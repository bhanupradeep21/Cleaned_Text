thyroid disease medical condition affects function thyroid gland thyroid gland located front neck produces thyroid travel blood help regulate many organs meaning endocrine organ hormones normally act body regulate energy use infant development childhood five general types thyroid disease symptoms person may one several different types time five groups us hypothyroidism hyperthyroidism respectively found old population types subacute thyroiditis postpartum thyroiditis symptoms may go away months laboratory tests may return however types thyroid disease resolve common hypothyroid symptoms include fatigue low energy weight gain inability tolerate cold slow heart rate dry skin common hyperthyroid symptoms include irritability anxiety weight loss fast heartbeat inability tolerate heat diarrhea enlargement structural abnormalities may produce symptoms however people may hyperthyroid hypothyroid symptoms related structural abnormality notice swelling rarely goiters cause compression airway compression vessels neck difficulty tumors often called thyroid nodules also many different symptoms ranging hyperthyroidism hypothyroidism swelling neck compression structures diagnosis starts history physical examination screening thyroid disease patients without symptoms debated topic although commonly practiced united dysfunction thyroid suspected laboratory tests help support rule thyroid disease initial blood tests often include thyroidstimulating hormone tsh free thyroxine total free triiodothyronine levels less commonly autoimmune disease thyroid suspected blood tests looking antithyroid autoantibodies also obtained procedures ultrasound biopsy radioiodine scanning uptake study may also used help diagnosis particularly nodule thyroid diseases highly prevalent treatment varies based disorder levothyroxine mainstay treatment people people hyperthyroidism caused graves disease managed iodine therapy antithyroid medication surgical removal thyroid thyroid surgery may also performed remove thyroid nodule reduce size goiter obstructs nearby structures cosmetic symptoms condition vary type hypo vs hyperthyroidism described possible symptoms hypothyroidism possible symptoms hyperthyroidism note certain symptoms physical changes seen hypothyroidism hyperthyroidism fine thinning hair menstrual cycle irregularities muscle weakness aches myalgia different forms hypothyroidism state body producing enough thyroid hormones able respond utilize existing thyroid hormones properly main categories hyperthyroidism state body producing much thyroid hormone main hyperthyroid conditions certain medications unintended side effect affecting thyroid function medications lead significant hypothyroidism hyperthyroidism risk need carefully monitored medications may affect thyroid hormone lab tests without causing symptoms clinical changes may require treatmentcitation needed following medications linked various forms thyroid disease thyroid disease united states stems condition bodys immune system attacks instances thyroid disease comes body trying adapt environmental conditions like iodine deficiency new physiologic conditions like pregnancy autoimmune thyroid disease general category disease occurs due immune system targeting body fully understood occurs thought partially genetic diseases tend run one common types graves disease body produces antibodies tsh receptor thyroid causes receptor activate even without tsh present causes thyroid produce release excess thyroid hormone another common form autoimmune thyroid disease hashimoto thyroiditis body produces antibodies different normal components thyroid gland commonly thyroglobulin thyroid peroxidase tsh antibodies cause immune system attack thyroid cells cause inflammation lymphocytic infiltration destruction fibrosis goiter general enlargement thyroid associated many thyroid diseases main reason happens increased signaling thyroid way tsh receptors try make produce thyroid causes increased vascularity increase size hypertrophy hypothyroid states iodine deficiency body recognizes producing enough thyroid hormone starts produce tsh help stimulate thyroid produce thyroid stimulation causes gland increase size increase production thyroid hormone hyperthyroidism caused graves disease toxic multinodular goiter excess stimulation tsh receptor even thyroid hormone levels graves disease autoantibodies thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins bind activate tsh receptors place tsh toxic multinodular goiter often mutation tsh receptor causes activate without receiving signal rare cases thyroid may become enlarged becomes filled thyroid hormone thyroid hormone precursors unable release congential abnormalities increased intake iodine supplementation many changes body pregnancy one major changes help development fetus production human chorionic gonadotropin hcg hormone produced placenta similar structure tsh bind maternal tsh receptor produce thyroid pregnancy also increase estrogen causes mother produce thyroxine binding globulin carries thyroid hormone normal hormonal changes often make pregnancy look like hyperthyroid state may within normal range pregnancy necessary use trimester specific ranges tsh free true hyperthyroidism pregnancy often caused autoimmune mechanism graves new diagnosis hypothyroidism pregnancy rare hypothyroidism often makes difficult become pregnant first hypothyroidism seen pregnancy often individual already hypothyroidism needs increase levothyroxine dose account increased thyroxine binding globulin present diagnosis thyroid disease depends symptoms whether thyroid nodule present patients receive blood test others might need ultrasound biopsy radioiodine scanning uptake study several hormones measured blood determine thyroid gland functioning include thyroid hormones triiodothyronine precursor thyroxine produced thyroid gland thyroidstimulating hormone tsh another important hormone secreted anterior pituitary cells brain primary function increase production thyroid gland useful marker thyroid gland function serum thyroidstimulating hormone tsh levels tsh levels determined classic negative feedback system high levels suppress production tsh low levels increase production tsh tsh levels thus often used doctors screening test first approach determine whether tsh elevated suppressed single abnormal tsh level misleading levels must measured blood confirm diagnosis circulating body bound transport proteins small fraction circulating thyroid hormones unbound free thus biologically active levels thus measured free total takes consideration free hormones addition proteinbound hormones free measurements important certain drugs illnesses affect concentrations transport proteins resulting differing total free thyroid hormone levels differing guidelines measurements autoantibodies thyroid gland may detected various disease states several antithyroid antibodies including antithyroglobulin antibodies tgab antimicrosomalantithyroid peroxidase antibodies tpoab tsh receptor antibodies many people may develop thyroid nodule point lives although many experience worry thyroid cancer many causes nodules benign cancerous possible nodule present doctor may order thyroid function tests determine thyroid glands activity affected information needed clinical exam lab tests medical ultrasonography help determine nature thyroid nodules notable differences typical benign vs cancerous thyroid nodules particularly detected highfrequency sound waves ultrasound scan ultrasound may also locate nodules small doctor feel physical exam demonstrate whether nodule primarily solid liquid cystic mixture imaging process often done doctors office painless expose individual main characteristics help distinguish benign vs malignant cancerous thyroid nodule ultrasound although ultrasonography important diagnostic tool method always able separate benign malignant nodules certainty suspicious cases tissue sample often obtained biopsy microscopic examination thyroid scintigraphy thyroid imaged aid radioactive iodine usually harm thyroid cells rarely performed nuclear medicine department hospital clinic radioiodine collects thyroid gland excreted urine thyroid radioactive emissions detected camera producing rough image shape radioiodine scan tissue activity radioiodine uptake thyroid gland normal radioiodine scan shows even uptake activity throughout gland irregular uptake reflect abnormally shaped abnormally located gland indicate portion gland overactive underactive example nodule overactive hot point suppressing activity rest usually thyrotoxic adenoma surgically curable form hyperthyroidism rarely malignant contrast finding substantial section thyroid inactive cold may indicate area nonfunctioning tissue thyroid cancer amount radioactivity quantified serves indicator metabolic activity gland normal quantitation radioiodine uptake demonstrates administered dose detected thyroid hours later overactivity underactivity gland may occur hyperthyroidism hypothyroidism usually reflected increased decreased radioiodine uptake different patterns may occur different causes hypo hyperthyroidism medical biopsy refers obtaining tissue sample examination microscope testing usually distinguish cancer noncancerous conditions thyroid tissue may obtained biopsy fine needle aspiration fna surgerycitation needed fine needle aspiration advantage brief safe outpatient procedure safer less expensive surgery leave visible scar needle biopsies became widely used recognized accuracy identification cancer good perfect accuracy diagnosis depends obtaining tissue suspicious areas abnormal thyroid gland reliability fine needle aspiration increased sampling guided ultrasound last years become preferred method thyroid biopsy north needed levothyroxine stereoisomer thyroxine degraded much slowly administered daily patients natural thyroid hormone pigs sometimes also used especially people tolerate synthetic version hyperthyroidism caused graves disease may treated thioamide drugs propylthiouracil carbimazole methimazole rarely lugols solution additionally hyperthyroidism thyroid tumors may treated radioactive iodine ethanol injections treatment recurrent thyroid cysts metastatic thyroid cancer lymph nodes also alternative surgerycitation needed thyroid surgery performed variety reasons nodule lobe thyroid sometimes removed biopsy presence autonomously functioning adenoma causing hyperthyroidism large majority thyroid may removed subtotal thyroidectomy treat hyperthyroidism graves disease remove goiter unsightly impinges vital structurescitation needed complete thyroidectomy entire thyroid including associated lymph nodes preferred treatment thyroid cancer removal bulk thyroid gland usually produces hypothyroidism unless person takes thyroid hormone replacement consequently individuals undergone total thyroidectomy typically placed thyroid hormone replacement eg levothyroxine remainder lives higher normal doses often administered prevent recurrencecitation needed thyroid gland must removed surgically care must taken avoid damage adjacent structures parathyroid glands recurrent laryngeal nerve susceptible accidental removal andor injury thyroid surgerycitation needed parathyroid glands produce parathyroid hormone pth hormone needed maintain adequate amounts calcium blood removal results hypoparathyroidism need supplemental calcium vitamin day event blood supply one parathyroid glands endangered surgery parathyroid glands involved may reimplanted surrounding muscle tissue recurrent laryngeal nerves provide motor control external muscles larynx except cricothyroid muscle also runs along posterior thyroid accidental laceration either two recurrent laryngeal nerves may cause paralysis vocal cords associated muscles changing voice quality systematic review concluded available evidence shows difference visually identifying nerve utilizing intraoperative neuroimaging surgery trying prevent injury recurrent laryngeal nerve thyroid radioiodine therapy used shrink thyroid gland instance case large goiters cause symptoms harbor evaluation biopsy suspicious nodules done destroy hyperactive thyroid cells example cases thyroid cancer iodine uptake high countries iodine deficiency low iodine sufficient countries enhance uptake thyroid allow successful treatment tsh raised prior therapy order stimulate existing thyroid cells done either withdrawal thyroid hormone medication injections recombinant human tsh released united states thyrogen injections reportedly boost uptake radioiodine treatment also cause hypothyroidism sometimes end goal treatment although rare pain syndrome due radiation united states autoimmune inflammation common form thyroid disease worldwide hypothyroidism goiter due dietary iodine deficiency according american thyroid association approximately million people united states alone affected thyroid hypothyroidism affects percent adults higher incidence women estimated onethird worlds population currently lives areas low dietary iodine levels regions severe iodine deficiency prevalence goiter high areas iodinedeficiency found common type hypothyroidism autoimmune subtype called hashimotos thyroiditis prevalence
