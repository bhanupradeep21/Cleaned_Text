statistics used misleading fashion trick casual observer believing something data shows misuse statistics occurs statistical argument asserts falsehood cases misuse may accidental others purposeful gain perpetrator statistical reason involved false misapplied constitutes statistical fallacy false statistics trap quite damaging quest knowledge example medical science correcting falsehood may take decades cost lives misuses easy fall professional scientists mathematicians even professional statisticians fooled even simple methods even careful check everything scientists known fool statistics due lack knowledge probability theory lack standardization tests one usable definition misuse statistics using numbers manner either intent ignorance carelessness conclusions unjustified numbers include misleading graphics discussed sources term commonly encountered statistics texts single authoritative definition generalization lying statistics richly described examples statisticians years ago definition confronts problems addressed lie statistics acknowledges statistics legitimately take many forms whether statistics show product light economical flimsy cheap debated whatever numbers object substitution statistical correctness moral leadership example objective assigning blame misuses often difficult scientists pollsters statisticians reporters often employees consultants insidious misuse statistics completed listener observer audience juror supplier provides statistics numbers graphics beforeafter photographs allowing consumer draw conclusions may unjustified incorrect poor state public statistical literacy nonstatistical nature human intuition make possible mislead without explicitly producing faulty conclusion definition weak responsibility consumer statistics historian listed fallacies dozen categories including generalization fallacies explicitly potentially statistical including sampling statistical nonsense statistical probability false extrapolation false interpolation insidious generalization technicalmathematical problems applied probability would fit single listed fallacy statistical probability many fallacies could coupled statistical analysis allowing possibility false conclusion flowing statistically sound analysis example use statistics analysis medical research process experimental planning conduct experiment data

results misleading leaves analyst vulnerable various statistical paradoxes cases false causality answers surveys often manipulated wording question way induce prevalence towards certain answer respondent example polling support war questions likely result data skewed different directions although polling support war better way wording question could support current us military action abroad still nearly neutral way put question view current us military action abroad point person asked way guessing wording questioner might want hear another way precede question information supports desired answer example people likely answer yes question given increasing burden taxes middleclass families support cuts income tax question considering rising federal budget deficit desperate need revenue support cuts income tax proper formulation questions subtle responses two questions vary dramatically depending order survey asked ownership stock found texas ranchers owned stock though probably kind traded new york stock overgeneralization fallacy occurring statistic particular population asserted hold among members group original population representative sample example suppose apples observed red summer assertion apples red would instance overgeneralization original statistic true specific subset apples summer expected representative population apples whole realworld example overgeneralization fallacy observed artifact modern polling techniques prohibit calling cell phones overthephone political polls young people likely demographic groups lack conventional landline phone telephone poll exclusively surveys responders calls landline phones may cause poll results undersample views young people measures taken account skewing sampling thus poll examining voting preferences young people using technique may perfectly accurate representation young peoples true voting preferences whole without overgeneralizing sample used excludes young people carry cell phones may may voting preferences differ rest population overgeneralization often occurs information passed nontechnical sources particular mass media scientists learned great cost gathering good experimental data statistical analysis difficult example placebo effect mind body powerful subjects developed rash exposed inert substance falsely called poison ivy developed rash harmless object really poison researchers combat effect doubleblind randomized comparative experiments statisticians typically worry validity data analysis reflected field study within statistics known design experiments pollsters learned great cost gathering good survey data statistical analysis difficult selective effect cellular telephones data collection discussed overgeneralization section one potential example young people traditional telephones representative sample biased sample surveys many pitfalls require great care one effort required almost telephone calls get answers simple random sample population isnt simple may research team wants know million people feel certain topic would impractical ask however team picks random sample people fairly certain results given group representative larger group would said asked confidence actually quantified central limit theorem mathematical results confidence expressed probability true result larger group within certain range estimate figure smaller group plus minus figure often quoted statistical surveys probability part confidence level usually mentioned assumed standard number like two numbers related survey estimated error confidence also estimated error confidence x displaystyle x confidence always x displaystyle confidence normally distributed population smaller estimated error larger required sample given confidence level example confidence people may assume confidence figure omitted certainty true result within estimated error mathematically correct many people may realize randomness sample important practice many opinion polls conducted phone distorts sample several ways including exclusion people phones favoring inclusion people one phone favoring inclusion people willing participate phone survey refuse etc nonrandom sampling makes estimated error unreliable hand people may consider statistics inherently unreliable everybody called never polled people may think impossible get data opinion dozens millions people polling thousands also inaccuratea poll perfect unbiased sampling truthful answers mathematically determined margin error depends number people polled however often one margin error reported survey results reported population subgroups larger margin error apply may made clear example survey people may contain people certain ethnic economic group results focusing group much less reliable results full population margin error full sample say margin error subgroup could around also many measurement problems population surveys problems mentioned apply statistical experiments population surveys statistical test shows correlation b usually six possibilities sixth possibility quantified statistical tests calculate probability correlation observed would large chance fact relationship variables however even possibility small probability still five others number people buying ice cream beach statistically related number people drown beach nobody would claim ice cream causes drowning obvious isnt case drowning ice cream buying clearly related third factor number people beach fallacy used example prove exposure chemical causes cancer replace number people buying ice cream number people exposed chemical x number people drown number people get cancer many people believe situation may statistical correlation even real effect example perception chemical site dangerous even really isnt property values area decrease entice lowincome families move area lowincome families likely get cancer highincome families due poorer diet example less access medical care rates cancer go even though chemical dangerous exactly happened early studies showing link emf electromagnetic fields power lines welldesigned studies effect false causality eliminated assigning people treatment group people control group random giving treatment group treatment giving control group treatment example researcher might expose one group people chemical x leave second group unexposed first group higher cancer rates researcher knows third factor affected whether person exposed controlled exposed assigned people exposed nonexposed groups random however many applications actually experiment way either prohibitively expensive infeasible unethical illegal downright impossible example highly unlikely irb would accept experiment involved intentionally exposing people dangerous substance order test toxicity obvious ethical implications types experiments limit researchers ability empirically test causation statistical test null hypothesis h displaystyle considered valid enough data proves wrong h displaystyle rejected alternative hypothesis h displaystyle ha considered proven correct chance happen although h displaystyle true probability denoted α displaystyle alpha significance level compared judicial process accused considered innocent h displaystyle proven guilty h displaystyle ha beyond reasonable doubt α displaystyle alpha data give us enough proof reject h displaystyle automatically prove h displaystyle correct example tobacco producer wishes demonstrate products safe easily conduct test small sample smokers versus small sample nonsmokers unlikely develop lung cancer even difference groups big order reject h displaystyle therefore smoking test reject h displaystyle h displaystyle accepted automatically follow smoking proven harmless test insufficient power reject h displaystyle test useless value proof h displaystyle also null judicial analogue compared truly guilty defendant released proof enough guilty verdict prove defendants innocence proof enough guilty verdict null hypothesis never proved established possibly disproved course experimentation every experiment may said exist order give facts chance disproving null hypothesis fisher design experiments many reasons confusion exist including use double negative logic terminology resulting merger fishers significance testing null hypothesis never accepted hypothesis testing hypothesis always accepted statistical significance measure probability practical significance measure baldness cure statistically significant sparse peachfuzz usually covers previously naked scalp cure practically significant hat longer required cold weather barber asks much take top bald want cure statistically practically significant probably work big hairy effect scientific publication often requires statistical significance led complaints last years statistical significance testing misuse data dredging abuse data mining data dredging large compilations data examined order find correlation without predefined choice hypothesis tested since required confidence interval establish relationship two parameters usually chosen meaning chance relationship observed due random chance thus chance finding correlation two sets completely random variables given data dredging efforts typically examine large datasets many variables hence even larger numbers pairs variables spurious apparently statistically significant results almost certain found study note data dredging valid way finding possible hypothesis hypothesis must tested data used original dredging misuse comes hypothesis stated fact without validation legitimately test hypothesis data first suggested hypothesis remedy clear hypothesis design study search specifically effect think result test statistically significant real evidence informally called fudging data practice includes selective reporting see also publication bias even simply making false data examples selective reporting abound easiest common examples involve choosing group results follow pattern consistent preferred hypothesis ignoring results data runs contradict hypothesis scientists general question validity study results reproduced investigators however scientists refuse publish data data manipulation serious issueconsideration honest statistical analyses outliers missing data nonnormality adversely affect validity statistical analysis appropriate study data repair real problems analysis begins scatter diagram points less detached main part cloud points rejected pseudoreplication technical error associated analysis variance complexity hides fact statistical analysis attempted single sample degenerate case variance calculated division zero always give researcher highest statistical correlation intent bias actual findings gamblers fallacy assumes event future likelihood measured likelihood happening already occurred thus someone already tossed coins come heads people tend assume likelihood tenth toss also heads first coin tossed fact chance tenth head assuming coin unbiased prosecutors assumes probability apparently criminal event random chance equal chance suspect innocent prominent
