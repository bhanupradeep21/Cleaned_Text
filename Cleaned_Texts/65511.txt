science cockatiel colour genetics deals heredity colour variation feathers cockatiels nymphicus hollandicus colour mutations natural rare phenomenon occur either captivity wild fifteen primary colour mutations established species enable production many different combinations note article heavily based captive companion cockatiel rather wild cockatiel species psittacus hollandicus kerr leptolophus hollandicus cockatiels started normal grey colour mutations began popping specific breeding first mutations occurred pieds cinnamons lutinos next mutations occur whitefaces silvers albinos recently orangecrested cock orange cheek patches extending face crest occurred newly discovered normal grey wildtype cockatiel one whose colour genes mutations normal grey cockatiels plumage primarily grey prominent white flashes outer edges wing face male yellow white face female primarily grey light grey genders feature round orange area ear areas often referred cheek patches orange colouration generally vibrant adult males often quite muted females young cockatiels visual sexing often possible variant normal grey cockatiel white yellow feathers back head split recessive mutation whitefaced cockatiels psittacofulvin yellow orange pigments deactivated blue gene resulting cockatiels absolutely psittacofulvin pigments whatsoever result genetic mutation genuine blue genetic mutation typical parrot parakeet species consequently whitefaced cockatiels mainly grey less white throughout plumage whitefaced cocks display brilliant white faces hens display basically grey faces white streaks availability whiteface mutation cockatiels wide colour varieties divided main classes series whitefaced cockatiels entirely white bodies red eyes albino isnt entirely correct terminology although sometimes referred albino animals blue genetic mutation cockatiels blue gene appropriate name mutation would whitefaced lutino lutino sexlinked recessive mutation perfect example type cockatiel hardest sex visually lutinos lack eumelanin pigment enabling black brown grey colours tones consequently yellow yellowishwhite orange cheekpatches adult female lutinos well immature lutinos sexes display yellow bars dots andor stripes underside tail feathers mature males however sexed visually always displaying solid white coloured undersides tail unfortunately good number cockatiels lutino mutations varieties palefaced lutino opaline lutino affected transmittable genetic flaw flaw enlarges bald spot crest due irresponsible excessive inbreeding general lack effort ethics responsibility breeders breed breeders working reducing bald patch greatly successful reducing pied cockatiel plumage patterns vary significantly one individual another giving rise cockatiel breeders hobbyists heavy pied light pied distinctions unfortunately degree piedness remains genetically unpredictable however breeding heavily pied specimens together generally produces higher percentage heavily pied offspring breeding lesser pied specimens together ultimately pied mutation causes bird lack majority typical grey plumage breast belly head thus pied cockatiels characterized degree yellow yellowwhite colouring areas last least exceptional clearpied individuals solid yellowishwhite solid white like lutino andor albino normal blackish eyes admpied recessive pied parentage throughout parrot species admpied gene negates males ability display species dimorphic features leads admpied cockatiels notoriously difficult sex visually excellent examples studies genetic traits however monomorphic species ie conures lovebirds macaws rosellas etc antidimorphic feature expressed piedness still therefore pied specimens species called either recessive pied andor harlequin budgerigar cinnamon pearl mutations sexlinked recessive cinnamons eumelanin pigment partially oxidized eumelanin granules stopped brown stage development end natural black colour state speckled complexion white spots secondary feathers deep brown primaries pearl cockatiels gene visual effect colour pigments bird instead affects distribution colours already present actually decreases spread grey family pigments melanin increases spread yellow pigments psittacofulvin individual feathers pearled bird yellow family pigments visible giving scalloped pattern males retain pearled colouring lose soon first molt though pattern may visible essentially gone covered grey tremendous number colour varieties combined mutations including admpied cinnamon whitefaced lutino opaline cinnamon creamino whitefaced cinnamon whitefaced opaline mutations appear individually wide variety combinations albino pearled lutino whitefaced pied opalinecinnamon still fairly hard find rather new yellowsuffusion cockatiels actually green pigment plumage thus yellowsuffusion specimens dont either yellow suffusion combined underlying black pure brown cinnamon specimens pigmentation produces illusion greenish tones giving rise genetically incorrect common names emerald trait many mutations retain normal features black eyes grey beak grey feetskin black toenails wildtype grey cockatiels however fallow lutino mutations pink red eyes pink feetskin whitetipped clear pink toenails pinkishwhite beaks also cinnamon specimens look quite essentially alike wildtype aka normal grey specimens exception purebrown hatching winered eyes turn brown days age displaying dark brown eyes adulthood sexlinked mutations cinnamon lutino opaline pallid andor sexlinked yellowcheeks higher ratio female male offspring due mode mentioned mutations dont allow sexing feather patterns mutations dont vary males females one method sexing cockatiels involves checking pelvic idea similar human pelvic bones differ females wider hips allow childbirth female cockatiels wider flexible pelvic bones account egg laying method isnt always accurate genes cause females narrower pelvis another way sex cockatiels behaviour males tend vocal also easier time mimicking males also sometimes strut behaviour categorized sticking chest parading around sometimes pacing typically accompanied females usually quiet theyre likely hiss
