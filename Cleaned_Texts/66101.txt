recombinant dna rdna molecules dna molecules formed laboratory methods genetic recombination molecular cloning bring together genetic material multiple sources creating sequences would otherwise found genome recombinant dna general name piece dna created combining two fragments different sources recombinant dna possible dna molecules organisms share chemical structure differing nucleotide sequence recombinant dna molecules sometimes called chimeric dna made material two different species like mythical chimera rdna technology uses palindromic sequences leads production sticky blunt ends dna sequences used construction recombinant dna molecules originate species example plant dna joined bacterial dna human dna joined fungal dna addition dna sequences occur anywhere nature created chemical synthesis dna incorporated recombinant dna molecules using recombinant dna technology synthetic dna dna sequence created introduced living organisms proteins result expression recombinant dna within living cells termed recombinant proteins recombinant dna encoding protein introduced host organism recombinant protein necessarily expression foreign proteins requires use specialized expression

existing dna sequences essentially organisms molecular cloning laboratory process used create recombinant one two widely used methods along polymerase chain reaction pcr used direct replication specific dna sequence chosen experimentalist two fundamental differences methods one molecular cloning involves replication dna within living cell pcr replicates dna test tube free living cells difference cloning involves cutting pasting dna sequences pcr amplifies copying existing sequence formation recombinant dna requires cloning vector dna molecule replicates within living cell vectors generally derived plasmids viruses represent relatively small segments dna contain necessary genetic signals replication well additional elements convenience inserting foreign dna identifying cells
