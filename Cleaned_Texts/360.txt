locale important hadrosauroid site eastern tremp primary subject research regarding bonebed taxonomic identity hadrosaurs namely whether one taxon multiple taxa present question complicated rarity cranial elements sample since taxonomically informative areas skeleton initially assumed single species present study alejandro blanco colleagues performed multiple types morphometric analysis investigate hadrosaur diversity pyrenees using dentaries number alveolar positions dentary primary metric distinctiveness basal taxa possess less though noted also increase age individual grows three morphotypes groupings specimens distinct anatomy groupings found sample two numbers two three present bp bonebed growth trajectory analysis different morphotypes supported separation sexual dimorphism reason different anatomy considered unlikely due different results regression analysis morphotype three interpreted belonging dwarf potentially relictual hadrosauroids morphotype two considered represent larger lambeosaurine animals stressed morphotype necessarily one species merely representative distinct lineage extensive study material conducted víctor fondevilla colleagues question many taxa present sample investigated using specimens multiple parts body opposed dentaries overall large amount variation noted specimens gradual rather case two obvious morphotypes authors attributed individual variation regarding dentaries found obviously sort multiple morphotypes due high amount variation one particular dentary noted rather distinct rest taphonomic damage improper restoration preparation fossil considered possible explanations opposed taxonomic distinctiveness authors favored identification hadrosaurs present bonebed singular taxon intertwined subject taxonomy noted studied size ontogeny growth development individuals represented individuals multiple sizes represented sample overall represent smaller animals hadrosaurs known asia north america despite small number individuals falling adult size ranges hadrosaurs indicated isolated elements multiple hypotheses put forward explain firstly juvenile individuals may dominant life stage living area bonebed preserved due ecological differences lifespan secondly possible represent dwarfed animals dominating environment relative rare larger species lastly possible large individuals comparative giants
