hall technique minimallyinvasive treatment decayed baby back molar teeth decay sealed preformed stainless steel crowns avoiding injections drilling one number biologically orientated strategies managing dental decay technique evidencebase showing acceptable children parents dentists preferred standard filling techniques due ease application overall patient comfort young patients dont undergo traumatic injections preformed metal crowns recommended optimum restoration managing carious primary molars five randomised control trials shown hall technique superior methods managing decay baby teeth lack evidence conclude hall technique superior placing preformed metal crowns conventional initial fears potential problem sealing caries teeth caries process might slowed rather arrested caries might still progress leading pain infection problem realised one study showing longterm data beyond five years baby teeth lost fewer problems tooth crown crowns placed using hall technique better long term outcomes paininfection need replacement compared standard technique used found particularly valuable developing country little access dental services resources support also utilized modern dental practices many parents patients prefer treatment options minimally invasive help eliminate need sedation preformed metal crowns used restoring primary molars since literature suggests preformed crowns placed carious primary molar teeth reduce risk major failure pain long term compared fillings also evidence suggest fitting crowns using hall technique reduces patient discomfort time treatment comparison conventional fillings also help reduce overall time patient spends dental chair due relatively simple quick procedure compared traditional method ssc hall technique named dr norna hall dentist working scotland developed simplified technique crown simply cemented carious primary molar local anaesthesia caries removal tooth preparation traditional method management dental caries evolved exclusive domain techniques based complete caries removal prior tooth restoration norna hall used preformed crowns cemented carious primary molars using glassionomer luting cement caries removal tooth preparation local anaesthesia hall technique included guideline scottish dental clinical effectiveness programme helped drive change dentists manage decay primary teeth traditional invasive surgical approach lessinvasive biological management clinical trials shown technique effective however easy quickfix solution problem carious primary molars technique suited every tooth child clinician however effective method managing carious primary molars hall technique used clinical radiographic signs symptoms irreversible pulpitis dental abscess radiographically clear band dentine carious lesion pulp hall technique suitable baby teeth known primary teeth deciduous teeth biologically orientated strategies managing dental decay considered proponents advantages child patients receiving dental care techniques less invasive often avoid use local anaesthesia drilling also less destructive potentially damaging primary teeth five randomised control trials children decayed primary teeth carried looking incomplete removal decay looked much pain infection repeated treatment biological techniques including hall technique compare treatment techniques including complete
