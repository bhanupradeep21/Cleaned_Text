ejaculation discharge semen ejaculate normally containing sperm male reproductive tract result orgasm final stage natural objective male sexual stimulation essential component natural conception ejaculation occur spontaneously sleep normal part human sexual development nocturnal emission wet dream rare cases ejaculation occurs prostatic disease anejaculation condition unable ejaculate ejaculation usually pleasurable men dysejaculation ejaculation painful uncomfortable retrograde ejaculation condition semen travels backwards bladder rather urethra usual precursor ejaculation sexual arousal male leading erection penis though every arousal erection leads ejaculation ejaculation require erection penile sexual stimulation masturbation vaginal anal oral manual nonpenetrative sexual activity may provide necessary stimulus man achieve orgasm ejaculation regard intravaginal ejaculation latency time men typically reach orgasm minutes start penilevaginal intercourse taking account

masturbation leads adequate amount arousal production preejaculatory fluid presence sperm preejaculatory fluid thought rare sperm earlier ejaculation still present urethra may picked preejaculatory

desire called delayed ejaculation anorgasmia orgasm accompanied ejaculation known dry orgasm man achieved sufficient stimulation orgasm ejaculation begins point control sympathetic nervous system semen containing sperm emitted semen ejected urethra rhythmic rhythmic contractions part male orgasm generated bulbospongiosus pubococcygeus control spinal reflex level spinal nerves via pudendal nerve typical male orgasm lasts several seconds start orgasm pulses semen begin flow urethra reach peak discharge diminish flow typical orgasm consists contractions although man may consciously aware many first contraction taken place ejaculation continue completion involuntary process stage ejaculation stopped rate contractions gradually slows orgasm initial contractions occur average interval seconds increasing increment seconds per contraction contractions men proceed regular rhythmic intervals duration orgasm many men also experience additional irregular contractions conclusion ejaculation usually begins first second contraction orgasm men first ejection semen occurs second contraction second typically largest expelling total semen discharge peak magnitude semen penis emits diminishes contractions begin lessen intensity muscle contractions orgasm continue ejaculation additional semen discharge occurring small sample study seven men showed average spurts semen followed average contractions semen expelled study also found high correlation number spurts semen total ejaculate volume ie larger semen volumes resulted additional pulses semen rather larger individual

cms ins close kmh men experience refractory period immediately following orgasm time unable achieve another erection longer period capable achieving another ejaculation time male feels deep often pleasurable sense relaxation usually felt groin thighs duration refractory period varies considerably even given individual age affects recovery time younger men typically recovering faster older men though universally whereas men may refractory periods minutes men able experience sexual arousal immediately ejaculation short recovery period may allow partners continue sexual play relatively uninterrupted ejaculation men may experience penis becoming hypersensitive stimulation ejaculation make sexual stimulation unpleasant even may sexually aroused men able achieve multiple orgasms without typical sequence ejaculation refractory period men report noticing refractory periods able maintain erection sustaining sexual activity full erection passed refractory time orgasm proceeded

possible underlying causes low volume complete lack semen ejaculatory duct obstruction normal amount semen diminish age number sperm ejaculation also varies widely depending many factors including time since last age stress testosterone greater lengths sexual stimulation immediately preceding ejaculation result higher concentrations unusually low sperm count low semen volume known oligospermia
