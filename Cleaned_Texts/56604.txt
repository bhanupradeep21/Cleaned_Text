organ corti spiral organ receptor organ hearing located mammalian cochlea highly varied strip epithelial cells allows transduction auditory signals nerve impulses action transduction occurs vibrations structures inner ear causing displacement cochlear fluid movement hair cells organ corti produce electrochemical italian anatomist alfonso giacomo gaspare corti discovered organ corti structure evolved basilar papilla crucial mechanotransduction mammals organ corti located scala media cochlea inner ear vestibular duct tympanic duct composed mechanosensory cells known hair strategically positioned basilar membrane organ corti three rows outer hair cells ohcs one row inner hair cells surrounding hair cells supporting cells deiters cells also called phalangeal cells close relation ohcs pillar cells separate support ohcs projecting tops hair cells tiny fingerlike projections called stereocilia arranged graduated fashion shortest stereocilia outer rows longest center gradation thought important anatomic feature organ corti allows sensory cells superior tuning cochlea uncoiled would roll mm long women mm men mm standard deviation cochlea also tonotopically organized meaning different frequencies sound waves interact different locations structure base cochlea closest outer ear stiff narrow highfrequency sounds transduced apex top cochlea wider much flexible loose

waves end amplitudes times greater entered ear normal hearing majority auditory signals reach organ corti first place come outer ear sound waves enter auditory canal vibrate tympanic membrane also known eardrum vibrates three small bones called ossicles result attached oval window moves causes movement round window leads displacement cochlear however stimulation happen also via direct vibration
