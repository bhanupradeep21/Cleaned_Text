pituitary adenomas tumors occur pituitary gland pituitary tumors benign approximately invasive pituitary adenomas represent intracranial neoplasms estimated prevalence rate general population approximately noninvasive nonsecreting pituitary adenomas considered benign literal well clinical sense however recent metaanalysis fernándezbalsells et al available research shown date scant studies poor quality either support refute assumption adenomas exceeding mm size defined macroadenomas smaller mm referred microadenomas pituitary adenomas microadenomas estimated prevalence autopsy studies radiologic majority pituitary microadenomas often remain undiagnosed diagnosed often found incidental finding referred incidentalomas pituitary macroadenomas common cause pituitary adenomas common affecting approximately one general population clinically active pituitary adenomas require surgical treatment rare affecting approximately one general hormone secreting pituitary adenomas cause one several forms hyperpituitarism specifics depend type hormone tumors secrete one hormone common gh prolactin present unexpected bone growth unexpected lactation men womencitation needed patient pituitary adenoma may present visual field defects classically bitemporal hemianopsia arises compression optic nerve tumor specific area visual pathway compression tumours occurs optic chiasma anatomy structure causes pressure produce defect temporal visual field sides condition called bitemporal hemianopsia originating superior optic chiasm commonly craniopharyngioma pituitary stalk visual field defect first appear bitemporal inferior quadrantanopia originating inferior optic chiasm visual field defect first appear bitemporal superior quadrantanopia lateral expansion pituitary adenoma also compress abducens nerve causing lateral rectus also pituitary adenoma cause symptoms increased intracranial pressure prolactinomas often start give symptoms especially pregnancy increased hormone level estrogen increase tumors growth various types headaches common patients pituitary adenomas adenoma may prime causative factor behind headache may serve exacerbate headache caused factors amongst types headaches experienced chronic episodic migraine uncommonly various unilateral headaches primary stabbing shortlasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks conjunctival injection tearing another type stabbing headache characterized short stabs pain cluster hemicrania continua compressive symptoms pituitary adenomas visual field deficits decreased visual acuity headaches commonly seen macroadenomas greater mm diameter microadenomas less mm nonsecreting adenomas go undetected extended time obvious abnormalities seen gradual reduction normal activities due decreased production hormones rather less evident example insufficient adrenocorticotropic hormone means adrenal glands produce sufficient cortisol resulting slow recovery illness inflammation chronic fatigue insufficient growth hormone children adolescents leads diminished stature many explanationscitation needed various psychiatric manifestations associated pituitary disorders including pituitary adenomas psychiatric symptoms depression apathy emotional instability easy irritability hostility pituitary gland close proximity brain invasive adenomas may invade dura mater cranial bone sphenoid adenomas anterior pituitary gland major clinical feature multiple endocrine neoplasia type rare inherited endocrine syndrome affects person every men causes various combinations benign malignant tumors various glands

functions via secretion various hormones circulatory system pituitary gland located brain depression fossa sphenoid bone known sella turcica although anatomically functionally connected brain pituitary sits outside barrier separated subarachnoid space diaphragma sella therefore arachnoid mater thus cerebral spinal fluid enter sella turcicacitation needed pituitary gland divided two lobes anterior lobe accounts two thirds volume gland posterior lobe one third volume separated pars posterior lobe neural lobe neurohypophysis pituitary gland despite name true gland posterior lobe contains axons neurons extend hypothalamus connected via pituitary stalk hormones vasopressin oxytocin produced neurons supraoptic paraventricular nuclei hypothalamus stored posterior lobe released axon endings dendrites within pituitary glands anterior lobe adenohypophysis true gland produces secretes six different hormones thyroidstimulating hormone tsh adrenocorticotropic hormone acth folliclestimulating hormone fsh luteinizing hormone lh growth hormone gh prolactin diagnosis pituitary adenoma made least suspected constellation related symptoms presented differential diagnosis includes pituitary tuberculoma especially developing countries immumocompromised diagnosis confirmed testing hormone levels radiographic imaging pituitary example ct scan mricitation needed unlike
