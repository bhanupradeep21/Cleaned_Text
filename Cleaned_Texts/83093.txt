fixed action pattern ethological term describing instinctive behavioral sequence highly stereotyped fixed action patterns said produced innate releasing mechanism hardwired neural network response signkey stimulus released fixed action pattern runs term often associated konrad lorenz founder lorenz identified six characteristics fixed action characteristics state fixed action patterns stereotyped complex speciescharacteristic released triggered independent fixed action patterns observed many species notably fish classic studies konrad lorenz niko tinbergen involve male stickleback mating behavior greylag goose eggretrieval fixed action patterns shown evolutionarily advantageous increase fitness however result predictability may also used means exploitation example exploitation would brood four exceptions fixed action pattern reduced response threshold vacuum activity displacement behavior graded characteristics fixed action fixed action patterns said stereotyped complex speciescharacteristic released triggered independent sign stimulus also known releaser determining feature stimulus produces response sign stimuli often found observing fixed action pattern fap innate behaviour little variance manner actions executed several examples sign stimuli seen observation animal behaviour natural environment experimenters gone natural environments better assess stimuli determine key features elicit fixed action pattern scientists also observed direct exploitation sign stimuli nature among different species birds fixed action patterns released due certain external stimuli single small group attributes object object attributes may include color shape odor exaggerated models attributes called supernormal supernormal stimulus leads exaggerated supernormal stimuli effective releasing response natural external stimulus elicits fixed action pattern termed sign stimulus stimuli emanates whereas releaser emanates ones conducting experiments scientists came across idea supernormal stimuli nikolaas tinbergen found incubating geese given choice performing eggrolling fap egg versus fullsized volleyball chose volleyball supernormal stimuli although naturally occurring gave insight process natural selection may stimulus features size egg result increased ability trigger one example fixed action patterns courtship aggression behaviours male stickleback particularly threespined stickleback mating season described series studies niko spring mating season male sticklebacks ventrum turns red establish territory build attack male sticklebacks enter territory court females entice enter nest lay tinbergen used models sticklebacks investigate features male female sticklebacks elicited attack courtship behavior male tinbergens main findings male sticklebacks responded relatively invariant way attacked even crude models red belly contrast courted model swollen also found presented real male stickleback crude model models stomach red stickleback would attack model opposed real male another example behavior described fixed action pattern eggretrieval behavior greylag goose reported classic studies niko tinbergen konrad like many groundnesting birds egg becomes displaced nest greylag rolls back nest sight displaced egg sign stimulus elicits eggretrieval first goose fixates sight next extends neck finally rolls egg back nest using underside egg removed goose performance eggrolling bird continue behavior pulling head back imaginary egg still shown greylag also attempt retrieve eggshaped objects golf ball door knob even model egg large possibly laid goose ie supernormal sight egg outside nest serves stimulus particular instance recognition eggs displacement fixed action pattern manipulation sign stimulus series experiments allow scientists understand specific component stimulus responsible innate behavioral sequence egg picked taken away displaced nest goose still exhibits head moving motion even though egg put test using objects beer cans baseballs experimenters found stimulus merely object large enough size convex enough shape comfortable enough goose lay neck around edges features stimulus obtain

mechanism irm gooses irm put test natural world manipulated scientific experimentation almost always efficient getting desired item egg back examples sign stimuli include behaviors fixed action patterns occur complex animals usually essential animals fitness speed ie absence learning instance greylag gooses eggretrieval behavior essential survival chicks fitness parent bird increased behavior relatively stickleback attack male fish enters territory female sexually receptive reacting red color female stickleback triggers behavior male resulting fertilization fixed action patterns predictable invariable therefore lead species evolved exploit fixed action patterns species mimicry sign replicating releaser required trigger fixed action pattern known wellknown example brood parasitism one species lay eggs nest another species parent young north american cowbird example provides supernormal stimulus foster parent cause forage rapidly satisfy larger birds nestling provide higher levels stimulus noisier energetic behavior communicating urgent need parents situation work harder provide food otherwise offspring likely die exploitation sign stimuli seen exploring concept brood parasitism animals learn sign stimuli different species use manipulate animal something benefit example seen european cuckoo particular species bird benefits handing task raising young species birds care egg found nest case sign stimulus presence eggs nest bird recognize birds egg foreign continue caring incubating hatching hatched young cuckoo ensures solid upbringing instinctively pushing neck around anything solid nest pushing edge thus classifying sign stimulus solid object allows cuckoos unwitting foster parents plenty time devote caring without exceptions fixed action pattern include reduced response threshold vacuum activity displacement behavior graded fixed action patterns become easier release time increases last long without released fixed action patterns released absence sign stimulus vacuum activity demonstrated courtship behavior ring male blond ring doves isolated species resort courting pigeon humans hand finally expressing courtship activity alone box left alone long period fixed action patterns may performed irrelevant stimulus seen displacement behavior occurs fighting mating urges male stickleback chasing another male stickleback stops two territories meet dives bottom tank picking something behavior resembles nest digging mating season released proper sign fixed action patterns may vary intensity instead
