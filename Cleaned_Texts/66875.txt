mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist mra aldosterone antagonist diuretic drug antagonizes action aldosterone mineralocorticoid receptors group drugs often used adjunctive therapy combination drugs management chronic heart failure spironolactone first member class also used management hyperaldosteronism including conns syndrome female hirsutism due additional antiandrogen actions antimineralocorticoids including spironolactone steroidal spirolactones finerenone nonsteroidal antimineralocorticoid mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists diuretic drugs work primarily kidneys decrease sodium reabsorption leads increased water excretion regulating water excretion mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists lower blood pressure reduce fluid around heart beneficial cardiovascular mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists used many clinical conditions cardiovascular system proven beneficial diseases like primary aldosteronism primary resistant hypertension heart failure chronic kidney often used medications ace inhibitors beta increased urination commonly reported side effect particularly initial phase following treatment initiation mostly transient tends reduce sustained treatment common side effects antimineralocorticoid medications include nausea vomiting stomach cramps clinically significant hyperkalemia possible warrants serum potassium monitoring periodic basis pathophysiology hyperkalemia antimineralocorticoid medications reduce potassium k excretion aldosterone mineralocorticoid synthesized adrenal aldosterone secreted adrenal glands binds mineralocorticoid receptor renal tubule cell forms complex enhances transcription specific dna segments nucleus leading formation two protein transporters nak atpase pump basolateral membrane na channel called enac located apical membrane renal tubule protein transporters increase sodium reabsorption potassium excretion distal tubule collecting duct kidneys helps body maintain normal volume electrolyte balance increasing blood pressure mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists decrease aldosterone effect binding mineralocorticoid receptor inhibiting aldosterone leads higher levels potassium serum increased sodium excretion resulting decreased body fluid lower blood comparing pharmacokinetic properties spironolactone eplerenone clear two drugs differ spironolactone shorter halflife hours eplerenone hours eplerenone goes rapid metabolism liver inactive metabolites hours however spironolactone metabolized three active metabolites give prolonged activity hours spironolactone long halflife excreted kidneys patients chronic kidney disease therefore require close monitoring taking drug spironolactone also eliminated feces excretion eplerenone kidneys feces information excretion plays critical role determining appropriate doses patients renal andor hepatic dysfunction important adjust doses patients renal dysfunction fail eliminate drug kidneys could accumulate body causing high concentration potassium spironolactone eplerenone competitively block binding aldosterone mineralocorticoid receptor hindering reabsorption sodium chloride ions activity mineralocorticoid antagonists dependent presence ylactone ring position position also important activity substituents sterically hinder interaction agonists eplerenone newer drug developed spironolactone analog reduced adverse effects addition ylactone ring substituent eplerenone group group believed reason eplerenone lower affinity mineralocorticoid receptor despite nonsteroidal nature finerenone yields different lipophilicity polarity profile compound finerenones affinity toward mineralocorticoid receptors equal spironolactone times eplerenone hinting steroidal core component antimineralocorticoids essential mineralocorticoid receptor main goal identification first aldosterone antagonists happened identify inhibitors aldosterone activity times main use aldosterone recognized control renal sodium excretion hans selye hungariancanadian endocrinologist studied effects aldosterone antagonists rats found use one first aldosterone antagonists spironolactone protected aldosteroneinduced cardiac necrosis year spironolactone launched potassiumsparing diuretic became clear years later aldosterone antagonists inhibit specific receptor protein protein high affinity aldosterone also cortisol humans corticosterone mice rats reason aldosterone antagonists called mineralocorticoid receptor three major waves pharmaceutical industry comes research development mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists first wave took place within searle laboratories company identified shortly purification aldosterone steroidbased spironolactone first antimineralocorticoid second wave discovering much specific steroidal antimineralocorticoids main active companies searle cibageigy roussel uclaf schering around years selyes work several pharmaceutical companies began drug discovery programs goal discover novel nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists use efficacious safe drugs pharmacodynamics pharmacokinetics well defined goal use candidates broad spectrum diseases essentially third wave first mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists discovered identified vivo experiments whereas identification novel nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists done highthroughput screening millions chemical compounds various pharmaceutical members class clinical use include drugs also antimineralocorticoid effects secondary main mechanism actions examples include progesterone
