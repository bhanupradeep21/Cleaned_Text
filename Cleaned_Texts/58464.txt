subsequent research found diethylstilbestrol ineffective hde combined progestogen women intact uterus unopposed estrogen particularly high dosages increases risk endometrial hyperplasia endometrial majority women intact uterus develop endometrial hyperplasia within years estrogen treatment even mere replacement dosages estrogen progestogen taken addition progestogen estrogen abolishes increase following steroidal estrogens used hde well following nonsteroidal estrogens little progestogens used pseudopregnancy regimens include hydroxyprogesterone caproate medroxyprogesterone acetate cyproterone acetate among progesterone littleused purposes likely due poor pharmacokinetics eg low oral bioavailability short elimination general adverse effects hde may include breast enlargement breast pain tenderness nipple enlargement hyperpigmentation nausea vomiting headache fluid retention edema melasma hyperprolactinemia galactorrhea amenorrhea reversible infertility uncommon serious

target endogenous estrogens estradiol used high doses estrogens powerful antigonadotropins strongly inhibiting secretion gonadotropins luteinizing hormone folliclestimulating hormone pituitary gland men able completely suppress gonadal androgen production reduce testosterone levels castrate basis use prostate cancer benign prostatic estradiol estradiol ester used hde men levels estradiol least approximately pgml necessary suppress testosterone levels castrate synthetic nonsteroidal estrogens like ethinylestradiol diethylstilbestrol resistant hepatic metabolism reason dramatically increased local potency result disproportionate effects hepatic protein production greatly increased risk blood clots relative endogenous bioidentical forms estrogen like estradiol estradiol unlike synthetic

found effective treatment prostate cancer treatment breast cancer hde first medical therapy prostate cancer breast pseudopregnancy developed following introduction progestins improved potency pharmacokinetics time used treat hypoplasia uterus breasts modern times pseudopregnancy rarely however studies conducted found rapidly effective increasing bone mineral density women osteopenia due hde also commonly used transgender women since oral hde prostate cancer diethylstilbestrol used widely men prostate cancer compared directly orchiectomy associated improved cancerrelated mortality worse overall survival mainly due previously unrecognized cardiovascular side result study hde prostate cancer fell however recent times resurgence interest hde prostate cancer safer bioidentical parenteral forms estrogen dont share risks like polyestradiol phosphate transdermal modern hde prostate cancer variety advantages benefits conventional androgen deprivation therapy castration including fewer side effects like osteoporosis hot flashes impairment cognitive emotional sexual domains potentially superior quality life considerable cost main drawback modern hde prostate cancer high incidence gynecomastia although generally mildly modestly addition prophylactic irradiation breasts used prevent minimal side effects mostly consisting temporary skin following continued clinical research discovery effectiveness hde breast cancer hde commonly diethylstilbestrol lesser extent ethinylestradiol became standard care treatment breast cancer postmenopausal women early antiestrogen tamoxifen found effective treatment breast cancer introduced medical comparative studies found two therapies showed equivalent effectiveness tamoxifen reduced result antiestrogen therapy became firstline treatment breast cancer almost completely replaced however hde revisited breast cancer found effective treatment women acquired resistance antiestrogen since research hde breast cancer continued safer bioidentical forms estrogen like estradiol estradiol valerate also studied found major review published summarizing literature pseudopregnancy suggested use decreasing risk breast
