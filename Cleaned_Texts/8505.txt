magnesium hydroxide inorganic compound chemical formula occurs nature mineral brucite white solid low solubility water ksp magnesium hydroxide common component antacids milk magnesia treating solution different soluble magnesium salts alkaline water induces precipitation solid hydroxide second abundant cation present seawater na economically extracted directly seawater alkalinisation described industrial scale produced treating seawater lime volume us gal seawater gives one tonne ksp far soluble ksp drastically increases ph value seawater less soluble precipitates common ion effect due added dissolution produced industrially well small amount mined converted fused magnesia mgo magnesia valuable poor electrical conductor excellent thermal small amount magnesium magnesium hydroxide usually absorbed intestine unless one deficient magnesium however magnesium mainly excreted kidneys longterm daily consumption milk magnesia someone suffering kidney failure could lead theory hypermagnesemia unabsorbed magnesium excreted feces absorbed magnesium rapidly excreted antacid magnesium hydroxide dosed approximately g adults works simple neutralization hydroxide ions combine acidic h ions hydronium ions produced form hydrochloric acid parietal cells stomach produce water laxative magnesium hydroxide dosed g works number ways first poorly absorbed intestinal tract draws water surrounding tissue osmosis increase water content soften feces also increases volume feces intestine intraluminal volume naturally stimulates intestinal motility furthermore ions cause release cholecystokinin cck results intraluminal accumulation water electrolytes increased intestinal motility sources claim hydroxide ions play significant role laxative effects milk magnesia alkaline

compatible seawater sea life ph place ph natural magnesium hydroxide brucite used commercially fire retardant industrially used magnesium hydroxide produced like aluminum hydroxide solid magnesium hydroxide smoke suppressing flame retardant properties property attributable endothermic decomposition undergoes heat absorbed reaction retards fire delaying ignition associated substance water released dilutes combustible gases common uses magnesium hydroxide flame retardant include additives cable insulation insulation plastics roofing various flame retardant brucite mineral form commonly found nature also occurs clay minerals amongst others chlorite occupies interlayer position normally filled monovalent divalent cations na k consequence chlorite interlayers cemented brucite swell shrink brucite cations substituted cations becomes positively charged constitutes main basis layered double hydroxide ldh ldh minerals hydrotalcite powerful anion sorbents relatively rare nature brucite may also crystallize cement concrete contact seawater indeed cation second abundant cation seawater behind na brucite swelling mineral causes local volumetric expansion responsible tensile
