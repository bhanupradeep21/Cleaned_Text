preexcitation syndrome heart condition part cardiac ventricles activated preexcitation caused abnormal electrical connection accessory pathway within cardiac chambers preexcitation may cause symptoms may lead palpitations caused abnormal heart rhythms usually diagnosed using electrocardiogram may found electrophysiological condition may require treatment symptoms controlled using medication catheter ablation several types preexcitation syndrome normally atria ventricles electrically isolated electrical contact exists atrioventricular node preexcitation syndromes least one conductive pathway present physiologically normal electrical depolarization wave delayed atrioventricular node allow atria contract ventricles however delay abnormal pathway electrical stimulus passes ventricle tract faster via normal atrioventricularbundle system ventricles depolarized excited pre normal conduction system httpsenwikipediaorgwikipreexcitationsyndrome
