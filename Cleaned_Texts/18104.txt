blood circulatory system system organs includes heart blood vessels blood circulated throughout entire body human includes cardiovascular system vascular system consists heart blood vessels greek kardia meaning heart latin vascula meaning vessels circulatory system two divisions systemic circulation circuit pulmonary circulation sources use terms cardiovascular system vascular system interchangeably circulatory network blood vessels great vessels heart including large elastic arteries large veins arteries smaller arterioles capillaries join venules small veins veins circulatory system closed vertebrates means blood never leaves network blood vessels invertebrates arthropods open circulatory system diploblasts sponges comb jellies lack circulatory system blood fluid

carbon dioxide left atrium receives newly oxygenated blood lungs well pulmonary vein passed strong left ventricle pumped aorta different organs body pulmonary circulation part circulatory system oxygendepleted blood pumped away heart via pulmonary artery lungs returned oxygenated heart via pulmonary vein oxygendeprived blood superior inferior vena cava enters right atrium heart flows tricuspid valve right atrioventricular valve right ventricle pumped pulmonary semilunar valve pulmonary artery lungs gas exchange occurs lungs whereby released blood oxygen absorbed pulmonary vein returns oxygenrich blood left separate circuit systemic circulation bronchial circulation supplies blood tissue larger airways lung systemic circulation circuit loop delivers oxygenated blood left heart rest body aorta deoxygenated blood returned systemic circulation right heart via two large veins inferior vena cava superior vena cava pumped right atrium pulmonary circulation oxygenation systemic circulation also defined two parts macrocirculation blood vessels circulatory system arteries veins capillaries large arteries veins take blood away heart known great oxygenated blood enters systemic circulation leaving left ventricle via aortic semilunar first part systemic circulation aorta massive thickwalled artery aorta arches gives branches supplying upper part body passing aortic opening diaphragm level thoracic ten vertebra enters later descends supplies branches abdomen pelvis perineum lower walls aorta elastic elasticity helps maintain blood pressure throughout aorta receives almost five litres blood heart recoils responsible pulsating blood pressure aorta branches smaller arteries elasticity goes decreasing compliance goes arteries branch small passages called arterioles capillaries merge bring blood venous capillaries merge venules merge venous system feeds two major veins superior vena cava mainly drains tissues heart inferior vena cava mainly drains tissues heart two large veins empty right atrium general rule arteries heart branch capillaries collect veins leading back heart portal veins slight exception humans significant example hepatic portal vein combines capillaries around gastrointestinal tract blood absorbs various products digestion rather leading directly back heart hepatic portal vein branches second capillary system liver heart supplied oxygen nutrients small loop systemic circulation derives little blood contained within four chambers coronary circulation system provides blood supply heart muscle coronary circulation begins near origin aorta two coronary arteries right coronary artery left coronary artery nourishing heart muscle blood returns coronary veins coronary sinus one right atrium backflow blood opening atrial systole prevented thebesian valve smallest cardiac veins drain directly heart brain dual blood supply anterior posterior circulation arteries front back anterior circulation arises internal carotid

functions place digestion form circulation branching allows bodily fluids reach outer layers since digestion begins inner layers earliest known writings circulatory system found ebers papyrus century bce ancient egyptian medical papyrus containing prescriptions remedies physical spiritual papyrus acknowledges connection heart arteries egyptians thought air came mouth lungs heart heart air travelled every member arteries although concept circulatory system partially correct represents one earliest accounts scientific thought century bce knowledge circulation vital fluids body known ayurvedic physician sushruta ancient also seems possessed knowledge arteries described channels dwivedi dwivedi valves heart discovered physician hippocratean school around century bce however function properly understood blood pools veins death arteries look empty ancient anatomists assumed filled air transport air greek physician herophilus distinguished veins arteries thought pulse property arteries greek anatomist erasistratus observed arteries cut life bleed ascribed fact phenomenon air escaping artery replaced blood enters veins arteries small vessels thus apparently postulated capillaries reversed flow bloodcitation needed ad rome greek physician galen knew blood vessels carried blood identified venous dark red arterial brighter thinner blood distinct separate functions growth energy derived venous blood created liver chyle arterial blood gave vitality containing pneuma air originated heart blood flowed creating organs parts body consumed return blood heart liver heart pump blood around hearts motion sucked blood diastole blood moved pulsation arteries galen believed arterial blood created venous blood passing left ventricle right passing pores interventricular septum air passed lungs via pulmonary artery left side heart arterial blood created sooty vapors created passed lungs also via pulmonary artery exhaled canon medicine persian physician avicenna erroneously accepted greek notion regarding existence hole ventricular septum blood traveled ventricles despite avicenna correctly wrote cardiac cycles valvular function vision blood circulation treatise needed also refining galens erroneous theory pulse avicenna provided first correct explanation pulsation every beat pulse comprises two movements two pauses thus expansion pause contraction pause pulse movement heart arteries takes form alternate expansion arabian physician ibn alnafis described process pulmonary circulation greater accurate detail predecessors though
