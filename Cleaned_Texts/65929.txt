adelolophus meaning unknown crest genus lambeosaurine dinosaur crested duckbill upper cretaceous rocks us state utah type known species hutchisoni type specimen consists broken maxilla constitutes oldest known lambeosaur remains north america well known lambeosaur species wahweap formation pertains upper member among relatives seems particularly similar parasaurolophus rather animals like lambeosaurus phylogenetic analysis confirms finding parasaurolophini tubeheaded lambeosaurs would lived wet environment bordering sea arid season times year environment would shared diverse variety fish turtles well dinosaurs like ceratopsids tyrannosaurids fossil bearing locality near death ridge kane county utah first reported howard zeller locality part wahweap formation found within grand national monument area information reported zeller would used john howard hutchison colleagues return collect fossils among maxilla jawbone lambeosaurine maxilla first reported paper terry gates colleagues noted known lambeosaur material formation reported upper member oldest known lambeosaur material north america suggested unique morphology indicated new taxon refrained naming later specimen described named study led terry gates published part book hadrosaurs new species given name adelolophus hutchisoni holotype ucmp incomplete right maxilla ends broken generic name derived greek α δηλόω show λόφη crest referring known anatomy species showing presumed crest specific name honor hutchison discovered specimen study noted exact locality specimen unknown making referral upper

older middle member younger upper member formation fossils animals locality reported paper among fragmentary hadrosaur postcranial specimens pertaining various ages including one large individual possibility noted could belong adelolophus referral impossible several unique morphological traits diagnose adelolophus distinct genus despite fragmentary nature anatomy known bone maxilla part upper jaw bearing teeth identifiable lambeosaur type dinosaur possessed large hollow head crests based features triangular shape among relatives anatomy similar parasaurolophs tubeheaded lambeosaurs rather lambeosaurins casque headed lambeosaurs two closely related types lambeosaurine differs prominently taxa tall medial wall ridge situated along middle upper edge bone front back end bone comparison lambeosaurins possess particularly short medial wall parasaurolophus showing intermediate condition dorsal process bony upwards extension similar parasaurolophs relatively rounded rather sharply tapered lambeosaurins region maxilla articulates jugal bone seems indicate parasaurolophlike jugal well though bone preserved near back end maxilla another distinguishing trait adelolophus large elevated palatine process triangular connects palatine bone lambeosaurs smaller lower maxilla shape bottom edge bone along toothrow drastically different north american relatives including parasaurolophus rugose protrusions rather usual smooth condition running jugal articulation palatine process adelolophus possesses unique thickened ridge also unique among adelolophus member lambeosaur subfamily family hadrosauridae phylogenetic position tested precisely original description study nicholas longrich colleagues included adelolophus phylogenetic analysis test relation hadrosaurs found member tribe parasaurolophini close relatives would included parasaurolophus charonosaurus cladogram longrich et al reproduced saurolophinae aralosaurus jaxartosaurus nipponosaurus
