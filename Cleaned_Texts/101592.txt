research laboratory afrl virtual fixtures pioneering platform virtual reality augmented reality technologies virtual fixtures first developed louis rosenberg usaf armstrong labs resulting first immersive augmented reality system ever graphics slow early present photorealistic spatiallyregistered augmented reality virtual fixtures used two real physical robots controlled full upperbody exoskeleton worn user create immersive experience user unique optics configuration employed involved pair binocular magnifiers aligned users view robot arms brought forward appear registered exact

physical barriers fields guides designed assist user performing real physical fitts law performance testing conducted batteries human test subjects demonstrating first time significant enhancement human performance realworld dexterous tasks could achieved providing immersive augmented reality overlays concept virtual fixtures first introduced overlay virtual sensory information workspace order improve human performance direct remotely manipulated tasks virtual sensory overlays presented physically realistic structures registered space perceived user fully present real workspace environment virtual sensory overlays also abstractions properties possible real physical structures concept sensory overlays difficult visualize talk consequence virtual fixture metaphor introduced understand virtual fixture analogy real physical fixture ruler often used simple task drawing straight line piece paper freehand task humans unable perform good accuracy high speed however use simple device ruler allows task carried quickly good accuracy use ruler helps user guiding pen along ruler reducing tremor mental load user thus increasing quality results virtual fixture concept proposed us air force augmented surgery example use case expanding idea virtual ruler guiding real pencil virtual medical fixture guiding real physical scalpel manipulated real objective overlay virtual content upon surgeons direct perception real workspace sufficient realism would perceived authentic additions surgical environment thereby enhance surgical skill dexterity performance proposed benefit virtual medical fixtures compared real hardware virtual additions ambient reality could partially submerged within real patients providing guidance andor barriers within unexposed definition virtual fixtures much broader simply providing guidance endeffector example auditory virtual fixtures used increase user awareness providing audio clues helps user providing multi modal cues localization endeffector

preventing motion undesired directions regions workspace virtual fixtures either guiding virtual fixtures forbidden regions virtual fixtures forbidden regions virtual fixture could used example teleoperated setting operator drive vehicle remote site accomplish objective pits remote site would harmful vehicle fall forbidden regions could defined various pits locations thus preventing operator issuing commands would result vehicle ending illegal commands could easily sent operator instance delays teleoperation loop poor telepresence number reasons example guiding virtual fixture could vehicle must follow certain trajectory operator able control progress along preferred direction motion along nonpreferred direction constrained forbidden regions guiding virtual fixtures stiffness
