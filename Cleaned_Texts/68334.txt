callosobruchus maculatus species beetles known commonly cowpea weevil cowpea seed member leaf beetle family chrysomelidae true weevil common pest stored legumes cosmopolitan distribution occurring every continent except beetle likely originated west africa moved around globe trade legumes small number individuals likely present legumes carried people distant places populations invaded various parts globe likely gone multiple bottlenecks despite bottlenecks subsequent rounds inbreeding populations persist ability withstand high degree inbreeding likely contributed species prevalence used model organism research education due quick generation time sexual dimorphism ease cowpea weevil lacks snout true weevil elongated shape members leaf beetle family reddishbrown overall black gray elytra marked two central black spots last segment abdomen extends short elytra also two black beetle sexually dimorphic males easily distinguished females females sometimes larger males true strains

different optimal levels life stage eggs hatched humidity produced highest survival adult lives longer another experiment temperatures constant humidity stressed beetle ideal temperature range age female oviposition affects development survival offspring eggs older females less likely hatch larvae take longer develop fewer larvae survive copulation injurious female beetle male possesses penile spines damage female reproductive tract female may forcefully kick male copulation ending mating possible male may benefit harming female injury could reduce matings mating success males increase egg production female experimentally prevented kicking male removal hind legs matings continued longer usual injury increased however amount time became receptive rate oviposition affected suggests penile spines increase reproductive success males suspected spines increase reproductive success either sex may adaptive mating female glues single eggs female generally lays fewer eggs fewer hosts experiment females presented three large beans laid eggs females presented three small beans occasionally females deposit many eggs onto nonviable surfaces especially hosts available leads higher

host depending variety size bean well texture seed one study showed beetles choose host depending geographic region also found beetle often switch hosts new host becomes available time beetles start specializing new host lose preference ancestral beetle larvae grow inside bean emerge time takes larvae develop varies across hosts longer development times less suitable found beetles choose oviposit
