embryologists clevage cleavage beginning steps developing embryo cleavage refers many mitotic divisions occur egg fertilized sperm ways cells divide specific certain types animals may many forms holoblastic cleavage complete division cells holoblastic cleavage radial see radial cleavage spiral see spiral cleavage bilateral see bilateral cleavage rotational see rotational cleavage holoblastic cleavage entire egg divide become embryo whereas meroblastic cleavage cells become embryo others yolk sac meroblastic cleavage incomplete division cells division furrow protrude yolky region cells impede membrane formation causes incomplete separation cells meroblastic cleavage bilateral see bilateral cleavage discoidal see discoidal cleavage centrolecithal see centrolecithal animals belong basal phyla holoblastic radial cleavage results radial symmetry see symmetry biology cleavage central axis divisions rotate basal phyla also one two embryonic cell layers compared three bilateral

hippocratic texts embryology include regimen acute diseases semen development child hippocrates claimed development embryo put motion fire nourishment comes food breath introduced mother outer layer embryo solidifies fire within consumes humidity makes way development bone nerve fire innermost part becomes belly air channels developed order route nourishment enclosed fire also helps form veins allows circulation description hippocrates aims describing causes development rather describing develops hippocrates also develops views similar preformationism claims parts embryo simultaneously

generation ideas related embryology also appear history animals parts animals respiration motion animals means know aristotle studied embryology likely predecessors well studying developing embryos taken animals well aborted miscarried human embryos aristotle believed female supplied matter development embryo formed menstrual blood whereas semen comes male shapes matter aristotles belief male female made contribution actual fetus goes prior beliefs according aeschylus egyptian traditions fetus solely develops male contribution female womb simply nourishes growing fetus hand melanesians held fetus solely product female contribution aristotle believe external influences development embryo hippocrates aristotle believed new parts body developed time rather forming immediately developing also considered whether new part derives previously formed part develops independently previously formed part basis different parts body resemble decided favor latter view also described development fetal parts terms mechanical automatic processes terms development embryo says begins liquidlike state material secreted female combines semen male surface begins solidify interacts processes heating cooling first part body differentiate heart aristotle many contemporaries believed location reason thinking aristotle claimed vessels join uterus order supply nourishment developing fetus solid parts fetus cool lose moisture heat turn nails horns hoofs beaks etc internal heat dries away moisture forms sinews bones skin results drying flesh aristotle also describes development birds eggs length described embryonic development dolphins sharks many animals aristotle singularly wrote embryology premodern author influence subsequent discussion subject many centuries immense
