aldrovanda vesiculosa commonly known waterwheel plant sole extant species flowering plant genus aldrovanda family droseraceae plant captures small aquatic invertebrates using traps similar venus flytrap traps arranged whorls around central freefloating stem giving rise common name one plant species capable rapid movement genus aldrovanda monotypic extinct species known fossil species displays degree morphological plasticity populations vesiculosa possesses low genetic diversity across entire vesiculosa declined last century confirmed extant populations worldwide spread across europe africa asia however potentially invasive populations exist eastern united kept hobbyists aldrovanda vesiculosa rootless aquatic plant seedlings develop short protoroot however fails develop senesces plant consists floating stems reaching length cm mm trap leaves grow whorls close succession along plants central stem actual traps held petioles air sacs aid flotation one end stem continually grows end
