evolutionary approaches postpartum depression examine syndrome framework evolutionary theory postpartum postnatal depression refers major minor episodes depression within first months delivery depression pregnancy referred prenatal antenatal depression symptoms postpartum depression include sad depressed mood feelings worry anxiety guilt worthlessness hypersomnia insomnia difficulty concentrating anhedonia somatic pain changes appetite weight loss weight gain moodiness irritability restlessness women may also doubts ability care new infant difficulty bonding infant thoughts harming infants dsmv diagnosis made major depressive disorder added specifier peripartum onset episode occurs pregnancy first four weeks postpartum depression conflated postpartum psychosis qualitatively metaanalysis found pregnant women experience episode major depression many experience depression point however find significant difference rates depression women nonchildbearing times similarly one metaanalysis found rates depression within first year postpartum studies found similar also growing evidence ppd underreported underdiagnosed raising concerns number women suffer untreated crosscultural research often difficult replicate synthesize instance one metaanalysis found rates ppd across likely number cultural factors likely lead overdiagnosis countries growing evidence new fathers also risk experiencing pre postpartum depression although remains understudied found first postpartum year incidence paternal depression ranged community samples among men whose partners experiencing postpartum depression others replicated association partner depression paternal postpartum another review found rates postpartum depression sampled men higher rates months another review found along depression partners low relationship satisfaction also correlated paternal postpartum may also adoptive fathers risk developing postadoption depression although requires many studies examined risk factors peripartum depression although results sometimes mixed factors listed table associated peripartum comprehensive metaanalysis found strongly associated risk factors postpartum depression stressful life events previous history depression anxiety pregnancy low levels social support low socioeconomic one study found stress hormone placental corticotropinreleasing hormone pcrh mediated relationship prenatal family support fewer depression symptoms studies also shown infant health issues represent suite risk factors maternal depression including preterm birth low birthweight birth complications infant another review found additional risk factors including marital status relationship quality infant temperament researchers examined diet primary risk factor depression according one review typical western diet often leads inadequacies folate b vitamins iron depletion nutrients pregnancy may increase womans risk postpartum depression cultural factors may also pose risks postpartum depression instance cultures gender preferences children unmet preferences risk evolutionary scientists postpartum depression interest due relatively high rates seemingly universal expression may provide evidence functionality however postpartum depression also detrimental mothers infants decreases future reproductive success another addition evolutionary approach postpartum depression framed changes human lifestyles recent history hahnholbrook review number lifestyle shifts affected humans since development agriculture first people today consume grainfed domesticated animal products rather wildcaught animals unlike wild animals domesticated animals much lower levels fatty acids essential brain development fetal health support theory postpartum depression may related modern diets authors find rates postpartum depression lower countries consume higher amounts seafood contain high levels fatty hypothesis weakened known poor reliability measures ppd asian samples often return low rates postpartum depression countries including japan emerging evidence suggests postpartum depression may common samples experienced differently detected measures including edinburgh postnatal depression scale furthermore direct randomized control trial found effect supplementary fatty acids women postpartum authors also review relationship breastfeeding postpartum depression specifically explore child loss hypothesis discussed discussed instead examine evidence breastfeeding related stress regulation reduces negative affect offering buffer risk postpartum depression however since studies crosssectional direction effect yet determined may depressed women less likely breastfeed nondepressed women finally authors review evidence lower rates exercise sunexposure common western lifestyles also found related postpartum however evidence hypotheses would easy test randomized controlled trials supplementary exercise vitamin could administered test samples however evidence direct trials also one commonly cited mismatch hypotheses relates changes family networks childcare routines huntergatherer families often live extended families regularly share childcare duties whereas western families may live far relatives therefore must meet demands childcare likely causes additional stress anxiety new parents access assistance family members aspect hypothesis difficult test relationship family assistance postpartum depression likely complicated others focused crux reproductive decisionmaking humans first exists tradeoff present future offspring lifehistory theory organisms limited reproductive energy requires tradeoffs made choosing invest one infant another additional mating opportunities secondly tradeoff quantity quality womens reproduction constrained mens obligate energetic demands women experience higher risks relative decisions invest invest mechanism served signal women faced bad investment opportunity would evolutionarily adaptive instance modern industrialized societies mortality low parents incentivized invest per child parents live less stable environments utilizing riskier subsistence see life history theory example bereczkei et al found women hungary higher rates low birthweight infants shorter interbirth intervals corresponding additional years potential women significantly children end reproductive careers women low birthweight children pointing tradeoff offspring quantity quality vein researchers hypothesized postpartum depression likely occur mothers suffering fitness cost order inform reduce withdraw investment support hypothesis found population hunterhorticulturalists shuar located ecuadorian reasons could include lack paternal social support poor infant health birth complications commonly associated postpartum depression hagen also found support postpartum depression could function bargaining strategy parents receiving adequate support partners withdrew investment order elicit additional support support hagen found postpartum depression one spouse related increased levels child investment spouse furthermore support also found reduction rates postpartum depression older women future reproductive another study reported similar undoubtedly reproductive cost experiencing postpartum depression likely affects future reproductive strategies childspacing decisions specifically myers et al found women experienced postpartum depression first second birth reduced likelihood parity progression third birth lower completed fertility given adaptationist hypotheses explain postpartum depression hagen thornhill one argue limiting complete family size one method reducing parental investment poor furthermore found evidence poor maternal condition birth one highly correlated poor condition subsequent births could poor condition postpartum depression drives lower fertility crosscultural rates peri postpartum depression difficult interpret differences cultural expressions depression may lead inaccurate diagnosis majority screening instruments test peri postpartum depression designed western contexts emphasize symptoms common western studies found women asia tend report somatic symptoms depressive episodes including feeling head numbness affective symptoms feelings sadness guilt commonly reported western samples hispanic asian african cultures one commonly used screening instruments postpartum depression edinburgh postnatal depression scale detect depression japanese early research returned mixed evidence regarding crosscultural rates postpartum depression one review found similar rates postpartum mental disorders across recent metaanalysis including studies data samples around world rates ppd varied another metaanalysis found rates postpartum depression returned selfreported questionnaires vary developing countries developed countries rates much lower structured clinical interviews used yet still varied finland reasons discrepancies fully understood however may often reported rates postpartum depression around reflect true rates postpartum depression experienced women around world variation may due differences measurement techniques socioeconomic factors symptom expression cultural factors relating pregnancy childbirth evidence cultures designate explicit postpartum period new mothers expected rest receive assistance family friends lower rates postpartum however studies found evolutionary approaches postpartum depression offer frameworks informative even given variations rates postpartum depression evolutionary medicine explores causality treatment perspective universal human biology psychology approaches may bring light new perspectives causes treatments
