filial cannibalism occurs adult individual species consumes part young species immediate offspring filial cannibalism occurs many species ranging mammals insects especially prevalent various species exact evolutionary purpose practice species unclear debated among zoologists though consensus may may point species evolutionary history certain evolutionary ecological implications total whole clutch cannibalism occurs parent consumes entire brood usually occurs brood small lower quality obvious purpose total whole clutch cannibalism termination care parents main benefit action investment future reproduction potentially larger healthier partial clutch cannibalism occurs parent consumes part offspring parental manipulation brood size may allow parent maximize lifetime reproductive output adjusting current reproductive costs favour future survival subsequent opportunities unlike total whole clutch cannibalism partial clutch cannibalism invests current future male parents particularly male fish may eat offspring complete current parental cycle remain sufficiently good condition engage breeding following potential benefits filial cannibalism suggested zoologists suggested costs loss immediate risk transmission diseases competition among species resources mating opportunities reproductive dominance promoters filial cannibalism compete well certain species social structure parent may compelled practice filial cannibalism limit amount energy time spend raising young males may compete mating opportunities eating offspring female make female sexually receptive remate male might able prolong lifetime mating female fish may compete mating opportunities males raiding males nest eating eggs inside females may also use cannibalism particularly birds bees live jointnesting social structure way establish reproductive dominance eating eggs animal cultures competition may lead instances egg thievery nest takeovers cuckoldry however consumption animals brood often beneficial consumption unrelated conspecifics since takes less energy eat offspring lessens chance getting brood raided getting food away many species fish paternal care exhibit total partial clutch cannibalism likely order gain additional energy nutrients might ultimately increase future reproductive cannibalized offspring act food source male fish guarding often male fish consume entire clutch small energetic costs caring small clutch may greater reproductive fish filial cannibalism observed regulate male fishs endocrine systems example blenniid fish rhabdoblennius nitidus males androgendependent brood cycle however acquisition eggs suppresses secretion androgen preventing males performing courtship displays obtaining offspring result r nitidus males cannibalize eggs clutch size small reproduce care larger clutch eggs subsequently cases size clutch seems determine whether male consumes entire clutch part example fantail darter males seem consume fixed number eggs regardless clutch size may order cover energy costs guarding eggs since cost parental care increase significantly larger clutch size small clutch size may worth amount care would invested compounded fact fantail darter females prefer males already mated guarding young eggs possibly would reduce risk eggs consumed male specifically females prefer males young eggs old eggs caring smaller broods older eggs may little net benefit male result smaller clutches may end entirely filial cannibalism act way analogous brood reduction birds order reduce competition offspring resources maximize survival fully developed healthy offspring example burying beetle nicrophorus vespilloides exhibits partial filial cannibalism burying beetles bury bodies small vertebrates food source offspring n vespilloides eggs scattered centimeters away corpse hatch larvae make way corpse feed supervised parents clutch sizes much larger corpse support researchers suggest due eggs laid insurance unexpected mortalities parents unable accurately estimate food capacity corpse parents physically constrained minimum clutch size though studies shown parents vary size clutch based amount food available higher densities insufficient food larvae may develop completely resulting smaller adults less likely find mate well limiting maximum clutch size laid parents thus kill part brood earliest stage maximize food available filial cannibalism also serve source energy simultaneously removing nonviable eggs parasitized assassin bug rhinocoris tristis males likely consume eggs periphery brood likely parasitized wasps also easiest male access although r tristis distinguish parasitized eggs nonparasitized eggs preference feeding peripheral eggs may general behavior maximize chances feeding nonviable parasitized eggs addition would reduce number peripheral eggs available parasitic wasps forcing inner egg guarding males likely see fight could potentially kill wasp furthermore eggs serve source energy due costs parental care reduced efficiency feeding energy used fend attackers r tristis males also guard adopted broods without higher rate cannibalization suggesting discriminate eggs unrelated among humans cases newborns infants killed considered unwanted unfit live consumed mother father parents close relatives known infanticidal cannibalism cannibalistic infanticide followed cannibalism practiced various regions particularly well documented among aboriginal httpsenwikipediaorgwikifilialcannibalism
