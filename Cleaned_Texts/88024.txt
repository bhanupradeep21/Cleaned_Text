parkes weber syndrome pws congenital disorder vascular system extremely rare condition exact prevalence named british dermatologist frederick parkes weber first described syndrome body vascular system consists arteries veins capillaries abnormalities vascular malformation capillary arteriovenous malformations avms arteriovenous fistulas avfs overgrowth limb occur together combination disturb complex network blood vessels vascular system known capillary malformations avfs known present birth cases pws genetic condition gene mutated displays autosomal dominant inheritance pws genetic patients show multiple capillary malformations patients multiple capillary malformations likely inherit pws mutations cases cause pws often unknown sporadic cases often pws often confused syndrome kts two diseases similar distinct pws occurs vascular malformation may may genetic mutations whereas klippeltr√©naunay syndrome condition blood vessels lymph vessels form pws kts almost symptoms except pws patients seen avms avfs occurring limb hypertrophy major symptoms pws include birthmarks affected pws patients large flat pink staining skin staining result capillary malformations tendency increase blood flow near surface skin causing staining staining color sometimes referred portwine stains portwine stain discoloration skin due vascular malformation also referred nevus hypertrophy hypertrophy refers excessive growth bone soft tissue pws patients limb overgrown hypertrophy usually seen affected multiple arteriovenous fistulas pws patients also multiple avfs occur conjunction capillary malformations avfs occur abnormal connections arteries normally blood flows arteries capillaries veins avf patients abnormal artery vein connections blood flows directly arteries veins completely bypassing irregular connections affect blood circulation may lead lifethreatening complications abnormal bleeding heart failure avfs identified large purplish bulging veins swelling limbs decreased blood pressure fatigue heart capillary arteriovenous malformations vascular system disorder cause capillary malformations capillaries enlarged increase blood flow towards surface capillary malformations skin multiple small round pink even red affected individuals malformations occur face arms legs spots may visible right birth may develop childhood capillary malformations occur huge threat life occur conjunction avfs clear indicator pws may serious depending severity human phenotype ontology hpo reports additional symptoms pws patients hpo active database collects researches relationships phenotypic abnormalities biochemical useful database information data rarest diseases pws according hpo symptoms reported frequently pws patients include abnormal bleeding hypertrophy lower limb hypertrophy upper limb nevus flammeus staining skin peripheral arteriovenous fistula telangiectasia skin frequent occasional symptoms include varicose veins congestive heart failure glaucoma headache abnormal bleeding skin lesions prone bleed peripheral arteriovenous fistula abnormal communication artery vein direct result abnormal connection wiring artery telangiectasia skin telangiectasia condition tiny blood vessels become widened form threadlike red lines patterns appearance formation weblike patterns also known spider veinscitation needed patterns referred telangiectases varicose veins enlarged swollen twisted congestive heart failure condition hearts ability meet requirements body diminished cardiac output decreased amount blood pumped adequate enough keep circulation body lungs glaucoma glaucoma combination diseases cause damage optic nerve may result vision loss headache pain causes pws either genetic unknown cases direct result gene mutations individuals identified genetic mutation always causes multiple capillary pws displays autosomal dominant pattern means one copy damaged altered gene sufficient elicit pws disorder cases pws occurs people family history condition cases mutation sporadic patients pws absence multiple capillary mutations causes unknown according bostons children hospital known food medications drugs cause pws pregnancy pws transmitted person person run families inherited pws affects males females equally racial predominance causes pws without capillary malformations currently unknown cases pws result mutations gene located chromosome position mutation applicable patients capillary malformations gene responsible making protein regulates rasmapk signaling rasmapk signaling pathway used transmitting signals outside cell cells nucleus pathway important directs cell functions growth proliferation controls cell protein regulates rasmapk pathway acting negative regulator signaling turns signals mutations gene disrupt normal formation protein result nonfunctional protein longer regulates rasmapk signaling pathway however according nih genetics home reference still unclear exactly disruption protein formation leads vascular abnormalities limb overgrowth known fact somehow protein crucial normal development vascular system complex network blood vessels arteries veins based current knowledge disruption protein reason behind blood vessel malformations turn lead sorts problems overgrowth limbs excess blood flow near surface skin leads port wine stains even heart failure occur severity symptoms based extent malformations making correct diagnosis genetic rare disease oftentimes challenging doctors healthcare professions rely persons medical history severity symptoms physical examination lab tests make confirm possibility interpreting symptoms pws conditions avms avfs avms avfs also involve characteristic overgrowth soft tissue bone also pws misdiagnosed syndrome however kts consists following triad capillary malformation venous malformation lymphatic usually specific set symptoms capillary arteriovenous malformations occur together used distinguish pws similar conditions arteriovenous malformations avms arteriovenous fistulas avfs caused mutations well therefore tests discussed fail determine pws highly unlikely genetic testing sequence analysis genetargeted deletionduplication analysis performed identify possible gene pws distinguished conditions defining portwine stains large flat pink portwine stains physical examination enough diagnose additional testing necessary determine extent pws syndrome following tests may ordered physicians help determine appropriate next steps mri ultrasound ctcat scan angiogram mri highresolution scan used identify extent hypertrophy overgrowth tissues also used identify complications may arise result ultrasound necessary examine vascular system determine much blood actually flowing ctcat scan scan especially useful examining areas affected pws helpful evaluating bones overgrown angiogram angiogram also ordered get detailed look blood vessels affected overgrown limb test physician injects dye blood vessels help see blood vessels echocardiogram depending intensity pws syndrome echo could also ordered check condition pws often requires multidisciplinary care depending symptoms patients dependent dermatologists plastic surgeons general surgeons interventional radiologists orthopedists hematologists neurosurgeons vascular surgeons since arteriovenous capillary malformations completely reconstructed depending extent severity malformations patients may care physicians entire lives moment known measures taken order prevent onset disorder genetic testing registry resource patients pws provides information genetic tests could done see patient necessary pws sporadic mutation genetic testing work way prevent onset pws cure treatment differs person person depends extent severity blood vessels malformations degree correction possible treatments control symptoms often involve multidisciplinary care mentioned avms avfs treated surgery differences legs overgrowth affected limb patient referred legs affected minimal degree patient may find heel inserts useful adjust different lengths legs walk normally portwine stains may treated supportive care necessary may include compression garments garments tightfitting clothing affected limb helps reducing pain also help protecting limb bumps scrapes cause bleeding based symptoms doctors may recommend antibiotics pain surgical care might also option pws patients surgeons may perform debulking procedure abnormal overgrown tissues pws affecting foot leg limbs become quite large orthopedic surgeon operate limb reshape limb growth limb one inch procedure called epiphysiodesis may procedure interrupts growth leg stops leg growing big treatment options include embolization laser therapy embolization includes substance injected interventional radiologists help elimination abnormal connections arteries according parkes weber management paradigms systematic review published july embolization alone combination surgical removal arteriovenous malformations leads significant clinical laser therapy also help lighten capillary malformations speed healing process bleeding lesions specialists needed dealing progression disease physical therapists occupational therapists physical therapists help ease pain increase range movements arm leg overgrown occupational therapists could help development motor skills impeded physical problems classic portwine stains may make patient feel uncomfortable counselors help psychological social issues pws progressive condition advances age dependent extent disease overgrowth condition patients heart blood vessels responsive treatment overall health patient tolerance medications treatments based factors prognosis fair deformity overgrowth tend progress time epiphyseal closure lot medical attention needed correct blood vessels according nih clinical trialsgov research portwine stain relation polymorphisms commenced november expected end november purpose study assess portwine stains lead complex syndromes pws currently little knowledge epidemiology stains progress disease research ongoing results yet published another review published july discussed treatments prognosis banzic et al discussed clinical findings embolization works really well patients pws also embolization along surgical resection targets arteriovenous malformations reliably leads significant clinical
