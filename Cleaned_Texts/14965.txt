brain herniation potentially deadly side effect high pressure within skull occurs part brain squeezed across structures within skull brain shift across structures falx cerebri tentorium cerebelli even foramen magnum hole base skull spinal cord connects brain herniation caused number factors cause mass effect increase intracranial pressure icp include traumatic brain injury intracranial hemorrhage brain herniation also occur absence high icp mass lesions hematomas occur borders brain compartments cases local pressure increased place herniation occurs pressure transmitted rest brain therefore register increase herniation puts extreme pressure parts brain thereby cuts blood supply various parts brain often fatal therefore extreme measures taken hospital settings prevent condition reducing intracranial pressure decompressing draining hematoma putting local pressure part brain brain herniation frequently presents abnormal characteristic positioning limbs indicative severe brain damage patients lowered level consciousness glasgow coma scores three one pupils may dilated fail constrict response vomiting also occur due compression vomiting center medulla oblongata severe headaches seizures result increased intracranial pressure uncommon cardiovascular pulmonary symptoms may also present brain loses function might also associated bleeding symptoms known cushings triad hypertension widening pulse pressure irregular respirations commonly cheynestokes bradycardia severe cases cardiac causes brain herniation tentorium extension dura mater separates cerebellum cerebrum two major classes herniation supratentorial infratentorial supratentorial refers herniation structures normally found tentorial notch infratentorial refers structures normally found uncal transtentorial central cingulate subfalcine transfalcine transcalvarial tectal posterior upward upward cerebellar upward transtentorial tonsillar downward cerebellar uncal herniation common subtype transtentorial herniation innermost part temporal lobe uncus squeezed much moves towards tentorium puts pressure brainstem notably tentorium structure within skull formed dura mater meninges tissue may stripped cerebral cortex process called uncus squeeze oculomotor nerve aka cn iii may affect parasympathetic input eye side affected nerve causing pupil affected eye dilate fail constrict response light pupillary dilation often precedes somatic motor effects cn iii compression called oculomotor nerve palsy third nerve palsy palsy presents deviation eye position due loss innervation ocular motility muscles except lateral rectus innervated abducens nerve aka cn vi superior oblique innervated trochlear nerve aka cn iv symptoms occur order parasympathetic fibers surround motor fibers cn iii hence compressed firstcitation needed compression ipsilateral posterior cerebral artery result ischemia ipsilateral primary visual cortex contralateral visual field deficits eyes contralateral homonymous hemianopsia another important finding false localizing sign socalled kernohans notch results compression cerebral crus containing descending corticospinal corticobulbar tract fibers leads ipsilateral hemiparesis reference herniation contralateral hemiparesis reference cerebral cruscitation needed increasing pressure progression hernia distortion brainstem leading duret hemorrhages tearing small vessels parenchyma median paramedian zones mesencephalon pons rupture vessels leads linear flamed shaped hemorrhages disrupted brainstem lead decorticate posture respiratory center depression death possibilities resulting brain stem distortion include lethargy slow heart rate pupil uncal herniation may advance central sliding uncus syndrome represents uncal herniation without alteration level consciousness sequelae mentioned central herniation diencephalon parts temporal lobes cerebral hemispheres squeezed notch tentorium transtentorial herniation occur brain moves either across tentorium called ascending descending transtentorial herniation respectively however descending herniation much downward herniation stretch branches basilar artery pontine arteries causing tear bleed known duret hemorrhage result usually symptoms type herniation include small fixed pupils paralysis upward eye movement giving characteristic appearance sunset eyes also found patients often terminal complication development diabetes insipidus due compression pituitary stalk radiographically downward herniation characterized obliteration suprasellar cistern temporal lobe herniation tentorial hiatus associated compression cerebral peduncles upwards herniation hand radiographically characterized obliteration quadrigeminal cistern intracranial hypotension syndrome known mimic downwards transtentorial herniation cingulate subfalcine herniation common type innermost part frontal lobe scraped part falx cerebri dura mater top head two hemispheres cingulate herniation caused one hemisphere swells pushes cingulate gyrus falx put much pressure brainstem types herniation may interfere blood vessels frontal lobes close site injury anterior cerebral artery may progress central interference blood supply cause dangerous increases icp lead dangerous forms symptoms cingulate herniation well usually occurring addition uncal herniation cingulate herniation may present abnormal posturing cingulate herniation frequently believed precursor types transcalvarial herniation brain squeezes fracture surgical site also called external herniation type herniation may occur craniectomy surgery flap skull removed protruding brain region preventing piece skull replaced increased pressure posterior fossa cause cerebellum move tentorial opening upward cerebellar midbrain pushed tentorial notch upward also known ascending transtentorial herniation since occurs across tentorium cerebelli tonsillar herniation also called downward cerebellar transforaminal herniation coning cerebellar tonsils move downward foramen magnum possibly causing compression lower brainstem upper cervical spinal cord pass foramen increased pressure brainstem result dysfunction centers brain responsible controlling respiratory cardiac function common signs intractable headache head tilt neck stiffness due tonsillar impaction level consciousness may decrease also give rise flaccid paralysis blood pressure instability also evident congenital tonsillar herniation cerebellum also known chiari malformation cm previously arnoldchiari malformation acm four types chiari malformation represent different disease processes different symptoms prognosis conditions found asymptomatic patients incidental finding severe lifethreatening condition diagnosed frequently radiologists patients undergo mri scans heads especially upright mri twice sensitive detecting cerebellar tonsillar ectopia cte term used radiologists describe cerebellar tonsils low lying meet radiographic criteria

consistent chiari malformation without radiographic evidence tonsillar herniation sometimes patients described chiari type many suspected causes tonsillar herniation including decreased malformed posterior fossa lower back part skull providing enough room cerebellum hydrocephalus abnormal csf volume pushing tonsils dural tension pulling brain caudally connective tissue disorders ehlers danlos
