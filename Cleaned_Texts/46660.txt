responsible thoughts feelings status determined persons fate upon death took place heart weighing ceremony anubis would feed heaviest hearts demon ammit believed ancient egyptian view heart formed foundation later theories location human hippocratic corpus many treatises demonstrate evolving knowledge body treat ailments reference treatise diseases ii physicians warned illnesses associated air body particularly lungs causing patient cough vigorously διαπνειν δοκει δια στηθεοζ translated patient breathing next lines detail extremely serious time condition patient cause great concern remedy air lungs physician advised clear lungs air possible using bladder hosing later corpus life aristotle disease iv pneuma air presented warming life force treatise sacred disease air described located lungs entire body circulating giving according treatise first location air brain describes medical conditions brain caused blockage air flow aristotle works refers pneuma directly related soul plato student socrates teacher aristotle suggests timmeus human soul divine nature entered human body separating spiritual origin would return upon death furthermore plato believed soul tripartite one composed logos thymos epithemitikon order protect immortal soul contamination perishable souls thymos epithemitikon separated head neck thymos responsible feelings rage bravery hope located chest cavity epithemitikon controlled desires unconscious thought located near umbilicus farthest logos brain seat rational thought logos true location immortal divine de spiritu aristotle links idea pneuma soul directly together saying pneuma connected soul souls primary driving aristotle de anima soul suggests organs body required soul interact unlike plato aristotle believed souls existence separate human body thus soul could immortal similarly plato however aristotle believed soul composed three parts vegetative sensitive rational growth reproduction result vegetative soul found organisms sensitive soul however allows sensation movement humans animals third rational exclusive humans allows rational book ii aristotle states soul part human allows entire one cant exist without complement book iii provides example theory soul makes correlation physical sensations light phaos body corporeal imaginations aristotle imagined soul part within human body part corporeal imagination aristotles treatise youth old age life death respiration aristotle explicitly states soul corporeal form physical area soul human body heart aristotle states heart location sensations body directly responsible respiration sustenance heart importance animals area heating body blood creation pneuma life force animates aristotle explains dead things become cold breathe souls left heart location human soul life force organ utmost importance aristotelian physiology correspondingly heart first organ appear embryonic epicurus view reflecting greek philosopher democritus suggested human soul corporeal composed small particles spread within entire body epicurus believed separation small particles resulted loss sensation consequently death like aristotle epicurus opinion soul result body making mortal third century herophilos alexandria one first anatomists perform dissections human body brief time herophilos discovered many novel aspects human body specifically brain associated works herophilus lost fire alexandria ad therefore know existence surviving works medical terminology works recorded books galen therefore reliability herophilus actually thought soul body according recordings work herophilus thought location soul brain specifically ventricles brain open cavities innermost parts brain herophilos describes distinction soul natures intertwined within body separate things exist

reasoning ventricles particular importance location soul ventricle brain herophilus observed existed two types nerves functioned motor activity take sensory information nerves continuation spinal cord cerebellum located closely ventricle stood reason center movement perception thus soul must located treatise anatomy pneuma inhaled lungs sent brain ventricles via vessels body brain would convert

detailed anatomy aristotle stated heart point origin nerves made argument heart secondary organ next liver organ operation site responsible production humors ideas predominated mid seventeenth egyptian philosopher father neoplatonism plotinus idea human soul would form foundation christian view human soul like plato plotinus believed soul resulted immortal would return divine source upon death plotinus believed two parts soul higher level rational part lower level portion located entire plotinus saw soul tool universal structure one two parts human form body saw soul responsible life existence death soul could body however body necessary soul exist therefore duality roles soul among plotinus philosophy soul played important role merging one ultimate object plotinus created three stages reaching goal attaining union stage involves gaining control body platos civic virtues detachment material goods recognize soul divine reality independent body prior second stage involves embracing higher processes soul abandoning current way thinking since soul bridge human form reaching one thinking processes soul divinity lift closer one final step abandonment things one learned since one knowledge language reasoning must personal journey unite plotinus put therefore said written says plato letter speak write sending wakening words explanations towards contemplation showing way wishes see something teaching extends road passage vision work decided see thomas aquinas sought christian view soul using ideas aristotle aquinas view soul incorporeal immortal came direct result divine intervention god typically came second trimester pregnancy point fetus would ability perceive move result given incorporeal though infused unknown manner body form body platonic sense soul
