cellulitis bacterial infection involving inner layers specifically affects dermis subcutaneous signs symptoms include area redness increases size borders area redness generally sharp skin may redness often turns white pressure applied always area infection usually lymphatic vessels may occasionally person may fever feel legs face common sites involved although cellulitis occur part leg typically affected following break risk factors include obesity leg swelling old facial infections break skin beforehand usually bacteria commonly involved streptococci staphylococcus contrast cellulitis erysipelas bacterial infection involving superficial layers skin present area redness welldefined edges often associated diagnosis usually based presenting signs symptoms cell culture rarely making diagnosis serious infections underlying bone infection necrotizing fasciitis ruled treatment typically antibiotics taken mouth cephalexin amoxicillin allergic penicillin may prescribed erythromycin clindamycin methicillinresistant aureus mrsa concern doxycycline trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole may addition concern related presence pus previous mrsa elevating infected area may useful may pain

redness heat occasionally associated inflammation regional lymph nodes classically distinguished separate entity erysipelas spreading deeply involve subcutaneous tissues many clinicians may classify erysipelas cellulitis often treated similarly cellulitis associated furuncles carbuncles abscesses usually caused aureus may affect treatment decisions especially antibiotic skin aspiration nonpurulent cellulitis usually caused streptococcal organisms rarely helpful diagnosis blood cultures positive fewer important evaluate coexistent abscess finding usually requires surgical drainage opposed antibiotic therapy alone physicians clinical assessment abscess may limited especially cases extensive overlying induration use bedside ultrasonography performed experienced practitioner readily discriminates abscess cellulitis may change management use ultrasound abscess identification may also indicated cases antibiotic failure cellulitis characteristic cobblestoned appearance
