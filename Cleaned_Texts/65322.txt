hivtoolbox internet application helps scientists identify develop new hypotheses well facilitate interpretation experiments goal helping scientists better understand hiv virus causes aids identify new potential drug information hiv includes different parts hiv proteins often referred domains smaller regions proteins called minimotifs also present hiv proteins minimotifs also called short linear motifs encode different molecular functions hiv hivtoolbox internet application runs mysql database designed integrate hiv data protein sequences derived many different isolates protein structures protein domains proteinprotein interactions functional elements proteins known predicted minimotifs minimotif miner amino acids involved molecular functions catalysis dimerization etc also included database program also contains calculated amino acid conservation hiv proteins helps identify regions virus change thus thought represent important regions release hivtoolbox also contains information locations proteins different hiv drugs bind spatial relationship mutations arise hiv render virus resistant drug httpsenwikipediaorgwikihivtoolbox
