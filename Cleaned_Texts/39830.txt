corneal ulcer ulcerative keratitis inflammatory condition cornea involving loss outer layer common dogs sometimes seen cats veterinary medicine term corneal ulcer generic name condition involving loss outer layer cornea used describe conditions inflammatory traumatic causes cornea transparent structure part outer layer eye refracts light protects contents eye cornea onehalf one millimeter thick dog trigeminal nerve supplies cornea via long ciliary nerves pain receptors outer layers pressure receptors deeper transparency achieved lack blood vessels pigmentation keratin organization collagen fibers collagen fibers cross full diameter cornea strictly parallel fashion allow percent light pass without scattering four important layers dog cat cornea outer layer epithelium micrometers five seven cell layers epithelium holds tear film place also prevents water invading cornea disrupting collagen fibers prevents corneal edema gives cloudy appearance also barrier infectious agents epithelium sticks basement membrane also separates epithelium stroma corneal stroma comprises percent thickness contains collagen fibers organized lamellae lamellae sheets separate easily posterior stroma descemets membrane basement membrane corneal endothelium endothelium single cell layer separates cornea aqueous humor healing corneal ulcer involves two processes migration surrounding epithelial cells followed mitosis dividing cells introduction blood vessels conjunctiva superficial small ulcers heal rapidly first process however larger deeper ulcers often require presence blood vessels supply inflammatory cells white blood cells fibroblasts produce granulation tissue scar tissue effectively healing cornea corneal ulcers one common eye diseases dogs caused trauma detergent burns infections eye conditions cause corneal ulcers entropion distichiae corneal dystrophy keratoconjunctivitis sicca dry eye least two cases corneal ulceration caused canine superficial ulcers involve loss part epithelium deep ulcers extend stroma result severe scarring corneal perforation descemetoceles occur ulcer extends stroma exposing descemets membrane type ulcer especially dangerous result perforation location ulcer depends somewhat cause central ulcers typically caused trauma dry eye exposure facial nerve paralysis exophthalmos ulcers inferior nasal cornea may caused foreign

membrane bulge forward staining appear dark circle green boundary absorb stain tests may necessary include schirmers test keratoconjunctivitis sicca analysis facial nerve function facial nerve paralysis treatment corneal ulcers includes topical antibiotic therapy prevent infection pain medications including topical atropine stop spasms ciliary muscle atropine may decrease tear production interfere corneal superficial ulcers usually heal less week deep ulcers descemetoceles may require corneal suturing conjunctival grafts conjunctival flaps soft contact lenses corneal transplant topical corticosteroids anesthetics used type corneal ulcer prevent healing often make worse new bioscaffold developed tr biosurgical evaluated refractory corneal ulcers dogs study conducted board certified veterinary ophthalmologists shown promise healing refractory ulcers failed conventional treatment refractory corneal ulcers superficial ulcers heal poorly tend recur also known indolent ulcers boxer ulcers believed caused defect basement membrane lack hemidesmosomal attachments recognized undermined epithelium surrounds ulcer easily peels back refractory corneal ulcers commonly seen middle aged older dogs often occur eye later similar cogans cystic dystrophy humans refractory corneal ulcers take long time heal sometimes months topical antibiotics used continually prevent infection pain medications given needed loose epithelium removed dry cotton swab topical anesthesia order allow production normal basement membrane division normal epithelium often treatment necessary keratotomy superficial cutting piercing cornea two main types used dogs multiple punctate keratotomy mpk grid keratotomy gk mpk involves making small superficial punctures cornea needle gk commonly used involves making parallel perpendicular scratches corneal surface usually topical anesthesia necessary scoring corneal surface anchoring points provided attachment new epithelium course procedures performed veterinarian particularly one experience treatment complete healing takes three four keratotomies may lead corneal sequestration medications shown useful topical treatment refractory ulcers including glycosaminoglycans sodium chondroitin aminocaproic melting ulcers type corneal ulcer involving progressive loss stroma dissolving fashion commonly seen pseudomonas infection caused types bacteria fungi infectious agents produce proteases collagenases break corneal stroma complete loss stroma occur within treatment includes antibiotics collagenase inhibitors acetylcysteine homologous blood serum surgery may necessary corneal ulcers cats caused trauma detergent burns infections eye diseases one common cause seen dogs infection feline herpesvirus causes ulceration direct infection epithelial cells lesions appear round dendritic branching ulcers also suppresses healing cornea symptoms include conjunctivitis squinting eye discharge blood vessels cornea cause severe scarring treatment topical antiviral drugs antibiotics oral llysine competes arginine inhibits viral corneal ulceration common disease equine eye sightthreatening consequences aggressive treatment always indicated even apparently mild ulcers progress quickly causing serious complications distinct cause initial ulceration commonly found although many cases assumed traumatic origin horses eye especially vulnerable trauma due prominent position compared species exposure keratitis inflamed cornea occur horse commonly secondary facial nerve paralysis hospitalised animals shown decreased corneal reflex corresponds increased incidence ulcers hospitalised population foreign bodies embedded palpebral conjunctiva nictitating membrane cause persistent irritation ulceration often shape distribution lesion suggestive aetiology even absence characteristic lesion presence considered sought bacterial fungal infection occurs readily initial ulceration disruption corneal epithelium allows attachment colonisation underlying tissues normal corneal commensals commonly isolated bacteria include staphylococcus streptococcus pseudomonas empirical antimicrobial therapy effective bacteria differential diagnoses painful equine eye full ocular exam performed every case eye pain fluoroscein staining usually diagnostic corneal ulcers although staining rose bengal also recommended pick early viralfungal lesions appear multifocal disturbances tear film culture sensitivity recommended rapidly progressive deep corneal ulcers cotton swabbing often inadequate corneal scraping example blunt side scalpel blade usually required greatly facilitated use local nerve blocks topical anaesthesia almost invariably secondary uveitis present corneal ulceration signs may also seen miosis corneal oedema aqueous flare hypopyon iop changes medical therapy based upon severity disease initially response therapy aims initial therapy initial choice antibiotic depends upon personal choice experience availability could include chloramphenicol chlortetracycline bacitracinneomycinpolymyxin bnp ciprofloxacin ofloxacin tobramycin topical gentamicin formulations also available opinion reserved cases stromal melting frequency application vary depending severity lesion formulation used ointment vs drops much pain associated corneal ulceration due secondary uveitis miosis effective relief often gained topical leading mydriasis dosing generally initially required maintain dilation mydriasis also important avoid complications associated uveitis synechiae formation glaucoma pain also associated inflammatory response occurring adjacent sclera conjunctiva systemic analgesia form nsaids usually indicated example flunixin meglumin mgkg bid topical nsaids available diclofenac flurbiprofen effective shown
