ideational apraxia ia neurological disorder explains loss ability conceptualize plan execute complex sequences motor actions involved use tools otherwise interacting objects everyday ideational apraxia condition individual unable plan movements related interaction objects lost perception objects characteristics disorder include disturbance concept sequential organization voluntary actions patient appears lost knowledge thought object represents disorder first seen years ago doctor arnold pick described patient appeared lost ability use patient would make errors combing hair wrong side comb placing pistol point several researchers doctors stumbled upon unique disorder ia described several names agnosia utilization conceptual apraxia loss knowledge use tools semantic amnesia tool term apraxia first created steinthal applied gogol kusmaul star pick patients failed pantomime use liepmann refined definition specifically described disorders involved motor planning rather disturbances patient visual perception language liepmann first actually conduct tests patients laboratory tests known multipleobject tasks task requires patient use one object researcher describes task patient asks execute task described liepmann gave patients necessary articles candle matchbox placed patient observed patients see interacted case matchbox one patient brought whole box next wick instead one match another opened box withdrew match brought wick unlighted still another patient struck candle striking surface matchbox thus liepmann able witness discontinuity patients actions respect everyday objects categorize errors patients made namely mislocation actions object misuse omissions perplexity sequence even though afflicted persons unable correctly perform simple tasks using multiple items provided able accurately identify objects involved simple tasks example able match given sequence photographs correct label process making coffee buttering bread preparing tea patients also able successfully identify objects researcher verbally describes function tool another test involves matching appropriate object function finally fact patients identify actions given tool sequence photographs shows completely understand object deficit therefore patients lack knowledge use object fully understand function tool rather problem lies attempt interact tools multipleobject task order execute functions execution cause ia still somewhat mystery researchers localized focal point brain shows deficit occur since liepmann proposed hypothesis action processing system found left hemisphere brain dedicated skilled motor planning guides movement body yet still never able produce two patients brain damage showed ideational apraxia major ideas ia found left posterior temporalparietal junction possibly damage lateral sulcus also known sylvian fissure may contribute individual deterioration object recognition another possible area damage leading ia submarginal gyrus located parietal lobe overall ia autonomous syndrome linked damage left hemisphere involving semantic memory disorders rather defect motor several severe injuries diseases cause ia wide range patients alzheimers patients largest cohort groups express groups often seen dysfunction stroke victims traumatic brain injuries dementia damage almost always found dominant hemisphere ie usually left hemisphere patientcitation needed ideational apraxia characterized mechanism patient loses idea interact object norman shallice came dualsystems theory control routine willed behavior according theory one system scheduling responsible control routine action supervisory attention able bias system willed control behavior contention scheduling complicated set processes involve action action schemas used sequence actions involved making cup tea situation specific factors whether glass lemonade bitter even simple tasks need monitoring goals eg sugar added cup coffeecitation needed learn new activities also learning new schemas know open jar jelly light match schemas needed everyday life give purpose goal behaviors schema subgoals components make example would schema lighting match three subgoals found schema holding match holding matchbox holding lit match subgoals could applied obvious overall goal wanted light match schemas form hierarchy complicated complex action sequences corresponding high level schemas low level schemas correlating simple single object said earlier norman shallice component used voluntary action supervisory attention schemas cause activation behaviors greater excitation activity easily achieve subgoals complete schema either topdown fashion activates schemas intentions governed type cognitive system bottomup fashion features object environment trigger schema begin bottomup feature seen ideational apraxia object appears capture attention however schema corresponds object fulfilled reason disconnect brain allow individual produce sequence actions know happening object visual pathway area still area ambiguity physicians researchers alike sure brain action schema pathway ideational apraxia difficult diagnose majority patients disorder also type dysfunction agnosia aphasia tests used make ia diagnosis range easy singleobject tasks complex multipleobject tested patient may asked view twenty objects demonstrate use single object following three different ways presenting stimuli patient must perform complex test examiner describes task making coffee patient must show sequential steps make cup coffee patients scored many errors seen examiner errors patients performing mot scored according set criteria partly derived de renzi two classes errors used develop diagnosis class sequence errors class ii conceptual errors examiner observes patient task mark errors committed criteria examiner able focus severity dysfunction important express motor movement lost patients ia yet first glance movements may appear awkward unable plan sequence movements given since underlying cause disorder damage brain present ideational apraxia reversible however occupational physical therapy may able slow progression help patients regain functional control treatment approach ideomotor recovery may occur younger patients stroke brain plasticity may allow functions damaged regions remapped patients develop new behaviors cope apraxia brains functioning neurons may take functions dead damaged context dementia apraxia major cause morbidity progresses underlying disease sometimes extent patients may unable feed use simple utensils patients often become highly dependent require nursing home placement inability properly use objects brain imaging techniques fmri eeg pet scans may help understanding neuroanatomical computational basis ideational apraxia understanding mechanisms likely crucial developing new modes therapy help patients cope disorder httpsenwikipediaorgwikiideationalapraxia
