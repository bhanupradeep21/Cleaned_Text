released colourless milky secretions glands located back behind ears frogs genus phyllobates one frogs agitated feels threatened pain toxin reflexively released several canals batrachotoxin activity temperaturedependent maximum activity activity also rapid alkaline ph suggests unprotonated form may active neurotoxin affects nervous system neurological function depends depolarization nerve muscle fibres due increased sodium ion permeability excitable cell membrane lipidsoluble toxins batrachotoxin act directly sodium ion involved action potential generation modifying ion selectivity voltage sensitivity batrachotoxin irreversibly binds na channels causes conformational change channels forces sodium channels remain open batrachotoxin keeps voltagegated sodium channels open also reduces singlechannel conductance words toxin binds sodium channel keeps membrane permeable sodium ions none direct effect peripheral nervous system pns batrachotoxin pns produces increased permeability selective irreversible resting cell membrane sodium ions without changing potassium calcium concentration influx sodium depolarizes formerly polarized cell membrane batrachotoxin also alters ion selectivity ion channel increasing permeability channel toward larger cations voltagesensitive sodium channels become persistently active resting membrane potential batrachotoxin kills permanently blocking nerve signal transmission muscles batrachotoxin binds irreversibly opens sodium channels nerve cells prevents closing neuron longer send signals results paralysis furthermore massive influx sodium ions produces osmotic alterations nerves muscles causes structural changes suggested may also effect central nervous system although currently known effect may although generally classified neurotoxin batrachotoxin marked effects heart muscles effects mediated sodium channel activation heart conduction impaired resulting arrhythmias extrasystoles ventricular fibrillation changes lead
