bronchus pl bronchi pronounced brankai passage airway lower respiratory tract conducts air lungs first primary bronchi branch trachea carina right main bronchus left main bronchus widest bronchi enter right lung left lung hilum main bronchi branch narrower secondary bronchi lobar bronchi branch narrower tertiary bronchi segmental bronchi divisions segmental bronchi known order order order segmental bronchi grouped together subsegmental bronchi narrow supported cartilage known bronchioles gas exchange takes place bronchi trachea windpipe divides carina two main primary bronchi left bronchus right bronchus carina trachea located level sternal angle fifth thoracic vertebra rest right main bronchus wider shorter vertical left main mean length enters root right lung approximately fifth thoracic vertebra right main bronchus subdivides three secondary bronchi also known lobar bronchi deliver oxygen three lobes right superior middle inferior lobe azygos vein arches behind right pulmonary artery lies first front cm commencement gives branch superior lobe right lung also called eparterial bronchus eparterial refers position right pulmonary artery right bronchus passes artery known hyparterial branch divides two lobar bronchi middle lower lobes left main bronchus smaller caliber longer right cm long enters root left lung opposite sixth thoracic vertebra passes beneath aortic arch crosses front esophagus thoracic duct descending aorta left pulmonary artery lying first front left bronchus eparterial branch therefore supposed upper lobe left lung socalled upper lobe corresponds middle lobe right lung left main bronchus divides two secondary bronchi lobar bronchi deliver air two lobes left superior inferior lobe secondary bronchi divide tertiary bronchi also known segmental bronchi supplies bronchopulmonary segment bronchopulmonary segment division lung separated rest lung septum connective tissue property allows bronchopulmonary segment surgically removed without affecting segments initially ten segments lung development left lung two lobes two pairs segments fuse give eight four lobe tertiary bronchi divide another three branchings known order order order segmental bronchi also referred subsegmental bronchi branch many smaller bronchioles divide terminal bronchioles gives rise several respiratory bronchioles go divide two eleven alveolar ducts five six alveolar sacs associated alveolar duct alveolus basic anatomical unit gas exchange lung main bronchi relatively large lumens lined respiratory epithelium cellular lining cilia departing towards mouth removes dust small particles smooth muscle layer epithelium arranged two ribbons muscle spiral opposite directions smooth muscle layer contains seromucous glands secrete mucus wall hyaline cartilage present bronchi surrounding smooth muscle layer main bronchi cartilage forms cshaped rings like trachea smaller bronchi hyaline cartilage present irregularly arranged crescentshaped plates islands plates give structural support bronchi keep airway bronchial wall normally thickness total bronchial cartilage mucous membrane main bronchus primary bronchi similar trachea lined respiratory epithelium classified ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium main bronchi contains goblet cells glandular modified simple columnar epithelial cells produce mucins main component mucus mucus plays important role keeping airways clear mucociliary clearance process branching continues bronchial tree amount hyaline cartilage walls decreases absent bronchioles cartilage decreases amount smooth muscle increases mucous membrane also undergoes transition ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium simple ciliated cuboidal epithelium simple squamous epithelium alveolar ducts people right superior lobe bronchus arising main stem bronchus prior carina known tracheal bronchus seen anatomical multiple variations although usually asymptomatic root cause pulmonary disease recurrent infection cases resection often cardiac bronchus prevalence presents accessory bronchus arising bronchus intermedius upper lobar bronchus origin middle lower lobar bronchi right main accessory cardiac bronchus usually asymptomatic condition may associated persistent infection half observed cases cardiac bronchus presents short deadending bronchial stump remainder bronchus may exhibit branching associated aerated lung parenchyma bronchi function carry air breathed functional tissues lungs called alveoli exchange gases air lungs blood capillaries occurs across walls alveolar ducts alveoli alveolar ducts alveoli consist primarily simple squamous epithelium permits rapid diffusion oxygen carbon dioxide bronchial wall thickening seen ct scan generally always implies inflammation bronchi normally ratio bronchial wall thickness bronchial diameter bronchitis defined inflammation bronchi either acute chronic acute bronchitis usually caused viral bacterial infections many sufferers chronic bronchitis also suffer chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd usually associated smoking longterm exposure irritants left main bronchus departs trachea greater angle right main bronchus right bronchus also wider left differences predispose right lung aspirational problems food liquids foreign bodies aspirated tend lodge right main bronchus bacterial pneumonia aspiration pneumonia may result tracheal tube used intubation inserted far usually lodge right bronchus allowing ventilation right lung asthma marked hyperresponsiveness bronchi inflammatory component often response allergens asthma constriction bronchi result difficulty breathing giving shortness breath lead lack oxygen reaching body cellular processes case inhaler used rectify problem inhaler administers bronchodilator serves soothe constricted bronchi reexpand airways effect occurs quite quickly bronchial atresia rare congenital disorder varied appearance bronchial atresia defect development bronchi affecting one bronchi usually segmental bronchi sometimes lobar defect takes form blindended bronchus surrounding tissue secretes mucus normally builds becomes lead regional collected mucus may form mucoid impaction
