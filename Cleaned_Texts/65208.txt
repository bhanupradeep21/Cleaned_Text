edema also spelled oedema also known fluid retention dropsy hydropsy swelling buildup fluid bodys commonly legs arms symptoms may include skin feels tight area may feel heavy joint symptoms depend underlying causes may include venous insufficiency heart failure kidney problems low protein levels liver problems deep vein thrombosis infections angioedema certain medications may also occur immobile patients stroke spinal cord injury aging temporary immobility prolonged sitting standing menstruation condition concerning starts suddenly pain shortness breath treatment depends underlying underlying mechanism involves sodium retention decreased salt intake diuretic may elevating legs support stockings may useful edema older people commonly word greek οἴδημα oídēma meaning edema occur specific organs part inflammations tendinitis pancreatitis instance certain organs develop edema tissue specific mechanisms examples edema specific organs foot two weeks postsurgery distal phalanx right finger exhibits edema due acute paronychia severe edema legs feet rise hydrostatic pressure occurs cardiac failure fall osmotic pressure occurs nephrotic syndrome liver causes edema generalized whole body cause edema multiple organs peripherally example severe heart failure cause pulmonary edema pleural effusions ascites peripheral edema severe systemic edema called anasarca rare cases parvovirus infection may cause generalized although low plasma oncotic pressure widely cited edema nephrotic syndrome physicians note edema may occur significant protein urine proteinuria fall plasma protein level forms nephrotic syndrome due biochemical structural changes basement membrane capillaries kidney glomeruli changes occur lesser degree vessels tissues body thus resulting increase permeability leads protein urine explain edema vessels permeable well previously mentioned conditions edemas often occur late stages pregnancy women common history pulmonary problems poor circulation also intensified arthritis already present particular woman women already arthritic problems often seek medical help pain caused overreactive swelling edemas occur pregnancy usually found lower part leg usually calf hydrops fetalis condition baby characterized accumulation fluid least two body compartments pumping force heart help keep normal pressure within blood vessels heart begins fail condition known congestive heart failure pressure changes cause severe water retention condition water retention mostly visible legs feet ankles water also collects lungs causes chronic cough condition usually treated diuretics otherwise water retention may cause breathing problems additional stress another cause severe water retention kidney failure kidneys longer able filter fluid blood turn urine kidney disease often starts inflammation instance case diseases nephrotic syndrome lupus type water retention usually visible form swollen legs cirrhosis scarring liver common cause edema legs abdominal phlebetic lymphedema phlebolymphedema seen untreated chronic venous insufficiency common type edema approx combination venouslymphatic disorder originates defective leaky veins allows blood back flow venous reflux slowing return blood heart venous stasis venous pressure legs changes dramatically standing compared laying much pressure depends persons height average adult person mm hg laying mm hg venous insufficiency venous stasis results abnormally high venous pressure venous hypertension greater permeability blood capillaries capillary hyperpermeability drain blood lymphatic system lymphatic system slowly removes excess fluid proteins veins lower legs towards upper body however efficient unimpaired circulatory system swelling edema visible particularly ankles lower leg unfortunately chronic increased fluid lymphatic system capillary hyperpermeability causes inflammatory response leads tissue fibrosis veins lymphatic system opening arteriovenous shunts worsens condition vicious swollen legs feet ankles common late pregnancy problem partly caused weight uterus major veins pelvis usually clears delivery baby mostly cause though always reported doctor lack exercise another common cause water retention legs exercise helps leg veins work gravity return blood heart blood travels slowly starts pool leg veins pressure force much fluid leg capillaries tissue spaces capillaries may break leaving small blood marks skin veins become swollen painful distorted condition known varicose muscle action needed keep blood flowing veins also stimulate lymphatic system fulfil overflow function longhaul flights lengthy bedrest immobility caused disability potential causes water retention even small exercises rotating ankles wiggling toes help reduce certain medications prone causing water retention include estrogens thereby including drugs hormone replacement therapy combined oral contraceptive well nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs premenstrual water retention causing bloating breast tenderness six factors contribute formation generation interstitial fluid regulated forces starling hydrostatic pressure within blood vessels tends cause water filter tissue leads difference protein concentration blood plasma tissue result colloidal oncotic pressure higher level protein plasma tends draw water back blood vessels tissue starlings equation states rate leakage fluid determined difference two forces also permeability vessel wall water determines rate flow given force imbalance water leakage occurs capillaries post capillary venules semipermeable membrane wall allows water pass freely protein protein said reflected efficiency reflection given reflection constant gaps cells vessel wall open permeability water increased first gaps increase size permeability protein also increases fall reflection changes variables starlings equation contribute formation edemas either increase hydrostatic pressure within blood vessel decrease oncotic pressure within blood vessel increase vessel wall permeability latter two effects allows water flow freely reduces colloidal oncotic pressure difference allowing protein leave vessel easilycitation needed another set vessels known lymphatic system acts like overflow return much excess fluid bloodstream even lymphatic system overwhelmed simply much fluid lymphatic system congested fluid remain tissues causing swellings legs ankles feet abdomen part edema may described pitting edema nonpitting pitting edema pressure applied small area indentation persists release pressure peripheral pitting edema shown illustration common type resulting water retention caused systemic diseases pregnancy women either directly result heart failure local conditions varicose veins thrombophlebitis insect bites nonpitting edema observed indentation persist associated conditions lymphedema lipedema myxedema edema caused malnutrition defines kwashiorkor acute form childhood proteinenergy malnutrition characterized edema irritability anorexia ulcerating dermatoses enlarged liver fatty infiltrates possible treatment involves resolving underlying cause many cases heart kidney disease treated treatment may also involve positioning affected body parts improve drainage example swelling feet ankles may reduced person lie bed sit feet propped cushions intermittent pneumatic compression used
