africa dry last glacial early holocene increase strength monsoon caused wet period northern africa african humid sizes numerous lakes east africa larger early holocene years ago strengthening monsoon also affected asian increased insolation northern hemisphere considered cause african humid directed precessional maximum insolation continents became much warmer ocean thus monsoon mechanisms also played seeing reconstructed changes precipitation considerably abrupt actual changes humidity increase simultaneously places locations farther north omo river headwaters reached maximum humidity thus maximum levels lakes fed rivers later locations farther south maximum humidity occurs maximum insolation coincides rainy season coincidence occurred later history northerly water nowadays suguta
