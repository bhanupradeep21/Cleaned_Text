ufo afterlight realtime tacticsturnbased strategy video game third altar games ufo series like predecessors ufo aftermath ufo aftershock combines squadlevel tactical combat overlying strategic elements inspired classic xcom ufo defense following canonical bad ending ufo aftermath humans agree terms reticulans invaded earth humans moved laputa earth events ufo aftershock colonists cryosleep small research team moved mars intention terraforming planet making new home humanity immediately prior events game member excavation research team jurgen stumbles upon alien structure filled robots unknown origins robots awaken attack killing tutorial mission soon robots begin emerging buried structures mars begin attacking human stations even damage critical water pipeline north pole colonists forced recover begin manufacture armaments protect new threat sufficiently armed humans strike back large robot cluster close original site discovery attack successful robot short circuit activates mysterious portal combat site aggressive alien creatures dubbed beastmen pour portal open fire humans forcing retreat beastmen refuse attempts communication soon begin arriving large numbers several portals planet humans eventually manage destroy power source portals beastmen create numerous outposts planet including large base side planet human base beastmen carry direct attack human base repelled damage cryo facility begins process awakening colonists player given time limit terraform secure mars small base would able sustain awakened colonists humans forced defend robots beastmen trying research advanced technologies fight terraform mars increased rate restore contact earth reach cultists antagonist faction ufo aftershock exchange weapon technologies following events ufo aftershock laputians soon defeat replace cultists primary earth contact eventually sending materials weapons scientific data mars war earth completely additionally human base contacts remnants reticulan forces set small outpost south time game different faction reticulans expedition lands west attack humans reticulans turns sent reticulan homeworld hunt rebel reticulans occupied earth player align either two factions fight technology resources finally mars sufficiently terraformed race martians creator robots emerges homes flooded melting ice though initially hostile humans allied player researches language helps beastmen threat eventually humans piece together history mars beastmen original inhabitants planet martians arrived beyond solar system myrmecol giant space travelling psionic colossal size beastmen defeated invaders cast portals distant world since planned trained take back homeworld invaders portals activated human expedition martians agree coexist humans provided research done make terraforming acceptable beastmen refuse notion coexisting species thus concluded option humans wipe entire beastmen species help laputian researchers virus devised target beastment dna wipe majority beastment forces planet however spread virus requires earthlike environment making need terraform mars even pressing terraforming mars reaches certain threshold virus released atmosphere killing beastmen severely weakening resilient remain player leads final attack beastmen main base wiping remaining commanders remain victory declared point regardless status factions game ufo afterlight played two parts first part strategy game consisting claiming territory building structures planet managing research production managing personnel training base management diplomacy items resources may traded parties second part afterlight tactical game much like previous ufo titles seven soldiers may equipped deployed accomplish goal missions mission goals capture kill specific enemy destroy retrieve particular item ubiquitous kill everything moves game starts set number characters new characters become available game progresses unlike previous titles however new characters simply purchased drones found missions gain experience like characters repaired upgraded parts appropriate research completed characters single class soldier technician scientist characters one class soldierscientist soldiertechnician scientisttechnician human resource management quite unique among games genre limited pool staff shared across activities combat production base planetary building research training example technician might needed assist combat mission work factory build mines increase resources learn new skill assignment one job prevent slow progress task characters gain experience respective classes soldiers combat missions sole method gain experience soldier levels technicians gain experience working production queues building structures base planet participating missions requiring technician scientists gain experience performing research labs building structures planet participating missions requiring scientist character gains levels training points accumulate used train character various skills well increasing characters abilities strength dexterity etc separate skill sets soldiers scientists technicians however science technician trainings useful combat missions addition respective role strategic game example suit handling training allows technicians build suits faster well repairing damaged suits mission scientists train medicine allows research medicine technologies faster use healing devices missions strategic game territories claimed building particular structure called geosonde territories must cleared opposing forces claimed claimed additional structures built territory including terraforming stations excavation sites resource mines radars type structure require either technician scientist build though equipped single scientific craft single technical truck sending respective characters build structures planet quite characters placed either vehicle thus speeding construction process building structures scientists technicians available missions purpose territories resources available mine including metal fuel crystals chemicals noble metals others tap resource simply build mine resource gains level cumulative mines type resource levels also traded factions planet give whatever resource offered whatever resource offered return warned deals undone otherwise actual resource management resources capped low levels unless certain buildings built raise cap many actions strategic game research production upgrading base one prerequisites specific technology particular base structure minimum resource level combination requirements tactical game squads soldiers equipped sent missions travel missions ufo gift colonists reticulan friends technicians scientists soldier levels included missions gain soldier experience usual missions also give technician science experience respective classes good idea use mixed class characters missions often enough keep soldier levels missions require use scientist technician mars landscape hostile place humans aliens alike strategic view environment hostility factor shown fluctuates slightly every days missions environment hostility rating based overall rating vary day night terraforming stations also lower environment hostility missions region suits must worn protect environment soldier wearing suit rated high enough missions environment hostility suit become damaged mission greater discrepancy suits rating environment hostility likely suit damaged character hurt technician repair damaged suits repair device base management includes building upgrading existing base structures grant ability build new weapons equipment expand resources add room perform research production train heal characters among things research many avenues medicine earth technology martian technology planetology among many others ufo titles research necessary upgrade equipment gain use alien technology expand base improve overall capabilities additional laboratories added prerequisites met allowing research multiple technologies production allows new items created time something added production queue build quantity set actual quantity item produced however production line takes time set production line built items start produced continue quantity defined reached item removed queue quantity built changed time queued items may freely moved ahead behind others without affecting production line setup time additional workshops may built prerequisites met allowing multiple production queues build multiple items ufo afterlight received mixed reviews upon release holds average aggregate website
