nesting behavior refers instinct animals reproduction prepare place optimal conditions nesting place provides protection predators competitors mean exploit kill also provides protection physical nest building important family therefore influenced different mating behaviours social found variety animals birds fish mammals amphibians female dogs may show signs nesting behaviour one week include pacing building nest items around house blankets clothing stuffed also sometimes cases false pregnancy pseudocyesis domestic cats often make nests bringing straw cloth scraps soft materials selected nook box particularly attracted haylofts nest sites commercial whelping queening boxes available however childrens wading pools dogs plastic dishpans cats work birds known going broody characterized insistence stay nest much possible cessation laying new eggs marsupials exhibit nesting instinct per se mothers pouch fulfills function housing newborns nest building performed order provide sufficient shelter comfort arriving threats predators decrease chance survival increase care natural conditions sows leave herd travel day prior parturition order find appropriate spot sows use forelimbs snouts order create excavated depressions within ground gathertransport nesting although nests vary radius dependent age sow nests generally round oval shape usually located near trees uprooted stumps shelter provided nest built sows utmost importance thermoregulation first two weeks piglets life physiological thermoregulation still developing due lack amount brown fat tissue piglets require increased surrounding temperature without protection nest piglets subjected climatic influences causing internal temperature drop lifethreatening farrowing crates widely implemented modern pig husbandry order reduce piglet mortality via crushing however type housing disturbs sows natural instinct nest build due lack space thus necessary sows farrow without performance natural prepartum activity results high stress animal rodents lagomorphs nesting instinct typically characterized urge seek lowest sheltered spot available mammals give birth rats example prefer burrow amongst dense areas vegetation around human settlements come contact often rodent species create burrows develop microclimates another way nesting instinct aids alzheimers disease rats observed impair nesting ability especially females impairments become exaggerated age progression particularly among burrowing animals groundhogs prairie dogs nesting used across burrows uses insulation bedding litter chambers transportation comfort various marmot species groundhogs alpine marmots nest borrows thick grasses advance winter keeps thermoregulated insulated comfortable environment marmots undergo maternal nestbuilding regulated hormonal actions estradiol progesterone prolactin given importance shelter offspring survival reproductive success wonder set common hormonal signals evolved however exact timing features nest building vary among species depending endocrine external factors initial drive perform behavior stimulated internally via hormones specifically rise prolactin levels increase driven increase prostaglandin decrease second phase nest building driven external stimuli phase also known materialoriented phase stage said external stimuli proper nest building materials must present internal external stimuli must exist conjunction one another nest building commence cessation nest building correlated rise oxytocin hormone responsible contraction uterus shortly parturition rabbits nest building occurs towards last third pregnancy mother digs builds nest straw grass lines hair plucked body sequential motor pattern produced changes estradiol progesterone prolactin levels six eight days prepartum high levels estradiol progesterone lead peak digging behavior estradiol progesterone produced released ovaries one three days prepartum strawcarrying behavior expressed function decreasing progesterone levels maintenance high estradiol levels increasing prolactin levels release prolactin anterior pituitary likely caused increase estrogentoprogesterone ratio one day prepartum four days postpartum hair loosening plucking occur result low progesterone high prolactin levels together decrease house mice golden hamsters nestbuilding takes place earlier start middle pregnancy species nestbuilding coincides high levels estrogen external factors also interact hormones influence maternal nestbuilding behavior pregnant rabbits shaved line straw nest available alternatives male rabbit hair synthetic hair given straw hair mothers prefer straw strawcarrying period prefer hair nestlining period given hair material shaved mothers collect hair even strawcarrying research avian paternal behavior shows nestbuilding triggered different stimuli two sexes unlike case females male nestbuilding among ring doves depends behavior prospective mate rather hormonal mechanisms males castrated injected daily testosterone either court females build nests depending purely behavior female hence male avian transition courtship nestbuilding prompted social cues changes hormone sand goby pomatoschistus minutus males ones build nests males exhibit increased paternal care eggs build nests smaller entrances comparison males provide less parental care helps prevent predators entering nest consuming offspring developing nesting behavior also present many invertebrates best known example nesting behavior insects domestic honey bee bees build nests solitary bees like honey bees make nests however solitary bees make individual nests larvae always solitary bees burrow ground dead wood httpsenwikipediaorgwikinestinginstinct
