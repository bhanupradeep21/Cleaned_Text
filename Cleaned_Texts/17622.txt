shaping conditioning paradigm used primarily experimental analysis behavior method used differential reinforcement successive approximations introduced b f pigeons extended dogs dolphins humans species shaping form existing response gradually changed across successive trials towards desired target behavior reinforcing exact segments behavior skinners explanation shaping first give bird food turns slightly direction spot part cage increases frequency behavior withhold reinforcement slight movement made toward spot alters general distribution behavior without producing new unit continue reinforcing positions successively closer spot reinforcing head moved slightly forward finally beak actually makes contact spot original probability response final form low cases may even zero way build complicated operants would never appear repertoire organism otherwise reinforcing series successive approximations bring rare response high probability short time total act turning toward spot point box walking toward raising head striking spot may seem functionally coherent unit behavior constructed continual process differential reinforcement undifferentiated behavior sculptor shapes figure lump successive approximations reinforced increasingly closer approximations target behavior set trainer training progresses trainer stops reinforcing less accurate approximations trainer stops reinforcing behavior learner go extinction burst perform many behaviors attempt receive reinforcement trainer pick one behaviors closer approximation target behavior reinforce chosen trainer repeats process successive approximations getting closer target response learner achieves intended behavior example train rat press lever following successive approximations might applied trainer starts reinforcing behaviors first category turning toward lever animal regularly performs response turning trainer restricts reinforcement responses second category moving toward third progressing accurate approximation animal learns one currently reinforced thus response gradually approximates desired behavior finally target response lever pressing established first rat likely press lever end presses rapidly shaping sometimes fails oftcited example attempt marian keller breland students bf skinner shape pig raccoon deposit coin piggy bank using food reinforcer instead learning deposit coin pig

reward contingencies changed two coins required gain reward raccoon could learn new complex rule could characterized expressions frustration raccoon resorts basic foodgetting behaviors common species results show limitation raccoon cognitive capacity even conceive possibility two coins could exchanged food irrespective existing autoshaping contingencies since brelands observations reported many examples untrained responses natural stimuli reported many contexts stimuli called sign stimuli related behaviors called sign shaping used training operant responses lab animals applied behavior analysis change human animal behaviors considered maladaptive dysfunctional also used teach behaviors learners refuse target behavior struggle achieving procedure plays important role commercial animal training shaping assists discrimination ability tell difference stimuli reinforced generalization application response learned one situation different similar shaping also used rehabilitation center example training parallel bars approximate walking shaping teach patients increase time bathroom visits autoshaping sometimes called sign tracking variety experimental procedures used study classical conditioning autoshaping contrast shaping reward comes irrespective behavior animal simplest form autoshaping similar pavlovs salivary conditioning procedure using dogs pavlovs bestknown procedure short audible tone reliably preceded presentation food dogs dogs naturally unconditionally salivated unconditioned response food unconditioned stimulus given learning conditionally came salivate conditioned response tone conditioned stimulus predicted food autoshaping light reliably turned shortly animals given food animals naturally unconditionally display consummatory reactions food given learning conditionally came perform consummatory actions directed conditioned stimulus predicts food autoshaping provides interesting conundrum bf skinners assertion one must employ shaping method teaching pigeon peck key animal shape use laborious process shaping autoshaping also contradicts skinners principle reinforcement autoshaping food comes irrespective behavior animal reinforcement occurring random behaviors increase frequency rewarded random food nonetheless keypecking reliably develops even behavior never rewarded clearest evidence autoshaping pavlovian skinnerian control found using omission procedure food normally scheduled delivery following presentation stimulus often flash light except cases animal actually performs consummatory response stimulus case food withheld behavior instrumental control animal would stop attempting consume stimulus behavior followed withholding food animals persist attempting consume conditioned stimulus thousands phenomenon known negative automaintenance unable cease behavioral response conditioned stimulus even prevents obtaining reward
