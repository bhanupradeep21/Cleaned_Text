herbarium plural herbaria collection preserved plant specimens associated data used scientific specimens may whole plants plant parts usually dried form mounted sheet paper called exsiccatum plur exsiccata depending upon material may also stored boxes kept alcohol specimens herbarium often used reference material describing plant taxa specimens may types term often used mycology describe equivalent collection preserved fungi otherwise known xylarium herbarium specialising specimens term hortorium liberty hyde bailey hortorium occasionally applied herbarium specialising preserving material horticultural making herbaria ancient phenomenon least six centuries old although techniques changed little important step transformation study plants branch medicine independent discipline make available plant material far away places long period oldest traditions making herbarium collections traced italy bologna physician botanist luca ghini reintroduced study actual plants opposed relying classical texts dioscorides lacked sufficient accuracy identification first needed make available plant material even winter hence hortus hiemalis winter garden hortus siccus dry garden students placed freshly gathered plants two sheets paper applied pressure flatten absorb moisture dried specimen glued onto page book practice supplemented parallel development hortus simplicium orto botanico botanical garden supply material established university pisa although ghinis herbarium oldest extant herbarium gherardo cibo around early herbaria prepared sheets bound books carl linnaeus came idea maintaining free sheets allowed easy reordering within commensurate need identify specimen essential include herbarium sheet much plant possible eg roots flowers stems leaves seed fruit least representative parts case large specimens preserve form colour plants collected field carefully arranged spread flat thin sheets known flimsies equivalent sheets newsprint dried usually plant press blotters absorbent drying process specimens retained within flimsies times minimise damage thicker absorbent drying sheets replaced plants may prove helpful allow fresh specimen wilt slightly arranged press opportunity check rearrange lay specimen best reveal required features plant occurs damp absorbent sheets changed dryingpressing processcitation needed specimens mounted sheets stiff white paper labelled essential data date place found description plant altitude special habitat conditions sheet placed protective case precaution insect attack pressed plant frozen poisoned case disinfected certain groups plants soft bulky otherwise amenable drying mounting sheets plants methods preparation storage may used example conifer cones palm fronds may stored labelled boxes representative flowers fruits may pickled formaldehyde preserve threedimensional structure small specimens mosses lichens often airdried packaged small paper matter method preservation detailed information plant collected habitat color since may fade time name collector usually includedcitation needed value herbarium much enhanced possession types original specimens study species founded thus herbarium british museum especially rich earlier collections made eighteenth early nineteenth centuries contains types many species founded earlier workers botany also rich types australian plants collections sir joseph banks robert brown contains addition many valuable modern herbaria utilize standard system organizing specimens herbarium cases specimen sheets stacked groups species belong placed large lightweight folder labelled bottom edge groups species folders placed together larger heavier folders genus genus folders sorted taxonomic family according standard system selected use herbarium placed pigeonholes herbarium locating specimen filed herbarium requires knowing nomenclature classification used herbarium also requires familiarity possible name changes occurred since specimen collected since specimen may filed older namecitation needed modern herbaria often maintain electronic databases collections many herbaria initiatives digitize specimens produce virtual herbarium records images made publicly accessible via internet possible herbarium collections great significance value science many herbaria long essential study plant taxonomy study geographic distributions stabilizing nomenclature linnaeuss herbarium contains types belongs linnean society modern scientists continue develop novel nontraditional uses herbarium specimens extend beyond original collectors could specimens housed herbaria may used catalogue identify flora area large collection single area used writing field guide manual aid identification plants grow specimens available author guide better understand variability form plants natural distribution plants growcitation needed herbaria also preserve historical record change vegetation time cases plants become extinct one area may become extinct altogether cases specimens preserved herbarium represent record plants original distribution environmental scientists make use data track changes climate human impact herbaria also proven useful source plant dna use taxonomy molecular systematics even ancient fungaria represent source dnabarcoding ancient many kinds scientists naturalists use herbaria preserve voucher specimens representative samples plants used particular study demonstrate precisely source data enable confirmation identification future may also repository viable seeds rare many
