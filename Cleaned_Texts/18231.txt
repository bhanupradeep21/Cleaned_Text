economics business decisionmaking sunk cost also known retrospective cost cost already incurred sunk costs contrasted prospective costs future costs may avoided action words sunk cost sum paid past longer relevant decisions future even though economists argue sunk costs longer relevant future rational decisionmaking people everyday life often take previous expenditures situations repairing car house future decisions regarding properties according classical economics standard microeconomic theory prospective future costs relevant rational moment time best thing depends current things matter future past mistakes costs incurred prior making decision already incurred matter decision made may described water making decisions basis may described crying spilt words people let sunk costs influence decisions sunk costs irrelevant rational decisions thus new factory originally projected yield million value million spent value projection falls million company abandon project rather spending additional million complete conversely rational actor value projection falls million company continue project known bygones marginal bygones principle grounded branch normative decision theory known rational choice theory particularly expected utility hypothesis expected utility theory relies property known cancellation says rational decisionmaking disregard cancel state world yields outcome regardless ones past sunk criterion bygones principle also formalised notion separability separability requires agents take decisions comparing available options eventualities still occur uninfluenced current situation reached eventualities precluded history language decision trees requires agents choice particular choice node independent unreachable parts tree formulation makes clear central principle standard economic theory example founding foldingback algorithm individual sequential decisions gametheoretical concepts subgame decisionmaker irreversibly commits resources prospective cost avoidable future cost properly included decisionmaking instance someone considering preordering movie tickets actually purchased yet cost remains avoidable retrospective prospective costs could either fixed costs continuous long business operating unaffected output volume variable costs dependent however many economists consider mistake classify sunk costs fixed variable example firm sinks million enterprise software installation cost sunk onetime expense recovered spent fixed cost would monthly payments made part service contract licensing deal company set software upfront irretrievable payment installation deemed fixed cost cost spread time sunk costs kept separate variable costs project might include data centre power usage example cases taking sunk costs account decisionmaking violating bygones principle example manager wishes perceived persevering face adversity avoid blame earlier mistakes may rational persist project personal reasons even benefit company hold private information undesirability abandoning project fully rational persist project outsiders think displays fallacy sunk bygones principle always accord realworld behavior sunk costs often influence peoples people believing investments ie sunk costs justify people demonstrate greater tendency continue endeavor investment money effort time sunk cost fallacy behavior may described throwing good money refusing succumb may described cutting ones people remain failing relationships already invested much leave people swayed arguments war must continue lives sacrificed vain unless victory achieved individuals caught psychologically manipulative scams continue investing time money emotional energy project despite doubts suspicions something types behaviour seem accord rational choice theory often classified behavioural rego arantes magalhães point sunk cost effect exists committed relationships devised two experiments one showed people relationship invested money effort likely keep relationship going end second experiment people relationship invested enough time tended devote time also means people fall sunk cost fallacy although people ignore sunk costs make rational decisions planning future time money effort often make people continue maintain relationship equivalent continuing invest failed projects according evidence reported de bondt makhija citation

groupthink aversion loss sunk evidence behavioral economics suggests least five specific psychological factors underlying sunk cost effect taken together results suggest sunk cost effect may reflect nonstandard measures utility ultimately subjective unique individual framing effect underlies sunk cost effect builds upon concept extensionality outcome regardless information framed contradiction concept intentionality concerned whether presentation information changes situation question take two mathematical functions functions framed differently regardless input x outcome analytically equivalent therefore rational decision maker choose two functions likelihood function chosen however framing effect places unequal biases towards preferences otherwise equal common type framing effect theorised kahneman tversky form valence framing form framing signifies types framing first type considered positive sure thing option highlights positivity whereas negative sure thing option highlights negativity analytically identical example saving people sinking ship equivalent letting people drown former framing type positive latter negative ellingsen johannesson möllerström categorised framing effects social economic orientation three broad classes theories firstly framing options presented affect internalised social norms social preferences called variable sociality hypothesis secondly social image hypothesis suggests frame options presented affect way decision maker viewed turn affect behaviour lastly frame may affect expectations people others behaviour turn
