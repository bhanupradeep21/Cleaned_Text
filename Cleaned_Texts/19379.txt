donohue syndrome also known leprechaunism extremely rare severe genetic disorder leprechaunism derives name hallmark elvish features small stature bulging eyes thick lips upturned nostrils exhibited affected individuals disease caused mutation insr gene contains genetic information formation insulin result affected individuals either decreased number insulin receptors insulin receptor greatly impaired functionality lack impairment insulin receptor functionality leads inability regulate blood glucose levels severe insulin resistance ultimately lead affected development tissues organs throughout body addition physical abnormalities leprechaunism also characterized endocrine system abnormalities lead conditions hyperglycemia high blood glucose levels hypoglycemia low blood glucose levels hyperinsulemia high blood insulin levels enlargement certain sex organs penis males clitoris females facial features indicative donohue syndrome include protuberant lowset ears flaring nostrils unusually large mouth thick lips widely spaced eyes physical features include stunted growth including gestation lack subcutaneous adipose tissue muscle atrophy hirsutism excessive body hair growth dysplasia nail additionally condition known acanthosis nigricans present affected individuals acanthosis nigricans patches skin darken thicken gain velvetlike appearance gender specific features also include enlarged clitoris breasts well ovarian cysts affected females enlarged penis affected journal pediatric medicine donohue uchida described affected sisters whose growth appeared ended seventh month gestation born alive dying four months early death spontaneous abortion typical although affected individuals sometimes live longer endocrine related abnormalities result insulin receptor malfunction include insulin resistance hypoglycemia hyperglycemia depending whether individual eaten hyperinsulemia much milder form disease insulin resistance normal growth subcutaneous fat distribution also caused less severe mutation gene donohue syndrome autosomal recessive genetic disorder mutations responsible disorder found short arm chromosome within coding sequence insr gene insulin receptor causing production inactive receptor several mutations responsible disease mutation severely impairs functionality insulin receptor similar effects insr gene spans one hundred twenty thousand base pairs contain twentytwo exons coding protein consists amino introns may may spliced depending kind known mutations gene cause donohue syndrome include nonsense mutation resulted early termination protein addition deletion mutation resulted frame single missense milder form mentioned single codon change altered isoleucine methionine receptor mutations gene instead result insulin resistant diabetes without donohue mutations gene extremely rare cases result consanguineous matings example however exact mutation need disease caused inheritance two different mutant alleles one parent case patient compound heterozygous individual ie one carrier disease one normal allele insulin receptor affected two heterozygous parents theory one four chance child disease two thirds unaffected children carriers however spontaneous abortion miscarriage often results fetus disease actuality proportion children born alive donohue syndrome lower possible genetic test identify carriers rare usually done unless reason suspect individual tested carrier instance affected sibling cousin expected genetic disease caused many different mutations limited specific ethnic group seen people various racescitation needed cause disease lack fully functional insulin receptor profound effect fetal development thereafter one case found culturing pancreatic cells receptor produced mutant allele effective normal beta cells pancreas make store insulin release asneeded basis often found large role insulin body facilitate entrance glucose cell insulin binds insulin receptors cell surface insulin receptors send signal ultimately bring glucose transporter protein attach cell membrane additionally insulin bound insulin receptors also initiate several signaling cascades promote cell growth differentiation protein synthesis glucose synthesis inhibition gluconeogenesis several metabolic pathways malfunctioning insulin receptor would thus able properly initiate signaling cascades aforementioned cellular processes many problems associated donohue syndrome may due insulin receptor binding insulinlike growth factor regulating growth embryo addition wellknown role regulation blood ways diagnose donohue syndrome due nature disorder donohue syndrome diagnosed either genetically symptomatically donohue syndrome genetic disorder genetic testing performed diagnose disease genetic tests include diagnostic testing carrier testing predictive presymptomatic testing well forensic testing prenatally amniocentesis performed determine child donohue additionally disorder diagnosed laboratory testing measure blood insulin levels defective insulin receptors currently cure donohue syndrome treatments disease tailored specifically symptoms present individual often team medical professionals come together treat patient condition specific realm practice pediatrics endocrinology treatment often address specific dysfunctions patient skin defects hormonal imbalances normal progression child growthcitation needed prognosis quite dire early death fact patients die first year except milder forms disease known lived variation unsurprising given diversity mutations causing disease donohue syndrome extremely rare disorder occurs one every million births worldwide several dozen cases reported medical community reported cases disorder found females twice likely disorder mencitation needed donohue syndrome first identified canadian pathologist william l donohue name leprechaunism largely abandoned perception name parents patients national institute diabetes digestive kidney diseases sponsored phase clinical study would look effectiveness leptin treat severe insulin resistance study two children severe insulin resistance ages known known defect insulin receptor
