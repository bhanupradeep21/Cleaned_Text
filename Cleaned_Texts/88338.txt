dental pulpal testing clinical diagnostic aid used dentistry help establish health dental pulp within pulp chamber root canals tooth investigations important aiding dentists devising treatment plan tooth tested two major types dental pulp tests vitality testing assesses blood supply tooth whilst sensitivity testing tests sensory supply dental pulp tests valuable techniques used establish pulpal health status tooth dentistry diagnostic information obtained pulpal testing used alongside patients history clinical radiographic findings determine diagnosis prognosis tooth pulp tests useful following procedures dentistry pulpal tests may conducted via stimulation sensory fibres within pulp sensitivity testing assessing pulpal blood flow vitality testing available techniques reported limitations terms accuracy reproducibility therefore require careful interpretation clinical practice sensitivity tests assess sensory response tooth external stimulus results may extrapolated indirectly determine pulpal health status sensory stimuli heat cold electrical current applied tooth question order stimulate nocireceptors within pulp type sensory fibres activated therefore response felt patient depends stimulus used sensibility testing based brännströms hydrodynamic theory postulates activation nocireceptors caused fluid movement within dentinal tubules response thermal electrical mechanical osmotic three primary outcomes pulp sensitivity test thermal testing involves application either hot cold stimuli tooth common form sensibility test number products available cold testing varying melting points although household ice cheap easy obtain accurate colder dry ice used however concerns regarding damaging effects using something cold oral despite evidence suggest dry ice negative impact tooth refrigerant sprays ethyl chloride propanebutaneisobutane gas mixture commonly used cold tests cold testing thought stimulate type aδ fibres pulpal tissue elicit short sharp pain heat tests include using heated instruments ballended probe guttapercha rubber commonly used root canal procedures tests less commonly used thought less accurate cold tests may likely cause damage teeth surrounding electrical current applied tooth order generate action potential type aδ fibres within pulp eliciting neurological response tests conducted applying conducting medium eg toothpaste dried tooth placing probe tip electric pulp tester surface tooth closest pulp horns patient directed hold end conducting probe complete circuit asked let go probe tingling sensation felt use electric pulp testing questioned patients traditional cardiac pacemakers despite evidence interferences humans particularly modern care must taken using electric pulp test tooth adjacent metallic restorations create electrical conduction yield false negative results pulp testing results inconclusive patients localise specify pain symptoms anaesthetic would helpful used posterior tooth area pain resonates undergoes anaesthesia either infiltration intraligamentary injection pain diminishes pain still present procedure repeated mesial teeth one one pain diminishes gone one still determine source pain procedure repeated opposite arch case pain localised either maxillary mandibular arch inferior alveolar nerve block would used pain stops would imply involves teeth mandibular test cavity technique used last resort results produced methods inconclusive highspeed burs used without anaesthetic drilling enamel restorations dentine throughout drilling process patient asked whether painful sensation felt would indicate pulpal vitality event vital pulp painful response provoked dentin contacted bur procedure stopped restoration would placed contrarily compared vital pulp pulp partial necrosis stimulated extensively case partial necrosis access dentine would needed dentist progressively invading drilling deeper dentine checking sensory usually without sensory response partial necrosis due invasiveness possible anxiety may generate patients test cavity technique generally avoided also little literature supporting effectiveness relatively anecdotal within clinical tests limitations test results interpreted experienced dentist bidirectional consideration clinical symptoms radiography sensitivity tests indicate presence absence nerve supply individual tooth even though prolonged response aforementioned tests indicate pulpal inflammation degree inflammation innervation inferred tests false positive false negative results possible performing sensitivity testing false positive response occurs patient respondent sensitivity testing despite lack sensory tissue tooth tested responses may occur due innervation adjacent teeth due inadequate isolation tooth tested anxious patients perceive pain despite sensory stimulus multirooted teeth still residual pulpal tissue residing false negative results occurs innervated teeth respond sensibility testing occur individuals recently traumatised teeth teeth incomplete root development teeth heavy restorations teeth significantly reduced pulp size due production tertiary sclerotic pulpal sensitivity testing may regarded inferior vitality testing definitively prove tooth blood supply vital nonetheless electric pulp testing cold testing tests found accurate reliable case assessing pulpal health especially tests used addition cold testing also accurate electric pulp case running tests upon immature traumatised despite insights gained sensitivity testing research study found density nerve fibers blood vessels pulp tissue degree oxygen saturation may play crucial role interpreting results presence higher density nerve fibers may contribute lower threshold electrical stimulation suggesting involvement neural factors pulp sensibility moreover positive correlation blood vessel density oxygen saturation well negative correlation nerve fiber density electrical voltage perception provide valuable insights complex nature dental pulp therefore addition standard sensitivity testing objective accurate methods pulse oximetry might necessary comprehensive understanding pulp vitality however findings study generalized caution due small sample size focus healthy teeth extracted orthodontic vitality tests assess vascular supply tooth vascular supply generally accepted earliest indicator pulpal however vitality tests limitations require strict adherence correct application diagnostic methods assess vascular response pulp include laser doppler flowmetry able assess blood flow within dental pulp directly laser beam directed onto tooth follows path dentinal tubules viability vascular supply pulp determined output signal generated backscattered reflected light circulating blood reflected light dopplershifted different frequency reflected surrounding tissues static arbitrary unit measurement perfusion unit pu used measure concentration velocity flux blood output laser doppler flowmetry may influenced blood flow surrounding tissues therefore test tooth must adequately isolated avoid pulse oximetry utilises difference red infrared light absorption oxygenated deoxygenated red blood cells within blood circulation determine oxygen saturation level pulse oximetry well laser doppler flowmetry vitality tests may truly reflect real state health dental pulp mainly happens clinical scenarios dental pulp diseased yet viable blood supply study slovenia correlations found clinical tests histological analysis dental pulp healthy permanent premolars extracted orthodontic reasons found higher density blood vessels pulp tissue corresponded increased oxygen saturation levels measured pulse oximetry lending support validity pulse oximetry reliable method assessing pulp vitality furthermore teeth closed apices higher density nerve fibers upper part dental pulp compared teeth open indicated individual variations sensitivity teeth showing higher density nerve fibers lower threshold electrical use dual wavelength light establishes contents within pulp httpsenwikipediaorgwikidentalpulptest
