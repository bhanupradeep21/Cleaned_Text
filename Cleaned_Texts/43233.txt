keystone species species disproportionately large effect natural environment relative abundance concept introduced zoologist robert paine keystone species play critical role maintaining structure ecological community affecting many organisms ecosystem helping determine types numbers various species community without keystone species ecosystem would dramatically different cease exist altogether keystone species wolf also apex predators role keystone species plays ecosystem analogous role keystone arch keystone least pressure stones arch arch still collapses without similarly ecosystem may experience dramatic shift keystone species removed even though species small part ecosystem measures biomass productivity became popular concept conservation biology alongside flagship umbrella species although concept valued descriptor particularly strong interspecies interactions allowed easier communication ecologists conservation policymakers criticized oversimplifying complex ecological

activities damaged ecosystems removing keystone keystone species defined paine species disproportionately large effect environment relative defined operationally davic strongly interacting species whose topdown effect species diversity competition large relative biomass dominance within functional classic keystone species predator prevents particular herbivorous species eliminating dominant plant species prey numbers low keystone predators even less abundant still effective yet without predators herbivorous prey would explode numbers wipe dominant plants dramatically alter character ecosystem exact scenario changes example central idea remains chain interactions nonabundant species outsized impact ecosystem functions example herbivorous weevil euhrychiopsis lecontei thought keystone effects aquatic plant diversity foraging nuisance eurasian watermilfoil north american similarly wasp species agelaia vicina labeled keystone species unparalleled nest size colony size high

several species conservation concepts flagship species indicator species umbrella species example jaguar charismatic big cat meets jaguar umbrella species flagship species wilderness quality indicator

keystone subtropical tropical america sea otters protect kelp forests damage sea urchins sea otters north american west coast hunted commercially fur numbers fell low levels fewer north pacific ocean unable control sea urchin population urchins turn grazed holdfasts kelp heavily kelp forests largely disappeared along species depended reintroducing sea otters enabled kelp ecosystem restored example southeast alaska sea otters released bred form population approaching keystone predators may increase biodiversity communities preventing single species becoming dominant profound influence balance organisms particular ecosystem introduction removal keystone predator changes population density drastic cascading effects equilibrium many populations ecosystem example grazers grassland may prevent single dominant species taking elimination gray wolf greater yellowstone ecosystem profound impacts trophic without predation herbivores began overgraze many woody browse species affecting areas plant populations addition wolves often kept animals grazing riparian areas protected beavers food sources encroached upon removal wolves direct effect beaver populations habitat became grazing territory increased browsing willows conifers along blacktail creek due lack predation caused channel incision beavers helped slow water allowing soil stay place furthermore predation keeps hydrological features creeks streams normal working order wolves reintroduced beaver population whole riparian ecosystem recovered dramatically within described paine sea stars eg pisaster ochraceus may prey sea urchins mussels shellfish natural sea star removed ecosystem mussel population explodes uncontrollably driving recent onset sea star wasting disease around united states indirectly caused mussel populations dominate many intertidal habitats creatures need apex predators sea stars prey sharks rays sea anemones sea otters prey jaguar whose numbers central south america classified near threatened acts keystone predator widely varied diet helping balance mammalian jungle ecosystem consumption different species lion another keystone keystone mutualists organisms participate mutually beneficial interaction loss would profound impact upon ecosystem whole example avon wheatbelt region western australia period year banksia prionotes acorn banksia sole source nectar honeyeaters play important role pollination numerous plant species therefore loss one species tree would probably cause honeyeater population collapse profound implications entire ecosystem another example frugivores cassowary spreads seeds many different trees seeds grow unless term used alongside keystone ecosystem north america prairie dog ecosystem engineer prairie dog burrows provide nesting areas mountain plovers burrowing owls prairie dog tunnel systems also help channel rainwater water table prevent runoff erosion also serve change composition soil region increasing aeration reversing soil compaction

allows younger trees take place beaver dams alter riparian area established depending topography soils many factors dams change riparian edges streams rivers wetlands meadows riverine forests dams shown beneficial myriad species including amphibians salmon song african savanna larger herbivores especially elephants shape environment elephants destroy trees making room grass species creating

reef fish consistently scrape clean coral reef without animals great barrier reef would severe serengeti presence sufficient gnus grasslands reduces wildfire likelihood turn promotes tree growth documentary serengeti rules documents although concept keystone species value describing particularly strong interspecies interactions allowing easier communication ecologists conservation policymakers criticized l mills colleagues oversimplifying complex ecological systems term applied widely different ecosystems predators prey plants primary producers inevitably differing ecological meanings instance removing predator may allow animals increase point wipe species removing prey species may cause predator populations crash may allow predators drive prey species extinction removing plant species may result loss animals depend like pollinators seed dispersers beavers called keystone eating species modifying environment ways affected species term thus given quite different meanings different cases millss view paines work showed species could sometimes extremely strong interactions within particular ecosystem automatically imply ecosystems similar
