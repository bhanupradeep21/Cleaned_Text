kinesiology ancient greek κίνησις kínēsis movement λογία logía study scientific study human body movement kinesiology addresses physiological anatomical biomechanical pathological neuropsychological principles mechanisms movement applications kinesiology human health include biomechanics orthopedics strength conditioning sport psychology motor control skill acquisition motor learning methods rehabilitation physical occupational therapy sport exercise physiology studies human animal motion include measures motion tracking systems electrophysiology muscle brain activity various methods monitoring physiological function behavioral cognitive research kinesiology studies science human movement performance function applying fundamental sciences cell biology molecular biology chemistry

populations exercise simple established intervention many movement disorders musculoskeletal conditions due neuroplasticity adaptability musculoskeletal therapeutic exercise shown improve neuromotor control motor capabilities pathological many different types exercise interventions applied kinesiology athletic normal clinical populations aerobic exercise interventions help improve cardiovascular anaerobic strength training programs increase muscular lean body decreased risk falls increased neuromuscular control attributed balance intervention flexibility programs increase functional range motion reduce risk whole exercise programs reduce symptoms risk metabolic additionally help improve quality sleeping immune system body study physiological responses physical exercise therapeutic applications known exercise physiology important area research within kinesiology neuroplasticity also key scientific principle used kinesiology describe movement changes brain related human brain adapts acquires new motor skills based brain exposed new stimuli experiences therefore learn create new neural pathways hence leading brain adaptation new adaptations skills include adaptive maladaptive brain changes adaptive plasticity recent empirical evidence indicates significant impact physical activity brain function example greater amounts physical activity associated enhanced cognitive function older effects physical activity distributed throughout whole brain higher gray matter density white matter integrity exercise andor specific brain areas greater activation prefrontal cortex neuroplasticity also underlying mechanism skill acquisition example longterm training pianists showed greater gray matter density sensorimotor cortex white matter integrity internal capsule compared maladaptive plasticity maladaptive plasticity defined neuroplasticity negative effects detrimental consequences movement abnormalities may occur among individuals without brain injuries due abnormal remodeling central nervous learned nonuse example commonly seen among patients brain damage stroke patients stroke learned suppress paretic limb movement unsuccessful experience paretic hand use may cause decreased neuronal activation adjacent areas infarcted motor many types therapies designed overcome maladaptive plasticity clinic research constraintinduced movement therapy cimt body weight support treadmill training bwstt virtual reality therapy interventions shown enhance motor function paretic stimulate cortical patients brain damage motor redundancy widely used concept kinesiology motor control states task human body perform effectively unlimited number ways nervous system could achieve redundancy appears multiple levels chain motor execution concept motor redundancy explored numerous usually goal describing relative contribution set motor elements eg muscles various human movements contributions predicted comprehensive theory two distinct incompatible theories emerged nervous system coordinates redundant elements simplification optimization simplification theory complex movements muscle actions constructed simpler ones often known primitives synergies resulting simpler system brain optimization theory motor actions arise minimization control energetic cost movement errors movement canada kinesiology professional designation well area
