additional partial skeletons large number disarticulated skeletal elements found yang referred tsintaosaurus others named tanius chingkankouensis yang also tanius laiyangensis zhen exists latter two species today either considered junior synonyms nomina dubia later researchers would refer larger part material tsintaosaurus tsintaosaurus originally reconstructed unicornlike crest skull crest preserved consists forty centimetres long process protruding almost vertically top rear snout structure hollow seems forked upper end comparable structures related species unknown possess lobelike crests david b weishampel jack horner cast doubt presence crest suggesting actually broken nasal bone top snout distorted upward crushing fossil study suggested without distinctive crest distinguish tsintaosaurus actually synonym similar crestless hadrosaur tanius however éric buffetaut ea renewed investigation bones concluded crest neither distorted artefact restoration besides second specimen upright crest part since discovered indicating crest indeed real tsintaosaurus likely distinct new reconstruction albert prietomárquez jonathan wagner based identification specimen ivpp praemaxilla tsintaosaurus element came conclusion unicornlike bone rear part larger cranial crest started tip snout front crest would formed ascending processes praemaxillae expanded rhomboid contact facets expanded upper parts crest processes nasal bones forming rear crest rear base crest covered outgrowths prefrontals fused nasal bones would formed hollow tubular structure height crest would exceeded rear skull measured along quadrates though largely vertical crest directed slightly rear forward inclination holotype crest would result distortion new reconstruction prietomárquez wagner also led new hypothesis internal air passages crest yang assumed tubular hollowing preserved part holotype would served main intake air rejected prietomárquez wagner pointed tube closed lower end lambeosaurines general air passages located forward position bony nostrils completely enclosed praemaxillae assumed tsintaosaurus would standard lambeosaurine arrangement snout air inhaling entering skull paired pseudonares fake nostrils praemaxillae behind upper beak air would transported paired passages median processes praemaxillae top crest subsequently entering common median chamber within lobe rear chamber formed nasal bones probably homologous nasal cavity chamber divided two smaller cavities one front rear curved median processes praemaxillae forming hooks around passage cavities rear cavity air transported towards internal skull cavity although usually assumed single passage served purpose prietomárquez wagner saw indications form nasal paired downward passages inside lateral processes praemaxillae concluded entire airflow likely separated common medium chamber probably divided left right section cartilaginous conclusion tubular structure rear nasal bones air passage forced prietomárquez wagner find alternative explanation function suggested would served lessen weight crest tube combining relative strength low bone mass tsintaosaurus would differed derived lambeosaurines front extension frontal bone form bone sheet supporting apart crest prietomárquez wagner identified several distinctive traits autapomorphies tsintaosaurus rim upper beak rounded thick wider
