granulocytes cells innate immune system characterized presence specific granules granules distinguish various agranulocytes myeloblastic granulocytes polymorphonuclear varying shapes morphology nucleus segmented irregular often lobed three segments referred polymorphonuclear leukocytes pmn pml pmnl common terms polymorphonuclear granulocyte refers specifically neutrophil abundant granulocytes types eosinophils basophils mast cells varying morphology granulocytes produced via granulopoiesis bone marrow four types granulocytes full name polymorphonuclear except mast cells names derived staining characteristics example abundant granulocyte neutrophil granulocyte neutrally staining cytoplasmic granulescitation needed neutrophils normally found bloodstream abundant type phagocyte constituting total circulating white blood consisting two subpopulations neutrophilkillers neutrophilcagers one litre human blood contains five billion micrometres neutrophils received appropriate signals takes thirty minutes leave blood reach site neutrophils return blood turn pus cells mature neutrophils smaller monocytes segmented nucleus several sectionstwo five segments section connected chromatin filaments neutrophils normally exit bone marrow maturity infection neutrophil precursors called myelocytes promyelocytes neutrophils three strategies directly attacking microorganisms phagocytosis ingestion release soluble antimicrobials including granule proteins generation neutrophil extracellular traps neutrophils professional ferocious eaters rapidly engulf invaders coated antibodies complement well damaged cells cellular debris intracellular granules human neutrophil long recognized proteindestroying bactericidal neutrophils secrete products stimulate monocytes macrophages secretions increase phagocytosis formation reactive oxygen compounds involved intracellular neutrophils two types granules primary azurophilic granules found young cells secondary specific granules found mature cells primary granules contain cationic proteins defensins used kill bacteria proteolytic enzymes cathepsin g break bacterial proteins lysozyme break bacterial cell walls myeloperoxidase used generate toxic bacteriakilling addition secretions primary granules neutrophils stimulate phagocytosis igg antibodycoated secondary granules contain compounds involved formation toxic oxygen compounds lysozyme lactoferrin used take essential iron neutrophil extracellular traps nets comprise web fibers composed chromatin serine proteases trap kill microbes extracellularly trapping bacteria particularly important role nets sepsis net formed within blood eosinophils also kidneyshaped lobed nuclei two four lobes number granules eosinophil vary tendency degranulate blood eosinophils play crucial part killing parasites eg enteric nematodes granules contain unique toxic basic protein cationic protein eg receptors bind igg iga used help cells also limited ability participate professional antigenpresenting cells regulate immune cell functions eg cell dendritic cell b cell mast cell neutrophil basophil involved destruction tumor promote repair damaged polypeptide called interacts eosinophils causes grow differentiate polypeptide produced basophils thelper cells basophils one least abundant cells bone marrow blood occurring less two percent cells like neutrophils eosinophils lobed nuclei however two lobes chromatin filaments connect visible basophils receptors bind ige igg complement histamine cytoplasm basophils contains varied amount granules granules usually numerous enough partially conceal nucleus granule contents basophils abundant histamine heparin chondroitin sulfate peroxidase plateletactivating factor substances infection occurs mature basophils released bone marrow travel site basophils injured release histamine contributes inflammatory response helps fight invading organisms histamine causes dilation increased permeability capillaries close basophil injured basophils leukocytes release another substance called prostaglandins contributes increased blood flow site infection mechanisms allow bloodclotting elements delivered infected area begins recovery process blocks travel microbes parts body increased permeability inflamed tissue also allows phagocyte migration site infection consume mast cells type granulocyte present mediate host defense pathogens eg parasites allergic reactions particularly mast cells also involved mediating inflammation autoimmunity well mediating regulating neuroimmune system granulocytes derived stem cells residing bone marrow differentiation stem cells multipotent hematopoietic stem cell granulocytes termed granulopoiesis multiple intermediate cell types exist differentiation process including myeloblasts promyelocytes examples toxic materials produced released degranulation granulocytes ingestion microorganisms granulocytopenia abnormally low concentration granulocytes blood condition reduces bodys resistance many infections closely related terms include agranulocytosis etymologically granulocytes clinically granulocyte levels less normal neutropenia deficiency neutrophil granulocytes granulocytes live one two days circulation four days spleen tissue transfusion granulocytes therapeutic strategy would confer shortlasting benefit addition many complications associated procedure usually granulocyte chemotactic defect individuals suffering type diabetes mellitus research suggests giving granulocyte transfusions prevent infections decreased number people bacterial fungal infection research suggests participants receiving therapeutic granulocyte transfusions show difference clinical reversal concurrent hematopoiesis
