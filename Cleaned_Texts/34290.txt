dravet syndrome ds previously known severe myoclonic epilepsy infancy smei autosomal dominant genetic disorder causes catastrophic form epilepsy prolonged seizures often triggered hot temperatures difficult treat anticonvulsant medications often begins one year six months age seizures prolonged convulsions triggered fever usually seizures common form ds diagnosed clinically genetic testing recommended due drugrefractory epilepsy ds many therapies explored prolong life expectancy dravet syndrome characterized prolonged febrile nonfebrile seizures within first year childs life disease
