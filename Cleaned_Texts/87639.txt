anticonvulsants also known antiepileptic drugs antiseizure drugs diverse group pharmacological agents used treatment epileptic anticonvulsants also increasingly used treatment bipolar borderline personality since many seem act mood stabilizers treatment neuropathic anticonvulsants suppress excessive rapid firing neurons anticonvulsants also prevent spread seizure within conventional antiepileptic drugs may block sodium channels enhance Î³aminobutyric acid gaba function several antiepileptic drugs multiple uncertain mechanisms next voltagegated sodium channels components gaba system targets include gabaa receptors gaba transporter gaba additional targets include voltagegated calcium channels blocking sodium calcium channels antiepileptic drugs reduce release excitatory glutamate whose release considered elevated epilepsy also probably side effect even actual mechanism action antiepileptic drugs since gaba directly indirectly act another potential target
