cognitive bias modification cbm refers procedures used psychology aim directly change biases cognitive processes biased attention toward threat vs benign stimuli biased interpretation ambiguous stimuli procedures designed modify information processing via cognitive tasks use basic learning principles repeated practice encourage healthier thinking style line training contingency cbm research emerged investigators used techniques assess attention bias manipulation attention allowed tests causal relationship cognitive biases emotional states eg selectively attending threatening information cause greater anxiety time cbm paradigms developed modify biases areas information processing including interpretation memory motivation eg behaviors attributional style early success procedures inducing change bias led researchers see potential benefit cbm intervention emotional behavioral disorders given maladaptive cognitive processes implicated models emotional vulnerability dysfunction targeted cbm considerable interest theoretical applied importance techniques many recent studies cbm targeted cognitive biases people anxiety depressive research effectiveness cbm shifting attention interpretation biases indicated promising evidence adult populations though also null additionally cbm reduce anxiety symptoms stress vulnerability cases though effects mixed also evidence cbm effectiveness depression symptomatology researchers pointed practical benefits offered cbm scalability ease dissemination potential augmentation effects cognitivebehavioral therapy research cbm needed however evidence longterm effects less clear including two common features used majority cbm first cognitive bias targeted change represents pattern selective information processing known characterize psychopathology example individuals anxiety disorders characterized automatic tendency attend toward threat paying less attention neutral stimuli second cognitive bias altered manner involve instructing individual intentionally change informationprocessing selectivity rather change cognitive bias induced introducing contingency designed successful task performance enhanced adoption new pattern responding two common types cbm target attention interpretation another type cbm training targets motivation biases associated approach avoidance behaviors cognitive bias modification attention cbma attention bias modification abm cognitive tasks typically designed draw attention neutral positive stimuli avoid negative threatening cognitive tasks utilized abm originally designed assessment attentional bias later adapted training common paradigms manipulate visual attention include spatial cueing task visual search task addition visual probe task typical visual probe trial central fixation cross presented followed brief appearance threat nonthreat cue face angry expression face neutral one cues replaced probe small dot letter arrow aim respond quickly possible identify probe buttonpress response example indicate letter shown direction arrow presented probe occur routinely location neutral rather negative threatening face appeared individual learns though practice attending neutral stimulus enhance performance task faster identify probe logic guiding training task follows assessment version task probe appears equally randomly following neutral threat stimuli case attention bias threat inferred response times individual bias direct attention spatial location threat stimuli reflected faster response times probes appear location threat cues threatcongruent trials nonthreat cues threatincongruent trials conversely individual bias direct attention away threat stimuli reflected slower response times probes replacing threat nonthreat cues cognitive bias modification interpretation cbmi interpretation bias modification ibm involves cognitive tasks disambiguate otherwise ambiguous sentence paragraph picture either positively negatively interpretation bias tasks typically aim increase extent individuals interpret ambiguous situations benign ways encourage flexible thinking less rigidly negative ambiguous situations paradigm one commonlyused protocols used manipulate interpretation bias task individuals typically presented short paragraphs describing ambiguous emotional resolution paragraph revealed end example ask friend look work done wonder think youve written comes back comments positie word fragment italics resolution often features word fragment individual asked solve repeatedly practicing assigning nonthreatening meanings ambiguous situations individual thought learn uncertainty likely resolved benign rather negative way resolution ambiguity typically reinforced brief question following word fragment completion requires individual respond way matches situations ending determined word fragment see whether ambiguous situations paradigm successful modifying interpretation bias recognition task consists series ambiguous scenarios typically used outcome task scenarios remain ambiguous even solving word example ask friend look work done wonder think youve written comes back comments thurday word fragment italics second part recognition task titles ambiguous scenarios displayed together four sentences per scenario reflect different ways understanding occurred scenario werent actually stated sentences represent possible positive interpretation tied key emotional meaning scenario b possible negative interpretation tied key emotional meaning scenario c positive sentence tied key emotional meaning scenario negative sentence tied key emotional meaning scenario individuals rate sentence similarity meaning original scenario higher similarity ratings positive vs negative interpretation tied key emotional meaning scenario thought reflect positive interpretation training involves cognitive tasks designed induce approach avoidance behaviors towards specific stimuli task commonly used training protocol individuals shown images certain distinguishing feature computer screen react fast possible using example images tilted left pulled become larger images tilted right pushed away shrink size zooming effect creates visual impression pictures coming closer upon pulling joystick move away upon pushing training involves selectively inducing avoidance one type stimulus andor approach example training avoidance behavior alcoholrelated stimuli individuals alcohol use disorder repeatedly practicing pushing joystick alcohol stimuli appear pulling joystick comparison stimuli training approach behavior spider stimuli individuals arachnophobia repeatedly practicing pulling joystick spider pictures appear pushing joystick comparison see whether training paradigm successful modifying bias reaction time participants instructed push away target stimuli eg alcohol spider cues compared participants instructed push away comparison stimuli contrasted along analogous contrast pulling target vs comparison stimuli one concern whether cbm modification procedures reliably change symptoms achieve lasting benefits yet clear metaanalysis trials looking outcomes anxiety depression casts doubt
