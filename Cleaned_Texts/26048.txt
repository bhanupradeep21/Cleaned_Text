bladder stones uroliths common occurrence animals especially domestic animals dogs occurrence species including reported well stones form urinary bladder varying size numbers secondary infection dietary influences genetics stones form part urinary tract dogs cats unlike humans stones kidney less common often cause significant disease although contribute pyelonephritis chronic kidney disease types stones include struvite calcium oxalate urate cystine calcium phosphate silicate struvite calcium oxalate stones far common bladder stones bladder crystals crystals coalesce unchecked bladder become stones bladder stones may cause blood urine animalin hematuria sometimes may signs painful urination straining urinate signs urinary tract infections commonly associated bladder stones smaller stones may become lodged urethra especially male animals causing urinary tract obstruction inability urinate condition causes acute kidney failure hyperkalemia sepsis death within days oversaturation urine crystals far biggest factor stone formation dogs oversaturation caused increased excretion crystals kidneys water reabsorption renal tubules resulting concentration urine changes urine ph influence crystallization contributing factors include diet frequency urination genetics current medications presence urinary tract infection stones form around nidus consist white blood cells bacteria organic matrix mixed crystals crystals alone nidus makes two ten percent mass possible nidus made different type crystal rest stone also known epitaxial growth nutrition often plays major role development bladder stones sodium calcium phosphorus potassium ratios quantities play large role urinary health animals research indicates low dietary inclusion potassium associated increased renal calcium excretion lowers urinary ph lowering urinary ph risk development calcium oxalate uroliths increases feeding proper amounts calcium potassium avoid issue especially common male symptoms indicate bladder stones first step usually take xray types stones appear readily xray urate occasionally cystine stones common exceptions stones smaller three millimeters may ultrasonography also useful identifying bladder stones crystals identified urinalysis may help identify stones analysis stones necessary identification complete chemical composition struvite stones also known magnesium ammonium phosphate stones due chemical composition often small amount calcium phosphate form neutral alkaline ph urine bacterial infections contribute formation increasing ph urine urease enzyme dogs

increased magnesium diet decreased acidity urine help promote struvite crystal urethral plugs cats usually composed struvite crystals organic urate stones usually ammonium urate sodium urate monohydrate form acidic neutral urine usually small yellowbrown smooth stones urate stones form due increased excretion uric acid urine dalmatians especially lesser extent bulldogs genetically

portosystemic shunts endstage liver disease also increased uric acid excretion urine due reduced conversion uric acid allantoin ammonia urea urate stones make six percent stones urate stones dissolved using diet reduced purines alkalinizes dilutes urine allopurinol used dogs altered purine metabolism prevent formation uric acid feeding diet high purines simultaneously administering allopurinol
