félix dhérelle april february french microbiologist codiscoverer bacteriophages viruses infect bacteria experimented possibility phage dhérelle also credited contributions larger concept applied dhérelle selftaught microbiologist discovered invisible antagonist added bacteria agar would produce areas dead bacteria antagonist known bacteriophage could pass chamberland filter accurately diluted suspension viruses discovered highest dilutions lowest virus concentrations rather killing bacteria formed discrete areas dead organisms counting areas multiplying dilution factor allowed calculate number viruses original realised discovered new form virus later coined term dherelle discovered different types bacteriophages could infect several species bacteria including vibrio bacteriophages heralded potential treatment diseases typhoid cholera promise forgotten development penicillin since early bacteria continued develop resistance antibiotics penicillin led renewed interest use bacteriophages treat serious félix dhérelles place birth debated current research concluded born félix dhérelles father hubert augustin félix haerens died age félix six years old years age dhérelle attended school paris including lycée condorcet lycée louislegrand high schools fall dhérelle traveled bonn germany attended lectures university bonn several months ages dhérelle traveled extensively via money given mother started travel western europe bike finishing school traveled south america afterwards continued travels europe including turkey met wife marie caire father daughter dhérelle family moved canada built home laboratory studied microbiology books experiments influence friend late father earned commission canadian government study fermentation distillation maple syrup schnapps fathers friend pointed pasteur made good beginning studying fermentations might interesting toocitation needed also worked medic geological expedition even though medical degree real experience together brother invested almost money chocolate factory soon went period dherelle published first scientific paper de la formation du carbone par les végétaux may issue le naturaliste canadien dhérelle contended paper results experiments indicated carbon compound money almost gone second daughter born took contract government guatemala bacteriologist general hospital guatemala city work included organizing defenses dread diseases time malaria yellow fever also studied local fungal infection coffee plants discovered acidifying soil could serve effective treatment side job asked find way make whiskey bananas life rough dangerous environment country hard family dhérelle always adventurer heart rather enjoyed working close real life compared sterile environments civilized clinic later stated scientific path began occasion took offer mexican government continue studies fermentation family moved sisal plantation near mérida yucatán disease struck family successfully established method produce sisal schnapps machines mass production sisal schnapps ordered paris oversaw machines construction meanwhile spare time worked free laboratory pasteur institute soon offered job running new mexican plant declined considering boring however take time attempt stopping locust plague plantation using diseases extracted bacteria pathogenic locusts guts innovative approach locust plagues anticipated modern biological pest control using bacillus thuringiensis also known bt dhérelle family finally moved paris early worked unpaid assistant lab pasteur institute got attention scientific community year results successful attempt counter mexican locust plague coccobacillus end year restless dhérelle road time argentina offered chance test results much larger scale thus fought argentinian locust plagues coccobacillus experiments even though argentina claimed success inconsistent declared full success subsequently invited countries demonstrate method world war dhérelle assistants wife daughters among produced million doses medication allied military point history medical treatments primitive compared todays standards smallpox vaccine developed edward jenner one vaccines available primary antibiotic arsenicbased salvarsan syphilis severe side effects common treatments based mercury strychnine cocaine result average life span years world war change better british bacteriologist frederick w twort discovered small agent infects kills bacteria pursue issue independently discovery invisible antagonistic microbe dysentery bacillus dhérelle announced september isolation phages dherelle works like early dhérelle isolated phages chicken feces successfully treating plague chicken typhoid successful experiment chicken felt ready first trial humans first patient healed dysentery using phage therapy august many followed time none even dhérelle knew exactly phage dhérelle claimed biological organism reproduces somehow feeding bacteria others nobelist jules bordet chief among theorized phages inanimate chemicals enzymes specifically already present bacteria trigger release similar proteins killing bacteria process due uncertainty dhérelle using phages without much hesitation humans work constant attack many scientists first phage observed electron microscope helmut ruska true nature established dhérelle travelled indochina pursuing studies cholera plague returned end year dhérelle officially still unpaid assistant found without lab dhérelle later claimed result quarrel assistant director pasteur institute albert calmette biologist edouard pozerski mercy dhérelle lent stool literally laboratory managed publish monograph bacteriophage role immunity works official institute publication tricking calmette following year doctors scientists across western europe took heightened interest phage therapy successfully testing variety diseases since bacteria become resistant single phage dherelle suggested using phage cocktails containing different phage strains phage therapy soon became boom great hope medicine january dhérelle received honorary doctorate university well leeuwenhoek medal awarded every ten years latter especially important idol louis pasteur received medal next year nominated eight times nobel prize though never awarded holding temporary position university leiden dhérelle got position conseil sanitaire maritime et quarantenaire degypte alexandria conseil put place prevent plague cholera spreading europe special emphasis sanitary concerns muslim pilgrim groups returning mecca medina dhérelle used phages collected plagueinfected rats visit indochina human plague patients claimed success british empire initiated vast campaign plague based results british government india requested antiplague phages trials haffkine institute institute trouble maintaining phages dhérelle took unpaid leave quarantine board egypt went bombay expense haffkine institute used martins medium included macerated pig stomach beef muscle would offend muslims hindus institute medium used hydrochloric acid digest goat tissue dherelle solved problem digestion papaya juice source papain thereafter lt col j morison acting director haffkine institute became convinced effectiveness phages morison wrote government india invite dhérelle noting consummate technician inspiring worker dhérelle returned india work cholera collaborated assistant director haffkine institute major reginald malone mn lahiri conducted experiments campbell hospital calcutta campbell hospial team also worked russian bacteriologist igor nicholas asheshov working patna experiments conducted hospitals field dhérelle coworkers added phages wells near camps crowded many pilgrims cases cholera camps subsequently much lower phages distributed village head men assam bengal along instructions however period gandhis satyagraha leading noncooperation indians many head men collaborate fewer still reported back effectiveness result experiment disbanded dhérelle refused request following year british government work india offered professorship yale university accepted meanwhile european us pharmaceutical companies taken production phage medicine promising impossible benefits counteract trend dherelle agreed cofound french phageproducing company piping money back phage research companies suffered production problems results commercial phage medicine erratic production problems likely due attempt massproduce phages barely understood phages may damaged andor low concentration another possibility incorrect diagnoses led use irrelevant types phages adapted host bacteria interest many studies proposed healing effects phages also poorly designed conducted situation led many influential members scientific community turning dhérelle problems may compounded dhérelle reputed bad temper said made enemies several scientists hérelle went tbilisi georgia welcomed soviet union hero bringing knowledge salvation diseases ravaging eastern states even awarded honorary doctorate tbilisi state university hérelle may accepted stalins invitation two reasons firstly said enamored communism secondly hérelle happy working friend professor george eliava founder tbilisi institute eliava become friendly dherelle visit pasteur institute paris used occasion learn phages dhérelle worked tbilisi institute year even dedicated one books comrade stalin bacteriophage phenomenon recovery written published tbilisi indeed hérelle may planned take permanent residence tbilisi started build cottage grounds institute building would later house georgian headquarters fortunes turned abruptly hérelle eliava fell love woman lavrenty beria head secret police eliava executed denounced enemy people one stalins purges result dhérelle fled tbilisi never return book banned distribution georgian period dhérelles career investigated author medical scientist david shrayerpetrov phage therapy boomed despite problems driven military sides effort keep troops safe least infections dhérelle could really enjoy development kept house arrest german wehrmacht vichy france used time write book value
