molar pregnancy also known hydatidiform mole abnormal form pregnancy nonviable fertilized egg implants uterus falls category gestational trophoblastic molar pregnancy uterus contains growing mass characterized swollen chorionic villi resembling clusters occurrence molar pregnancy attributed fertilized egg lacking original maternal nucleus result products conception may may contain fetal tissue molar pregnancies categorized two types partial moles complete moles term mole simply denotes clump growing tissue growth complete mole caused either single sperm time two sperm time combining egg lost dna former case sperm reduplicates leading formation complete typically genotype diploid due subsequent mitosis fertilizing sperm also however diploid observed hand partial mole occurs normal egg fertilized one two sperm reduplicates resulting genotypes triploid complete moles carry risk western countries developing choriocarcinoma higher risk eastern countries additional risk becoming invasive mole contrast incomplete moles become invasive well associated notably complete hydatidiform moles account cases choriocarcinoma molar pregnancies relatively rare complications pregnancy occurring approximately pregnancies united states asia rates considerably higher reaching pregnancies countries like molar pregnancies usually present painless vaginal bleeding fourth fifth months uterus may larger expected ovaries may enlarged may also vomiting would expected hyperemesis sometimes increase blood pressure along protein urine blood tests show high levels human chorionic gonadotropin cause condition completely understood potential risk factors may include defects egg abnormalities within uterus nutritional deficiencies women years age higher risk risk factors include diets low protein folic acid diploid set spermonly dna means chromosomes spermpatterned methylation suppression genes leads overgrowth syncytiotrophoblast whereas dual eggpatterned methylation leads devotion resources embryo underdeveloped syncytiotrophoblast considered result evolutionary competition male genes driving high investment fetus versus female genes driving resource restriction maximise number hydatidiform mole pregnancyconceptus placenta contains grapelike vesicles small sacs usually visible naked eye vesicles arise distention chorionic villi fluid inspected microscope hyperplasia trophoblastic tissue noted left untreated hydatidiform mole almost always end spontaneous abortion miscarriage based morphology hydatidiform moles divided two types complete moles chorionic villi vesicular sign embryonic fetal development present partial moles villi vesicular whereas others appear normal embryonicfetal development may seen fetus always malformed never viable rare cases hydatidiform mole coexists uterus normal viable fetus cases due twinning uterus contains products two conceptions one abnormal placenta viable fetus mole one normal placenta viable fetus careful surveillance often possible woman give birth normal child cured complete moles nuclear genes inherited father androgenesis approximately androgenetic moles probable mechanism egg empty nucleus nucleus fertilized single sperm followed duplication chromosomesgenes process called endoreduplication approximately complete moles probable mechanism empty egg fertilized two sperm cases moles diploid ie two copies every chromosome cases mitochondrial genes inherited mother usual partial moles triploid three chromosome sets nucleus contains one maternal set genes two paternal sets mechanism usually reduplication paternal haploid set single sperm may also consequence dispermic two sperm fertilization rare cases hydatidiform moles tetraploid four chromosome sets chromosome abnormalities small percentage hydatidiform moles biparental diploid genomes normal living persons two sets chromosomes one inherited biological parent moles occur women carry mutations gene predisposing towards molar pregnancy rare variants hydatidiform mole may complete diagnosis strongly suggested ultrasound sonogram definitive diagnosis requires histopathological examination ultrasound mole resembles bunch grapes cluster grapes honeycombed uterus increased trophoblast proliferation enlarging chorionic villi angiogenesis trophoblasts sometimes symptoms hyperthyroidism seen due extremely high levels hcg mimic effects thyroidstimulating hydatidiform moles treated evacuating uterus uterine suction surgical curettage soon possible diagnosis order avoid risks patients followed serum human chorionic gonadotrophin hcg level fallen undetectable level invasive metastatic moles cancer may require chemotherapy often respond well methotrexate contain paternal antigens response treatment nearly patients advised conceive half year hcg levels normalized chances another molar pregnancy approximately management complicated mole occurs together one normal fetuses women growth develop gestational trophoblastic neoplasia women complete hydatidiform mole high risk progression evidence suggests giving prophylactic chemotherapy known pchem may reduce risk however pchem may also increase toxic side effects research needed explore uterine curettage generally done effect anesthesia preferably spinal anesthesia hemodynamically stable patients advantages spinal anesthesia general anesthesia include ease technique favorable effects pulmonary system safety patients hyperthyroidism nontocolytic pharmacological properties additionally maintaining patients consciousness one diagnose complications like uterine perforation cardiopulmonary distress thyroid storm earlier stage patient sedated general hydatidiform moles benign outcome treatment usually excellent close followup essential ensure treatment highly effective means contraception recommended avoid pregnancy least months women prior partial complete mole slightly increased risk second hydatidiform mole subsequent pregnancy meaning future pregnancy require earlier ultrasound cases hydatidiform moles may develop invasive moles condition named persistent trophoblastic disease ptd moles may intrude far uterine wall hemorrhage complications develop reason postoperative full abdominal chest xray often requested cases hydatidiform moles may develop choriocarcinoma malignant rapidly growing metastatic spreading form cancer despite factors normally indicate poor prognosis rate cure treatment chemotherapy high women malignant nonspreading cancer able survive retain ability conceive bear children metastatic spreading cancer remission remains although childbearing ability usually lost hydatidiform moles rare complication pregnancy occurring every pregnancies us much higher rates asia eg one pregnancies etymology
