method dfa construction recognized later consolidation two algorithms algorithms described alfred v aho margaret j working uc berkeley december gish sped fastp program later known william r pearson david j lipman without altering results performance modifications communicated pearson lipman gish suggested dfa rather lookup table would yield faster ktuple identification improve overall speed program perhaps much cases however marginal improvement even best case deemed authors worth added code complexity gish also envisioned time centralized search service wherein nucleotide sequences genbank would maintained memory eliminate io stored compressed form conserve clients invoking fastn searches remotely via internet gishs earliest contributions blast made working ncbi starting july even early prototypes blast typically much faster fasta gish recognized potential added benefit application using dfa wordhit recognition morphed earlier dfa code flexible form incorporated blast search modes others contributions blast include use compressed nucleotide sequences efficient storage format rapid native search format parallel processing memorymapped io use sentinel bytes sentinel

algorithm used ncbi software many years gish added support wublast extended database format xdf first blast database format capable accurately representing entire draft sequence human genome fulllength chromosome sequence objects also first time blast package introduced new database format transparently existing users without abandoning support prior formats result abstracting database io
