allodaposuchus extinct genus crocodyliforms lived southern europe campanian maastrichtian stages late cretaceous although generally classified noncrocodylian eusuchian crocodylomorph sometimes placed one earliest true crocodylians allodaposuchus one common late cretaceous crocodylomorphs europe fossils known romania spain france like many cretaceous crocodylomorphs allodaposuchus relatively small body size compared living crocodylians largest known specimen allodaposuchus belongs individual probably around metres ft although shape varies species general allodaposuchus short flattened rounded

allodaposuchus currently identified allodaposuchus study published suggested fossils belong several different genera crocodylomorphs original romanian material fragmentary assign genus making
