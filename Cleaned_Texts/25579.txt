countersurveillance refers measures usually undertaken public prevent including covert surveillance countersurveillance may include electronic methods technical surveillance countermeasures process detecting surveillance devices also include covert listening devices visual surveillance devices countersurveillance software thwart unwanted cybercrime accessing computing mobile devices various nefarious reasons eg theft financial personal corporate data often countersurveillance employ set actions countermeasures followed reduce risk surveillance countersurveillance different sousveillance inverse surveillance latter necessarily aim prevent reduce surveillance bugs emit form electromagnetic radiation usually radio waves standard countermeasure bugs therefore sweep receiver looking radio emissions professional sweeping devices expensive lowtech sweeping devices available amateur electrical magazines may built circuit designs internet sweeping foolproof advanced bugs remotely operated switch may even rapidly switch frequencies according predetermined pattern order make location sweepers difficult bug run power may show sweep means sweeper alerted surveillance also devices active parts example great seal given us ambassador moscow hid device thing amidst concerns privacy software emerged prevent cyberintrusion unauthorized act spying snooping stealing personally identifiable information proprietary assets eg images cyberspace popular interest countersurveillance growing given media coverage privacy surveillance countersurveillance involves human methods rather electronic methods since people generally vulnerable capable reacting creatively surveillance situations human countermeasures include activities make harder track surveillance subjects following steady
