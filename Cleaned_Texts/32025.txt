reabsorption water osmotic gradient intestines cells occupying intestinal lining pump sodium ions intercellular space raising osmolarity intercellular fluid hypertonic fluid creates osmotic pressure drives water lateral intercellular spaces osmosis via tight junctions adjacent cells turn moves across basement membrane capillaries sodium ions pumped intercellular although water travels osmotic gradient individual step overall water usually travels osmotic gradient due pumping sodium ions intercellular fluid allows large intestine absorb water despite blood capillaries hypotonic compared
