rod frame test psychophysical method testing perception relies use rod frame apparatus uses rotating rod set inside individually rotatable drum allowing experimenter vary participants frame reference thus test perception vertical rod frame illusion occurs effect orientation frame rod simplest example rod frame illusion illusion cause participant perceive rod oriented congruent orientation participant viewing rod frame positioned degrees vertical perceives rod vertical perfect accuracy however frame tilted away vertical participants perception vertical affected participant tends perceive rod tilted direction frame oriented eg frame tilted counterclockwise direction rod also perceived tilted counterclockwise tilt frame increases participants perceived vertical increasingly deviates true vertical perform rod frame task apparatus consisting rod square frame used example commercial apparatus seen picture participant tested using apparatus head fastened firmly chin rest prevent participant collecting visual cues outside apparatus rod frame shown center far end apparatus provides frame reference participant participant experimenter able adjust orientation rod experimenter adjust frame orientation using appropriate knobs apparatus seen picture experimenter able see exact degree measurement rod frame vertical participant sees physical rod frame inside apparatus methods constant stimuli limits adjustment used test participants method limits commonly used research conducted using rod frame using method limits experimenter sets orientation rod frame separately participant asked adjust rod orientation perceive vertical deviation true vertical determined based way frame tilted rod viewed either tilted direction frame direct effect opposite direction frame indirect effect frame reference respect studies visual system refers perceived reference axes rod frame illusion number things influence ones frame reference past research found one reason people experience rod frame illusion due visualvestibular instance participant viewing rod frame task physically tilted participant acts though tilted opposite orientation frame suggests illusion part due person compensating perceived vertical direction opposite frame evidence proposed researchers consistent participants put sides view rod frame task rely vision vestibular proprioceptive senses incongruent visual findings suggest rod frame illusion processed type hierarchy visual input top vestibular cues finally proprioceptive cues lipshits found along hierarchy processing proprioceptive information opposed gravity used body determine way lipshits says able use vision determine way vertical use cues based axis head body httpsenwikipediaorgwikirodandframetest
