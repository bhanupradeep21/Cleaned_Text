peripheral nervous system discovery study pepsin discovery organic nature invention term theodor schwann born neuss december leonard schwann elisabeth leonard schwann goldsmith later printer theodor schwann studied dreikönigsgymnasium also known tricoronatum three kings school jesuit school schwann devout roman catholic cologne religious instructor wilhelm smets de priest novelist emphasized individuality human soul importance free schwann enrolled university bonn premedical curriculum received bachelor philosophy bonn schwann met worked physiologist johannes peter müller considered founded scientific medicine germany publishing handbuch der physiologie des menschen für vorlesungen translated english elements physiology became leading physiology textbook schwann moved university würzburg clinical training went university berlin müller professor anatomy schwann graduated md degree medicine university berlin thesis work müller advisor schwanns thesis involved careful study necessity oxygen embryonic development chicken carry designed built apparatus enabled pump gases oxygen hydrogen incubation chamber specific times enabled establish critical period eggs needed schwann passed state examination practice medicine summer chose continue work müller research rather practicing could afford least short term family salary assistant taler next five years schwann would pay threequarters expenses inheritance longterm strategy schwann worked assistant müller anatomischzootomische museum university schwann carried series microscopic physiological experiments focused studying structure function nerves muscles blood addition performing experiments preparation müllers book physiology schwann research many important contributions made time worked müller schwann used newly powerful microscopes examine animal tissues enabled observe animal cells note different properties work complemented matthias jakob schleiden plants informed two close described quiet serious schwann particularly gifted construction use apparatus experiments also able identify important scientific questions design experiments systematically test writing described accessible logic clear identified question wanted answer communicated importance findings effectively others coworker jakob henle spoke inborn drive schwann needed position substantial salary hoped return bonn catholic city attempted gain professorship instead schwann accepted chair anatomy université catholique de louvain leuven belgium another catholic schwann proved dedicated conscientious professor new teaching duties less time new scientific work spent considerable time perfecting experimental techniques instruments use experiments produced papers one exception paper reported series experiments dogs established importance bile examining processes muscle contraction fermentation digestion putrefaction schwann sought show living phenomena result physical causes rather immaterial vital nonetheless still sought reconcile organic nature divine writers suggested schwanns move decreased scientific productivity reflect religious concerns perhaps even crisis relating theoretical implications work cell however authors regard misrepresenting thinking reject idea schwann went existential crisis mystical ohad parnes uses schwanns laboratory notebooks unpublished sources along publications reconstruct research unified florence vienne draws unpublished writings discuss ways cell theory unifying principle organic development related philosophical religious political ideas various proponents including schwanns compatriot antoine frédéric spring convinced transfer university liège also liège schwann continued follow latest advances anatomy physiology make major new discoveries became something inventor one projects portable respirator designed closed system support human life environments surroundings serving professor physiology general anatomy embryology american philosophical society elected international ceased teach general anatomy embryology retired fully schwann deeply respected peers festival held celebrate years teaching many contributions presented unique gift book containing autographed photographic portraits scientists various countries sent scientist part gift schwann volume dedicated creator cell theory contemporary three years retiring schwann died cologne january buried family tomb colognes melaten viewed context unpublished writings laboratory notes schwanns research seen coherent systematic research programme biological processes described terms material objects agents causal dependencies forces exert measurable effects schwanns idea cell fundamental active unit seen foundational development microbiology rigorously lawful schwanns earliest work involved muscle contraction saw starting point introduction calculation developed described experimental method calculate contraction force muscle controlling measuring variables measurement technique developed used later emil du boisreymond schwanns notes suggest hoped discover regularities laws physiological relatively little known digestive processes william prout reported digestive juices animals contained hydrochloric acid schwann realized substances digestive juices might also help break beginning schwann began study digestive processes conceptualized digestion action physiological agent though immediately visible measurable could characterized experimentally peculiar specific eventually schwann found enzyme pepsin successfully isolated stomach lining named schwann coined name greek word πέψις pepsis meaning digestion πέπτειν peptein pepsin first enzyme isolated animal demonstrated could break albumin eggwhite even importantly schwann wrote carrying analyses one could eventually explain whole developmental process life organized next year studied decomposition respiration constructing apparatus would later adapt study next schwann studied yeast fermentation work yeast independent work done charles cagniard de la tour friedrich traugott kützing published work schwann carried numerous experiments alcohol powerful microscopes made possible observe yeast cells detail recognize tiny organisms whose structures resembled schwann went beyond others simply noted multiplication yeast alcoholic fermentation first assigning yeast role primary causal factor claiming alive schwann used microscope carry carefully planned series experiments contraindicated two popular theories fermentation yeast first controlled temperature fluid fermenting beer closed vessel presence oxygen heated liquid could longer ferment disproved joseph louis gaylussacs speculation oxygen caused fermentation suggested sort microorganism necessary process happen next schwann tested effects purified air unpurified sterilized air passing heated glass fermentation occur presence purified air occur presence unpurified air suggesting something air started process strong evidence theory spontaneous generation idea living organisms could develop nonliving schwann demonstrated fermentation required presence yeasts start stopped yeasts stopped concluded sugar converted alcohol part organic biological process based action living substance yeast demonstrated fermentation inorganic chemical process like sugar living yeast necessary reaction would produce although schwann correct ideas ahead strongly opposed justus von liebig friedrich wöhler saw emphasis importance living organism supporting vitalism liebig contrast saw fermentation series purely chemical events without involving living ironically schwanns work later seen first step away schwann first müllers pupils work towards physicochemical explanation schwanns view furthered conceptualization living things terms biological reactions organic chemistry liebig sought reduce biological reactions purely inorganic value schwanns work fermentation eventually would recognized louis pasteur ten years pasteur would begin fermentation research repeating confirming schwanns work accepting yeast alive taking fermentation research pasteur schwann would challenge liebigs views retrospect germ theory pasteur well antiseptic applications lister traced schwanns matthias jakob schleiden viewed stated new plant cells formed nuclei old plant cells dining schwann one day conversation turned nuclei plant animal cells schwann remembered seeing similar structures cells notochord shown müller instantly realized importance connecting two phenomena resemblance confirmed without delay observers experiments schwann examined notochordal tissue cartilage toad larvae well tissues pig embryos establishing animal tissues composed cells schwann published observations neue notisen geb followed publication book mikroskopische untersuchungen über die uebereinstimmung der struktur und dem wachsthum der thiere und pflanzen microscopic investigations similarity structure growth animals plants considered landmark foundational modern schwann declared living things composed cells cell drew three conclusions cells formed cell theory cell doctrine first two correct tenets accepted basis cell theory used describe elementary anatomical composition plants schwanns theory observations created foundation modern schwann claimed one universal principle development elementary parts organisms however different principle formation schwann supported claim examining adult animal tissues showing tissues could classified terms five types highly differentiated cellular observation singlecelled ovum eventually becomes complete organism established one basic principles schwanns third tenet speculating formation cells later disproven schwann hypothesized living cells formed ways similar formation crystals biologists would eventually accept view pathologist rudolf virchow popularized maxim omnis cellula e every cell arises another epigram originally put forth françoisvincent raspail raspails writings unpopular partly due republican sentiments evidence suggest schwann raspail aware others schwann particularly interested nervous muscular tissues part efforts classify bodily tissues terms cellular nature discovered cells envelope nerve fibers called schwann cells fatty myelin sheaths peripheral nerves formed matter debate could answered electron microscope axons peripheral nervous system known wrapped schwann cells mechanisms continue schwann also discovered muscle tissue upper esophagus speculated muscular nature esophagus enabled act pipe moving food mouth examining teeth schwann first notice cylindrical cells connected inner surface enamel pulp also identified fibrils dentinal tubes later became known tomess fibers speculated possible structural functional significance tubes microscopical researches schwann introduced term metabolism first used german adjectival form metabolische describe chemical action cells french texts began use le
