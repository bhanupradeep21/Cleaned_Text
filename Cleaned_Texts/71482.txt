number gut acarbose cheap popular china us one physician explains use us limited potent enough justify side effects diarrhea however large study concluded acarbose effective safe well tolerated large cohort asian patients type possible explanation differing opinions observation acarbose significantly effective patients eating relatively high carbohydrate eastern since acarbose prevents digestion complex carbohydrates drug taken start main meals taken first bite moreover amount complex carbohydrates meal determine effectiveness acarbose decreasing postprandial hyperglycemia adults may take doses mg times daily increasing mg times day however maximum dose per day mgcitation needed cochrane systematic review assessed effect alphaglucosidase inhibitors people impaired glucose tolerance impaired fasting blood glucose elevated glycated hemoglobin found acarbose reduced incidence diabetes mellitus type compared placebo however conclusive evidence acarbose compared diet exercise metformin placebo intervention improved allcause mortality reduced increased risk cardiovascular mortality serious nonserious adverse events nonfatal stroke congestive heart failure nonfatal myocardial combination acarbose metformin results greater reductions fasting blood glucose postprandial glucose either agent since acarbose prevents degradation complex carbohydrates glucose
