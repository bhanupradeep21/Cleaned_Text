assistive technology deaf hard hearing technology built assist deaf suffer hearing loss examples technology include hearing aids video relay services tactile devices alerting devices technology supporting communication deaf hard hearing community difficult time communicate perceive information compared hearing individuals thus individuals often rely visual tactile mediums receiving communicating information use assistive technology devices provides community various solutions problems providing higher sound hard hearing tactile feedback visual cues improved technology access individuals deaf hard hearing utilize variety assistive technologies provide improved accessibility information numerous devices either provide amplified sound alternate ways access information vision andor vibration technologies grouped three general categories hearing technology alerting devices communication support hearing technology broadly defined device utilized improving level sound available listener hearing technology divided two general subcategories assistive listening devices personal amplification assistive listening devices ald utilized individuals large groups people typically accessed without support specific personnel devices typically used improve signaltonoise ratio snr given situation alds utilize transmitter sends persons voice sound source receiver distributes sound evenly throughout room theaters churches directly individual frequency modulation fm systems sound transmitted specific frequency channel similar radio federal communications commission fcc designated specific frequencies types systems small receivers connected directly persons hearing aids direct audio input dai time fm system coupled hearing aid special settings connections required audiologist sometimes several fm based systems used building problems cross rooms channels systems utilize light waves transmit sound transmitter special light sensitive receiver signal broadcast whole room speakers person wears individual receiver must clear line connection transmitter receiver light signal interrupted benefit infrared systems work room transmitter receiver located resulting significantly fewer issues crossover systems sensitive external light sources interfering objects induction loop systems utilize electromagnetic energy transmit signal systems cover small area loop placed rug may permanently installed within walls ceiling larger areas like theaters auditoriums churches personal amplification chosen specific needs individual based level hearing requires support audiologist determine candidacy different devices appropriately fit adjust chosen device hearing aids electroacoustic devices designed amplify sound wearer usually aim making speech intelligible correct impaired hearing measured audiometry technologies also worth noting cochlear implants boneanchored hearing aids baha serve similar purpose hearing aids following technologies
