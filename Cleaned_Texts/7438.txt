predictions counterfactual truth made lewiss views counterfactuals controversial whereas stalnaker treated possible worlds imaginary entities made sake theoretical convenience lewis adopted position formal account counterfactuals commit namely modal realism lewiss formulation speak world made shot world missed speaking world real one although say world made shot precisely counterpart mine successful lewis already proposed view earlier papers counterpart theory quantified modal logic anselm actuality counterparts persons bodies theory widely considered implausible lewis urged taken

calls incredulous stare lewis plurality worlds pp defends elaborates theory extreme modal realism insisting nothing extreme plurality worlds lewis acknowledges theory contrary common sense believes advantages far outweigh disadvantage therefore hesitant pay price according lewis actual merely indexical label give world things necessarily true true possible worlds lewis first speak possible
