variability hypothesis also known greater male variability hypothesis hypothesis males generally display greater variability traits females often discussed relation human cognitive ability studies appear show males likely females either high low iq test scores context controversy whether sexbased differences variability intelligence exist whether caused genetic differences environmental

precisely yield position regarding greater male support greater male variability hypothesis grew early part period attention researchers shifted towards studying variability mental abilities partly due advent standardised mental tests see history intelligence quotient made possible examine intelligence greater objectivity precision one advocate greater male variability time american psychologist edward thorndike one leading exponents mental testing played instrumental role development todays armed services vocational aptitude battery asvab publication sex education thorndike argued mean level

intelligence could biological basis suggested could important implications achievement pedagogy example postulated greater male variation could mean eminence leadership worlds affairs whatever sort inevitably belong oftener addition since number women fall within extreme topend intelligence distribution would inherently smaller suggested educational resources invested preparing women roles occupations require mediocre level cognitive examining case records patients clearing house mental defectives leta hollingworth determined although men outnumbered women clearing house ratio men women decreased age hollingworth explained result men facing greater societal expectations women consequently deficiencies men often detected earlier age similar deficiencies women might detected less expected therefore deficiencies women would required pronounced men order detected similar hollingworth also attacked variability hypothesis theoretically criticizing underlying logic hollingworth argued variability hypothesis flawed empirically established men anatomically variable women even greater anatomical variability men established would necessarily mean men also variable mental traits even established men variable mental traits would automatically mean men innately variable variability significant rather depends variability consists possible differences variability men women must also understood reference fact women lack opportunity achieve eminence prescribed societal cultural additionally argument great variability automatically meant greater range criticized attempt examine
