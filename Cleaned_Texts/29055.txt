disease mjd also known azorean disease machados disease josephs disease spinocerebellar ataxia type rare autosomal dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disease causes progressive cerebellar results lack muscle control coordination upper lower symptoms caused genetic mutation results expansion abnormal cag trinucleotide repeats results abnormal form protein ataxin causes degeneration cells symptoms clumsiness rigidity make mjd commonly mistaken drunkenness parkinsons disease disease type spinocerebellar ataxia common cause autosomaldominant mjd causes ophthalmoplegia mixed sensory cerebellar ataxia symptoms mjd memory spasticity difficulty speech swallowing weakness arms legs clumsiness frequent urination involuntary eye movements symptoms begin early adolescence get worse time eventually mjd leads paralysis however intellectual functions usually remain samecitation needed flores s√£o miguel centers disease machado josephs disease multiple origins comes haplotype four different origins one origin azores japan brazil france founder effects areas spinocerebellar ataxia type azores believed come portugals northeast sephardic jews belgium frenchguiana algeria mjd mutation origins portuguese two mutations brazil france one mutation germans make majority mjd patients united states individuals azorean mjd locus chromosome japanese mjd azorean william machado whose offspring new england first diagnosed azorean joseph family living california also diagnosed mjd origin mjd found azores americas northwest coast portuguese since african americans indians italians japanese also developed china mutation causing sca type estimated occurred years japan oldest causative mutation appears occurred years among aboriginal australians founder mutation appears occurred years ago mutation shared families based asia seems likely imported mjd affected azoreans japanese haplotypes common azoreans also haplotypes two different disease caused mutation gene located chromosome exon gene contains lengthy irregular cag repeats producing mutated protein called normally number copies mjd autosomal dominant disease meaning either parent gives defective gene child child show symptoms disease therefore one parent condition parent chance child inheriting pons brainstem one areas affected mjd striatum brain area connected balance movement also affected disease could explain main motor problems cause mjd tightening twisting limb abrupt irregular affected cells protein builds assembles intranuclear inclusion bodies insoluble aggregates hypothesized interfere normal activity nucleus induce cell degenerate diecitation needed mjd diagnosed recognizing symptoms disease taking family history physicians ask patients questions kind symptoms relatives disease progression harshness symptoms ages onset family memberscitation needed presymptomatic diagnosis mjd made genetic direct detection genetic mutation responsible mjd available since genetic testing looks number cag repeats within coding region gene chromosome test show positive mjd region contains repeats opposed repeats found healthy individuals limitation test number cag repeats individual tested falls healthy pathogenic ranges repeats test predict whether individual mjd five subtypes mjd characterized age onset range symptoms subtypes illustrate wide variety symptoms patients however assigning individuals specific subtype disease limited clinical cure machadojoseph disease however treatments available example spasticity reduced antispasmodic drugs baclofen parkinsonian symptoms treated levodopa therapy prism glasses reduce diplopic physiotherapyphysical therapy andor occupational therapy help patients prescribing mobility aids increase patients independence providing gait training prescribing exercises maintain mobility various joints general health decrease likelihood falls injuries result falls walkers wheelchairs greatly help patient everyday tasks patients experience difficulties speech swallowing therefore speechlanguage pathologist assist patients improve communicating abilities issues patients severe forms mjd life expectancy approximately years mild forms normal life expectancy cause death die early often aspiration unlike many medical conditions disease named researchers named two men william machado antone joseph patriarchs families condition initially highest prevalence condition australias groote eylandt population currently symptomatic followed azorean island flores around individuals population diagnosed brazilian comedian actor tv personality guilherme karam diagnosed disease inherited mother like brother died july video facebook days karams death brazilian personality journalist television presenter arnaldo duran publicly acknowledged condition machadojoseph brazilian press gave huge attention ethicists used disease paradigmatic illness discuss rights community patients control ownership disease particularly comes research genetic also currently clinical intervention prevent onset disease symptoms discourse whether individuals get tested benefits mjd testing include reduction anxiety uncertainty ability plan future disadvantages include anticipation negative results individuals difficulties adapting outcomecitation needed disease
