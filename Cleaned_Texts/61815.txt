metronomic therapy new type chemotherapy anticancer drugs administered lower dose maximum tolerated dose repetitively long period treat cancers fewer side effects metronomic therapy shown affect tumor microenvironment tumor cells achieve therapeutic metronomic therapy also costeffective lower dose used compared conventional use metronomic therapy extensively investigated advantageous selected group yet clinical trials necessary generalize conventional chemotherapy dose close maximum tolerated dose administered bolus manner achieve cytotoxic effects tumor however side effects often significant cytotoxic agents also kill fastdividing cells normally present body bone marrow cells epithelial cells gastrointestinal treatment break thus required allow recovery normal tissues metronomic therapy lower dose typically varying onetenth onethird maximum tolerated dose administered frequently maintain low concentration drugs commonly given oral form convenient patients lower cost compared intravenous form used conventional low concentration drugs primarily act tumor microenvironment including tumor endothelial cells immune cells lower dose used risk severe side effects neutropenia multiple mechanisms action studied preclinical clinical settings instead directly killing tumor cells drugs metronomic therapy suppress tumor growth mainly inhibiting tumor angiogenesis modulating immune response also emerging evidence metronomic therapy may also act tumor cells inducing tumor dormancy angiogenesis supports tumor growth ensuring sufficient oxygen nutrient supply rapidlyproliferating tumor metronomic therapy inhibit tumor angiogenesis multiple mechanisms selectively inhibits proliferation induces apoptosis tumor endothelial cells without disrupting endothelial cells normal blood probably mediated increasing expression inhibits another target metronomic therapy bone marrowderived circulating endothelial progenitor cells ceps involved tumor angiogenesis metronomic therapy found decrease level tumor cells develop various means evade immunosurveillance number regulatory cells tregs found increase various types tumors suppressing specific innate immune

antigenpresenting ability dendritic cells turn facilitate tcell mediated immune response breast cancer settings several drugs commonly used conventional chemotherapy methotrexate cyclophosphamide vinorelbine fluoropyrimidines tested either monotherapy combination therapies including hormonal therapy targeted therapy although many cases metronomic therapy create synergy therapies number studies proven efficacy metronomic therapy treatment intractable breast fact recent study presented american association cancer research aacr congress announced effect metronomic study also encourages studies

treatment although docetaxel drug used regimen found effective treatment crpc using docetaxel caused serious side effects neuropathy undesirable especially patients prostate cancer oldaged response newer medications enzalutamide abiraterone also however recent studies found metronomic chemotherapy using cyclophosphamide beneficial fewer side effects therapy uses smaller amount regimens cause severe side effects since metronomic chemotherapy proven effective alternative studies find beneficial combination regimens fewest side effects need metronomic therapy discovered effective treatment lung cancer well especially metastatic nonsmallcell lung carcinoma variety drugs used cancer treatment vinorelbine one drugs used cancer treatment using vinorelbine regimen shown feasible elderly patients tend multiple comorbidities condition patient two diseases time require multiple effect metronomic therapy limited aged patients etoposide may also effective frail patients although metastatic recurrent lung cancer difficult completely cured modern medical technology metronomic therapy feasible palliative therapy reducing tumor burden improving patients quality life future research expected experimenting effects combinations vinorelbine metronomic therapy investigated treatment metastatic ovarian cancer less costly improves patients quality lives compared conventional

treatments received treatment provided progress ovarian cancers one case found nearly complete clinical remission despite encouraging results many clinical trials using metronomic therapy ovarian cancer findings case reports preclinical trials due clinical trials lack information applications still risky questionable substitute conventional therapy used treatment ovarian paediatric cancers challenge due expense treatment fact cure rate highincome countries lowincome countries therefore lowering expense paediatric cancers key improve quality life metronomic therapy good way reduce
