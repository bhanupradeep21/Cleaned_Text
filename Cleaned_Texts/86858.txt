antipredator adaptations mechanisms developed evolution assist prey organisms constant struggle predators throughout animal kingdom adaptations evolved every stage struggle namely avoiding detection warding attack fighting back escaping caught first line defence consists avoiding detection mechanisms camouflage masquerade apostatic selection living underground nocturnality alternatively prey animals may ward attack whether advertising presence strong defences aposematism mimicking animals possess defences startling attacker signalling predator pursuit worthwhile distraction using defensive structures spines living group members groups reduced risk predation despite increased conspicuousness group improved vigilance predator confusion likelihood predator attack individual animals may avoid becoming prey living sight predators whether caves burrows nocturnality animal behavior characterized activity night sleeping day behavioral form detection avoidance called crypsis used animals either avoid predation enhance prey hunting predation risk long recognized critical shaping behavioral decisions example predation risk prime importance determining time evening emergence echolocating bats although early access brighter times permits easier foraging also leads higher predation risk bat hawks bat falcons results optimum evening emergence time compromise conflicting another nocturnal adaptation seen kangaroo rats forage relatively open habitats reduce activity outside nest burrows response moonlight full moon shift activity towards areas relatively dense cover compensate extra camouflage uses combination materials coloration illumination concealment make organism hard detect sight common terrestrial marine animals camouflage achieved many different ways resemblance surroundings disruptive coloration shadow elimination countershading counterillumination selfdecoration cryptic behavior changeable skin patterns animals flattail horned lizard north america evolved eliminate shadow blend ground bodies lizards flattened sides thin towards edge body form along white scales fringed along sides allows lizards effectively hide shadows addition lizards hide remaining shadows pressing bodies animals hide plain sight masquerading inedible objects example potoo south american bird habitually perches tree convincingly resembling broken stump butterfly kallima looks like dead another way remain unattacked plain sight look different members species predators tits selectively hunt abundant types insect ignoring less common types present forming search images desired prey creates mechanism negative frequencydependent selection apostatic many species make use behavioral strategies deter many weaklydefended animals including moths butterflies mantises phasmids cephalopods octopuses make use patterns threatening startling behaviour suddenly displaying conspicuous eyespots scare momentarily distract predator thus giving prey animal opportunity escape absence toxins defences essentially bluffing contrast aposematism involves honest pursuitdeterrent signals behavioral signals used prey convince predators pursue example gazelles stot jumping high stiff legs arched back thought signal predators high level fitness outrun predator result predators may choose pursue different prey less likely outrun whitetailed deer prey mammals flag conspicuous often black white tail markings alarmed informing predator warning calls given birds eurasian jay similarly honest signals benefiting predator prey predator informed detected might well save time energy giving chase prey protected another pursuitdeterrent signal thanatosis playing dead thanatosis form bluff animal mimics dead body feigning death avoid attacked predators seeking live prey thanatosis also used predator order lure prey example seen whitetailed deer fawns experience drop heart rate response approaching predators response referred alarm bradycardia causes fawns heart rate drop beats per minute within one beat heart drop heart rate last two minutes causing fawn experience depressed breathing rate decrease movement called tonic immobility tonic immobility reflex response causes fawn enter low body position simulates position corpse upon discovery fawn predator loses interest dead prey symptoms alarm bradycardia salivation urination defecation also cause predator lose marine molluscs sea hares cuttlefish squid octopuses give last chance escape distracting attackers eject mixture chemicals may mimic food otherwise confuse response predator animals groups release ink creating cloud opaline affecting predators feeding senses causing attack distraction displays attract attention predators away object typically nest young birds feign broken wing hopping mimicry occurs organism mimic simulates signal properties another organism model confuse third organism results mimic gaining protection food mating two classical types defensive mimicry batesian müllerian involve aposematic coloration warning signals avoid attacked batesian mimicry palatable harmless prey species mimics appearance another species noxious predators thus reducing mimics risk form mimicry seen many insects idea behind batesian mimicry predators tried eat unpalatable species learn associate colors markings unpleasant taste results predator learning avoid species displaying similar colours markings including batesian mimics effect parasitic chemical defences unprofitable species octopus mimic selection animals changing skin color skin pattern body motion damselfish attacks octopus octopus mimics banded model chosen varies octopuss predator octopuses use batesian mimicry selecting organism repulsive predators müllerian mimicry two aposematic forms share warning viceroy monarch butterflies birds avoid eating species wing patterns honestly signal unpleasant many animals protected predators armour form hard shells molluscs turtles leathery scaly skin reptiles tough chitinous exoskeletons spine sharp needlelike structure used inflict pain predators example seen nature sohal surgeonfish fish sharp scalpellike spine front tail fins able inflict deep wounds area around spines often brightly colored advertise defensive predators often avoid sohal defensive spines may detachable barbed poisonous porcupine spines long stiff break tip barbed stick wouldbe predator contrast hedgehogs short spines modified readily bend barbed body easily lost may jabbed many species slug caterpillar limacodidae numerous protuberances stinging spines along dorsal surfaces species possess stinging spines suffer less predation larvae lack predator paper wasp chooses larvae without spines given group living decrease risk predation individual variety described dilution effect seen animals living group dilute risk attack individual one many group george c williams wd hamilton proposed group living evolved provides benefits individual rather group whole becomes conspicuous becomes larger one common example shoaling fish experiments provide direct evidence decrease individual attack rate seen group living example camargue horses southern france horsefly often attacks horses sucking blood carrying diseases flies numerous horses gather large groups individuals indeed attacked less water striders insects live surface fresh water attacked beneath predatory fish experiments varying group size water striders showed attack rate per individual water strider decreases group size selfish herd theory proposed wd hamilton explain animals seek central positions theorys central idea reduce individuals domain danger domain danger area within group individual likely attacked predator center group lowest domain danger animals predicted strive constantly gain position testing hamiltons selfish herd effect alta de vos justin orainn studied brown fur seal predation great white sharks using decoy seals researchers varied distance decoys produce different domains danger seals greater domain danger increased risk shark radical strategy avoiding predators may otherwise kill large majority emerging stage population emerge rarely irregular intervals predators lifecycle one years unable reproduce rapidly enough response emergence predators may feast emerging population unable consume fraction brief surfeit prey periodical cicadas emerge intervals years often used example predator satiation though explanations unusual lifecycle animals live groups often give alarm calls give warning attack example vervet monkeys give different calls depending nature attack eagle disyllabic cough leopard cat loud bark python snake chutter monkeys hearing calls respond defensively differently case eagle call look run cover leopard call run trees snake call stand two legs look around snakes seeing snake sometimes mob similar calls found species monkey birds also give different calls elicit different improved vigilance effect groups able detect predators sooner solitary many predators success depends surprise prey alerted early attack improved chance escape example wood pigeon flocks preyed upon goshawks goshawks less successful attacking larger flocks wood pigeons attacking smaller flocks larger flock size likely one bird notice hawk sooner fly away one pigeon flies alarm rest pigeons wild ostriches tsavo national park kenya feed either alone groups four birds subject predation lions ostrich group size increases frequency individual raises head look predators decreases ostriches able run speeds exceed lions great distances lions try attack ostrich head grouping ostriches present lions greater difficulty determining long ostriches heads stay thus although individual vigilance decreases overall vigilance group individuals living large groups may safer attack predator may confused large group size group moves predator greater difficulty targeting individual prey animal zebra suggested zoologist martin stevens colleagues example stationary single zebra stands large size reduce risk attack zebras often travel herds striped patterns zebras herd may confuse predator making harder predator focus individual zebra furthermore moving rapidly zebra stripes create confusing flickering motion dazzle effect eye defensive structures spines may used ward attack already mentioned need fight back methods fighting back include chemical defensive suicidal many prey animals defend seed predation also seeds make use poisonous chemicals may concentrated surface structures spines glands giving attacker taste chemicals actually bites swallows prey animal many toxins lastditch defence animals flesh toxic puffer fish danaid butterflies burnet moths many insects acquire toxins food plants danaus caterpillars accumulate toxic cardenolides milkweeds prey animals able eject noxious materials deter predators actively bombardier beetle specialized glands tip abdomen allows direct toxic spray towards predators spray generated explosively oxidation hydroquinones sprayed temperature armoured crickets similarly release blood joints threatened several species grasshopper including poecilocerus parasanaa aularches tegra novaehollandiae secrete noxious liquids threatened sometimes ejecting spitting cobras accurately squirt venom fangs eyes potential striking target eight times ten causing severe termite soldiers nasutitermitinae fontanellar gun gland front head secrete shoot accurate jet resinous terpenes many centimeters material sticky toxic insects one terpenes secretion pinene functions alarm seeds deter predation combinations toxic nonprotein amino acids cyanogenic glycosides protease amylase inhibitors vertebrate species texas horned lizard able shoot squirts blood eyes rapidly increasing blood pressure within eye sockets threatened individual may lose blood single used persistent predators like foxes wolves coyotes canidae last canids often drop horned lizards squirted attempt wipe shake blood mouths suggesting fluid foul choose lizards given suggesting learned aversion towards horned lizards slime glands along body hagfish secrete enormous amounts mucus provoked stressed gelatinous slime dramatic effects flow viscosity water rapidly clogging gills fish attempt capture hagfish predators typically release hagfish within seconds common predators hagfish include seabirds pinnipeds cetaceans fish suggesting predatory fish avoid hagfish communal defence prey groups actively defend grouping together sometimes attacking mobbing predator rather allowing passive victims predation mobbing harassing predator many prey animals mobbing usually done protect young social colonies example red colobus monkeys exhibit mobbing threatened chimpanzees common predator male red colobus monkeys group together place predators groups females juveniles males jump together actively bite fieldfares birds may nest either solitarily colonies within colonies fieldfares mob defecate approaching predators shown experimentally reduce predation birds insects use defensive regurgitation ward predators northern fulmar vomits bright orange oily substance called stomach oil stomach oil made aquatic diets causes predators feathers mat leading loss flying ability loss water especially dangerous aquatic birds water repellent feathers protect hypothermia diving european roller chicks vomit bright orange foul smelling liquid sense danger repels prospective predators may alert parents danger respond delaying numerous insects utilize defensive regurgitation eastern tent caterpillar regurgitates droplet digestive fluid repel attacking similarly larvae noctuid moth regurgitate disturbed ants vomit noctuid moths repellent irritant properties help deter predator unusual type predator deterrence observed malaysian exploding ant social hymenoptera rely altruism protect entire colony selfdestructive acts benefit individuals worker ants leg grasped suicidally expels contents hypertrophied submandibular expelling corrosive irritant compounds adhesives onto predator prevent predation serve signal enemy ants stop predation rest normal reaction prey animal attacking predator flee available means whether flying falling swimming running jumping according animals escape paths often erratic making difficult predator predict way prey go next example birds snipe ptarmigan
