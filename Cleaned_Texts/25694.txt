expressed oocytes found alter measured channel subsequent report using human channels expressed cells found small hyperpolarizing shift midpoint activation result common among shift results channels open negative potentials thus higher open probability wildtype channels potentials report also found mutant produced almost twice much wholecell current compared wildtype channels due change single

mutant channel currents also decreased gpcr activation smaller amount recent group confirmed results creating knockin confirmed mutant activates negative potentials neurons producing channels much larger wholecell current resulted much larger quantal content number neurotransmitter packets released per action potential generally enhanced neurotransmitter release neurons versus wildtype
