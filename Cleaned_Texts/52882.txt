equipotentiality refers psychological theory neuropsychology behaviorism karl spencer lashley defined equipotentiality apparent capacity intact part functional brain carry memory functions lost destruction words brain coopt areas take role damaged equipotentiality subject term lashley coined law mass action law mass action says efficiency complex function brain reduced proportionately much damage brain whole sustained damage particular area brain context use brains referring cortex brain localization theories popular theories brain brocas area speech discovered cerebral cortex marked motor center brain general visual auditory areas defined cerebral behaviorism time would also say learned responses series specific connections cerebral cortex lashley argued one would able locate connections part brain systematically looked learning localized working phd genetics lashley began number tests brain tissue idea lashley wanted focus mainly behaviors could observed easy way study white rats controlled setting fellow researcher shepherd ivory franz also shared common interest studying localization studying things could observed franz already done previous work lesions cat brains puzzle boxes lashley franz decided team work rats first experiments lashley charge building different mazes rats go franz charge making lesions rats lashley franz observed lesions rats became better better getting mazes find food testing lesions influence rats memory ability get mazes franz made multiple lesions specific parts brains healed put maze see deficits finding food found mice deficits finding food lesions specific part brain lesions damaged large portion brain troubles finding food would suggest one part brain responsible memory localization totally ruled concluded multiple parts brain work together memory retention also found rats lesions small specific area functioning sensory systems seemed parts brain damaged certain action parts brain compensating actions could carried lashley coined term equipotentiality define idea one part brain damaged parts brain carry memory functions damaged part apparent capacity intact part functional brain carry memory functions lost destruction another way putting brain ability use functioning part brain damaged part brain longer equipotentiality subject term lashley coined mass action principle principle postulates efficiency complex function brain reduced proportionately much damage brain whole sustained damage particular area brain context use brain referring cortex ghiselli brown conducted experiment destroyed various subcortical regions brain rats tested abilities learn mazes compared rats damage done brains rats damaged brains didnt learn well control rats particular region seemed necessary learn mazes also experimental work done higher apes also studies done humans suffered brain damage various ways data gathered tend confirm lashleys using idea equipotentiality explain someone whos received damage specific part brain relearn perform actions lost due brain damage since area brain originally performing function damaged unusable brain compensates code information parts brain lashleys ideas equipotentiality law mass action saying brain functioning whole unit overall damage brain affects overall functioning starts go localization theories would say brain functioning specific regions brains ability perform given task affected overall damage area brain damage unrelated area shouldnt affect task however equipotentiality law mass action dont mean certain functions pinned specific parts brain language senses example things like learning behavior specific area identified yet brain activities flexibility coded different areas brain damage neuropsychology equipotentiality neurological principle describes cortical mechanism first identified jean pierre flourens later revisited karl lashley performing ablation experiments birds seeing could still fly peck mate sleep perform range regular behaviors flourens concluded every area brain capable every area brain could higherlevel functions called perception also argued elementary sensory input localized supported current research famous saying use brains originates flourens back century half agocitation needed lashley offered two generalizations research recently successfully challenged nonetheless represent important milestones development neurological theory lashley contributed psychology neuropsychology number ways first publication brain mechanisms intelligence quantitative study injuries brain found evidence suggest idea localization wrong brought life idea brain multiple parts work together memory second researchers began copy studies also started investigate parts brain work together also began studying deficits people may along parts brain may damaged see correlation lashley also pioneer challenging way think human animal behavior terms lashley found experimentation behavior reaction stimulus large complicated series connections made brain input information stimuli occurs connections occur brain leads output behavior researchers also expanded study working memory central executive research memory deficits learning lashley find central place stored memories suggests stored memories localized stored retrieved multiple lashley contributed studies alzheimers disease deficits memory behavior thinking alzheimers celltocell communication slowly degrades alzheimers disease lashleys contributions psychology neuropsychology biology helped understanding many diseases disorders karl lashley worked donald hebb yerkes laboratories lab worked monkeys study various psychological concepts another man lashley influenced roger also studied lashley lab eventually
