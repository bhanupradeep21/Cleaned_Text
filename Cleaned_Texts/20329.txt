eurotrochilus species occurred rupelian age early oligocene era specimens eurotrochilus found throughout central europe seem agree geological era german specimens estimated million years french specimen estimated million years polish specimens estimated million years oligocene era paratethys ocean covered majority central eastern winnica site poland e noniewiczi specimen found used submerged paratethys winnica site produced large diversity bird remains aquatic terrestrial indicates likely coastal shoreline climate rich avifauna e inexpectatus large diversity avian specimens clay pits southern germany also found marine sediment supporting theory majority central europe likely marinecoastal based species found alongside eurotrochilus specimens local climate believed subtropical warm frostfree climate would supported broadleaved evergreen forests well palmrich coastal forests sandy difficult estimate winter conditions period without knowing migratory habits avian species based fruit nectar diets scientists believe area europe likely experienced mild ornithophilous flowers flowers pollinated birds present old world flowers like canarina eminii campanulacea impatiens sakeriana balasaminaceae agapetes spp ericaceae similar morphology flowers nectar new world specifically lack perch new world similar flowers pollinated modern hummingbirds need perch flowers due adaption hovering modern hummingbirds present old world instead longtongued bees pollinate considering eurotrochilus long beaks tongues consume nectar well ability hover flight seems plausible conclude ornithophilous flowers old world evolved birdpollination morphologies response true would suggest maximum age hummingbirdpollinated plants ie nectivorous plants plants would able pollinated early oligocene without abundance e inexpectatus specimens frauenweiler site southern germany suggests eurotrochilus possibly locally abundant early oligocene making likely dominant pollinators ornithophilous ecological competition longtongued bees ornithophilous flowers suggested explanation extinction eurotrochilus modern hummingbirds another possible explanation extinction rapid climate change suspected moderate tropical climate would critical problem considering small size httpsenwikipediaorgwikieurotrochilus
