octreotide sold brand name sandostatin among others octapeptide mimics natural somatostatin pharmacologically though potent inhibitor growth hormone glucagon insulin natural hormone first synthesized chemist wilfried bauer binds predominantly somatostatin receptors approved use united states octreotide mycapssa approved medical use european union june octreotide mycapssa first oral somatostatin analog ssa approved world health organizations list essential octreotide used treatment growth hormone producing tumors acromegaly gigantism surgery contraindicated pituitary tumors secrete thyroidstimulating hormone thyrotropinomatacitation needed diarrhea flushing episodes associated carcinoid syndrome diarrhea people vasoactive intestinal peptidesecreting tumors vipomas octreotide also used mild cases glucagonoma surgery octreotide often given infusion management acute hemorrhage esophageal varices liver cirrhosis basis reduces portal venous pressure though current evidence suggests effect transient improve octreotide used nuclear medicine imaging labeling octreoscan noninvasively image neuroendocrine tumours expressing somatostatin recentlywhen radiolabeled well using edotreotide enabling imaging positron emission tomography pet provides higher resolution sensitivity octreotide usually derivative edotreotide dotatoc also labeled variety therapeutic radionuclides enable peptide receptor radionuclide therapy prrt treatment unresectable neuroendocrine tumours octreotide also used treatment acromegaly disorder excessive growth hormone gh octreotide somatostatin

patients responded tolerated treatment octreotide mycapssa first oral somatostatin analog ssa approved octreotide helps management fistula reducing gastrointestinal secretions inhibiting gastrointestinal motility thus controlling reducing outputcitation needed value healing intestinal fistulas yet proven routine use limited side effects octreotide also used treatment refractory

obstructioncitation needed octreotide adequately studied treatment children well pregnant lactating women drug given groups riskbenefit analysis common adverse effects headache hypothyroidism cardiac conduction changes gastrointestinal reactions including cramps nauseavomiting diarrhoea constipation gallstones reduction insulin release sometimes hypoglycemia usually transient injection site reactions slow heart rate skin reactions pruritus hyperbilirubinemia hypothyroidism dizziness dyspnoea also fairly common rare side effects include acute anaphylactic reactions pancreatitis studies reported alopecia treated rats treated octreotide experienced erectile dysfunction prolonged qt interval observed uncertain whether reaction drug result existing octreotide reduce intestinal reabsorption ciclosporin possibly making necessary increase people diabetes mellitus might need less insulin oral antidiabetics treated octreotide inhibits glucagon secretion strongly longer time span insulin bioavailability bromocriptine besides antiparkinsonian bromocriptine also used treatment acromegaly since octreotide resembles somatostatin physiological activities also shown produce analgesic effects probably acting partial agonist mu opioid octreotide absorbed quickly completely subcutaneous application maximal plasma concentration reached minutes elimination halflife minutes

marketing authorization medicinal product mycapssa intended treatment adults applicant medicinal product amryt pharmaceuticals mycapssa approved medical use european union december octreotide also used offlabel treatment severe refractory diarrhea causes used toxicology treatment prolonged recurrent hypoglycemia sulfonylurea possibly meglitinide overdose also used varying degrees success infants nesidioblastosis help decrease insulin hypersecretion several clinical trials demonstrated effect octreotide acute treatment abortive agent cluster headache shown administration subcutaneous

increased insulin secretion vmh dysfunction promotes excessive caloric intake decreased caloric expenditure leading continuous unrelenting weight gain attempts caloric restriction pharmacotherapy adrenergic serotonergic agents previously met little brief success treating context octreotide suppresses excessive release insulin may increase action thereby inhibiting excessive adipose storage
