treatments physicians use history individual skin condition well tests identify disorder present conditions may confused seborrhoeic dermatitis based appearance listed variety different types medications able reduce symptoms seborrhoeic include certain antifungals antiinflammatory agents like corticosteroids nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs antiandrogens antihistamines among treatments must take consideration potential side effects especially longterm use given chronic nature seborrhoeic dermatitis initial therapy usually topical preparation agreeable side effect regular use overthecounter prescription antifungal shampoo cream common treatment topical antifungal medications ketoconazole ciclopirox best ketoconazole used twice per shampoo soap containing zinc pyrithione selenium sulfide also options used daily basis may also used conjunction ketoconazole shampoo regimen alternate unclear antifungals equally effective sufficiently antifungals studied found effective treatment seborrhoeic dermatitis include ketoconazole fluconazole miconazole bifonazole sertaconazole clotrimazole flutrimazole ciclopirox terbinafine butenafine selenium disulfide lithium salts lithium gluconate lithium topical climbazole appears little effectiveness treatment seborrhoeic systemic therapy oral antifungals including itraconazole fluconazole ketoconazole effective adverse side effects documented fluconazole ketoconazole latter recommended use itraconazole good safety profile commonly terbinafine said effective adverse side effects sources state effective topical corticosteroids shown effective shortterm treatment seborrhoeic dermatitis used long term maintenance skinthinning side effect accordingly used weeks also evidence effectiveness topical calcineurin inhibitors like tacrolimus pimecrolimus well lithium salt calcineurin inhibitors also effective reducing growth malassezia offering two routes may treat seborrhoeic medications calcineurin inhibitors used individuals seborrhoeic dermatitis immune compromised cause immune oral immunosuppressive treatment prednisone used short courses seborrhoeic dermatitis last resort due potential side seborrhoea sometimes associated seborrhoeic recognized androgensensitive condition caused aggravated androgen sex hormones testosterone dihydrotestosterone common symptom hyperandrogenism eg seen polycystic

glands also likely accordance involvement androgens seborrhoeic dermatitis antiandrogens cyproterone highly effective alleviating used treatment seborrhoeic particularly severe beneficial seborrhoeic dermatitis effectiveness may vary different antiandrogens instance spironolactone regarded relatively weak antiandrogen found produce improvement three months treatment whereas flutamide found result improvement within three cyproterone acetate similarly potent effective spironolactone results considerable improvement disappearance acne seborrhoea patients within three systemic antiandrogen therapy generally used treat seborrhoeic dermatitis women men medications result feminization eg gynecomastia sexual dysfunction infertility addition antiandrogens theoretically potential feminize male fetuses pregnant women reason usually combined effective birth control sexually active women may become antihistamines used primarily reduce itching present however research studies suggest antihistamines antiinflammatory keratolytics help skin via exfoliation builtup skin flakes thereby remove scale applied topically affected area keratolytics include urea salicylic acid coal tar lactic acid pyrithione zinc propylene coal tar shampoo formulations although significant increased risk cancer human treatment coal tar shampoos found caution advised since coal tar carcinogenic animals heavy human occupational exposures increase cancer another option natural artificial uv radiation since inhibit growth malassezia recommend photodynamic therapy using uva uvb laser red blue led light
