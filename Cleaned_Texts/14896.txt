gene therapy parkinsons disease consists creation new cells produce specific neurotransmitter dopamine protect neural system modification genes related disease cells transplanted patient disease different kinds treatments focus reducing symptoms disease currently cure parkinsons disease pd progressive neurological disorder resulting death cells substantia nigra contain produce dopamine people pd may develop disturbance motor activities activities tremor shaking rigidity slow movements bradykinesia patients may eventually present certain psychiatric problems like depression current pharmacological intervention consist administration ldopa dopamine precursor ldopa therapy increases dopamine production remaining nigral therapy deep brain electrical stimulation modulate overactivity subthalamic nucleus loss dopamine signaling however treatment number substantia nigra neurons decrease becomes less treatments try reduce symptoms patient focusing increasing production dopamine cure disease new treatments pd clinical trials centered gene therapy researchers expect compensate loss dopamine protect dopamine neurons pharmacological surgical therapies pd focus compensating ganglia dysfunction caused degeneration dopaminergic neuron substantia many new pd treatments clinical trials several focusing gene therapeutic approaches compensate loss dopamine protect nervous system dopamine neurons degeneration important reasons focusing gene therapy treatment pd first currently cure disease secondly genes identified modulate neuron phenotype act neuroprotective agents also environment brain afford repeated injections region substantia nigra meets striatum nigrostriatum therefore gene therapy could single treatment appealing viral vectors used therapy diffusible capable transduction main idea gene therapy create new generations cells produce particular neurotransmitter dopamine transplant cells patients neurons proliferate renewed replacing lost neurons process currently going investigation also use embryonic dopaminergic cells used cells difficult modifications cell made somatic cells modifications transplanted cell change expression genes normalize several types gene therapy therapies symptomatic approaches like production ectopic ldopa full ectopic dopamine synthesis ectopic ldopa conversion use glutamic acid descarboxylase gad also disease modifying therapies like ntn gndf glial cell linederived neurotrophic factor regulation αsynuclein parkin gene expression currently main studies using vector platform making standard vector disease although lentevirus also different types gene therapy investigations encoding enzymes necessary dopamine synthesis tyrosine hydroxylase gtp cyclohydrolase symptomatic approach treatment focused symptoms patients first one consists ectopic dopamine synthesis production ectopic ldopa striatum another alternative gene therapy therapy consists transferring th gtp cyclohydrolase genes msns endogenous aadc activity able convert ldopa experiment using tyrosine hydroxylase th altogether vectors could provide normal levels ldopa rats results experiment showed reduced dyskinesias well reversion view abnormal projections striatum using gene dopamine synthesis fully ectopic case enzyme aadc charge converting levodopa dopamine parkinson disease loss neurons nigrostriatum leads inability convert levodopa dopamine goal restore normal levels aadc striatum could conversion levodopa therefore reducing levodopa induced using gene therapy experiment accomplish primates testing tyrosine hydroxylase th transgene primate astrocytes gene therapy made transfer th fulllength cdna using rat th results showed behavioural improvement monkeys received plasmid unlike control another type ectopic ldopa conversion use gene enzyme replacement therapy used increase efficacy pharmacological ldopa therapy using aav vectors aav vectors designed send aadc coding sequence msn medium spiny neurons striatum able convert administered ldopa kind gene therapy symptomatic approach use glutamic acid decarboxylase gad expression subthalamic nucleus gene enzyme replacement therapy used increase efficacy pharmacological ldopa therapy using aav vectors aav vectors designed send aadc coding sequence msn striatum able convert administered ldopa phase study published journal lancet neurology parkinson says gene therapy called dramatically reduces movement damage study used glutamic acid decarboxylase gad introduced genetic material brain related motor functions symptoms included tremor stiffness difficulty movements improved half group gene therapy control group improved therapies development based modification disease first one neurotrophic factors gene delivery therapy gndf ntn used protect system gndf factor tgfß superfamily secreted astrocytes glia cells charge survival midbrain dopaminergic neurons homologous ntn persephin artemin preclinical studies nigrostriatal dopaminergic relation parkinson disease system shown gndf ntn potential neuroprotective another type diseases modification technique synuclein silencing cases pd related polymorphisms αsynuclein promoter also multiplication locus carries αsynuclein gene therefore trying downregulate αsynuclein expression could impact development disease explored several viral vectorbased gene delivery system
