adaptive memory study memory systems evolved help retain survival fitnessrelated information ie geared toward helping organism enhance reproductive fitness chances one key element adaptive memory research notion memory evolved help survival better retaining information one foundations method studying memory relatively little adaptive value memory system evolved merely remember past events memory systems argued must use past service present planning another assumption model evolved memory mechanisms likely domainspecific sensitive certain types information recent development field evolutionary psychology adaptive memory first proposed james nairne sarah r thompson josefa ns evolutionary psychologists often state humans possess stoneage therefore optimal cognitive performance may found problems faced ancestors related environments evolutionary ancestors based finding nairne colleagues proposed human memory systems tuned information relevant first study subject adaptive memory published methodology replicated many times since participants told imagine one three randomly assigned scenarios survival condition imagine stranded grassland area foreign land needing find steady supply food water protecting predators second condition moving condition participants instructed imagine moving foreign land needing locate new home transporting possessions finally pleasantness condition asked participants simply rate pleasantness list words survival moving conditions participants asked rate relevance word list imagined situation participants subject surprise recall nairne et al found called survival survival advantage means information salient relevant survival ancestral environment higher rate retention control conditions became clear following free recall experiments conducted nairne processing information relevant survival leads information remembered known encoding one explanation survival advantages improved retention kind processing taps sort memory module specialized remembering processing information important another proposed explanation leads arousal emotional processing many survival situations emotionally arousing retention important first step toward functional analysis survival processing thinking kinds problems memory would evolved solve figuring selection pressures difficult posthoc accounts also known justso stories important problem avoid nairne et als work stressed importance priori predictions designing empirical like scientific research important element studying adaptive memory consider basis empirical evidence study methodology methodology testing adaptive memory survival advantage human participants thus far mostly consisted ranking lists words relevance survival setting along control dimensions well followed recall basic research methodology involves participants rate series words fitness relevance control condition words rated relevance moving foreign land pleasantness surprise recall test

chemical sense system study blackcapped chickadees poecile atricapilla alaska colorado birds alaska cached food remembered hiding places quickly readily significantly larger hippocampal volumes blackcapped chickadees colorado supports known adaptive specialization hypothesis adaptive specialization hypothesis states animals hide food bigger hippocampi animals hide food additionally animals hide food performed better nonhiding animals spatial memory tests finding suggests since climate tends harsh alaska may increased need remember food hidden help survive pressure natural selection sex differences spatial memory skills develop distinct mating systems comparing different vole species either polygamous monogamous researchers found sex differences spatial skills found polygamous mating meadow examination found unlike monogamous pine voles travel together permanent basis partners polygamous males increased mobility compared females order reap reproductive benefits male meadow voles good spatial skills likely able survive reproduce suggested evolutionary pressure led greater spatial skills comparison female meadow voles monogamous male pine voles suggestion based better performance male meadow voles route place learning tasks laboratory tests polygamous voles significantly larger relative hippocampus females species difference found pine vole findings suggest better spatial memory evolutionarily adaptive polygamous species organisms may develop larger hippocampus allow greater spatial memory contrast nairnes findings survival advantage found superiority survival

survival advantage found unlikely survival advantage explained terms schematic processing adaptive memory research depends different auxiliary assumptions drawn evolutionary psychology one assumption memory specially tuned remember information processed context similar environmental context adaptation took place ie african savannah grasslands foreign however information processed relevance environment involving zombies remembered better information processed african savannah context african context condition differ outer space experiments present problem assumption importance ancestral environment retention better information processed nonafrican savannah context something predicted theory adaptive memory second assumption adaptive memory research memory evolved beneficial survival
