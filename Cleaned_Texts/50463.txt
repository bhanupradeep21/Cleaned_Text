ornithophily bird pollination pollination flowering plants birds sometimes always coevolutionary association derived insect pollination entomophily particularly well developed parts world especially tropics southern africa island association involves several distinctive plant adaptations forming pollination syndrome plants typically colourful often red flowers long tubular structures holding ample nectar orientations stamen stigma ensure contact pollinator birds involved ornithophily tend specialist nectarivores brushy tongues long bills either capable hovering flight light enough perch flower structures plant adaptations ornithophily grouped primarily attract facilitate pollen transfer birds exclude groups primarily protecting theft nectar ovules bird flowers also tend adaptations protect damage vigorous foraging hard bird one general adaptation patterns red flower color many plant species pollinator birds tetrachromats one type single cone specific opsin detect longwavelength light therefore birds red photoreceptors sensitive red color red flower colors strong contrast green leaf background better bird attraction thus primary reason behind red color adaptation moreover flowers generalist birdpollinated species new world purer red colors old world often secondary reflectance peak around shorterwavelength region secondary peak reduces contrast red color background avoidance insects higher risk nectar robbing decreasing efficiency flowers generalist birdpollinated plant species differ pollinated specialized birds hummingbirds sunbirds lacking long corolla tubes brushlike exserted bird pollinated flowers red lot nectar also tend flowers generalist pollinators tend dilute nectar specialist pollinators hummingbirds sunbirds tend concentrated nectar ornithophilous flowers vary sugar composition hexoses high passerine pollinated species insect pollinated tend sucrose rich hummingbird pollinated flowers however tend sucrose different plants also developed specific adaptations bird pollination many plants family loranthaceae explosive flowers shower pollen bird forages near associated mainly flowerpeckers family australia species banksia flowers open response bird actions thereby reducing wastage tropical dry forests southern india ornithophilous flowers found bloom mainly hot dry calceolaria uniflora species scrophularaceae south america special fleshy appendage lower lip flower rich sugar fed least seedsnipe thinocorus rumicivorus process birds brush pollen onto head transfer rats tail babiana babiana ringens produces strong stalk within inflorescence serves perch malachite sunbird visits heliconias special sticky threads help adhesion pollen smooth structures bill african orchids genus disa pollinaria stick feet visiting plants need protect nectar pollen taken animals sometimes classified thieves simply remove resources without pollinating robbers damage flower access resources flowers specialized pollination longbilled birds may especially vulnerable example bees birds reach long tubes bird pollinated flowers simply pierce flower base obtain nectar without main families specialized nectar feeding birds involved ornithophily hummingbirds trochilidae sunbirds nectariniidae honeyeaters meliphagidae important bird groups include families icteridae honeycreepers thraupidae carduelinae whiteeyes zosteropidae south african sugarbirds promeropidae birds may obtain nectar either perching hovering latter mainly found hummingbirds sunbirds within hummingbirds two kinds foraging noted nonterritorial hermit hummingbirds forage longer distances territorial hummingbirds ability digest sucrose unlike many passerines prefer hexoses fructose glucose starlings relatives completely avoid nectar feeding birds typically mechanism quickly excrete excess water may drink four five times body mass liquid day obtain enough hummingbirds capable excreting nitrogenous wastes ammonia since afford water loss birds feed lowmoisture food hummingbirds sunbirds also special anatomical physiological adaptations allow quickly excrete excess water hummingbirds also able turn kidney function birds whiteeyes pollen dusted plants forehead birds may increase wear feathers leading increased moulting neotropical plant species contrast species north american plants evolved ornithophilous nearly fourth species genus salvia birdpollinated central south america also occur south tropical china adjacent indochinese countries harbor relatively birdpollinated flowers among rhodoleia championii member family hamamelidaceae one site visited pollinated seven species nectarforaging birds including japanese whiteeyes zosterops japonicus zosteropidae forktailed sunbirds aethopyga christinae hummingbirds rely nectar energy ornithophilous flowers need hummingbirds assistance pollination order reproduce birds feeding pollen sticks beaks rub next flower visit pollinating time codependence one another causes coevolution pollination example different species hummingbirds differently shaped beaks presumably allow drink nectar flowers around widely believed shortbilled hummingbirds drink wider flowers short petals hummingbirds longer bills close relationships flowers long narrow corollas time longbilled species access short long flowers often avoid short flowers avoid hummingbirds curved bills forage straightpetaled flowers straightbilled birds less likely visit curved ornithophilous flowers pollinated hummingbirds often reproductive structures vertically oriented creates favorable upright body position hummingbirds feeding one allows sufficiently flap wings hummingbirds prefer visit larger taller floral displays proven confirmed many studies birds prefer flowers red pink petals bird pollination considered costly strategy plants evolves particular benefits high altitude ecosystems lack insect pollinators dry regions isolated islands tend favour evolution ornithophily specialized nectarivorous birds hummingbirds plants pollinated generalist birds diverse tropical subtropical lowlands pronounced climatic seasonality plants mostly large woody species produce large number open flowers time contrast mostly small shrubs herbs pollinated specialized nectarivorous birds since generalist birdpollinated plants mostly selfincompatible needed adapt pollinators mostly provide outcrossing generalist birds birds mostly feed arthropods fruits seeds even much nectar available therefore move lot forest activity often move nectarproviding plants provide generalist birdpollinated plants even evolved deterring mechanisms specialized nectarivorous birds bees since groups tend establish feeding territories within one tree thus conduct selfpollination islands however generalist bird pollination evolve avoid selfpollination adapted reliable pollinator since bees butterflies rare montane time flowering often used mark start spring temperate climate zones recently studies consistently found plants respond increasing temperatures flowering strong coevolution hummingbirds flowers led adaptive specialization outcome important behaviors hummingbirds flowers become synchronized hummingbirds depend heavily nectar possible migration correlated time flowering flower specialist hummingbird species flowering phenology extremely important survival following fall migration example migratory route rufus linked florescence unique collection flower rufus prefer iodantha studies found presence rufus coupled flowering iodantha specific locations time flowering therefore significant survival rufus fall migration similarly peak flowering impatiens biflora flowers corresponds peak migration time rubythroated several mite species mainly genera proctolaelaps tropicoseius rhinoseius family ascidae evolved phoretic mode life climbing nostrils hummingbirds visit flowers hitching ride flowers feed nectar hummingbird flower
