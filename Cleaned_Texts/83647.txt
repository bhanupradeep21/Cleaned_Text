term boundary paradox refers conflict traditional rankbased classification life evolutionary thinking hierarchy ranked categories implicitly assumed morphological gap growing along increasing ranks two species genus similar two species different genera family latter two species similar two species different families order however requirement may satisfy classification contemporary organisms difficulties arise wish classify descendants together ancestors theoretically classification necessarily involves segmentation spatiotemporal continuum populations groups crisp boundaries however problem many parent populations would separate species level offspring truly paradoxical situation betweenspecies boundaries would necessarily coincide betweengenus boundaries betweengenus boundaries borders families apparent ambiguity resolved linnaean systems resolution possible classification cladistic see jeanbaptiste lamarck philosophie zoologique first questioned objectivity rankbased classification life saying orders families genera nomenclatures weapons invention could without must use discretion productions nature really formed either classes orders families genera constant species individuals succeed one another resemble sprung half century later charles darwin explained sharp separation groups organisms observed present becomes less obvious go back past common case especially respect distinct groups fish reptiles seems supposing distinguished present day dozen characters ancient members two groups would distinguished somewhat lesser number characters two groups though formerly quite distinct period made small approach book orchids darwin also warned system ranks would work knew details past life make perfect gradation extinct forms ever existed along many lines descent converging common progenitor order would called life due absence consequent wide gaps series enabled divide existing species definable groups genera families tribes finally richard dawkins argued recently assume almost every anthropologist today accepts members genus homo descended ancestors belonging genus call australopithecus necessarily follows somewhere along chain descent one species must least one individual sat exactly borderline indeed evolutionary view conferring discrete names actually become impossible fossil record complete one way fortunate fossils rare continuous unbroken fossil record granting distinct names species genera would become impossible least problematical following conclusion linnaean system works long try classify dead antecedents soon include hypothetically complete fossil record neat separations break paradox may best illustrated model diagrams similar darwin single evolutionary tree origin tree graphs dots represent populations edges correspond parentoffspring relations trees placed coordinate system onedimensional time single lineage twodimensional differentiation vs time cladogenesis evolution divergence single lineage model consider sequence populations along extremely long time axis say several hundred million years last dot representing extant population figure space dots even though edges adjacent populations hidden could use second axis express differentiation necessary purposes assume extinction branching events disregarded branches changes would correspond typical anagenesis classification organisms along sequence species shown small ellipses differences certain species judged large enough justify classification distinct genera generic separators must coincide betweenspecies boundary differences reach familylevel differentiation easy imagine long time consider consequence familylevel border must overlap betweengenus turn betweenspecies border gray arrow figure one imagine however parent offspring distinct classified different families even genera would paradoxical illustrates dawkins argumentation human ancestry level genera homo australopithecus darwin placed emphasis divergence parent population splits offspring populations diverge gradually following anagenetic sequence potentially divergence events case evolutionary say morphological divergence expressed new horizontal axis time becomes vertical axis time point imaginary taxonomist judges populations b belong different species within genus respective descendants c observed time considered represent two separate genera morphological difference large paradox c well b remain within generic limits c ancestors classified together descendants meaningfully linnaean system figure illustrates problem darwin discussed fish reptile example let us consider hypothetical evolutionary tree four recent species classified two genera fairly distant morphologically assume fossil record know common ancestor e representing yet another genus taxonomist takes intermediate position two yet considerably different forms went extinct therefore classification five species three genera would illogical fossils known illustrates darwin dawkins examples role gaps fossil record classification nomenclature demonstrated given darwinian evolutionary model descendants ancestors classified together within system linnean ranks solution provided cladistic classification group composed ancestor descendant populations condition called monophyly models monophyletic groups may obtained cutting branch subtree tree places instance
