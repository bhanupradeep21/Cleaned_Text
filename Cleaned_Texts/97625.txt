repeat falling front tv camera deploying rover questions centered around surface operations crew important findings irwin responded organization revealed side mount hadley scott asked describe like land falcon said cratering surface much subtle expected making landmark sighting harder scott also asked physical workload three hour evas said saw problem praised training earth mission preparing possible events rover interest irwin describing bucking bronco times two wheels still touching surface scott said felt stable machine gravity tendency float bit scott also asked drill much trouble said meter surface ran hard rock unable drill easily although irwin great difficulty extracting core sample felt worthwhile scott answered question loss north complex saying terms original mission objectives north complex even mentioned added later although personally disappointed would bonus always questions related american taxpayer getting mission except pretty television pictures scott said man must explore along huge amounts scientific data great sense exploration came flight worden irwin agreed totally sentiments asked problems board crew thought smooth flight except popped circuit breakers problem sps thrust switch irwin said seemed like tame simulation asked describe geological observations orbit worden talked cinder cones seen many craters observed especially far side seemed
