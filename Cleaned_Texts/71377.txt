galileo project international scientific research project systematically search extraterrestrial intelligence extraterrestrial technology near earth identify nature anomalous unidentified flying objectsunidentified aerial phenomena ufosuap launched harvard university astrophysicist avi loeb shortly odni ufo report prepared us intelligence reported sightings aircraft devices apparently flying mysterious speeds trajectories june speech head nasa bill nelson stated scientific analysis unidentified aerial phenomena detected multitude instruments june loeb emailed nasa suggest scientific project received reply upon launched project july help nonprofit project searching extraterrestrial technological equipment considered technosignatures including gathering new data peculiar ufos dedicated optimized unclassified sensor project aims use existing new telescopes systematically look artifacts earths orbit interstellar objects unexplained craft sometimes called anomalous aerial vehicles earths atmosphere research ufos including ufology often criticized working providing little lowquality data especially adherence extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence adage guiding principle scientific inquiry project aims address dataquality issue setting new sensor systems project aims make collected data publicly available scientific scrutiny publish papers transparent scientific analysis peerreviewed scientific loeb notes people military politics trained scientists asked interpret see project uses agnostic unbiased empirical approach potential explanations including considered unlikely experts rejected priori data gathered scientifically investigated based results develop two main avenues research searching two types potential extraterrestrial technological signatures use ai oumuamualike interstellar objects nonmanmade artificial scientists worldwide involved july harvard astronomer avi loeb team reported possibility finding interstellar claims made loeb team findings doubted peers according report new york loeb stated minimum galileo project gather rich data sets may foster discovery better scientific explanations novel interstellar objects anomalous properties potential new natural phenomena terrestrial technology explanations many presently inexplicable one project aims construct series optical infrared telescopes monitor sky use artificial intelligence classify analyse observations first telescope installed roof harvard college observatory sensor systems planned deployed worldwide possibly networked september reported project begin collecting observations loeb stated online post october instruments designed galileo project collecting new highquality needed telescope systems use machine learning sort example birds balloons drones atmospheric events aircraft satellites mysterious telescopes could supplemented radar systems would distinguish physical object sky weather pattern moreover like nasa uap project looking also using earth observation satellites particular data collected miniature satellites planet loeb stated far seti mainly predicated assumption extraterrestrials communicate via radio waves technology used century advanced extraterrestrials may long ago left behind noting better strategy may look artefacts alien astronomer jason wright affirms little searching done artefact seti seems got traction artefacts may able accumulate solar system like mailbox billion goal project capture new crisp images better instruments ever used relevant sensors photographic cameras loeb stated early highresolution images could collected within two project plans search characterize study interstellar objects isos like peculiar oumuamua detected intend use astronomical surveys like vera rubin observatory objects identified quickly design space mission probe could intercept gather closeup team intends develop software analyze data collected vera rubin thought observatory commences legacy survey space time lsst able detect isos entering solar system rate per collaboration alan stern principal investigator nasas new horizons mission received funding develop space mission project may trace origins back founder loeb first got excited topic gained substantial public attention first known interstellar object oumuamua discovered displayed highly unusual properties behavior loeb investigated elaborated anomalies proposed could kind extraterrestrial technology scientific journals many media appearances book extraterrestrial first sign intelligent life beyond interstellar object studies branch led amir siraj harvard astrophysicist frequently collaborates loeb codiscoverer one two see interstellar siraj loeb reported discovery additional candidate interstellar meteor cneos preprint using fireball catalog used cneos see find implied material strength two objects highest thirdhighest catalogs fireballs suggests interstellar meteors come population material strength characteristically higher meteors originating within solar project planning deepocean expedition retrieve small fragments interstellar meteor cneos appears rare composition speed ruled extraterrestrial using magnetic sled seafloor impact region coast papua new interstellar object identified interstellar object members galileo project siraj loeb project established confirmed united states space command april september online post loeb announced projects planned expedition fully june post medium profile loeb announced discovery anomalous curled piece wire designated xray fluorescence analysis determined chiefly composed manganese platinum commonly used manufacture corrosion resistant laboratory electrodes however relative composition elements wire significantly different used additionally metallic shards discovered determined composed steel alloy bears yield strength far exceeds iron meteorites reflecting previously published results characterized two varieties found dubbed red gray representative differing oxidation state fragments found several kilometers project intends systematically search nonmanmade artificial satellites semiartificial satellites artifacts earths orbit example designing algorithms telescopes recognize filter orbiting objects using modern sky object geosynchronous orbit may many millions years intact material well debris degraded probes could detected even undergone multiple collisions highalbedo objects moving spinning emitting reflections time time possible confirm existence customized searches modern data project search glinting events effectively possible team includes scientists work voluntary basis caltech cambridge university harvard princeton stockholm university university tokyo project also lists affiliated professionals offer useful expertise input research members scientific advisory board philanthropic advisory activities funded donations million funders include frank laukien ceo bruker corporation william linton founder promega corporation listed projects philanthropic advisory board donations reported unconditional funding covers costs expedition retrieve

bizarre aliens far less relevant daily human million two percent large hadron colliders budget even smaller fraction elon musks spacex project valued around creation interstellar object interceptor mission would expensive estimated cost project gained substantial mainstream media applauded many including gained traction social media online communities people interested ufos nbc news article describes project exactly kind research many called release pentagons intelligence report june also various concerns doubts criticism prospects galileo astronomers worried astronomy search extraterrestrial intelligence seti getting undermined projects like galileo senior astronomer seti institute seth shostak compared organizations broader ufounrelated seti efforts loebs project describing preferred approach studying unknown fauna rainforest latters search aliens earths atmosphere hoping find mermaids however shostak also stated loebs peers ie academic astronomical community grateful loebs effort grateful loeb go would dare astronomers also criticized claims projects lead scientist insufficient evidence support bold conjectures alien astrobiologist caleb scharf stated galileo project intermingled legitimate scientists assessed fringe nonetheless august new york times published article loeb related search signs extraterrestrial life galileo
