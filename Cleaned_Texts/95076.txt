blinking bodily function semiautonomic rapid closing single blink determined forceful closing eyelid inactivation levator palpebrae superioris activation palpebral portion orbicularis oculi full open closecitation needed essential function eye helps spread tears across remove irritants surface cornea conjunctiva blinking may functions since occurs often necessary keep eye lubricated researchers think blinking may help disengagement attention following blink onset cortical activity decreases dorsal network increases defaultmode network associated internal blink speed affected elements fatigue eye injury medication disease blinking rate determined blinking center also affected external stimulus animals tortoises hamsters blink eyes independently humans use winking blinking one eye form body language blinking provides moisture eye irrigation using tears lubricant eyes secrete eyelid provides suction across eye tear duct entire eyeball keep drying blinking also protects eye irritants eyelashes hairs attached upper lower eyelids create line defense dust elements eye eyelashes catch irritants reach eyeball multiple muscles control reflexes blinking main muscles upper eyelid control opening closing orbicularis oculi levator palpebrae superioris muscle orbicularis oculi closes eye contraction levator palpebrae muscle opens eye m√ºllers muscle superior tarsal muscle upper eyelid inferior palpebral muscle lower eyelid responsible widening eyes muscles imperative blinking also important many functions squinting winking inferior palpebral muscle coordinated inferior rectus pull lower lid one looks correlation human eyelid blink behavior psychological stress also demonstrated means laboratory lying may affect rate though one may think stimulus triggering blinking dry irritated eyes likely controlled blinking center globus pallidus lenticular body nerve cells base outer surface brain nevertheless external stimuli contribute orbicularis oculi facial muscle therefore actions translated facial nerve root levator palpebrae superioris action sent oculomotor nerve duration blink average milliseconds according ucl ms according harvard database useful biological closures excess ms defined microsleeps greater activation dopaminergic pathways dopamine production striatum associated higher rate spontaneous eye conditions reduced dopamine availability parkinsons disease reduced eye blink conditions raised schizophrenia increased blink rate associated dopaminerelated executive function blinking present major tetrapod crown groups soft tissues involved blinking preserved fossil record study mudskippers group amphibious fish species evolved blinking independently tetrapod species similar purposes suggest blinking involves eye retracting mudskippers may arose response selective pressures upon species shifting aquatic terrestrial habitats example compared aquatic environment terrestrial environment corneal cells must kept moist vital substances like oxygen easily diffuse detritus may adhere eye dry conditions objects may move towards eye faster dangerous speeds air water additionally fully aquatic juvenile stage development eyes positioning blink adults eyes elevate position blink submerged bump surface suggesting blinking emerged adaptation terrestrial life opposed aquatic early tetrapods transition land would later yield nonmudskipper blinking species possessed similar characteristics regarding eye positioning suggest blinking arose response aerial vision terrestrial three types blinking spontaneous blinking done without external stimuli internal effort type blinking conducted premotor brain stem happens without conscious effort like breathing digestion reflex blink occurs response external stimulus contact cornea objects appear rapidly front eye reflex blink necessarily conscious blink either however happen faster spontaneous reflex blink may occur response tactile stimuli eg corneal eyelash skin eyelid contact eyebrow optical stimuli eg dazzle menace reflex auditory stimuli eg menace reflex voluntary blink conscious blink use divisions orbicularis oculi muscle infants blink rate adults fact infants blink average rate one two times minute reason difference unknown suggested infants require amount eye lubrication adults eyelid opening smaller relation adults additionally infants produce tears first month life infants also get significant amount sleep adults discussed earlier fatigued eyes blink however throughout childhood blink rate increases adolescence usually equivalent mixed results studying genderdependentdubious discuss differences blinking rates results varying womens rate nearly doubling mens significant difference addition women using oral contraceptives blink often women average unknown generally blink interval seconds actual rates vary individual averaging around blinks per minute laboratory setting however eyes focused object extended period time reading rate blinking decreases times per major reason eyes dry become fatigued reading eyes dry become fatigued due reading computer screen indication computer vision syndrome computer vision syndrome prevented taking regular breaks focusing objects far screen welllit workplace using blink reminder application studies adults learn maintain healthy blinking rate reading looking computer screen using biofeedback eye blinking criterion diagnosing medical conditions example excessive blinking may help indicate onset tourette syndrome strokes disorders nervous system reduced rate blinking associated parkinsons
