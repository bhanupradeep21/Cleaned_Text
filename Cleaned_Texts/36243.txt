frozen bovine semen method preserving bovine semen future artificial insemination even death donor early artificial insemination organizations largely farmerowned cooperatives first cooperative america organized clinton new jersey efforts enos j perry extension dairyman new brunswick began operations may began operations members cows enrolled using frozen semen dairy cattle done since oldest semen believed existence sire named cottonade emmet member american breeders service sire battery semen collected emmet november used several times produce offspring however last time offspring born osborndale ivanhoe probably famous holstein bull early semen era died november time time calves still born frozen semen ivanhoe member atlantic breeders coop sire battery sons considerable influence include penstate ivanhoe star provin mtn ivanhoe jewel fleetridge monitor grandsons dominated holstein breed include carlinm ivanhoe bell round oak rag apple elevation semen early days artificial insemination delivered every day technicians bull studs semen frozen point addition glycerol semen extenders semen could frozen early days semen extended bulls stud type bottle test tube kept low temperatures delivered technicians usually every day freezing process discovered christopher polge placed containers called glass ampules sealed frozen dry ice alcohol kept type solution needed insemination later liquid nitrogen refrigerator invented union carbide money given john rockefeller prentice used exclusively bull stud number years later giving entire artificial insemination ai industry charge royalty liquid nitrogen boils k allows little deterioration bovine semen ampules fastened cane placed inside canister process insemination involves transferring ampule waterice bath ampule thaws several minutes opened semen drawn pipette semen packages tried include magic wand developed badger breeders coop frozen pipette contained cc extended semen use connector adapter syringe rubber bulb attached air thawed thawed cow frozen polybulb another semen package usage semen actually placed plastic polybulb frozen canes polybulb thawed sealed end cut attached pipette semen expelled pipette several size ampules used early days ampules used curtiss breeding service ampules used tristate breeders coop ampules almost excursively used american breeders service ampules usually attached six metal cane cc ampules attached eight per cane straw package utilized plastic straw invented robert cassou family business called imv france straw made pvc two cotton plugs powder factory end end open semen sucked straw placed directly onto comb semen expelled make airspace straw placed directly pile pvc powder sealed straw straw placed water bath period time plug end sealed dried cloth towels frozen metal racks freezing straws placed water thawed seconds placed stainless steel gun sheath placed gun locked place oring cow inseminated usual way early automated machine invented imv machine would seal straws ultrasonically one one several years later machine would fill seal straws three time came greatly increased processing times bull studs machine would fill three straws time also capability print desired information straw became available late new straw packaging method involving fully automatic filling sealing machine patented german vet ludwig simmet founded german company minitüb since provider semen straws equipment industry early automated machine also invented imv machine would seal straws ultrasonically one one several years later machine would fill seal straws three time came minitüb followed machine fills seals four four straws greatly increased processing times bull studs late minitüb developed first inkjet printer straws machine capability print desired information straw like bull stud identification date production even barcodes automatic filling sealing printing equipment today standard bull semen processing lab bull semen collected

protection areas set cases dairy bulls bull halter rope inserted nose ring led handler safe distance away yet control animal collection area usually stall stanchion mount animal tied mount animal steer cow even another bull bulls rather aggressive problems issues mounting another animal others rather passive may show little interest mounting different scenarios used try entice mount scenarios may include different breed steer different bull even cow sometimes bull may wary individual approaching collect cases blindfold may put eye side bull mounts semen able collected bull doesnt worry going number bulls collected commercial stud setups bulls may good enough enter active ai service however owner may elect use small amount herd perhaps syndicate may want control amount breedings services case bull may sent custom stud collected farm owner may elect collect hundred several thousand units straws bull custom studs semen stored sent breeders cases significant population females particular breed bull may designated supply semen collected sent slaughter however bank supply semen kept storage many years still breeding females many years departed many beef bulls collected stud good share collected farm custom studs many bulls used owners herds beef breeding season however genetic merit used many others well beef bull may able service head via natural service breeding season able service many breeding season via artificial insemination becomes hurt disabled even dies still sire hundreds thousands progeny httpsenwikipediaorgwikifrozenbovinesemen
