coarctation aorta coao also called aortic narrowing congenital condition whereby aorta narrow usually area ductus arteriosus ligamentum arteriosum regression inserts word coarctation means pressing drawing together narrowing coarctations common aortic arch arch may small babies coarctations heart defects may also occur coarctation present typically occurring left side heart patient coarctation left ventricle work harder since aorta narrowed left ventricle must generate much higher pressure normal order force enough blood aorta deliver blood lower part body narrowing severe enough left ventricle may strong enough push blood coarctation thus resulting lack blood lower half body physiologically complete form manifested interrupted aortic archcitation needed three types aortic aortic coarctation aortic stenosis forms aortic narrowing terms word root meanings names different conventional distinction usage allows differentiation clinical aspects spectrum dichotomized idea aortic coarctation occurs aortic arch near ductus arteriosus whereas aortic stenosis occurs aortic root near aortic naturally could present question dividing line post valvular stenosis preductal coarctation nonetheless dichotomy practical use defects either one othercitation needed mild cases children may show signs symptoms first condition may diagnosed later life children born coarctation aorta additional heart defects aortic stenosis ventricular septal defect patent ductus arteriosus mitral valve abnormalitiescitation needed coarctation twice common boys girls frequently found girls turner symptoms may absent mild narrowings coarctation present include breathing difficulties poor appetite trouble feeding failure thrive later children may develop symptoms related problems blood flow enlarged heart may experience dizziness shortness breath fainting nearfainting episodes chest pain abnormal tiredness fatigue headaches nosebleeds cold legs feet pain legs exercise intermittent cases severe coarctations babies may develop serious problems soon birth enough blood get aorta rest body arterial hypertension arms low blood pressure lower extremities classic lower extremities weak pulses femoral arteries arteries feet coarctation typically occurs left subclavian artery however situated blood flow left arm compromised asynchronous radial pulses different strength may detected normal right arm weak delayed left termed radioradial delay cases difference normal radial pulse right arm delayed femoral pulse legs either side may apparent whilst delay would appreciated palpation delayed left arm either femoral pulses hand coarctation occurring left subclavian artery produce synchronous radial pulses radiofemoral delay present palpation either arm arm pulses normal compared

gestation oxygen transferred via placenta fetus results dilatation fetal lung vessels consequence flow blood fetal circulatory system increases including underdeveloped arch suitable fetuses marked increases aortic arch dimensions observed treatment periods two three longterm outcome good patients may however develop narrowing stenosis dilatation previous coarctation site patients unrepaired

endtoend anastomosis coarctatio aortae excision narrowing coarctatio aortae endtoend anastomosis aortic coarctation using different imaging surgical treatment involves resection stenosed segment reanastomosis two complications specific surgery left recurrent nerve palsy chylothorax recurrent laryngeal nerve thoracic duct vicinity chylothorax troublesome complication usually managed conservatively adjusting diet eliminate longchain fatty acids supplementing mediumchain triglycerides conservative management fails surgical intervention often fluorescein dye aid localisation chyle previously hypertension defined blood pressure mm hg since revised american college cardiologyamerican heart association task force blood pressure mm hg higher severe problem heart cause many complications study coarctation repair recipients done groningen netherlands twentynine patients experienced hypertension later years life due repair hypertension many different factors lead stage blood pressure people coarctation repair regardless age operation performed much higher risk general public hypertension later undetected chronic hypertension may result earlier atherosclerosis arterial area lead earlier death among coarctation repair patients higher rates time angioplasty procedure done dilate abnormally narrow section blood vessel allow better blood flow done cardiac catheterization laboratory typically taking two three hours procedure may take longer usually patients able leave hospital day coarctation repair infant patients may experience reoccurring stenosis site original operation fixed either another coarctectomycitation coronary artery disease cad major issue patients undergone coarctation repair many years procedure done heart disease increased chance affecting coarctation patients also progresses levels severity alarmingly increased rate one study one fourth patients experienced coarctation later died heart disease relatively young clinical criteria used studies defining recurrence coarctation recoarctation blood pressure difference mmhg lower upper limbs procedure common infant patients uncommon adult patients infant patients underwent recoarctations less two years age another older children received people coarctation aorta likely bicuspid aortic valve disease patients affected disease bicuspid aortic valve disease big contributor cardiac failure turn makes roughly late deaths coarctation risk recoarctation late hypertension checkups needed year less frequently depending individual case important visit cardiologist regular depending severity patients condition evaluated casebycase level visiting cardiologist year less frequent surveillance checkup keeping regular schedule appointments cardiologist coarctation procedure complete helps increase chances optimal health patients nowadays life expectancy considered normal given repair successfully done early childhood treatment recoarctation usually successfully done without need openheart surgery recoarctation increasingly less common modern era late hypertension also seem much less problem coarctation repair performed within first years life life expectancy quality life therefore close normal population check ups recommended percent need treatment get condition largely unidentified century history condition prior understood via postmortem records first
