coomassie brilliant blue name two similar triphenylmethane dyes developed use textile industry commonly used staining proteins analytical biochemistry coomassie brilliant blue differs coomassie brilliant blue addition two methyl groups name coomassie registered trademark imperial chemical industries name coomassie adopted end century trade name blackleybased dye manufacturer levinstein ltd

coomassie trademark company longer manufactures dyes blue disulfonated triphenylmethane dyes first produced max weiler based elberfeld various patents subsequently taken organic papers published biochemistry journals frequently refer dyes simply coomassie without specifying dye used fact colour index lists dyes coomassie name also coomassie blue dyes example merck index edition lists coomassie blue rl acid blue ci completely different structure suffix r name coomassie brilliant blue abbreviation red blue colour dye slight reddish tint g variant blue colour greenish tint originally denoted purity dye colour two dyes depends acidity solution g form dye studied ph less dye red colour absorption maximum wavelength nm ph around dye green absorption maximum nm ph dye bright blue maximum nm ph dye extinction coefficient different colours result different charged states dye molecule red form three nitrogen atoms carry positive charge two sulfonic acid groups extremely low pka normally negatively charged thus ph around zero dye cation overall charge green colour corresponds form dye net overall charge neutral media ph nitrogen atom diphenylamine moiety carries positive charge blue dye molecule anion overall charge pka values losses two protons respectively final proton lost alkaline conditions dye becomes pink pka dye interacts electrostatically noncovalently amino carboxyl groups proteins dye molecules bind proteins including wool keratin form complex formation complex stabilises negatively charged anionic form dye producing blue colour even acid conditions molecules solution cationic basis bradford assay quantifies protein coomassie brilliant blue dye binding binding dye protein causes shift absorbance maximum dye nm increase absorption nm monitored determine protein dye also forms complex anionic detergent sodium dodecylsulfate formation complex stabilizes neutral green form dye effect interfere estimation protein concentration using bradford assay also likely anionic detergent competes dye binding protein coomassie brilliant blue first used visualise proteins fazekas de st groth colleagues protein samples separated electrophoretically cellulose acetate sheet sheet soaked sulfosalicylic acid fix protein bands transferred solution two years later meyer lambert used coomassie brilliant blue stain protein samples electrophoretic separation polyacrylamide gel soaked gel dye solution containing methanol acetic acid water dye stained polyacrylamide gel well protein order visualise protein bands needed destain gel subsequent publications reported polyacrylamide gels could successfully destained using acetic acid solution first report use g form dye visualise protein bands polyacrylamide gels came dye dissolved acetic acid solution containing subsequently discovered protein bands could stained without staining polyacrylamide using colloid g form dye trichloroacetic acid solution containing methanol procedure longer necessary destain modern formulations typically use colloid g form dye solution containing phosphoric acid ethanol methanol ammonium sulfate aluminium bradford assay uses spectral properties coomassie brilliant blue estimate amount protein protein sample added solution dye phosphoric acid ethanol acid conditions dye normally brownish colour binding protein blue form dye produced optical absorbance solution measured wavelength nm dye noted high level sensitivity Î¼g proteinclarification needed detected however among disadvantages method variability color development different proteins absorbance change per unit mass proteins varies type binding protein negatively charged coomassie brilliant blue dye molecule give overall negative charge protein property used separate proteins protein complexes using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis nondenaturing conditions technique called blue native mobility complex polyacrylamide gel depend size protein complex ie molecular weight amount dye
