four main mechanisms microorganisms exhibit resistance antimicrobials betalactam antibiotics penicillin cephalosporin chloramphenicol binds penicillinbinding proteins inhibiting peptidoglycan synthesis bind ribosome subunit inhibiting formation peptide bonds plasmid encode betalactamase open betalactam ring inactivating plasmid encode enzyme acetylate drug thereby inactivating betalactam
