soiltransmitted helminthiasis type worm infection helminthiasis caused different species roundworms caused specifically worms transmitted soil contaminated faecal matter therefore called soiltransmitted helminths three types soiltransmitted helminthiasis distinguished ascariasis hookworm infection whipworm infection three types infection therefore caused large roundworm lumbricoides hookworms necator americanus ancylostoma duodenale whipworm trichuris trichiura become common parasitic disease humans approximately two billion people third global population infected latest estimate four billion risk surpassing even alltime prevalent parasitic disease largest numbers cases occur impoverished rural areas subsaharan africa latin america southeast asia main cause like many types helminth infections lack sanitation practice open defecation lack hygiene hand washing walking barefoot contaminated regarded one worlds important causes intellectual physical helminthic disease named infection transmitted ingestion nematode eggs soil contaminated excrements therefore disease prevalent warm moist climates sanitation hygiene poor waters unsafe including temperate zones warmer months sth categorised among neglected tropical diseases inflicts tremendous disability suffering clinically treated relatively easily prevented primarily improved sanitation yet negligible attention given many among target diseases london declaration neglected tropical diseases launched january controllederadicated simple prevention control strategies access improved sanitation public awareness personal hygiene health education soiltransmitted helminths essentially intestinal parasites eggs liberated along faeces infected persons soil ascaris hookworm eggs become infective develop larvae soil infection occurs vegetables fruits contaminated soil infested eggs consumed hands fingers contaminated dirt carrying eggs put mouth hand hookworm eggs directly infective hatch soil releasing mobile larvae penetrate skin thus infection acquired accidental contact contaminated ascariasis sth caused large roundworm lumbricoides estimated widespread sth affecting approximately billion people victims constitute half populations tropical subtropical areas conditions mild often show little symptoms heavy infections however debilitating causing severe intestinal blockage impair growth children children compounded malnutrition infected common age group annual death children susceptible due frequent exposure contaminated environment playing eating raw vegetables fruits drinking hookworm infection sth caused n americanus duodenale mild infections produce diarrhoea abdominal pain severe infections create serious health problems newborns children pregnant women malnourished adults fact leading cause anaemia protein deficiency developing nations affected estimated million people n americanus common hookworm duodenale geographically restricted unlike sths schoolage children affected highintensity hookworm infections frequent adults specifically women roughly million pregnant women estimated infected disease causes severe adverse effects mother infant low birth weight impaired milk production increased risk whipworm trichuris trichiura third common sthcausing nematode humans according current estimate nearly million people infected majority children heavy infections could lead acute symptoms diarrhoea anaemia chronic symptoms growth retardation impaired cognitive development medical conditions often serious since coinfection protozoan parasites giardia entamoeba histolytica nematodes predominantly tropical disease developing countries trichuriasis quite common united symptoms becomes evident intensity infection relatively high thus degree negative outcomes directly related worm burden worms means greater severity conditions sth light worm burden usually discernible symptoms heavy infections however cause range health problems including abdominal pain diarrhoea blood protein loss rectal prolapse physical mental retardation severe ascariasis typically pneumonia larvae invade lungs producing fever cough dyspnoea early stage hookworm infections insinuate skin reaction dermatitis increased white blood cells eosinophils pulmonary reaction pneumonitis skin rash iron deficiency anaemia due blood loss common sth often associated malnutrition children worsens nutritional status multiple worms induce intestinal bleeding competition nutrients malabsorption nutrients frequent anaemia soiltransmitted helminths also cause loss nutritional knock effects sth significant impact mental physical development children endemic countries communities remain suppressed due malnourishment cognitive disability physical weaknesses result heavy basic diagnosis specific helminths generally identified faeces eggs microscopically examined enumerated using fecal egg count method however certain limitations inability identify mixed infections clinical practice technique inaccurate novel effective method egg analysis technique highly accurate rapid method lumbricoides trichiura however much hookworm could due fast degeneration rather delicate hookworm prevention control measures prevent soiltransmitted helminthiasis following availability clean water personal domestic uses improved access sanitation includes use properly functioning clean toilets community members education personal hygiene hand washing hygienic safe food preparation eliminating use untreated human faeces world health organizations recommended albendazole mebendazole one strategy control disease areas common treatment entire groups people regardless symptoms via mass drug administration world health organization recommends mass treatments atrisk groups endemic communities especially women childbearing age children mass treatments also provided pregnant women second third trimesters breastfeeding known mass infected treating children effective significant evidence concludes routine deworming absence positive test improve nutrition haemoglobin school attendance school purpose broadspectrum benzimidazoles mebendazole albendazole drugs choice recommended anthelminthics safe inexpensive effective several months mebendazole given twice day three consecutive days albendazole given single dose recommends annual treatment areas people infected twice year treatment low risk situations ie less prevalence casebycase addition pyrantel pamoate also equally effective ascaris however reported albendazole mebendazole pyrantel pamoate entirely effective trichiura single oral doses populationbased cases coinfection combination therapy ivermectin diethylcarbamazine advocated however coinfection malaria hiv especially among african women respond well current combination pressing trichuriasis recommended drugs fail provide positive novel drug tribendimidine approved china ccdc human use subjected clinical trials showing
