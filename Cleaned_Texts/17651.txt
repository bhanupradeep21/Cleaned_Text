koinophilia evolutionary hypothesis proposing sexual selection animals preferentially seek mates minimum unusual mutant features including functionality appearance koinophilia intends explain clustering sexual organisms species issues described darwins term derives greek word koinos meaning common shared philia meaning fondness natural selection causes beneficial inherited features become common expense disadvantageous counterparts koinophilia hypothesis proposes sexuallyreproducing animal would therefore expected avoid individuals rare unusual features prefer mate individuals displaying predominance common average mutants strange odd peculiar features would avoided mutations manifest changes appearance functionality behavior impossible judge whether new mutation beneficial might advantageous unforeseeable future koinophilic animals avoid cost avoiding occasional potentially beneficial thus koinophilia although infallible ability distinguish fit unfit mates good strategy choosing mate koinophilic choice ensures offspring likely inherit suite features attributes served members species well koinophilia differs like prefers like mating pattern assortative like preferred like leucistic animals white peacocks would sexually attracted one another leucistic subspecies would come koinophilia predicts unlikely leucistic animals attracted average way members species since nonleucistic animals attracted leucism leucistic individuals find mates leucistic lineages rarely form koinophilia provides simple explanations almost universal canalization sexual creatures rarity
