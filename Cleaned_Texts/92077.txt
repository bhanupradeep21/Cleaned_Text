tubers type enlarged structure used storage organs nutrients plants used plants perennation survival winter dry months provide energy nutrients regrowth next growing season means asexual stem tubers form thickened rhizomes underground stems stolons horizontal connections organisms well known species stem tubers include potato yam writers also treat modified lateral roots root tubers definition found sweet potatoes cassava dahlias term originates latin tuber meaning lump bump writers define term tuber mean structures derived others use term structures derived stems stem tuber forms thickened rhizomes stolons top sides tuber produce shoots grow typical stems leaves undersides produce roots tend form sides parent plant often located near soil surface underground tuber normally shortlived storage regenerative organ developing shoot branches mature plant offspring new tubers attached parent tuber form end hypogeogenous initiated ground rhizome autumn plant dies except new offspring tubers one dominant bud spring regrows new shoot producing stems leaves summer tubers decay new tubers begin grow plants also form smaller tubers tubercules act like seeds producing small plants resemble morphology size seedlings stem tubers longlived tuberous begonias many plants tubers survive plants fully leafed point tuber reduced shriveledup huskcitation needed stem tubers generally start enlargements hypocotyl section seedling sometimes also include first node two epicotyl upper section root tuber vertical orientation one vegetative buds top fibrous roots produced bottom basal section typically tuber oblong rounded shapecitation needed tuberous begonias cyclamens commonly grown stem tubers mignonette vine anredera cordifolia produces aerial stem tubers ft vines tubers fall ground grow plectranthus esculentus mint family lamiaceae produces tuberous underground organs base stem weighing kg lb oz per tuber forming axillary buds producing short stolons grow even though legumes commonly associated forming stem tubers lathyrus tuberosus example native asia europe grown potatoes stem tubers enlarged stolons thicken develop storage tuber parts normal stem including nodes internodes nodes eyes leaf scar nodes eyes arranged around tuber spiral fashion beginning end opposite attachment point stolon terminal bud produced farthest point away stolon attachment tubers thus show apical dominance normal stem internally tuber filled starch stored enlarged parenchymalike cells inside tuber typical cell structures stem including pith vascular zones cortexcitation needed tuber produced one growing season used perennate plant means propagation fall comes aboveground structure plant dies tubers survive underground winter spring regenerate new shoots use stored food tuber grow main shoot develops tuber base shoot close tuber produces adventitious roots lateral buds shoot shoot also produces stolons long etiolated stems stolon elongates long days presence high auxins levels prevent root growth stolon new tuber formation begins stolon must certain age enzyme lipoxygenase makes hormone jasmonic acid involved control potato tuber developmentcitation needed stolons easily recognized potato plants grown seeds plants grow stolons produced around soil surface nodes tubers form close soil surface sometimes even top ground potatoes cultivated tubers cut pieces planted much deeper soil planting pieces deeper creates area plants generate tubers size increases pieces sprout shoots grow surface shoots rhizomelike generate short stolons nodes ground shoots reach soil surface produce roots shoots grow green plantcitation needed tuberous root storage root modified lateral root enlarged function storage organ enlarged area tuber produced end middle root involve entire root thus different origin similar function appearance stem tuber plants tuberous roots include sweet potato ipomoea batatas cassava dahliacitation needed root tubers perennating organs thickened roots store nutrients periods plant actively grow thus permitting survival one year next massive enlargement secondary roots typically represented sweet potato internal external cell tissue structures normal root produce adventitious roots stems produce adventitious root tubers nodes internodes reduced leaves proximal end tuber attached old plant crown tissue produces buds grow new stems distal end tuber normally produces unmodified roots stem tubers order reversed distal end producing stems tuberous roots biennial duration plant produces tubers first year end growing season shoots often die leaving newly generated tubers next growing season tubers produce new shoots shoots new plant grow stored reserves tuber consumed production new roots stems reproductive organs remaining root tissue dies concurrently plants regeneration next generation tuberscitation needed hemerocallis fulva daylily number daylily hybrids large root tubers h fulva spreads underground end new fan grows roots produce thick tubers send root tubers along storage tissues plants produce consumed animals rich source nutrients root tubers arrowhead plants genus sagittaria eaten plants root tubers propagated late summer late winter digging tubers separating making sure piece crown tissue replantingcitation needed httpsenwikipediaorgwikituber
