global neurosurgery field intersection public health clinical neurosurgery aims expand provision improved equitable neurosurgical care global neurosurgery clinical public health practice neurosurgery primary purpose ensuring timely safe affordable neurosurgical care need term global neurosurgery first used canadian neurosurgeon dwight parkinson describe comprehensive clinical neurosurgery care however field defined today born modern definition global neurosurgery born combination global health neurosurgery hence global neurosurgery conceived subspecialty global health within global around million people affected diseases amenable neurosurgery year million require surgical burden diseases amenable neurosurgery disproportionately distributed globally low middleincome countries bearing low middleincome countries lack workforce infrastructure funding data needed address disease highincome country patients especially rural areas economicallydisadvantaged backgrounds face unique challenges accessing safe timely affordable neurosurgical reason global neurosurgery work focused access care low middleincomce countries despite global nature disparities accessing neurosurgical global neurosurgery practice involves advocacy education policy research service components global neurosurgery practice interdependent global neurosurgeons tend focus practice one two trend allowed specialization within field greater collaboration individuals advocacy efforts happen international regional local levels collaboration health initiatives share similar goals global neurosurgery universal health coverage sustainable development internationally global neurosurgery advocacy groups participate highlevel health policy events like world health assembly united nations general global neurosurgery advocates contributed numerous highlevel decisions including folate fortification detection management congenital malformations injury locally global neurosurgery advocacy groups constituted health workers patient advocates groups affect local decision making equally active internationally many local advocacy groups members international advocacy groups like people organisations united spina bifida hydrocephalus push global international federation spina bifida hydrocephalus local global neurosurgery advocacy groups work within international organizations coordinate advocacy efforts regionally globally global neurosurgery education focuses two aspects first global neurosurgery educators train specialists serve underresourced regions training focuses primarily safe quality service delivery within underserved communities global neurosurgery education efforts divided nonspecialized specialized training nonspecialized training education

practice service delivery oldest component global neurosurgery practice traced back colonial era surgeons would deliver care global neurosurgery aims reduce barriers essential emergency neurosurgery procedures needed acute stroke neural tube defects traumatic brain injuries traumatic spine low middleincome country patients worse outcomes highincome country counterparts regularly face barriers accessing timely safe neurosurgical workforce deficit low middleincome countries constitutes significant barrier receiving care although former colonies trained local neurosurgeons since independence neurosurgical workforce density many low middleincome countries remains world federation neurosurgical societies recommendation neurosurgeon per addition majority low middle income countries geographical disparities neurosurgical workforce neurosurgeons working urban areas whereas majority people countries addition surgical nongovernmental organizations highincome countries help fill service delivery gap low middleincome although neurosurgical nongovernmental organizations offer shortterm service delivery low middleincome countries like cure international offer longterm neurosurgical workforce low middleincome countries increased gradually past decade thanks targeted efforts global neurosurgery community example world federation neurosurgical societies supports training aspiring neurosurgeons understaffed countries scholarships accredited centers africa asia south young neurosurgeons underresourced regions trained advanced neurosurgical techniques report
