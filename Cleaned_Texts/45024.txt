maelstrom battle earth begins realtime strategy game developed kdvision russia published codemasters maelstrom battle earth begins set postapocalyptic future following ecological disaster results much planets submersion well subsequent nuclear holocaust remaining resources humankind taken refuge beneath surface taking shelter longstanding war guerillawarfare remnants hitech ascension midst war alien race facing extinction known haigenti appear quickly flooding land slaughtering remnants ascension alike game utilises lot technology used kds previous rts game perimeter features terraforming weather control far unique genre said core gameplay maelstrom battle earth begins player also control hero units directly third person perspective maelstrom battle earth begins gameplay requires players construct bases harvesting resources order fund production various units well construction structures order aid players efforts defeat enemy resources uniform factions referred different names functionally identical three main resources obtained survivor compounds water pumps sun resource utilized different ways example water used give units speed boost battle well act healing base haigenti units staple requirement researching upgrades resources also harvested battlefields different ways biomass useless ascension remnant forces salvage useful remnants players also command group several units issuing orders birds eye view commanding means direct control players take control factions hero unit play game thirdperson perspective giving significant advantage range sight well ability launch preemptive strike terraforming plays significant role gameplay well remnants ascension units terraform land suit needs creating artificial hills ditches either barring units entering exiting also used staging defensive stronghold haigenti terraform instead flood map means mutagen pumps giving advantage early game vehicles remnants guerillawarfare based group led james buchanan consisting army recruits war veterans across world essentially forming last formidable army anywhere world remnants wide variety units compensate low damage lowtech gear units much mobile take small amounts damage wearing remnants utilize salvage solar power fresh water remnants utilize conventional weapons stealth tactics order wear enemies remnant units specialised focusing one particular form combat rather general purpose unit remnant bases constructed survivor compounds havens provide infinite source salvage act construction site middle man scavenger barracks remnant infantry salvage harvested remains vehicles well survivor compounds use havens vehicles scavengers take damage submerged water unless amphibious upgrades researched ascension hitech remains corporation headed arlan khan suffers messianic complex proceeds command troops totalitarian manner showing little concern dead ascension focuses powerful allpurpose units somewhat inflexible terms base expansion ascension harvests dna solar power hydrogen ascension utilize hitech laser weaponry advanced technology raw firepower place unit diversity ascension bases constructed anywhere battlefield means vanguard unit ascension buildings constructed vanguard deconstruct relocate need arises unlike remnants however dna harvested survivor compounds means manipulator unit perform terraforming like scavenger construct anything hydrogen harvested water pumps used purpose water resources solar energy generated automatically ascension buildings act solar generators ascension units buildings capable regenerating shields lack regenerative capacity whatsoever ascension compensate lack units including vehicles morph forms suit battle example ground units effective infantry transform aerial antivehicle units become stationary turrets longrange artillery much like remnants vehicles manipulators take damage submersion unless vehicles hover water haigenti aliens come earth middle struggle ascension remnants use mechanical units race bioconstructs engineered specific purpose invasion led mammon overseen known overseer haigenti biological vehicles transport systems bases consist three buildings inception spore biomass farm mutagen pump haigenti shields regenerate water haigenti harvest two resources namely biomass mutagen unlike two factions haigenti multiple base structures separate facilities constructing infantry vehicles units spawned eggs called inception spores also act primary research centre eggs hatch one variety units depending size biomass harvested constructing biomass farms top survivor compounds also create biothralls units sacrificed inside egg resulting stronger hatched creature biomass also harvested enemy friendly corpses mutagen acts equivalent water resource also behaves healing agent water pumped unlike factions mutagen pumps constructed water stations flood land healing aliens swimming waters inception spore evolvedupgraded allowing eggs improve size thrall capacity well providing access upgrades inception spore last evolved stage called elder spore call extremely powerful melee unit called titan however costs lot water biomass
