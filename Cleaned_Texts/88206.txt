alternating hemiplegia childhood ahc ultrarare neurological disorder named transient episodes often referred attacks hemiplegia weakness paralysis condition experience typically presents age months hemiplegic attacks cause anything mild weakness complete paralysis one sides body vary greatly duration attacks may also alternate one side body alternate affecting one sides single attack besides hemiplegia symptoms disorder include extremely broad range neurological developmental impairments well understood normally hemiplegia associated symptoms cease completely sleep may recur upon frequently ahc caused spontaneous mutation extremely rare disorder approximately people ahc recently discovered first characterized ahc patients exhibit wide range symptoms addition hemiplegic characterized paroxysmal nonparoxysmal symptoms paroxysmal symptoms generally associated hemiplegic attacks may occur suddenly hemiplegia paroxysmal symptoms may last variable amounts time nonparoxysmal symptoms tend side effects ahc present times episodes attacks epilepsy also considered paroxysmal symptom plays important role progression diagnosis ahccitation needed chronologically hemiplegic attacks always first symptom ahc prominent symptom well symptom disorder named hemiplegic attacks may affect one sides body attacks affect sides body may referred either bilateral quadriplegic attacks one unique characteristics ahc hemiplegic attacks well symptoms may cooccur hemiplegia cease immediately upon sleep strong attacks symptoms may reoccur upon hemiplegic attacks occur suddenly gradually severity attack vary attacks may alternate one side body another though length attacks may also vary minutes though length attacks varies greatly people attacks one bilateral hemiplegic attacks associated pseudobulbar features dysphagia dysarthria respiratory paralysis also often accompanied changes skin color temperature sweating restlessness tremor screaming appearance hemiplegic attacks happen irregularly occur speech eating swallowing impairment patients ahc frequently underweight due side average age onset hemiplegic episodes found months early onset gives name disorder slightly misleading ending childhood ahc exclusively limited childhood attacks cases become milder first ten years life never completely ahc patients exhibited various paroxysmal symptoms manifest different degrees paroxysmal symptoms include tonic tonicclonic myoclonic limb dystonic posturing choreoathetosis ocular nystagmus various ocular motor almost half people dystonic symptoms prior experiencing symptoms generally begin months ocular motor abnormalities occur early frequent early symptoms ahc particularly almost people disorder episodic ocular motor features within days birth many also experienced hemiplegia dystonia months final symptom may considered paroxysmal temporary change behavior patients become unreasonable demanding aggressive either patients symptoms known whether caused symptoms usually manifest first months childs life average onset months frequently symptoms manifest neonatal period paroxysmal symptoms often used help diagnose ahc since simple test itcitation needed cases eegs taken paroxysmal events characterized generalized background overall however eeg episodes investigative methods brain mri tacs angiographic mris cfs normal long term many paroxysmal symptoms occur along ahc symptoms vary strength depending person consistent features thought symptoms brought worsened hemiplegic attacks though known certain patients experience persistent motor movement ataxia cognitive deficits become apparent time include developmental delays social problems rare someone ahc cognitive deficits study japan find two patients met diagnostic criteria ahc mentally known whether ahc progressive disease severe attacks suspected cause damage result permanent loss children studied usa form mental impairment usually described mild varies greatly among individuals least people ahc also ahc often misdiagnosed epilepsy epileptic events distinguished episodes alteration consciousness well frequent tonic tonicclonic activity epileptic episodes generally rare though increase age due rarity epileptic episodes eeg confirmations themcitation needed recent research suggests ahc caused de novo spontaneous genetic mutation chromosome locus encodes enzyme small number cases seem caused mutation mutation inherited autosomal dominant pattern previously ahc thought form complicated migraine strong family histories migraine reported ahc ahc also considered movement disorder form epilepsy suggested causes included channelopathy mitochondrial dysfunction cerebrovascular disorder closely related ahc familial hemiplegic migraine caused mutation gene calcium channel receptors thus thought ahc may caused similar approximately people ahc described scientific due rarity complexity ahc unusual initial diagnosis incorrect diagnosis delayed several months initial symptoms become average age diagnosis diagnosis ahc difficult rarity diagnostic test making diagnosis exclusion several generally accepted criteria define disorder however conditions similar presentation hsv encephalitis must first ruled due diagnostic difficulties possible commonness disease underestimatedcitation needed following descriptions commonly used diagnosis ahc initial four criteria classifying ahc begins months age includes attacks hemiplegia either side body well autonomic problems involuntary eye movement episodic monocular nystagmus improper eye alignment choreoathetosis sustained muscle contractions finally condition often develop intellectual disabilities delayed development neurological diagnostic criteria updated include fact symptoms dissipate immediately upon sleeping diagnostic criteria also expanded include episodes bilateral hemiplegia shifted one side body recent criteria proposed screening ahc early order improve diagnostic timeline screening criteria include focal unilateral paroxysmal dystonia first months life well possibility flaccid hemiplegia either separate symptoms paroxysmal ocular movements also considered include binocular monocular symptoms show first months overall outcomes ahc generally poor contributed ahcs various diagnostic management challenges long term ahc debilitating due hemiplegic attacks permanent damage associated ahc damage include cognitive impairment behavioral psychiatric disorders various motor however yet conclusive evidence ahc fatal shortens life expectancy relatively recent discovery disorder makes large data type information unavailable treatment ahc extremely successful several drugs available treatment well management strategies preventing dealing hemiplegic attackscitation needed hemiplegic attacks brought particular triggers management ahc often centers around avoiding common known triggers triggers vary greatly person person also common ones prevalent many patients common triggers include temperature changes water exposure bright lights certain foods emotional stress physical activity avoiding triggers may help prevent hemiplegic episodes many occur without triggered attacks associated symptoms end sleep various sedatives used help patients common drug used treat ahc flunarizine flunarizine functions acting calcium channel blocker drugs order frequency use benzodiazepines carbamazapine barbiturates valproic acid flunarizine prescribed purpose reducing severity ahc attacks number episodes though rarely stops attacks minimizing attacks may help reduce damage body hemiplegic attacks improve longterm outcomes far mental physical disabilities experts differ confidence flunarizines studies found effective reducing duration severity frequency hemiplegic generally considered best treatment available drug thought little benefit ahc patients many affected people experience adverse effects without seeing flunarizine also causes problems difficult patients obtain readily available united statescitation needed clinical research university utah investigated whether sodium oxybate also known gammahydroxybutyric acid effective treatment thus far small number patients sampled conclusive results yet available success thus far drug ahc patients known respond well initially drugs effectiveness decline time currently sodium oxybate used narcolepsycataplexy treatment though past used controversially nutritional supplements drug chosen test possible link causes narcolepsycataplexy ahccitation needed
