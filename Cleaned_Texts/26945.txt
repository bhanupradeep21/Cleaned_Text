curiosity latin cūriōsitās cūriōsus careful diligent curious akin cura care quality related inquisitive thinking exploration investigation learning evident humans curiosity associated withvague aspects human development derives process learning desire acquire knowledge term curiosity also denote behavior characteristic emotion curious regard desire gain knowledge information curiosity behavior emotion driving force behind human development developments science language many species display curiosity including apes cats common human beings ages research shown curiosity fixed attribute amongst humans rather nurtured early definitions curiosity call motivated desire motivational desire said stem passion appetite knowledge information understanding traditional ideas curiosity expanded consider difference perceptual curiosity innate exploratory behavior present animals epistemic curiosity desire knowledge specifically attributed daniel recognized three classes variables playing role evoking curiosity psychophysical variables ecological variables collative variables psychophysical variables correspond physical intensity ecological variables motivational significance task relevance collative variables involve comparison different stimuli features may actually perceived may recalled memory berlyne mentioned four collative variables novelty complexity uncertainty conflict though suggested collative variables probably involve conflict additionally considered three variables supplementary novelty change surprisingness incongruity finally curiosity may aroused perception stimulus associated aforementioned variables specific exploration also lack stimulation boredom diversive curiositydriven behavior often defined behavior knowledge gained form exploratory behavior therefore encompasses behaviors provide access increase sensory information divided curiositydriven behavior three categories orienting responses locomotor exploration investigatory responses investigatory manipulation previously suggested curiosity also includes verbal activities asking questions symbolic activities consisting internally fueled mental processes thinking epistemic exploration like desires needstates take appetitive quality eg foodhunger curiosity linked exploratory behavior experiences reward curiosity described terms positive emotions acquiring knowledge ones curiosity aroused considered inherently rewarding pleasurable discovering new information may also rewarding help reduce undesirable states uncertainty rather stimulating interest theories arisen attempts understand need rectify states uncertainty desire participate pleasurable experiences exploratory behaviors curiositydrive theory posits undesirable experiences uncertainty ambiguity reduction unpleasant feelings rewarding theory suggests people desire coherence understanding thought processes coherence disrupted something unfamiliar uncertain ambiguous individuals curiositydrive causes collect information knowledge unfamiliar restore coherent thought processes theory suggests curiosity developed desire make sense unfamiliar aspects ones environment exploratory behaviors understanding unfamiliar achieved coherence restored behaviors desires derivations curiositydrive theory differ whether curiosity primary secondary drive curiositydrive originates due ones need make sense regulate ones environment caused external causes range basic needs need satisfied eg hunger thirst needs fearinduced derived theories state whether need primary secondary curiosity develops experiences create sensation uncertainty perceived unpleasantness curiosity acts dispel uncertainty exhibiting curious exploratory behavior one able gain knowledge unfamiliar thus reduce state uncertainty unpleasantness theory however address idea curiosity often displayed even absence new unfamiliar type exploratory behavior common many species human toddler bored current situation devoid arousing stimuli walk finds something interesting observation curiosity even absence novel stimuli pinpoints one major shortcomings curiositydrive model optimalarousal theory developed need explain desire seek opportunities engage exploratory behaviors without presence uncertain ambiguous situations optimalarousal suggests one motivated maintain pleasurable sense arousal exploratory stimulus encountered associated complexity uncertainty conflict novelty increases arousal optimal point exploratory behavior employed learn stimulus thereby reduce arousal contrast environment boring lacks excitement arousal reduced optimal point exploratory behavior employed increase information input stimulation thereby increasing arousal theory addresses curiosity elicited uncertain unfamiliar situations curiosity elicited absence situations cognitiveconsistency theories assume two simultaneously active cognitive structures logically inconsistent arousal increased activates processes expected consequence increasing consistency decreasing similar optimalarousal theory cognitiveconsistency theory suggests tendency maintain arousal preferred expected level also explicitly links amount arousal amount experienced inconsistency expected situation actually perceived situation inconsistency small exploratory behavior triggered curiosity employed gather information expectancy updated learning match perception thereby reducing approach associates curiosity aggression fear inconsistency larger fear aggressive behavior may employed alter perception order make match expectancy depending size inconsistency well specific context aggressive behavior alters perception forcefully manipulating matching expected situation fear prompts flight removes inconsistent stimulus perceptual field thus resolves taking account shortcomings curiositydrive optimalarousal theories attempts made integrate neurobiological aspects reward wanting pleasure comprehensive theory curiosity research suggests desiring new information involves mesolimbic pathways brain account forclarification needed dopamine activation use pathways dopamine activation may brain assigns value new information interprets theory neurobiology supplement curiositydrive theory explaining motivation exploratory behavior although curiosity widely regarded root causes largely empirically unknown however studies provided insight neurological mechanisms make known reward may influence characteristics associated curiosity learning memory motivation due complex nature curiosity research focuses specific neural processes characteristics help us understand phenomenon curiosity whole following descriptions characteristics curiosity links neurological aspects essential creating exploratory behaviors drive learn new information perform action may prompted anticipation reward learn motivation reward may help us understand reward defined positive reinforcement action reinforcement encourages particular behavior means emotional sensations relief pleasure satisfaction correlate happiness many areas brain process reward come together form called reward pathway pathway many neurotransmitters play role activation reward sensation including dopamine serotonin dopamine linked curiosity assigns retains reward values information gained research suggests higher amounts dopamine released reward unknownclarification needed stimulus unfamiliar compared activation dopamine stimulus nucleus accumbens formation neurons important reward pathway release dopamine investigating response novel exciting stimuli fast dopamine release observed childhood adolescence important development curiosity exploratory behavior largest facilitators learning early yearscitation needed sensation pleasure liking occur opioids released nucleus accumbens helps someone evaluate unfamiliar situation environment attach value novel object processes wanting liking play role activating reward system brain perhaps stimulation curious informationseeking tendencies caudate nucleus region brain highly responsive dopamine another component reward pathway research suggests caudate nucleus anticipates possibility reward exploratory behavior gathered information thus contributing factors regions anterior insula anterior cingulate cortex correspond toclarification needed conflict arousal seem reinforce certain exploratory models cortisol chemical known role stress regulation however cortisol may also associated curious exploratory behavior studies suggesting role cortisol curiosity support optimal arousal theory suggest release cortisol causing stress encourages curious behavior much stress initiate back away attention important curiosity allows one selectively focus concentrate particular stimuli surrounding environment limited cognitive sensory resources understand evaluate stimuli attention allows brain better focus perceives important relevant stimuli individuals tend focus stimuli particularly stimulating engaging attention stimulus garners frequent ones energy focus directed towards stimulus suggests individual focus new unfamiliar stimuli effort better understand make sense unknown rather familiar repetitive striatum part brain coordinates motivation body movementthe striatum likely plays role attention reward anticipation important provoking precuneus region brain involved attention episodic memory visuospatial processing correlation amount grey matter precuneus levels curious exploratory behaviors suggests precuneus density influence levels memory plays important role curiosity memory brain stores accesses stored information curiosity desire seek understand unfamiliar novel stimuli memory helps determine stimulus indeed unfamiliar order determine stimulus novel individual must remember stimulus encountered curiosity may also affect memory stimuli novel tend capture attention additionally novel stimuli usually reward value associated anticipated reward learning new information may bring stronger associations attention devoted stimulus probable memory formed stimulus longer lasting easier recall facilitate better learning hippocampus important memory formation recall therefore determining novelty various research suggests hippocampus involved generating motivation explore purpose parahippocampal gyrus phg area grey matter surrounding hippocampus implicated amplification amygdala associated emotional processing particularly emotion fear well memory important processing emotional reactions towards novel unexpected stimuli induction exploratory behavior suggests connection curiosity levels amygdala however research needed direct jean piaget argued babies children
