developing crepis model plant enable genetic investigations similar possible model insect drosophila melanogaster like genera stebbins previously studied crepis commonly hybridized displayed polyploidy chromosome doubling could make seed without fertilization process known apomixis collaboration babcock stebbins produced numerous papers two monographs first monograph published resulted

described concept polyploid complex role plant evolution genera crepis complex reproductive forms center sexually diploid populations also given rise polyploid ones babcock stebbins also observed allopolyploid types formed hybridization two different species always wider distribution diploid autotetraploid species proposed polyploids formed hybridization greater potential exploit varied environments inherit traits parents also showed hybridization polyploid complex could provide mechanism genetic exchange diploid species otherwise unable breed observations offered insight species formation knowledge complex processes could provide information history genus monograph described swedish botanist Ã¥ke gustafsson important work formation species stebbinss review significance polyploidy plant evolution published american naturalist demonstrated work done artificial polyploids natural polyploid complexes shown polyploidy important developing large complex widespread genera however looking history polyploidy plant families argued polyploidy common herbaceous perennials infrequent woody plants annuals polyploids played conservative role evolution since problems fertility prevented acquisition replication new genetic material might lead new line work continued paper types polyploids classification significance detailed system classification polyploids described

different environments one books original chapters used cytogenetics work c darlington show genetic systems like hybridization polyploidy also subject book offered original hypotheses stebbins hoped
