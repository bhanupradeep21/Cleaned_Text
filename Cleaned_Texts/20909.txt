species chances survival unknown means navigation may involved research needed several different kinds marine animals demonstrate natal homing commonly known sea turtle loggerhead sea turtles thought show two different types homing first comes early stages life first heading sea animals carried tides currents little swimming involved recent studies show animals demonstrate homing feeding grounds near natal birthplace turtles specific natal beach show differences mitochondrial dna haplotypes distinguish turtles nesting many turtles beaches show feeding areas reaching sexual maturity atlantic

freshwater spawning habitat one extreme migrations animal kingdom life cycle salmon begins freshwater stream river dumps spending four five years ocean reaching sexual maturity many salmon return

geomagnetic imprinting concept developed paper sought explain sea turtles salmon return home areas migrating hundreds thousands kilometers animal behavior term imprinting refers special type learning exact definitions imprinting vary important aspects process include following learning occurs particular critical period usually early life animal effects last long time effects easily natal homing concept animals like sea turtles salmon imprint magnetic field home area young use information return years later geomagnetic imprinting proven occur appears plausible several reasons earths magnetic field varies across globe way different geographic areas different magnetic fields associated also sea turtles welldeveloped magnetic detect intensity strength earths field well inclination angle angle field lines intersect earths thus plausible sea turtles maybe salmon also recognize home areas using distinctive magnetic fields exist pacific salmon known imprint chemical signature home information helps salmon find home river reach coast open sea cases chemical cues rivers thought extend far ocean thus salmon probably use two different navigational systems sequence migrate open sea spawning first one possibly based earths magnetic field see geomagnetic imprinting used open ocean probably brings salmon close home river close home river salmon use olfactory chemical signals find spawning area many classical studies demonstrating olfactory imprinting salmon carried arthur hasler one particularly famous experiment young salmon imprinted artificial chemicals released wild perform normal migrations almost young fish returned stream also artificially imprinted chemicals proving fish use chemical cues return natal region thermal pollution refers degradation water quality changing ambient water temperature serious effect natal homing chum salmon chum salmon typical cold water fish prefer water around water temperature raised due thermal pollution chum salmon tends dive
