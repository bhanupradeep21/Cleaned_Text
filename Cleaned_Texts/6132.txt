stiffperson syndrome sps also known stiffman rare neurologic disorder unclear cause characterized progressive muscular rigidity stiffness stiffness primarily affects truncal muscles superimposed spasms resulting postural deformities chronic pain impaired mobility lumbar hyperlordosis common sps occurs one million people commonly found middleaged people small minority patients paraneoplastic variety condition variants condition stifflimb syndrome primarily affects specific limb often seen sps first described diagnostic criteria proposed refined two decades later roles antibodies condition

benzodiazepineclass drugs common treatment used symptom relief stiffness common treatments include baclofen intravenous immunoglobin rituximab limited encouraging therapeutic experience haematopoietic stem cell transplantation exists stiffperson syndrome sps often separated several subtypes based cause progression disease three clinical classifications sps around sps classic form people classic sps typically first experience intermittent tightness aching muscles muscles repeatedly involuntarily contract causing grow eventually rigidified muscles reduce affected persons range motion slow voluntary movements may cause abnormal posture particularly lumbar hyperlordosis distinctive curve lower rigid trunk muscles also prevent chest abdomen expanding causing shortness breath early many people sps muscle rigidity eventually progresses trunk limbs first affecting muscles closest trunk stiffened limbs affect persons balance gait causing awkward statuelike falls affected person put arms soften alongside growing stiffness many sps develop bouts muscle spasms triggered sudden movements feeling upset spasms sometimes accompanied elevated blood pressure heart rate body temperature experience chronic muscle muscle stiffness initially fluctuates sometimes days weeks eventually begins consistently impair disease progresses patients sometimes become unable walk chronic pain common worsens time sometimes acute pain occurs stress cold weather infections lead increase symptoms sleep decreases sps patients experience superimposed spasms extreme sensitivity touch spasms primarily occur proximal limb axial spasms usually last minutes recur hours attacks spasms unpredictable often caused fast movements emotional distress sudden sounds rare cases facial muscles hands feet chest affected unusual eye movements vertigo brisk stretch reflexes clonus occur late diseases progression hypnagogic myoclonus addition physical symptoms many sps experience neurological psychiatric sps various neurological disorders affect physical reflexes movement also experience anxiety depression alcohol use disorders phobias particularly patients psychologically normal respond reasonably
