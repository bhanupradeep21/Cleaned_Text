curved mirror mirror curved reflecting surface surface may either convex bulging outward concave recessed inward curved mirrors surfaces shaped like part sphere shapes sometimes used optical devices common nonspherical type parabolic reflectors found optical devices reflecting telescopes need image distant objects since spherical mirror systems like spherical lenses suffer spherical aberration distorting mirrors used entertainment convex concave regions produce deliberately distorted images also provide highly magnified highly diminished smaller images object placed certain distances convex mirror diverging mirror curved mirror reflective surface bulges towards light convex mirrors reflect light outwards therefore used focus light mirrors always form virtual image since focal point f centre curvature imaginary points inside mirror reached result images formed mirrors projected screen since image inside mirror image smaller object gets larger object approaches mirror collimated parallel beam light diverges spreads reflection convex mirror since normal surface differs spot mirror passengerside mirror car typically convex mirror countries labeled safety warning objects mirror closer appear warn driver convex mirrors distorting effects distance perception convex mirrors preferred vehicles give upright inverted though diminished smaller image provide wider field view curved outwards mirrors often found hallways various buildings commonly known hallway safety mirrors including hospitals hotels schools stores apartment buildings usually mounted wall ceiling hallways intersect make sharp turns useful people look obstruction face next hallway next turn also used roads driveways alleys provide safety road users lack visibility especially curves convex mirrors used automated teller machines simple handy security feature allowing users see happening behind similar devices sold attached ordinary computer monitors convex mirrors make everything seem smaller cover larger area surveillance round convex mirrors called oeil de sorcière french sorcerers eye popular luxury item century onwards shown many depictions interiors century technology easier make regular curved mirror blown glass perfectly flat one also known bankers eyes due fact wide field vision useful security famous examples art include arnolfini portrait jan van eyck left wing werl altarpiece robert image convex mirror always virtual rays havent actually passed image extensions like regular mirror diminished smaller upright inverted object gets closer mirror image gets larger approximately size object touches mirror object moves away image diminishes size gets gradually closer focus reduced point focus object infinite distance features make convex mirrors useful since everything appears smaller mirror cover wider field view normal plane mirror useful looking cars behind drivers car road watching wider area surveillance etc concave mirror converging mirror reflecting surface recessed inward away incident light concave mirrors reflect light inward one focal point used focus light unlike convex mirrors concave mirrors show different image types depending distance object mirror mirrors called converging mirrors tend collect light falls refocusing parallel incoming rays toward focus light reflected different angles different spots mirror normal mirror surface differs spot concave mirrors used reflecting also used provide magnified image face applying makeup illumination applications concave mirrors used gather light small source direct outward beam torches headlamps spotlights collect light large area focus small spot concentrated solar power concave mirrors used form optical cavities important laser construction dental mirrors use concave surface provide magnified image mirror landing aid system modern aircraft carriers also uses concave mirror curved mirrors spherical simplest make best shape generalpurpose use spherical mirrors however suffer spherical rays reflected mirrors focus single point parallel rays coming distant object parabolic reflector better job mirror focus incoming parallel rays much smaller spot spherical mirror toroidal
