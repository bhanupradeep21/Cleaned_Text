twofactor theory emotion states emotion based two factors physiological arousal cognitive label theory created researchers stanley schachter jerome e singer according theory emotion felt physiological arousal occurs person uses immediate environment search emotional cues label physiological sometimes cause misinterpretations emotions based bodys physiological state brain know feels emotion relies external stimulation cues label stanley schachter jerome e singer performed study tested people use clues environment explain physiological changes hypotheses participants told injected new drug called suproxin test eyesight participants actually injected epinephrine causes respiration increase blood pressure heart rate placebo four conditions participants randomly placed epinephrine informed epinephrine ignorant epinephrine misinformed control group epinephrine informed group told may feel side effects including hands would start shake heart start pound face may get warm flushed epinephrine ignorant group experimenters explain subjects symptoms might feel epinephrine misinformed group told would probably feel feet go numb itching sensation parts body slight headache control group injected placebo given side effects expect group used control experiencing physiological change emotion label injection confederate interacted students either acting euphoric experimenters watched one way mirror rated participants state three category scale participants given questionnaire heart rate checked researchers found impact confederate different participants different conditions high low euphoria ranking follows epinephrine misinformed epinephrine ignorant placebo epinephrine informed anger condition ranking epinephrine ignorant placebo epinephrine informed results show participants explanation body felt susceptible confederate findings considered support researchers misattribution arousal study tested schachter singers twofactor theory emotion psychologists donald g dutton arthur p aron wanted use natural setting would induce physiological arousal experiment male participants walk across two different styles bridges one bridge scary arousing suspension bridge narrow suspended deep ravine second bridge much safer stable first end bridge attractive female experimenter met male participants gave participants questionnaire included ambiguous picture describe number call questions idea study find group males likely call female experimenter measure sexual content stories men wrote crossing one bridges found men walked across scary bridge likely call woman follow study stories sexual twofactor theory would say transferred misattributed arousal fear anxiety suspension bridge higher levels sexual feeling towards female experimenter schachter wheeler study subjects injected epinephrine chlorpromazine chlorpromazine neuroleptic ie antipsychotic none subjects information injection receiving injection subjects watched short comical movie watching movie subjects monitored signs humor movie watched subjects rated funny movie enjoyed results concluded epinephrine subjects demonstrated signs humor placebo subjects demonstrated fewer reactions humor chlorpromazine subjects criticism theory come attempted replications schachter singer study marshall zimbardo marshall tried replicate schachter singer euphoria conditions schachter singer subjects injected epinephrine placebo except administrator told subjects experiencing nonarousal symptoms subjects put four different conditions subjects injected epinephrine exposed neutral confederate another received placebo told expect arousal symptoms two conditions dosage epinephrine determined body weight rather results found euphoria confederate little impact subjects also euphoric confederate produce anymore euphoria neutral confederate concluding subjects injected epinephrine susceptible emotional manipulations nonaroused placebo subjectscitation needed maslach designed study try replicate extend schachter singer study instead injected epinephrine administrators used hypnotic suggestions source arousal either subjects hypnotized used control placebo effect schachter singer study subjects hypnotized given suggestion become aroused presentation cue instructed remember source right subjects hypnotized confederate began acting either euphoric angry condition later study subjects exposed two euphoric confederates one confederate keep aware source arousal confederates told subjects expect different arousal symptoms results found subjects selfreports observation found unexplained arousal causes negative conditions subjects still showed angry emotions regardless euphoric confederate maslach concluded lack explanation arousal cause negative emotion evoke either anger fear however maslach mention limitation might negative emotion selfreported terms referring negative emotions positive also criticisms twofactor theory come theoretical standpoint one criticisms schachtersinger theory centers primarily autonomic nervous system provides account emotional process within central nervous system aside signaling role cognitive factors important considering heavy implication certain brain centers mitigating emotional experience eg fear also noted gregorio mara√±on also early studies development cognitive theories emotion
