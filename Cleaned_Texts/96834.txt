targeted genetic testing multigene panel testing may performed however testing done variant interpretation genetic counseling performed conjunction clinical genetics service alternatively several research units special interests genetics gnrh insensitivity clinicians consider referring patients specialized centers genetic testing commercially available several clinical laboratory improvement amendments clia laboratories united states genedx athena diagnostics fulgent diagnosticscitation needed choice therapy gnrh insensitivity depends upon patients age desire achieve one following goalscitation needed puberty induction sexual maturation girls women exogenous estrogens used start secondary sexual development prepubertal girls build sustain normal bone muscle mass initiation treatment based upon patients bone age current height percentiles psychosexual needs predicted adult height shorter predicted adult height later puberty induced inappropriate use estrogens may result rapid osseous maturation resulting short stature irregular menstrual bleedingcitation needed initiation puberty begin type route exogenous estrogen oral transdermal initiation puberty transdermal estradiol starting low doses approximately mcg estradiol per kgday body weight successful commonly prescribed dose gradually increased several years initial therapy consist unopposed estrogen alone maximize breast growth achieve appropriate skeletal maturation induce uterine endometrial proliferation progestin eventually needs added prevent endometrial hyperplasia adding prematurely administering combinations estrogens progestins eg birth control pills completion breast development avoided likely reduce ultimate breast sizecitation needed pubertal induction completed estrogen progestin therapy continued indefinitely doses principles therapy similar women primary ovarian insufficiency boys men boys puberty induced testosterone exogenous gonadotropins pulsatile gonadotropinreleasing hormone gnrh therapy latter two options also induce spermatogenesis necessary age group testosterone therapy suggested pubertal induction boys goals therapy tocitation needed oral testosterone preparations used hepatic toxicity choices testosterone replacement include intramuscular injections longacting testosterone preparations topical gelssolutionspatches serum testosterone levels monitored dose adjusted whichever form testosterone replacement chosen providing psychological support important patient variety new often confusing symptoms much like adolescent undergoing puberty difficult likely later age testosterone therapy initiated low dose gradually increased adult dose yearscitation needed pubertal induction completed testosterone therapy continued
