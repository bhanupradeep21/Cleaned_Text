paleoanthropology hunting hypothesis hypothesis human evolution primarily influenced activity hunting relatively large fast animals activity hunting distinguished human ancestors hominins undisputed early humans hunters importance fact final steps emergence genus homo earlier australopithecines bipedalism production stone tools million years ago eventually also control fire million years ago emphasized hunting hypothesis deemphasized scenarios stress omnivore status humans recipe success social interaction including mating behaviour essential emergence language culture advocates hunting hypothesis tend believe tool use toolmaking essential effective hunting extremely important part human evolution trace origin language religion hunting context societal evidence david buss cites modern tribal population deploy hunting primary way acquiring aka pygmies central african republic spend quest nourishment hunting gathering processing food additionally kung botswana retain calories hunting percentage varies depending physical evidence buss first looks guts humans apes human gut consists mainly small intestines responsible rapid breakdown proteins absorption nutrients apes gut primarily colon indicates vegetarian diet structural difference supports hunting hypothesis evolutionary branching point modern humans modern primates buss also cites human teeth fossilized human teeth thin enamel coating little heavy wear tear would result plant diet absence thick enamel also indicates historically humans maintained meatheavy buss notes bones animals human ancestors killed found olduvai gorge cut marks strategic points bones indicate tool usage provide evidence ancestral women theorized participated hunting either collective group suggested past women targeted low guaranteed food whereas men targeted higher risk higher reward gathering hypothesis view states men provided evolution current human hunting women contributed via though criticized many provides clues hunting gathering patterns acquiring food resources according hunting hypothesis women preoccupied pregnancy dependent children hunt dangerous less profitable addition subsistence labor differentiates observations suggests gender patterns originate genetic another possible explanation women gathering inherent prioritization rearing offspring difficult uphold women hunting seen cost effective men division labor allows types resources animals plants individual small group hunting requires patience skill strength women capable men plant collecting physically demanding task strength endurance patience explain women regularly hunt large since women hunt menstruating child still breastfed mother may take along shoulder sling hunting women hunt compatible children usually means communal net hunts andor hunting small game childcare prevents woman hunting young expertise effective hunter later may though hunting hypothesis still debated today many experts theorized impact women concerning involvement huntergatherers primarily males much larger previously women foraging societies hunt small game regularly occasionally large majority humans evolutionary history consisted huntergatherers women evolved necessary traits needed hunting endurance movement coordination hunting big game requires collaborative effort thus participation abledbodies encouraged included addition atlatl spearthrowers required energy utilized contributions everyone including females wouldve contributed mitigating energy exerted use examples consist martu women western australia example frequently hunt goannas women also participate communal game drives extensive land knowledge well use assist husbands kelly roberts example consists agta women hunters returned home kill percent time whereas men averaged womens expertise hunting shown mixed groups male female hunters successful coming home kills percent agta females reached end childbearing years children old enough look camp sterile ones intentionally noted women target reliable lowreturnrate foods whereas men target less reliable highreturnrate could explanation women werent commonly documented hunters buss purports hunting hypothesis explains high level human male parental investment offspring compared primates meat economical condensed food resource brought home feed young efficient carry lowcalorie food across great distances thus act hunting required transportation kill order feed offspring reasonable explanation human male buss suggests hunting hypothesis also explains advent strong male coalitions although chimpanzees form malemale coalitions tend temporary opportunistic contrastingly large game hunters require consistent coordinated cooperation succeed large game hunting thus male coalitions result working together succeed providing meat hunters kristen hawkes suggests obtaining resources intended community consumption increases males fitness appealing males society thus good favor males females male relationship would improve hunting success create alliances future conflict female relationship would improve direct reproductive buss proposes alternate explanations emergence strong male coalitions suggests male coalitions may result groupongroup aggression defense ingroup political alliances explanation support relationship male coalitions hawkes proposes hunters pursue large game divide kill across group hunters compete divvy kill signal courage power generosity prosocial intent dedication engaging activities hunters receive reproductive benefits reproductive benefits lead greater reproductive success skilled evidence hunting goals benefit families hunters ache hadza men hawkes notes hunting techniques less efficient alternative methods energetically costly men place importance displaying bravery power prosocial intent hunting efficiency method different compared societies hunters retain control kills signal intent sharing alternate method aligns coalition support hypothesis efforts create preserve political meat successful large game hunts single hunter consume hunting success varies week one week hunter may succeed hunting large game next may return meat situation buss suggests low costs giving away meat eaten individual hunter large benefits expectation returned favor week hunting hawkes calls sharing tolerated theft purports benefits reciprocal altruism stem result families experience lower daily variation higher daily average provisioning may actually form sexual competition males hawkes suggests male provisioning particularly human behavior forges nuclear structure familial provisioning determines form resource distribution however hawkes acknowledge inconsistencies across societies contexts fluctuating time courses dedicated hunting gathering directly correlated return rates fact nutrition value often chosen caloric count fact meat widely spread resource showoff hypothesis concept successful men better mate options idea relates back fact meat result hunting expeditions distinct resource comes large quantities often hunters family able consume timely manner meat doesnt go also success hunting unpredictable whereas berries fruits unless drought bad bush fairly consistent seasonality kristen hawkes argues women favor neighbors opting men provide advantageous yet infrequent meat women may profit alliance resulting feasts especially times shortage hawkes suggests would beneficial women reward men employ showoff strategy supporting dispute caring offspring providing sexual benefits women may gain alignment lie favored treatment offspring spawned showoff buss echoes cites hawkes thoughts showoffs benefits sexual access increased likelihood children favorable treatment children would receive members hawkes also suggests showoffs likely live large groups thus less susceptible showoffs gain benefits sharing family classical fitness potential favorable treatment community reciprocal altruism members hawkes uses ache people paraguay evidence showoff hypothesis food acquired men widely distributed across community inconsistent resources came large quantities acquired also widely represented ache according hawkes buss notes trend contradicted hadza evenly distribute meat across members population whose hunters little control distribution hadza showoff hypothesis resources result hunting prestige risk involved big game hunting possible circuitous benefits protection gathering hypothesis view men provided critical evolutionary propulsion modern human hunting whereas women contributed via addition helps provide fact ancestors diets consisted mostly plant suggested david buss stone tools invented strictly hunting gathering plants used digging could explain migration forests woodlands tools allowed easy access previously used methods view results hunting part modern human coming much though women werent strictly hunters womans time investment foraging depended much food husband brought gathering plant foods allows person return camp necessary hunting may require overnight stay continue tracking animal gathering hypothesis criticized believe incapable explaining human origins primate common argument gathering hypothesis gathering best efficient method acquiring food men gather stop wasting time division labor among men woman unaccounted throughout hunting often takes hunter far away home base selection would favor hunters could find way home without getting lost along locating gathering edible nuts berries fruit tubers would require different set spatial high prevalence male hunters female gatherers among traditional societies although conclusive evidence provides one clue activities part human pattern procuring httpsenwikipediaorgwikihuntinghypothesis
