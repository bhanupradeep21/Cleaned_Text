gorhams disease pronounced goramz also known gorham vanishing bone disease phantom bone rare skeletal condition unknown cause characterized uncontrolled proliferation distended thinwalled vascular lymphatic channels within bone leads resorption replacement bone angiomas andor symptoms gorhams disease vary depending bones involved may affect part skeleton common sites disease shoulder skull pelvic girdle jaw ribs cases symptoms seen fracture occurs either spontaneously following minor trauma fall acute onset localized pain swelling may occur commonly pain apparent cause increases frequency intensity time may eventually accompanied weakness noticeable deformity area rate progression unpredictable prognosis difficult disease may stabilize number years go spontaneous remission cases involving chest upper spine prove fatal recurrence disease following remission also occur involvement spine skull base may cause poor outcome neurological complications many cases result gorhams disease severe deformity functional symptoms difficulty breathing chest pain may present disease present ribs scapula thoracic vertebrae may indicate disease spread bone chest cavity breathing problems may misdiagnosed asthma damage done lungs cause types changes lung function testing seen extension lesions chest may lead development chylous pleural pericardial effusions chyle rich protein white blood cells important fighting infection loss chyle chest serious consequences including infection malnutrition respiratory distress failure complications symptoms difficulty breathing chest pain poor growth weight loss infection sometimes first indications specific cause gorhams disease remains unknown bone mass strength obtained maintained process bone destruction replacement occurs cellular level throughout persons life cells called osteoclasts secrete enzymes dissolve old bone allowing another type cells called osteoblasts form new bone except growing bone rate breakdown equals rate building thereby maintaining bone mass gorhams disease process gorham stout found vascular anomalies always occupied space normally would filled new bone speculated presence angiomatosis may lead chemical changes gorham others speculated change bone chemistry might cause imbalance rate osteoclast osteoblast activity bone dissolved beginning elevated levels protein called detected people disease reported leading suggest increased levels vascular endothelial growth factor vegf may contribute chemical changes gorham others believed cause type m√∂ller concluded gorhamstout syndrome may essentially monocentric bone disease focally increased bone resorption due increased number paracrine autocrine stimulated hyperactive osteoclasts resorbed bone replaced markedly vascularized fibrous tissue apparent contradiction concerning presence absence number osteoclasts may explained different phases syndrome stated histopathological study provided good evidence osteolytic changes seen gorhams disease result hyperactive osteoclastic bone however others concluded lymphangiomatosis gorhams disease considered spectrum disease rather separate consensus exists gorhams caused deranged

cortex outer shell bone disrupted vascular channels may invade adjacent soft tissues joints eventually complete nearcomplete resorption bone occurs may extend adjacent bones though spontaneous arrest bone loss reported occasion throughout process bone destroyed replaced angiomatous andor fibrous often gorhams disease recognized fracture occurs subsequent improper bone healing diagnosis essentially one exclusion must based combined clinical radiological histopathological xrays ct scans mris ultrasounds nuclear medicine bone scans important tools diagnostic workup surgical planning none ability alone produce definitive diagnosis surgical biopsy histological identification vascular lymphatic proliferation within generous section affected bone essential component diagnostic recognition disease requires high index suspicion extensive workup serious morbidity gorhams must always considered differential diagnosis osteolytic treatment gorhams disease part palliative limited symptom managementcitation needed sometimes bone destruction spontaneously ceases treatment required disease progressive aggressive intervention may necessary duffy reported around people gorhams disease ribs shoulder upper spine experience extension disease chest leading chylothorax serious consequences mortality rate group reach high without surgical intervention search medical literature reveals multiple case reports interventions varying rates success followscitation needed cardiothoracic heart lung skeletal date known interventions consistently effective gorhams reported interventions considered experimental treatments though many routine conditions people may require combination approaches unfortunately people respond interventioncitation needed gorhams disease extremely rare may occur age though often recognized children young adults strikes males females races exhibits inheritance pattern medical literature contains case reports every continent rare commonly misdiagnosed exactly many people affected disease known literature frequently cites fewer cases reported though consensus building many cases occur around world reportedcitation needed first known report condition
