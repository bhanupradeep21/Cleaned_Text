transgenerational epigenetic inheritance plants involves mechanisms passing epigenetic marks parent offspring differ reported several kinds epigenetic markers provide mechanism facilitate greater phenotypic plasticity influencing expression genes without altering dna code modifications represent responses environmental input reversible changes gene expression patterns passed generations plants transgenerational epigenetic inheritance could potentially represent evolutionary adaptation sessile organisms quickly adapt changing environment eukaryotes negativelycharged dna wrapped extremely tightly around positivelycharged proteins called histones form since dna wrapped tightly inaccessible transcription enzymes function copy dna rna see central dogma molecular biology inaccessible dna must unwound transcribed rna mechanism dna unwound called chromatin remodeling chromatin remodeling one apparatus epigenetics acts three mechanisms chromatin remodeling wellsupported research dna methylation refers addition methyl group cytosine c nucleotide plants methylation occurs every cytosine sequence context cg chg chh h represents either addition methyl group c nucleotide manipulates
