granulomatous commonly isolated species corynebacterium kroppenstedtii selective medium isolation species organism first isolated human sputum requires lipids growth may help explain association condition treatment protocols well established sources report approximately half patients fully recover months one review recommended complete resection corticosteroid therapy stating also longterm
