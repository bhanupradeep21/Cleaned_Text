dentition pertains development teeth arrangement mouth particular characteristic arrangement kind number teeth given species given number type morphophysiology relationship shape form tooth question inferred function teeth animals whose teeth type nonmammalian vertebrates said homodont dentition whereas whose teeth differ morphologically said heterodont dentition dentition animals two successions teeth deciduous permanent referred diphyodont dentition animals one set teeth throughout life monophyodont dentition animals teeth continuously discarded replaced throughout life termed dentition animals teeth set sockets jawbones termed thecodont evolutionary origin vertebrate dentition remains contentious current theories suggest either outsidein insideout evolutionary origin teeth dentition arising odontodes skin surface moving mouth vice despite debate accepted vertebrate teeth homologous dermal denticles found skin basal gnathostomes ie since origin teeth mya vertebrate dentition

area study archaeologists especially specializing study older dentition affords many advantages studying rest skeleton osteometry structure arrangement teeth constant although inherited undergo extensive change environmental change dietary specializations alterations use patterns rest skeleton much likely exhibit change adaptation teeth also preserve better bone sample teeth available
