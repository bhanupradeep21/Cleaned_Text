stapled hemorrhoidopexy surgical procedure involves cutting removal anal hemorrhoidal vascular cushion whose function help seal stools create continence procedure also removes abnormally enlarged hemorrhoidal tissue followed repositioning remaining hemorrhoidal tissue back normal anatomic position severe cases hemorrhoidal prolapse normally require surgery newer surgical procedures include stapled transanal rectal resection starr procedure prolapse hemorrhoids pph starr pph contraindicated persons either enterocele procedure internal hemorrhoids external hemorrhoids anal fissurescitation needed procedure anal sphincter muscle pulled due tight stapling external hemorrhoids present also get pulled get hidden get tucked inside anal sphincter muscle reappear staples fall months sphincter comes normal position previously lot surgeons thought procedure external hemorrhoids also external hemorrhoids reappear staples fall offcitation needed hemorrhoids amongst common anal disorders patients may complain bleeding prolapse personal discomfort minor anal leakage traditional nonsurgical measures rest suppositories dietary advice fail improve condition choice treatments opinion best management patients varies considerably many treatments hemorrhoids may performed without anesthetics lasting effect conservative therapies questioned many patients treated rubber band ligation injection sclerotherapy require multiple treatments high recurrence rate following procedures conventional hemorrhoidectomy provides permanent symptomatic relief patients effectively treats external component hemorrhoids however wounds created surgery usually associated considerable postoperative pain necessitates prolonged recovery period put stress general practitioner resources may alienate patient delays patients return full normal lifestyle workplace surgeons generally reserve formal excision severe cases prolapse patients failed respond conventional treatmentsmedical citation needed obstructed defecation syndrome ods caused structural deformities rectum resulting chronic constipation starr treat ods using minimally invasive methods starr surgical procedure performed anus requires external incisions leaves visible scars using surgical stapler procedure removes excess tissue rectum reducing anatomical defects cause ods study patients undergoing starr procedure patients hospitalized one three days experienced minimal postoperative pain procedure resumed employment normal activity days study ods patients experienced significant improvement ods symptoms following starrcitation needed pph uses circular stapler reduce degree prolapse procedure avoids need wounds sensitive perianal area thus reducing postoperative pain considerably facilitates speedier return normal activities procedure internal hemorrhoids external hemorrhoids anal fissures procedure first described italian surgeon dr antonio longo department surgery university palermo since widely adopted europe procedure avoids need wounds sensitive perianal area result advantage significantly reducing patients post operative followup relief symptoms indicate similar success rate achieved conventional since pph first introduced subject numerous clinical trials national institute clinical evidence nice uk issued full guidance procedure stating safe efficacious pph generally indicated severe cases internal hemorrhoidal prolapse degree surgery would normally indicated may also indicated patients minor degree haemorrhoids failed respond conservative treatments procedure may contraindicated one cushion prolapsed severe cases fibrotic piles physically repositioned addition correcting symptoms associated prolapse problems bleeding piles also resolved excision although cushions may totally partially preserved blood supply interrupted venous drainage improved repositioning external component remains usually regress period months prominent skin tags may occasion removed operation may increase postoperative pain routinely performed pph employs unique circular stapler reduces degree prolapse excising circumferential strip mucosa proximal anal canal effect pulling hemorrhoidal cushions back normal anatomical position usually patient general anesthetic minutes many cases successfully performed local regional anesthesia procedure suited day case treatmentcitation needed due low level postoperative pain reduced analgesic use patients usually discharged either day day following surgery patients resume normal activities days fit work first bowel motion usually day two cause great discomfort staples may passed time time defecation normal cause concernmedical citation needed since articles published reporting complications stapled
