generally intruder happen territory may defended actual fighting although generally last resort scent marking also known territorial marking spraying involves urination behaviour used animals identify commonly accomplished depositing strongsmelling substances contained urine faeces specialised scent glands located various areas body often scent contains pheromones carrier proteins major urinary proteins stabilize odours maintain animal sniffing scent frequently displays flehmen response assist detecting mark scent marking often performed scent rubbing many many mammal species scent marking frequent breeding felids leopards jaguars mark rubbing vegetation prosimians new world monkeys also use scent marking including urine washing selfanointing body urine many ungulates example blue wildebeest use scent marking two glands preorbital gland scent gland hoofcitation needed territorial scent marking may involve behaviours specific activity wolf marks territory lifts hind leg urinates scent post usually elevated position like tree rock raised leg urination different normal urination done squatting posture exclusive alpha wolves either sex although alpha male often alpha female

first animals use range behaviours intimidate intruders defend territories without engaging fights expensive terms energy risk injury ritualized aggression defense frequently involves graded series behaviours displays include threatening gestures vocalizations spreading wings gill covers lifting presentation claws head bobbing tail body beating finally direct attack territories may held individual mated unmated pair group territoriality always fixed behavioural characteristic species example red foxes vulpes vulpes either establish stable home ranges within particular areas itinerant fixed territories may vary time season example european robins defend territories pairs breeding season individuals winter resource availability may cause changes territoriality example nectarivores

territoriality rather quality defended territory behavioural ecologists argued food distribution determines whether species territorial however may narrow perspective several type resource may defended including partners potential mates offspring nests lairs display areas leks territoriality emerges focused resource provides enough individual group within boundary small enough defended without expenditure excessive effort territoriality often strong towards conspecifics shown case redlip conspecifics share exactly set resources several types resource territory may defended food large solitary paired carnivores bears bigger raptors require extensive protected area guarantee food supply territoriality breaks glut food example grizzly bears attracted migrating salmon food

species males observed occasionally form aggregations fragrancerich territories considered leks leks serve facultative purpose species fragrancerich sites greater number habitable territories since territories aggregated females large selection males potentially mate within aggregation giving females power mate similar behaviour also observed eulaema meriana orchid bee males species bee show alternative behaviours territoriality transiency transient male bees defend territories instead flew one territory also engage physical contact territorial males hand territorial males patrolled area around tree used territory days also appeared gave territories new males without violence males defend territories solely mating resources fragrances nests nest construction materials nectar pollen found although territories contain multiple potential resources territories defended one purpose european blackbirds may defend feeding territories distant nest sites species form leks example uganda
