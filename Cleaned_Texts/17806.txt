quick check major life events preceded patients relationship largely thought causal strongest evidence causation coming findings negative events outside ones control strongly associated depression making unlikely depression symptoms anything negative additional support comes twin studies allow researchers control endogenous factors may related however noncausal associations also likely individuals likely depressed may increase chance experiencing negative social event due placing relationships events may evidence association negative life events depression comes largely case studies studies compare frequency events depressed individuals rates people representative larger negative life events often reported depressed cases major depression preceded major life event symptoms tend occur within one month event diagnosis major depression high frequency negative events also seen relative representative samples nondepressed population studies often showing depressed experienced twice much negative addition depressed individuals likely experienced negative life events preceding symptoms compared mental health issues like schizophrenia bipolar although negative social experiences often reported preceding depression people get diagnosed major part stems fact grieving sadness behavior often seen normal healthy worthy diagnosis indicating however ones history major depression levels social support gender sex personality differences suggested play roles mediating ones sensitivity pathological negative life events lead depression often classified dependent independent dependent events individual control independent events mostly due unavoidable dependent events typically involve stressors result interactions people addition variables like performancebased job security avoidable financial strongly associated depression independent events controlling severity may result traits lead individuals situations likely result addition likely directly related interpersonal content least immediately following stressor dependent events also thought strongly associated major depression symptoms people history experiencing first however validity statement may dependent whether one focusing relapse recurrence evidence recurrent major depression supportive although independent events less associated depression social content still positively associated addition helped contribute evidence causal relationship negative life events depression dependent events always question whether depression symptoms played role like types negative life events social experiences lead higher probabilities developing major depression either onetime events episodic events clear beginnings endings usually involve specific time frame however often hard distinguish episodic stressors chronic stressors length many stressors expected vary based individual environmental cultural however loss loved one usually considered shortterm discrete event instances estimated result depression examples episodic stressors include unexpected loss employment robbery assault known increase likelihood addition differences length stressful events researchers also emphasized different types events may relate differences stress example episodic events like romantic breakups economic hardship assault result long periods chronic may due likelihood events often caused ongoing problems result quick fix often although less often mentioned case studies lack social support also implicated form chronic stress increases likelihood major like previously mentioned example romantic breakups lack social support may become form chronic stress often something fixed quickly may source conflict negative life events chronic stress shown contribute onset depression two may combine increase ones risk example acute chronic stressors found increase likelihood depression similar degrees men women spanish sample compared depressed group addition direct effect depression stressors suggested interact either chronic stress making individuals susceptible effects episodic events negative life events adding levels chronic major depression twice common women one often explored explanation women experience negative social events men however little evidence looking relationship negative events depression said much variability exists looking negative event type risk depression particularly involve social general women much higher risk developing depression social loss one explanation women tend larger networks meaningful supporters men important loss evidence comes primarily finding sexes equally likely become depressed response conflict death within nuclear family women likely become depressed response loss friend family members outside nuclear addition women may also sensitive depression conflict exists physically expressed evidenced women likely depressed physical attack another potential explanation women experience greater strain men fewer ways manage lessen difficulties however currently little direct evidence although women typically found sensitive social loss outside nuclear family risk factor supportive social networks also shown protective depression reason kendler colleagues suggest differences sensitivity social stressors alone explain sex difference depression since larger social networks women likely reduce risk depression addition negative life events leading depression researchers suggested depression may also worsen ones social environment elevate symptoms major ones risk experiencing negative connection depression social stressors best seen depressed individuals likely experience negative social events depression nondepressed individuals particular depressed individuals likely experience social however unclear effect increased rejection ones experience depression ways depression might lead increased social stressors negative feedback seeking reassurance seeking two behaviors involve questioning social partners oneself ways aversive others differing whether feedback sought positive negative evidence compatible reassurance seeking negative feedback seeking increasing social stress depression symptoms comes frequency behaviors among depressed responses others often accompany example depressed individuals found engage behaviors nondepressed individuals may fail benefit positive feedback reactions negative feedback reassurance seeking often include increased likelihood rejection contribute low selfesteem potentially prolonging increasing ones depression symptoms degree depressed engages feedback seeking therefore although negativity social impacts may minor relative triggered depression effects may significant symptoms terms directly connection behaviors depression reassurance seeking style reported associated depression symptoms among experiencing addition loss relationship loved one conflict also suggested another way social factors bring divorce separation threat either often result conflict serious marital problems divorce two strongest predictors conflict family members also predictive depression although extent marital although less studied conflict outside family also associated depression seen among tsiman√© likely depressed currently conflict anyone especially person outside relationship conflict depression also seen seen primarily shortterm assault often event highest likelihood correlated depression however longterm affects also seen childhood assaults sexual physical correlated greater likelihoods depression later social support levels strong inverse relationship ones risk becoming depressed despite challenges come measuring effect strongly felt women tend larger support networks likely become depressed response conflict loss relationships outside nuclear depressed individuals tend lower levels perceived actual support may express others ways may exacerbate ones symptoms put strain ones social time spent major depressive episodes also negatively correlated social support unclear whether longer bouts depression lessen perceived actual support social support helped depressed return normal however degree relationship social support depression casual still questions causality often come possibility social support levels may tied traits also play role example addition depression tending produce negative reactions others fact people low social support may simply less interested less skilled developing social networks may help buffer negative life therefore trait lessons extent ones social network may also result social adversity negatively impact ones risk depression indirect ways addition low levels support risk factor depression high levels also widely considered protective however results often come studies limited selfreports todays culture social networks tied social media high numbers social media users studies conducted recently determine relationship social media use depression topic research regard college students significant interest due high rates depression reported group example american college health associations national college health assessment spring american undergraduate college students reported feeling depressed difficult function time past studies published journals social science medicine computers human behavior found social media use strongly associated depression depressive symptoms meanwhile study journal social clinical psychology found university students limited time spent social media extended period time decreased levels another study published journal american college health found close reallife relationships social media contacts significantly associated decreased odds depressive family potential source important social support conflict associated differences likelihood multiple risk factors adolescent depression identified within among strongest degree conflict present within family conflict associated greater risk addition parental responses sadness discontent also tied likelihood major depression increased aggression suppressed aggression towards dysphoric children associated greater likelihoods adolescent although conflict social support often viewed opposites likely result different mechanisms high levels conflict necessarily impact low levels social seen although low parental support predictive depression within family high social support one parent may enough provide protective effects response conflict depressed general responses depressed family members often aversive seen parents depressed tend provide less support neglect children parents nondepressed however depression also found reduce chance parent act aggressively towards outcome

diagnosing depression exclusion diagnosis depression due bereavement originally observed back dsmiii noting full depressive syndrome frequently normal reaction death loved one patients condition better understood uncomplicated beareavement exclusion became part diagnostic criteria dsmiiir dsmiv individuals experiencing depression symptoms considered depressed symptoms response death loved one ended within two months however bereavement exclusion removed dsm v allowing depression diagnosis made favor change argue grief related loss loved one major depression share many overlapping symptoms thing therefore bereavement prevent depression although depression could still diagnosed bereavement clause place individual suicidal psychotic trouble day day tasks proponents removal argue underdiagnosis depression still risk due certain severe symptoms meeting criteria eg insomnia rapid weight loss trouble concentrating concern individuals may hide certain symptoms due fears institutionalized major risk underdiagnosis due bereavement clause would prevent individuals getting treatment could receive diagnosis exacerbated fact depression risk factor suicide thereby creating situations treatment may reason proponents exclusions removal argue judgement clinicians needs unconstrained whether individual lost loved one would sufficient preventing overdiagnosis study wakefield compared depression patients whose diagnosis triggered death loved one whose diagnosis triggered different kind loss study found major symptomatic difference two groups suggesting death loved one treated differently critics change emphasize depressive symptoms seen bereavement often normal inclusion bereavement exclusion important prevent like proponents removing exclusion emphasize grieving individuals often experience symptoms used diagnose major depression however argue symptoms often resolved without treatment often fail become chronic recurrent symptoms define major depression instead removing bereavement exclusion wakefield first favor use provisional qualifiers use patient history balance risks argue classifying someone provisionally normal twomonth cutoff bereavement clause absence dangers like suicidal behavior clinician avoid costs falsepositive diagnosis still monitoring patient closely signs pathological depression opposed normal grief avoid risk falsenegatives history major depression could diagnosed without provisional tag due previous history depression strong predictor onset future episodes
