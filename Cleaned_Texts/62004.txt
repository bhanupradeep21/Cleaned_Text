ethology behavioral ecology traplining traplining feeding strategy individual visits food sources regular repeatable sequence much trappers check lines traplining usually seen species foraging floral involves specified route individual traverses order repeatedly check specific plants flowers hold nectar even long distances traplining described several taxa including bees butterflies tamarins bats rats hummingbirds tropical fruiteating mammals opossums capuchins traplining used term method bumblebees hummingbirds go collecting nectar consequently pollinating plant visit term traplining originally coined daniel although concept discussed charles darwin nikolaas instance hummingbirds bumblebees traplining evolutionary response allocation resources specifically individual hummingbirds form specific routes order minimize competition maximize nutrient availability hummingbird species territorial eg rufous hummingbird selasphorus rufus defend specific territory others trapliners ie longbilled hermit phaethornis longirostris constantly check different locations food territorial hummingbirds robust traplining hummingbirds adaptations longer wings efficient traplining hummingbirds move source source obtaining nectar time one hummingbird primary visitor particular case bumblebees competitors removed influx removal area less time spent traplining long distances demonstrates ability behaviorally adapt based surrounding addition bumblebees use traplining distinguish high nectarproducing flowers lownectar producing flowers consistently recognizing visiting produce higher types bees euglossine bees ie euglossa imperialis use traplining forage efficiently flying rapidly one precise flowering plant next set circuit even ignoring newly blooming plants adjacent outside daily route euglossine bees significantly reduce amount time energy spent searching nectar general seen traplining species higher nutritional rewards nontraplining traplining hummingbirds known active proportionally nectar production flowers decreasing throughout day therefore traplining hummingbirds spend less time foraging obtain energy intake number spending less time searching food means less energy spent flying searching traplining bumblebees prioritize routes based travel distance reward seen total distance trapline related abundance reward nectar traplining also indication levels spatial cognition species use technique example traplining bumblebees indication bumblebees spatial reference memory spatial memory used create specific routes short term ability remember specific routes longterm cuts foraging flying time consequently conserving energy theory tested showing bumblebees remember shortest route reward even original path changed additionally bees cut amount time spent revisiting sites little nutritive bees access shortterm memory forage one main advantages traplining route taught members population quickly period hours leading members reliable food source group works together finding particular source food quickly establish get route information transferred individuals population ensures entire community able quickly find consume nutrients needed traplining helps foragers competing resources replenish decelerating way example nectar plant slowly replaced time acorns occur traplining help plant diversity evolution keeping pollen different genetics flowing plant plant mostly pollinators use traplining way ensure always know food sources looking means organisms like bumblebees hummingbirds transfer pollen anywhere starting point route final food source along path since path always greatly reduces risk selfpollination iterogamy pollinator wont return flower particular foraging overall plant species visited trapliners increased fitness evolutionary mutualistic relationship traplining hummingbirds plants traplining hummingbirds referred legitimate pollinators territorial hummingbirds referred nectar organism traplines learns food source always return food source remember minute details location source allows adapt quickly one major sources suddenly becomes scarce serious obstacles arrangement plant life hamper traplining route zig zags understory tropical rainforest organisms using route get lost subtle treefall gap heavy rainfall could cause individual separated entire group isnt able find path back original route food sources overlooked traplining route use lead organisms area resources since route specific organisms following may also miss opportunities come contact potential mates male bumblebees going directly source food observed pass female bumblebees potential mates along path preferring continue foraging bring food back take away species diversification could possibly delete traits gene pool useful observing traplining natural world proven difficultaccording little known species trapline study traplining natural environment take place one particular study individual bees trained five artificial flowers equal reward observed traplining five flowers new flower higher reward gets included group bees subsequently adjust trapline include higher reward flower natural conditions hypothesized would likely beneficial bees prioritize higher reward flowers either beat competition conserve energy field experiments ecologists created competition vacuum observe whether bumblebees adjusted feeding routes based intense direct competition bumblebees study showed bees areas higher competition productive control bees bumblebees opportunistically adjust use traplining routes response activity competing another effective way study behavior traplining species via computer simulation indoor flight cage experiments simulation models made show linkage pollinator movement pollen flow model considers service pollinators different foraging patterns would affect flow pollen indoor flight cage experiments allow easier determination test subjects easier observation behavior patterns bees small study environments seem demonstrate less traplining tendencies bees studied environments stretched several hectares larger working area increases need traplining techniques conserve energy maximize nutrient intake bees often trapline due strictly travel distance bees remember complex flight paths breaking small segments using vectors landmarks environmental factors one pointing next despite long history research bee learning navigation knowledge deduced behavior foragers traveling nest single feeding recently studies bumblebees foraging arrays artificial flowers fitted automated tracking systems started describe learning mechanisms behind complex route formation multiple locations demonstration observations accurately replicated single learning heuristic
