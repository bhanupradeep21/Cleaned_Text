pigtailed langur simias concolor monotypic genus simias large old world monkey endemic several small islands coast sumatra indonesia face black fur blackbrown relatively short tail diurnal species feeding rainforest canopy leaves lesser extent fruit berries little known natural history heavily hunted populations declining rapidly international union conservation nature assessed conservation status critically included list worlds endangered arboreal primate pigtailed langur spends time canopy devoting majority activity budget towards resting structure groups singlemale multifemale group sizes range around individuals depending locations hunting two subspecies primate simias concolor concolor lives southern mentawai islands simias concolor siberu lives exclusively northern island sexual dimorphism sexual swelling exhibited population estimates compared data show decrease population northern island siberut shows greater abundance species comparison southern mentawai islands largely attributed difference conservation efforts much northern siberut declared national park whereas southern islands historically devastated commercial species subject hunting local inhabitants reduction forest cover allowed greater levels human activity settlement facilitates hunting especially southern islands areas pigtailed langur large rather heavily built old world monkey adapted climbing long arms fur blackbrown hairless face also black monkey subfamily colobinae relatively short tail tail slightly furred cm long short nose pointed upward pigtailed langur reaches full grown length approximately cm weight kg lb sexual dimorphism exhibited species adult males larger heavier adult sexual swelling exhibited species rare single male multi female groups colobinae many researchers would like reclassify species nasalis genus phylogenic analyses suggest two groups remain separate sister critically endangered status primate gives even reason remain genus simias since grouping genera could affect conservation omnivore diet consisting leaves flowers fruits occasionally insects availability foods area abundant especially unripe ripe leaves abundant diet followed colobinae primates species diurnal primate endemic mentawai islands two subspecies simias concolor concolor also known simasepsep resides southern islands sipora north pagai south second subspecies simias concolor siberut also known simakobou lives island diurnal arboreal rain forest dweller often spending spending time canopy occasionally comes activity budget primate mostly resting feeding small fraction time devoted towards travel social studies siberut area show relatively low group sizes mean group size parts siberut show relatively high group sizes mean group size reason different group sizes factually known however many researchers suggest could due anthropogenic factors hunting pigtailed langur singlemale multifemale groups mating system species follows polygynous structure although originally thought species classified critically endangered international union conservation classified endangered iucn status endangerment status changed critically among worlds endangered primates due many anthropogenic pressures faces include destruction forest commercial use hunting illegal pet population size estimates conducted across many years varying islands chosen research areas population estimates pigtailed langur island siberut across four lisa paciulli dedicated phd dissertation towards studying threats mentawai island primates determining population densities associated logging population estimates found around across islands large amount variation attributed due hunting logging population densities logged areas whereas unlogged areas population density extensive population density survey conducted university indonesia four endemic mentawai primates research exclusive southern mentawai islands included variety survey areas devastated commercial logging results surveys population densities island sipora pagai islands group sizes around research population densities northern mentawai island siberut abundant due lower mean population densities humans living island well considerable amount forestry remains comparison southern mentawai islands northern siberut researchers peleonan forest conducted population density surveys july december results form surveys show mean density one main factors associated population decline species habitat disturbance commercial logging forestry cover varies significantly among islands island siberut area declared national park whereas southern islands sipora north pagai south pagai limited areas forestry estimated siberuts forest cover decreased southern mentawai islands sipora pagai decreased reason siberuts extensive forestry cover comparison southern islands due historical conservation efforts much efforts started help unesco man biosphere expanded large portion siberut declared national declaration national park allowed hunting logging operations significantly reduced although areas around national park still experience pressures logging conversions commercial palm oil plantations concessions illegal many areas southern mentawai islands experienced heavy logging operations left little forestry mentawai primates forestry reduced primary forestry secondary forestry troubling since pigtailed langur thrives arboreal reduction forestry southern mentawai islands creates domino effect paving new land human activities second main factor associated population decline species hunting local inhabitants historically used arrows poisonous materials hunt however technological advancements firearms facilitated hunting species especially since one largest primates many local inhabitants hunt species considered delicacy many locals saying best tasting meat compared population density data suggests increase hunting pressure survey sites results lower population densities
