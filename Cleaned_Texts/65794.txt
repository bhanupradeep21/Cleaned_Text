finding heart failure increased heart rate stimulated increased sympathetic order maintain adequate cardiac output initially helps compensate heart failure maintaining blood pressure perfusion places strain myocardium increasing coronary perfusion requirements lead worsening ischemic heart disease sympathetic activity may also cause potentially fatal abnormal heart rhythms increase physical size hearts muscular layer may occur caused terminally differentiated heart muscle fibers increasing size attempt improve contractility may contribute increased stiffness thus decrease ability relax diastole enlargement ventricles also occur contributes enlargement spherical shape failing heart increase ventricular volume also causes reduction stroke volume due mechanical inefficient contraction
