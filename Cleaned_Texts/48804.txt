imprinted brain hypothesis unsubstantiated hypothesis evolutionary psychology regarding causes autism spectrum schizophrenia spectrum disorders first presented bernard crespi christopher badcock claims certain autistic schizotypal traits opposites implies etiology two conditions must odds imprinted brain hypothesis based around genomic imprinting epigenetic process genes expressed differently way one parents contribution effect specifically proponents imprinted brain hypothesis propose autism spectrum disorders caused paternal overimprinting schizophrenia spectrum disorders caused maternal overimprinting point number supposed correlations anticorrelations seen disorders traits support hypothesis hypothesis found attention popular science lacks scientific also attacked unfalsifiable exaggerated overly specific issues hypothesis include predictions makes genetic disorders falsified effects two disorders empathy mentalizing contrary crespi badcocks model many neuroimaging findings fail support hypothesis genomic imprinting epigenetic process certain genes expressed parentoforiginspecific manner imprinted brain theory variant kinship theory genomic imprinting also known conflict theory genomic imprinting kinship theory argues diploid organisms humans maternal paternal set genes may antagonistic reproductive interests since mother father may antagonistic interests regarding development child kinship theory one multiple competing major hypotheses regarding genomic imprinting supported proponents imprinted brain hypothesis precise matter genomic imprinting works yet proponents imprinted brain hypothesis argue since uncertain womans future children father well father generally lower parental investment may fathers reproductive interest child use mothers resources children may mothers interest child take fewer resources free future thus genomic imprinting slight maternal bias would supposedly associated factors decreased growth tractable behavior empathizing less selfcentered personality causing less demands mother opposite would occur slight paternal however extreme genomic imprinting favor maternal genes argued cause psychosis schizophrenia spectrum disorders extreme genomic imprinting favor paternal genes argued cause autism spectrum disorders claims symptoms schizophrenia caused overempathizing resulting delusions paranoia autism caused underempathizing specifically autism considered tendency undermentalize underempathize way treats people objects schizotypy considered inverse tendency overmentalize overempathize objects treated people certain neuroimaging findings lend support although neuroimaging schizophrenia controversial due neurological impact neuroleptic neuroimaging findings results inconsistent traits ambivalence seen negative symptoms versus singleminded focus autistic special interests also posited although pronounced similarity overlap negative symptomatology seen two disorders weakens claim imprinted brain hypothesis first proposed biologist bernard crespi sociologist christopher badcock neither previous experience cognitive science behavioural publishing first presentation claims influential cognitive science journal behavioral brain sciences hypothesis attracted significant attention interested imprinted brain hypothesis similarities extreme male brain theory autism come apart significantly proponents imprinted brain hypothesis state hypothesized imprinting mechanism may detrimental interactions extreme genomic imprinting occurs opposite sex claim provides explanation something would problem extreme male brain female autism tends particularly also used explanation relative severity schizophrenia however proponents extreme male brain theory believe sexual dimorphism autism severity already explained diagnostic autism schizophrenia theory mind impaired imprinted brain hypothesis posits occurs via different mechanisms generalizable broader underlying neurotypes proponents hypothesis claim people schizotypal personality enhanced theory mind increased emphatic ability improved ability recognize emotions supported research schizotypal personality disorder measures healthy schizotypy general rather theory mind appears impaired schizophreniaspectrum conditions even absence frank factors nutrition pregnancy believed affect imprinting proponents note schizophrenia associated maternal starvation pregnancy autism increased diagnostic prevalence affluent although general scientific consensus rising rates autism diagnosis wealthy societies related awareness rather autism schizophrenia appear related birth weight opposite ways autism associated high birth weight schizophrenia low birth weight supporters hypothesis point towards association proponents hypothesis also point towards genetic disorders elevated risk one disorder especially imprinting disorders support claims instance beckwithwiedemann syndrome caused increased effects paternally imprinted genes increased incidence contrary overall claim majority disorders raise risk one autism schizophrenia also including ways directly contradict imprinted brain hypothesis imprinting disorders instance velocardiofacial syndrome associated significant increases general population risk autism data copy number variation genomewide association studies support shared genetic mechanisms causing schizophrenia autism although lends circumstantial support imprinted brain hypothesis also used support many competing role oxytocin autism schizophrenia also researched findings characterizations research used favour hypothesis oxytocin appears treatment potential schizophrenia likely including schizotypal personality crespi proposes contrary suggestion high oxytocin contributing factor population schizotypy creates hyperdeveloped social understanding induces supporters hypothesis point towards associations higher oxytocin levels personality traits also associated schizotypy creativity divergent however schizotypal personality disorder schizotypy general population appear associated oxytocin deficits observed degree positive symptoms schizophrenia schizotypy associated high argued unclear broad claim autism schizophrenia opposition biological level supported research samples autistic adults schizophrenia nonaffective psychotic disorders occur far higher rates general population occurring broad asd high onethird association occurs childhood onset schizophrenia considered homogenous form disorder hews closest hypothetical neurodevelopmental disorder underlying schizophreniaspectrum conditions approximately onequarter children schizophrenia fit criteria autism spectrum disorder prior onset psychosis majority clinical subclinical disturbances social motor language skills similar seen autistic adults schizophrenia related psychotic disorders also higher rates autistic symptomatology healthy crespi badcock make number claims genetic disorders relationship hypothesis instance relationship disorders sex chromosome aneuploidy supports hypothesis trisomy x klinefelter syndrome extra x chromosomes increasing schizophrenia risk turner syndrome one x chromosome increasing autism however polysomy x conditions associated increased autism well schizophrenia turner syndrome approximately three times common schizophrenic women general female genetic syndromes general lend credence suggestion autism schizophrenia related rather contraindicated conditions sharply increase one risk tending also increase instance velocardiofacial syndrome associated increase schizophrenia also significantly increases risk chromosomal disorders notable significantly increasing risk autism schizophrenia include microdeletion moreover specific predictions imprinted brain hypothesis makes imprinting disorders part falsified imprinted brain hypothesis predicts praderwilli syndrome disorder maternal overimprinting decreased autism increased psychosis angelman syndrome disorder paternal overimprinting however autism rates substantially general population pws similar nonaffective psychosis appears occur rates comparable general population indeed suggested maternally imprinted cases praderwilli syndrome elevated autism prevalence compared etiologies disorder exact opposite imprinted brain despite contradicted research crespi nonetheless claims imprinting disorders rule fit crespi badcock claimed neuroimaging studies lend support imprinted brain hypothesis neuroimaging studies found contradictory results several neurological findings common autism brain regions distinguish schizophrenia autism also centre controversy regarding neuroleptic reducing degree used distinguish disorders autistic subjects taking psychotropic medication share altered neuroconnectivity crespi badcock ascribe imprinting brain hypothesis also criticized inaccurately presenting schizophrenia spectrum making claims schizophrenic disorders odds clinical profiles claim milder schizophreniaspectrum disorders associated intensified empathy strong theory mind imperiled research showing specific pattern empathy deficits also appears consistent autism schizophrenia demonstrating impaired cognitive empathy relatively preserved affective crespi badcocks attempt conceptualize schizophrenia relatively homogenous disorder slots neatly one end spectrum criticized due clinical heterogeneity even individual cases schizophrenia due different presentation course positive negative crespi badcock also criticized avoiding falsifiable claims addition
