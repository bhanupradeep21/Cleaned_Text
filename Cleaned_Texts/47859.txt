sharks continually shed teeth carcharhiniformes shed approximately teeth lifetime replacing fall four basic types shark teeth dense flattened needlelike pointed lower triangular upper nonfunctional type tooth shark depends diet feeding habits sharks great model organism study continually produce highly mineralized sharks continually shed teeth replace tooth replacement system sharks replace teeth relatively quickly replacement teeth ready rotate teeth often get damaged catching replace teeth broken young sharks even replace teeth although sharks constantly shed teeth factors water temperature affect turnover rate warmer water temperatures produced faster rates cold water temperatures slowed tooth replacement rates nurse shed new teeth formed underneath push connective tissue holding sex shark also plays role development teeth differences teeth species due gender called sexual usually females larger teeth average usually larger also age change shape teeth juvenile teeth

elasmobranchii extending back hundreds millions years shark tooth contains resistant calcium phosphate ancient types sharklike fish date back million years ago late ordovician period mostly known fossilized teeth dermal however commonly found fossil shark teeth cenozoic era last million years though sharks often highly specialized category ranged widely adaptations teeth reflect ranging widely form function number common types shark teeth vary according diet shark examples include dense flattened teeth crushing long needlelike teeth gripping pointed lower teeth gripping combined serrated triangular upper teeth cutting teeth tiny greatly reduced dense flattened teeth used crush prey like bivalves sharks include nurse sharks angel sharks typically found bottom ocean floor first common style shark tooth present devonian four hundred million years sharks needlelike teeth commonly feed small mediumsized fish sometimes including small sharks teeth especially effective prey easily grip slippery narrow bodies modern examples include blue shark bull sharks sharks specifically use teeth feed small prey like squid flounder stingrays even hammerhead combination pointed lower teeth triangular upper teeth especially useful cutting prey consist large mammals fish combination teeth entails serrated edges cut larger prey smaller portions order easily swallow famously known shark

organisms get sucked mouths feed without using teeth instead filtering food passing water basking sharks feed swimming towards prey mouth open straining process shark able successfully eat hundreds
