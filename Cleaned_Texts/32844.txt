arise spontaneously genetic component associated autoimmune disease infection eye relatively protected environment immune mechanisms may overcome resulting inflammation tissue destruction associated tcell activation uveitis ophthalmic emergency requires urgent control inflammation prevent vision loss treatment typically involves use topical eye drop steroids intravitreal injection newer biologics

causing tissue damage cause noninfectious uveitis unknown strong genetic factors predispose disease onset including recent evidence pointed reactivation herpes simplex varicella zoster viruses important causes developing previously described idiopathic anterior bacterial infection another significant contributing factor developing uveitis assessed part dilated eye diagnosis includes dilated fundus examination rule posterior uveitis presents white spots across retina along retinitis laboratory testing usually used diagnose specific underlying diseases including rheumatologic tests eg antinuclear antibody rheumatoid factor serology infectious diseases syphilis toxoplasmosis tuberculosis major histocompatibility antigen testing may performed investigate genetic susceptibility uveitis common antigens include birdshot chorioretinopathy behçet diseasecitation needed radiology xray may used show coexisting arthritis chest xray may helpful sarcoidosis uveitis typically treated glucocorticoid steroids either topical eye drops prednisolone acetate oral prior administration corticosteroids corneal ulcers must ruled typically done using fluorescence dye addition corticosteroids topical cycloplegics atropine homatropine may used successful treatment active uveitis increases tregulatory cells eye likely contributes disease severe cases injection posterior subtenon triamcinolone acetate may also given reduce swelling eye intravitrial injection steroid proven newer useful way control inflammation longer without need daily eyedrops dexamethasone fluocinolone acetonide two commonly used options noninfectious nonbiologic steroid sparing therapies noninfectious uveitis adults available include diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs dmards methotrexate mycophenolate cyclosporine azathioprine comparing various studies methotrexate efficacious mycophenolate inflammatory control forms panuveitis methotrexate also little differences safety outcomes compared antimetabolite medications methotrexate often used recalcitrant aggressive cases uveitis experimental treatments infliximab antitnf infusions may prove helpful antidiabetic drug metformin

men women affected equally western countries anterior uveitis accounts uveitis cases asian countries proportion uveitis estimated responsible approximately blindness united noninfectious uveitis women likely affected men possibly due higher prevalence related autoimmune vitamin deficiency smoking risk factors noninfectious prognosis generally good receive prompt diagnosis treatment serious
