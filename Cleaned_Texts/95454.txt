adolescence latin adolescere mature transitional stage physical psychological development generally occurs period puberty adulthood typically corresponding age adolescence usually associated teenage physical psychological cultural expressions may begin earlier end later puberty typically begins preadolescence particularly physical growth particularly males cognitive development extend past teens age provides rough marker adolescence scholars agreed upon precise definition definitions start early end late world health organization definition officially designates adolescent someone ages puberty period several years rapid physical growth psychological changes occur culminating sexual maturity average age onset puberty girls every persons individual timetable puberty influenced primarily heredity although environmental factors diet exercise also exert factors also contribute precocious delayed significant parts pubertal development involve distinctive physiological changes individuals height weight body composition circulatory respiratory changes largely influenced hormonal activity hormones play organizational role priming body behave certain way puberty active role referring changes hormones adolescence trigger behavioral physical puberty occurs long process begins surge hormone production turn causes number physical changes stage life characterized appearance development secondary sex characteristics example deeper voice larger adams apple boys development breasts curved prominent hips girls strong shift hormonal balance towards adult state triggered pituitary gland secretes surge hormonal agents blood stream initiating chain reaction male female gonads thereby activated puts state rapid growth development triggered gonads commence mass production hormones testes primarily release testosterone ovaries predominantly dispense estrogen production hormones increases gradually sexual maturation met boys may develop gynecomastia due imbalance sex hormones tissue responsiveness facial hair males normally appears specific order puberty first facial hair appear tends grow corners upper lip typically years spreads form moustache entire upper lip followed appearance hair upper part cheeks area lower hair eventually spreads sides lower border chin rest lower face form full human biological processes specific order may vary among individuals facial hair often present late adolescence around ages may appear significantly men develop full facial hair years facial hair continues get coarser much darker thicker another years major landmark puberty males spermarche first ejaculation occurs average age females menarche onset menstruation occurs average ages age menarche influenced heredity girls diet lifestyle contribute regardless genes girl must certain proportion body fat attain consequently girls highfat diet physically active begin menstruating earlier average girls whose diet contains less fat whose activities involve fat reducing exercise eg ballet girls experience malnutrition societies children expected perform physical labor also begin menstruating later timing puberty important psychological social consequences early maturing boys usually taller stronger advantage capturing attention potential partners picked first sports pubescent boys often tend good body image confident secure late maturing boys less confident poor body image comparing already developed friends peers however early puberty always positive boys early sexual maturation boys accompanied increased aggressiveness due surge hormones affect appear older peers pubescent boys may face increased social pressure conform adult norms society may view emotionally advanced despite fact cognitive social development may lag behind studies shown early maturing boys likely sexually active likely participate risky girls early maturation sometimes lead increased selfconsciousness typical aspect maturing bodies developing advance pubescent girls become insecure consequently girls reach sexual maturation early likely peers develop eating disorders anorexia nervosa nearly half american high school girls diets lose addition girls may deal sexual advances older boys emotionally mentally addition earlier sexual experiences unwanted pregnancies late maturing girls early maturing girls exposed alcohol drug experiences tend perform well school inexperienced girls usually reached full physical development around ages boys usually complete puberty around ages increase height beyond postpubertal age uncommon girls attain reproductive maturity four years first physical changes puberty contrast boys develop slowly continue grow six years first visible pubertal physical development girls teenage years broken three distinct stages start generally coincides beginning rapid growth development breast buds pubic hair peak period physical growth occurs approximately one year later concert stage two sexual maturity approximately years onset secondary sex characteristics girls enter third stage typically includes menarche time finished growth spurt experience notable broadening hips well adult fat distribution additionally breast development complete hair pubic region armpits axillary hair darker widespread comparison girls tricky define exactly sexual development boys begins boys puberty typically takes around years finish opposed years girls menarche point time already experienced growth spurt evident changes body shape wider hips fat distribution adultlike breast development also completed stage boys four stages development correlated curve general body growth adolescence initial sign sexual maturation boys usually fat spurt maturing boy gains weight becomes almost chubby somewhat feminine fat distribution probably occurs estrogen production leydig cells testes stimulated abundant sertoli cells begin produce significant amounts testosterone stage boys may appear obese somewhat awkward physically approximately year scrotum begins increase size stage ii seen time redistribution subcutaneous fat start pubic hair growth following months peak velocity height gain stage iii ensues period marked obvious widenening hips adultlike fat distribution full development breasts together three stages culminate complete growth spurt individuals time axillary hair appears facial hair appears upper lip spurt muscle growth also occurs along continued decrease subcutaneous fat obviously harder angular body form pubic hair distribution appears adult yet spread medial area thighs penis scrotum near adult size stage iv boys occurs anywhere months stage iii difficult pinpoint time spurt growth height ends facial hair chin upper lip adult distribution color pubic axillary hair increase muscular adolescent growth spurt rapid increase individuals height weight puberty resulting simultaneous release growth hormones thyroid hormones males experience growth spurt two years later average females peak height velocity time rapid growth adolescents grow growth rate nearly identical cm inches per year males cm inches per year addition changes height adolescents also experience significant increase weight marshall weight gained adolescence constitutes nearly half ones adult body teenage early adult males may continue gain natural muscle growth even accelerated growth different body parts happens different times adolescents fairly regular sequence first places grow head hands arms legs torso nonuniform growth one reason adolescent body may seem proportion puberty bones become harder brittle conclusion puberty ends long bones close process called epiphysis ethnic differences skeletal changes example united states bone density increases significantly among black white adolescents might account decreased likelihood black women developing osteoporosis fewer bone fractures another set significant physical changes puberty happen bodily distribution fat muscle process different females males puberty nearly sex differences fat muscle distribution puberty boys grow muscle much faster girls although sexes experience rapid muscle development contrast though sexes experience increase body fat increase much significant girls frequently increase fat girls happens years puberty ratio muscle fat among postpubertal boys around three one girls five four may help explain sex differences athletic pubertal development also affects circulatory respiratory systems adolescents heart lungs increase size capacity changes lead increased strength tolerance exercise sex differences apparent males tend develop larger hearts lungs higher systolic blood pressure lower resting heart rate greater capacity carrying oxygen blood greater power neutralizing chemical products muscular exercise higher blood hemoglobin red blood despite genetic sex differences environmental factors play large role biological changes adolescence example girls tend reduce physical activity may receive inadequate nutrition diets often lack important nutrients environmental influences turn affect female physical development primary sex characteristics directly related sex organs males first stages puberty involve growth testes scrotum followed growth time penis develops seminal vesicles prostate bulbourethral gland also enlarge develop first ejaculation seminal fluid generally occurs one year beginning accelerated penis growth although often determined culturally rather biologically since many boys first ejaculation occurs result boys generally fertile adult females changes primary sex characteristics involve growth uterus vagina aspects reproductive system menarche beginning menstruation relatively late development follows long series hormonal generally girl fully fertile several years menarche regular ovulation follows menarche two unlike males therefore females usually appear physically mature capable becoming pregnant changes secondary sex characteristics include every change directly related sexual reproduction males changes involve appearance pubic facial body hair deepening voice roughening skin around upper arms thighs increased development sweat glands females secondary sex changes involve elevation breasts widening hips development pubic underarm hair widening areolae elevation changes secondary sex characteristics take place puberty often referred
