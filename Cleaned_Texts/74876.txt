aldabrachampsus extinct genus small horned crocodile known fragmentary remains lived pleistocene aldabra atoll seychelles western indian ocean name aldabrachampsus dilophus means twocrested crocodile aldabra small animal reaching length ft ft comparable size smallest extant aldabrachampsus known fragmentary cranial mandibular remains including premaxilla frontal bone parietal dentaries squamosals among others postcranial bones also known including several vertebrae femur like crocodilians aldabrachampsus possessed five teeth situated premaxilla however second fifth aligned straight line rather following convex path following premaxillary teeth rostrum crocodile constricted creating notch one dentary teeth toothless region diastema present second third alveoli dentary orbital margins frontan prefrontal bone raised main body frontal shaped like pentagon distinctly vshaped suture parietals excluding frontal contributing supratemporal fenestrae anterior process frontal bone slender notably protrudes body following sudden sharp constriction parietal posterior section known shows flat surface deep notch rear margin exposing occipital region squamosal bone widens towards suture postorbital bone bears hornlike projection faces outwards similar structures known madagascar crocodile voay crocodylus anthropophagus tanzania even alligatoroids like acresuchus ceratosuchus modern species siamese crocodiles cuban crocodiles share similar squamosal horns however aldabrachampsus differs taxa two ways horns notably less pointed showing rounded morphology apex located towards halfway point bone rather squamosal horns crocodilians reach apex towards vertebrae show neural centra neural arches least partly fused sutures beginning close indicates animals bones belonged almost reached adult size length cm vertebrae suggest animal assuming similar proportions modern crocodiles relatively small size approximately ft ft long extrapolating size based skull remains gives similar results ranging ft ft size would similar smallest extant crocodilians south american dwarf caimans african dwarf crocodiles alongside extinct dwarf mekosuchines like volia crocodilian remains found later might indicate presence larger bodied robust animal island however clear fossils belong large specimen species aldabrachampsus taxon previously known island like nile crocodile osteolaemine related voay remains indicate crocodile body length ft ft fragmentary nature aldabrachampsus left exact placement within crocodilia somewhat ambiguous phylogenetic analysis suggests part family crocodylidae composed subfamilies crocodylinae osteolaeminae although relationship recovered strict consensus tree results large polytomy rendering aldabrachampsuss exact position unknown trees suggest potentially different relationships trees aldabrachampsus recovered sister taxon voay others find sister crocodylus palaeindicus however positions weakly supported based single morphological character exposed supraoccipital expressed differently different crocodiles question brochu however argues despite based character relationship voay crocodylus robustus within osteolaeminae likely due anatomy nares palate squamosal horns although differ first remains aldabrachampsus found quaternary deposits point hodoul eastern end aldabra atoll limestone cavities yielded remains also preserved fossils lizards tortoises birds land snails date approximately years ago appearance aldabrachampsus atoll entirely submerged water suggests rather endemic species affected island dwarfism crocodile already small stature time arrived island fragmentary nature poorly resolved phylogenetic relationships however make difficult determine aldabrachampsus originated possible genus arrived aldabra atoll east assuming close relationship crocodylus palaeindicus however brochu suggests relationship voay thus african malagasy origin likely malagasy origin would consistent proximity atoll madagascar led faunal exchanges islands especially prominent regards tortoises given small stature osteolaemus possible minute bodysize ancestral grouping simply reversed voay madagascar another hypothesis meanwhile suggests smaller bodysize trait evolved osteolaemus aldabrachampsus independently one fossil discoveries made dried pond grande terre island corresponding late pleistocene aldabra limestone show evidence predatorprey relationship crocodilians native giant tortoise aldabrachelys gigantea several tortoise shell fragments site known bear distinct feeding marks form unhealed puncture wounds inflicted nuchal armor plastron pubis tortoise possible crocodile attacked killed tortoise head drinking watering hole puncturing nuchal plate front shell rather attacking high better defended sides turtle another possibility tortoise killed crocodiles instead scavenged punctures nuchal shield caused fact particular area allows better access meat beneath shell however crocodile remains found alongside turtle bones notably larger previously recorded aldabrachampsus specimens fragmentary certain belong genus instead represent second species crocodile native
