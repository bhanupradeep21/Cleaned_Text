phratries ionian citystates therefore possible functioned differently athenian phratries perhaps even emerged separately linguistic origins word phratry quite old date back indoeuropean period thus giving rise second origin theory phratries date back early antiquity originated ionia elsewhere greece term phratry quite similar number words brother languages derived indoeuropean makes plausible institutions named phratries emerged independently attica athens ionia existence apatouria ionia athens complicates second theory origin somewhat present scholars highly uncertain phratries actually
