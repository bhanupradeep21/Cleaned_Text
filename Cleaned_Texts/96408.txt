amplexus latin embrace type mating behavior exhibited externally fertilizing species chiefly amphibians horseshoe crabs male grasps female front legs part mating process time time delay fertilizes eggs released females amphibians females may grasped head waist armpits type amplexus characteristic taxonomic groups amplexus involves direct contact male female distinguished forms external fertilization broadcast spawning sperm eggs freely shed water without direct contact individuals order amplexus initiated male frogs must first find mate attracting one calls typically male successfully attracted mate process amplexus begins unsuccessful males forced continue search mate competition female mate among males considered intense uncommon male amphibian attack alreadyamplexed pair male amphibian attacks amplexed pair amphibians trying force male release grasp female mate male amphibians also known show mateguarding behaviour shown amplexus males attempt prevent female amphibian mating duration amplexus found vary across species species may last many days others may last despite variation duration amplexus across species typically species exhibit behaviour use forelimb muscles duration studies found reproductive behaviour amplexus come different fitness costs due fact amplexus occur prolonged periods time instance study found male amphibian grasping holding onto female amphibian lead impairment females ability move conducting experiments researchers confirmed amplexus decrease females locomotor performance eg swimming walking well feeding regard cost male engaged amplexus male amphibians found feed many types amplexus identified literature however two types amplexus common others known inguinal axillary two types amplexus classified based position male amphibian relative male amphibian clasps female around waist inguinal region using forelimbs considered inguinal contrast male amphibian clasps behind forelimbs axillary region female considered axillary amplexus found involve different muscles male female amphibians forelimb muscles males females identified key muscles amplexus species forelimb muscles used amplexus typically larger males females males muscles contain oxidative fibers could mean amplexus involves increased rate aerobic addition forelimb muscles larger males male frogs also typically keratin pads nuptial pads located thumbs contribute success amplexus assisting gripping female duration amplexus behaviour allows amphibians cloacae close contact gametes additionally amplexus thought help alignment reproductive tracts males females furthermore contributes successful female amphibian may always receptive male amphibian trying initiate amplexus female may ready produce female ready engage amplexus simply vibrate body felt male clasped stop amplexus two major hormones identified involved amplexus hormone arginine vasotocin avt identified effect calling behaviours produced male amphibians searching female mate avt increased amount calling behaviour produced male additionally believed gonadotropinreleasing hormone gnrh influence amplexus amphibians found produce initiate behaviour many anuran furthermore arginine vasotocin gonadotropinreleasing hormone found involved sexual behaviour male stress hormone corticosterone also identified associated sexual behaviour amplexus study conducted redspotted newts found acute increase corticosterone males females engaged behaviour however overall found males higher level corticosterone compared females amplexus seen energetically costly increase corticosterone found females could attributed amplexus preventing foraging amplexus chiefly occurs aquatically terrestrial anurans frogs toads like disctongued frogs discoglossidae perform amplexus land crowngroup anurans like true frogs ranidae tree frogs hylidae true toads bufonidae amplexus axillary armpits anurans archaeobatrachia sooglossidae myobatrachidae show ancestral state inguinal lumbar amplexus abdominal front hindlegs species show cephalic amplexus head female held others show complete lack additionally anurans species observed engage multiple amplexus also referred mating ball many toads attach female trying initiate however multiple amplexus common among anurans could indicate costs associated multiple amplexus higher advantages associated female anurans idea multiple amplexus would probably advantageous mating one male would increase fertilization chances increase offspring genetic multiple amplexus would typically common explosive breeding amphibians larger number adults ready breed breeding site short period occurs female amphibians viewed important resource males typically males present females thus leading chances multiple amplexus anurans males deposit sperm onto eggs laid however males genus ascaphus possess intromittent organ unique among anurans internal fertilization internal fertilization occur genera including nectophrynoides mertensophryne case newts process amplexus often observed soon newts become seasonally active western usa example time typically soon onset winter rainy season intermittent streams vernal pools become available breeding habitat roughskinned newt specific widespread example newt western usa observed quiet stream pools shallow ponds engaging amplexus newts males typically show behaviour tail fanning chin rubbing thought prompt mating receptivity female studies shown male newts deeper tailfins better control females amplexus also successful catching females additionally found probability male newt deeper tailfin achieve amplexus greater newts contain deeper tailfin male newts tend use tails malemale male newt unpaired encounters female male newt engaged amplexus unpaired newt try displace paired male newt using wrestling study examining wrestling behaviour newts found observed wrestling encounters paired male meaning would retain female study found invading unpaired newt rarely successfully displaces paired male newt engaged amplexus occurs four species horseshoe crab horseshoe crabs typically go ashore amplexus high tide end beaches eggs first pair walking legs used tightly clasp female species second pair also employed limulus male horseshoe crab develops modified claspers sexual maturity male moults modified claspers help process males pair posterior claspers known ability maintain longterm amplexus found always attach females opisthosoma contrast males anterior claspers found attach females opisthosoma well lateral edges opisthosoma function resist displacement environmental uniquely amplexus likely occur horseshoe crabs female horseshoe crab hard additionally males inhabit clean shell likely enter amplexus compared males contain dirty shell seems females preference clean shells male horseshoe crabs claspers may also important factor consideration initiation amplexus since claspers used attachment female claspers good condition successful initiation male horseshoe crab damaged missing clasper puts male disadvantage increases probability displaced competing male fossil evidence suggests certain euthycarcinoid extinct arthropod cambrian may also
