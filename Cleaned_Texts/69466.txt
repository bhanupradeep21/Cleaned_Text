mirror image plane mirror reflected duplication object appears almost identical reversed direction perpendicular mirror surface optical effect results reflection substances mirror water also concept geometry used conceptualization process structures geometry mirror image object twodimensional figure virtual image formed reflection plane mirror size original object yet different unless object figure reflection symmetry also known psymmetry twodimensional mirror images seen reflections mirrors reflecting surfaces printed surface seen insideout first look object effectively twodimensional writing card turn card face mirror object turns angle see leftright reversal mirror example change orientation rather mirror causes observed reversal another example stand backs mirror face object front mirror compare object reflection turning towards mirror perceive leftright reversal due change orientation examples mirror actually cause observed reversals concept reflection extended threedimensional objects including inside parts even transparent term relates structural well visual aspects threedimensional object reversed direction perpendicular mirror surface physics mirror images investigated subject called geometrical optics fundamentally geometry mathematics form principal objects coxeter group theory reflection groups chemistry two versions isomers molecule one mirror image called enantiomers superposable correct technical term though term superimposable also used example chirality chemistry general object mirror image called enantiomorphs point object coordinates x z image point reflected mirror z plane coordinates z thus reflection reversal coordinate axis perpendicular normal mirrors surface although plane mirror reverses object direction normal mirror surface turns entire threedimensional image seen mirror insideout perception leftright reversal hence reversal somewhat misleadingly called lateral inversion perception leftright reversal geometrically explained fact threedimensional object seen mirror insideout version actual object like glove stripped left hand turned righthand glove still confusion explanation amongst psychologists psychology perceived leftright reversal discussed much ado mirrors professor michael corballis see external links reflection mirror result change chirality specifically righthanded lefthanded coordinate system vice versa one looks mirror two axes updown leftright coincide mirror third axis frontback reversed person stands sideon mirror left right hands reversed directly mirror persons leftright axis normal mirror plane however important understand always two enantiomorphs object insideout image therefore matter object oriented towards mirror resulting images fundamentally identical corballis explains paper much ado mirrors mentioned picture mountain reflected lake photograph top right reversal normal reflecting surface obvious notice obvious frontback leftright mountain example urn mirror photograph right urn fairly symmetrical frontback leftright thus obvious reversal sort seen mirror image urn mirror image appears obviously threedimensional observer moves image viewed using binocular vision relative position objects changes observers perspective changes differently viewed looking mirror different positions necessarily point observation restricted halfspace one side mirror like looking mirror image space without mirrors mirror image halfspace mirror relevant another mirror mirror image halfspace mirror produce image would without also changes light distribution halfspace front behind mirror mirror hanging wall makes room brighter additional light sources appear mirror image however appearance additional light violate conservation energy principle light longer reaches behind mirror mirror simply redirects light energy terms light distribution virtual mirror image appearance effect real symmetrically arranged halfspace behind window instead mirror shadows may extend mirror halfspace vice versa mirror writing text deliberately displayed mirror image order read mirror example emergency vehicles ambulances fire engines use mirror images order read vehicles rearview mirror movie theaters also use mirror writing rear window captioning system used assist individuals hearing impairments watching films case two mirrors planes angle Î± looking sector intersection two halfspaces like looking version world rotated angle points observations directions looking applies correspond looking frame like first mirror frame mirror image respect first plane second mirror mirrors vertical edges left edge field view plane right edge first mirror edge second mirror right looked directly left mirror image case two parallel mirrors looking like looking version world translated twice distance mirrors direction perpendicular away observer since plane mirror one looks directly beyond mirror one always looks oblique angle translation mentioned component away observer also one perpendicular direction translated view also described translation observer opposite direction example vertical periscope shift world away observer length periscope practical consider equivalent shift observer backward also possible create nonreversing mirror placing two first surface mirrors give image reversed httpsenwikipediaorgwikimirrorimage
