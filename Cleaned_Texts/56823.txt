notable due one complete australian triassic reptiles known also due close relative archosauriformes believed proterosuchid taxon believed intermediate advanced nonarchosauriform archosauromorphs prolacerta basal archosauriforms proterosuchus features traditionally used define archosauria later archosauriformes presence antorbital fenestra serrated teeth known evolved prior groups due presence first named nomen nudum genus received formal description paleontologists charles lewis camp maxwell banks descriptions considered proterosuchid archosaur redescription british paleontologist tony thulborn agreed since cladistic work redefined term archosaur include avemetatarsalia lineage including pterosaurs dinosaurs modern birds pseudosuchia lineage including modern crocodylians extinct relatives aetosaurs raisuchids proterosuchids evolved prior split two groups considered archosaurs using definition lieu revelation clade archosauriformes used encompass proterosuchids archosaurs well several families one group archosauriformes component archosauromorpha broader clade refers animals closely related archosaurs lepidosaurs main group reptiles including lizards snakes tuataras transition tasmaniosaurus remained ignored rectified genus received thorough redescription martin ezcurra ezcurra also included genus comprehensive analysis archosauromorphs indicated proterosuchidae

organ alternatively another component olfactory bulbs would indicate parts brain unusually large interpretation significant ramifications biology jacobsons organ notion organ present archosauromorphs proven false notion originally formed due fact neither crocodilians birds two extant groups archosauromorphs possess organ however ezcurra notes groups specialized modes life may caused organ lost parts olfactory bulbs tasmaniosaurus would superb sense smell noted aquatic animals generally diminished olfactory capabilities compared terrestrial counterparts thus interpretation significantly lowers likelihood tasmaniosaurus relatives proterosuchids mainly aquatic sources also supported idea proterosuchids terrestrial rather aquatic specimen tasmaniosaurus also preserved bone another animal maxilla complete teeth maxilla originally interpreted belonging temnospondyl amphibian believed piece gut content known example preserved proterosuchid however ezcurra noted several aspects specimens preservation makes assignment uncertain best addition noted maxilla relatively low number teeth compared temnospondyls also ascending process may front edge antorbital fenestra factors made
