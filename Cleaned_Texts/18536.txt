blood stool rectal bleeding looks different depending early enters digestive thus much digestive action exposed much term refer either melena black appearance typically originating upper gastrointestinal bleeding hematochezia red color typically originating lower gastrointestinal evaluation blood found stool depends characteristics terms color quantity features point source however serious conditions present mixed picture form bleeding found another section term blood stool usually used describe visible blood fecal occult blood found physical examination chemical laboratory testing infants apt test used distinguish fetal hemoglobin maternal blood based differences composition fetal hemoglobin compared hemoglobin found blood stool come many sources causes range harmful serious conditions common way divide causes bleeding based source bleeding gi tract divided upper lower causes bleeding affecting entire tract upper blood stool often appears different depending source differences help diagnosing conditions rate bleeding also make blood stool look different typical upper gi tract defined organs involved digestion ligament treitz comprises esophagus stomach upper gastrointestinal bleeding typically characterized melena black stool bright red blood may seen active rapid development blood persons stool results variety conditions divided major categories disease broad categories include cancerous processes abnormal structure bowel wall inflammatory disease colitis caused infection medications vascular gut wall important movement waste products gi tract repetitive attempts bowel movement lead tearing around exit rectum anal fissure list diagnoses include diseases wall bowel compromised diseases causing inflammation gi tract lead blood inflammation occur anywhere along gi tract crohns colon person ulcerative tests considered evaluate passage blood stool based characteristics bleeding color quantity whether person passing blood low blood pressure elevated heart rate opposed normal vital following tests combined determine causes source bleeding melena defined dark tarry stools often black color due partial digestion red blood hematochezia defined bright red blood seen toilet either inside surrounding hematochezia typically presumed come lower portion gi tract initial steps diagnosis include dre fobt positive lead person large amount blood stool egd test may source active bleeding found examinations capsule endoscopy may performed order closely examine small bowel seen types melena dre fobt often also performed however suspicion source upper gi tract higher leading first use egd tests required source anoscopy another type examination used along colonoscopy exams rectum distal portion descending mucus may also found texture described tarry stool generally associated dark black stool seen partially digested generally associated melena persons age important consideration assessing cause treatment bloody stool depends largely cause bleeding bleeding commonly associated symptoms fatigue dizziness headaches even shortness breath associated symptoms also require symptoms result blood loss occur due lack red blood cells rbcs circulating vascular system resulting less oxygen reaching tissues blood stool associated serious complications result blood volume loss hemorrhage slow leak blood leading low levels hemoglobin circulating blood anemia common complication blood stool especially large amount blood bleeding occurs long period anemia also commonly associated iron deficiency due importance iron formation red blood cells anemia diagnosed result blood stool vitamins important rbc formation folate vitamin vitamin c frequently prescribed order ensure materials available cells diagnostic measures used interventions help stop bleeding cases bleeding occurs due neoplasm cancer growth treated using colonoscopy clipping surgical intervention measures depending form stage similarly stomach cancer treated depending staging although typically requires surgical medical treatment motility issues namely constipation typically improve movement waste gi tract done using stool softeners work pulling water stool colon addition fiber diet use osmotic laxatives help fluid movement colon improving overall motility improving persons gut motility reduce straining defecation decrease risk developing anal anal fissures associated pain blood toilet paper require time treatment includes topical nitrates calcium channel blockers surgical interventions chronic complex similar anal fissures internal hemorrhoids cause blood tissue wiping felt opening anus treatment options hemorrhoids dependent whether underlying cause exists anorectal varices related hemorrhoids caused cirrhosis however symptomatic treatment often involves colitis divided infectious drug induced treatment conditions infectious colitis treatment pathogen dependent generally requires use antibiotics druginduced colitis treatment typically involves removal offending agent case nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids induced peptic ulcer however removing radiation cancer patient always practical within treatment regimen medical treatment primary mode structural compromise leading blood stool caused variety conditions therefore requires different treatment condition peptic ulcer disease alone divided multiple causes generally initially controlled primarily proton pump inhibitor addition blocker serious cases requiring surgical diverticulitis diverticulosis require antibiotic treatment may require surgical inflammatory bowel disease also divided separate conditions namely ulcerative colitis crohns disease different medical treatment regimens may require surgical intervention serious
