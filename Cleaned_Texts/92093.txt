mandibular fracture also known fracture jaw break mandibular bone cases break occurs two may result decreased ability fully open often teeth feel properly aligned may bleeding mandibular fractures occur commonly among males mandibular fractures typically result include fall onto chin hit rarely may due osteonecrosis tumors common area fracture condyle body angle symphysis rarely fracture may occur ramus coronoid process diagnosis occasionally made plain xray modern ct scans immediate surgery necessarily occasionally people may go home follow surgery next number surgical techniques may
