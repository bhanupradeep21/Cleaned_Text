remifentanil marketed brand name ultiva potent shortacting synthetic opioid analgesic drug given patients surgery relieve pain adjunct anaesthetic remifentanil used sedation well combined medications use general anesthesia use remifentanil made possible use highdose opioid lowdose hypnotic anesthesia due synergism remifentanil various hypnotic drugs volatile anesthetics remifentanil used opioid analgesic rapid onset rapid recovery used effectively spinal cardiac gastric bypass opiates function similarly respect analgesia pharmacokinetics allows quicker postoperative administered form remifentanil hydrochloride adults given intravenous infusion doses ranging microgram per kilogram per minute µgkgmin children may require higher infusion rates clinically useful infusion rates µgkgmin sedation rates adjusted age patient severity illness invasiveness surgical procedure small amounts sedative medications usually coadministered remifentanil produce sedation clinically useful infusion rates general anesthesia vary usually remifentanil administered part anesthesia technique called tiva total intravenous anesthesia using computer controlled infusion pumps process called target controlled infusion tci target plasma concentration entered ngml pump calculates infusion rate according patient factors like age weight induction levels ngml commonly used generally varies ngml certain surgical procedures produce particularly strong stimuli level ngml might needed relatively short contextsensitive halflife remifentanil allows desired blood plasma level achieved quickly also reason recovery occurs quickly allows remifentanil used unique circumstances cesarean remifentanils short contextsensitive halflife makes ideal intense pain short duration used analgesia labor successfully however effective epidural combination propofol remifentanil used anesthesia patients undergoing electroconvulsive remifentanil considered metabolic soft one rapidly metabolized inactive form unlike synthetic opioids hepatically metabolized remifentanil ester linkage undergoes rapid hydrolysis nonspecific tissue plasma esterases means accumulation occur remifentanil contextsensitive halflife remains minutes infusion remifentanil metabolized compound remifentanil acid potency parent due quick metabolism short effects remifentanil opened new possibilities anesthesia remifentanil used together hypnotic ie one produces sleep used relative high doses remifentanil rapidly eliminated blood plasma termination remifentanil infusion hence effects drug quickly dissipate even long infusions owing synergism remifentanil hypnotic drugs propofol dose hypnotic substantially leads often hemodynamic stability surgery quicker postoperative recovery time remifentanil specific μreceptor hence causes reduction sympathetic nervous system tone respiratory depression analgesia drugs effects include dosedependent decrease heart rate arterial pressure respiratory rate tidal volume muscle rigidity sometimes noted common side effects reported patients receiving medication sense extreme dizziness often short lived common side effect fastacting synthetic phenylpiperidine narcotics fentanyl alfentanil intense itching pruritus often around face side effects often controlled either altering administered dose decreasing cases increasing dose administering sedatives allow patient tolerate lose awareness side effect pruritus partially due excessive serum histamine levels antihistamines diphenhydramine benadryl often coadministered done care however excessive sedation may occur nausea occur side effect remifentanil however usually transient nature due drugs short halflife rapidly removes patients circulation infusion terminated comparing analgesiasedation effect ventilated patients remifentanil may superior remifentanil used success circumvent naltrexone patients need pain management remifentanil μreceptor agonist functions like μreceptor agonists morphine codeine cause euphoria potential however due rapid metabolism shortacting halflife likelihood abuse quite low nevertheless documentations remifentanil prior development remifentanil shortacting hypnotics amnestics faced issues prolonged use accumulation would result unfavorable lingering effects postoperative recovery remifentanil designed serve strong anesthetic ultrashort predictable duration would
