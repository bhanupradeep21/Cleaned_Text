corneal abrasion scratch surface cornea symptoms include pain redness light sensitivity feeling like foreign body people recover completely within three cases due minor trauma eye occur contact lens use cases occur diagnosis often slit lamp examination fluorescein dye significant injuries like corneal ulcer globe rupture recurrent erosion syndrome foreign body within eye ruled prevention includes use eye treatment typically antibiotic wear contact lenses fluoroquinolone antibiotic often paracetamol acetaminophen nsaids eye drops cyclopentolate paralyse pupil help evidence support usefulness eye patching simple per people affected year united males often affected typical age group affected complications include bacterial keratitis corneal ulcer complications may occur signs symptoms corneal abrasion include pain trouble bright lights foreignbody sensation excessive squinting reflex production tears signs include epithelial defects edema often redness eye vision may blurred swelling cornea excess tears crusty buildup excess tears may also presentcitation needed complications exception rather rule simple corneal abrasions important foreign body identified removed especially containing iron rusting occurcitation needed occasionally healed epithelium may poorly adherent underlying basement membrane case may detach intervals giving rise recurrent corneal erosions corneal abrasions generally result trauma surface eye common causes include poked finger walking tree branch wearing old contact lensescitation needed foreign body eye may also cause scratch eye rubbedcitation needed injuries also incurred hard soft contact lenses left long damage may result lenses removed rather lens still contact eye addition cornea becomes excessively dry may become brittle easily damaged movement across surface soft contact lens wear overnight extensively linked gram negative keratitis infection cornea particularly bacterium known pseudomonas aeruginosa forms eyes biofilm result extended soft contact lens wear corneal abrasion occurs either contact lens another source injured cornea much susceptible type bacterial infection noncontact lens users would optical emergency sight cases eye threatening contact lens wearers present corneal abrasions never pressure patched shown clinical studies patching creates warm moist dark environment cause cornea become infected cause existing infection greatly accelerated destructive pathcitation needed corneal abrasions also common recurrent feature people specific types corneal dystrophy lattice corneal dystrophy lattice dystrophy gets name accumulation amyloid deposits abnormal protein fibers throughout middle anterior stroma eye examination doctor sees deposits stroma clear commashaped overlapping dots branching filaments creating lattice effect time lattice lines grow opaque involve stroma also gradually converge giving cornea cloudiness may also reduce vision people abnormal protein fibers accumulate corneas outer epithelium cause erosion epithelium condition known recurrent epithelial erosion erosions alter corneas normal curvature resulting temporary vision problems expose nerves line cornea causing severe pain even involuntary act blinking painfulcitation needed although corneal abrasions may seen ophthalmoscopes slit lamp microscopes provide higher magnification allow thorough evaluation aid viewing fluorescein stain fills corneal defect glows cobalt bluelight generally instilled firstcitation needed careful search made foreign body particular looking eyelids injury following use hammers powertools always raise possibility penetrating foreign body eye urgent ophthalmology opinion sought prevention best method avoid recurrence corneal abrasions protective eyewear worn people work hazardous machinery metal wood chemicals well perform yard work participate certain contact sports appropriate type protective eyewear depends specific circumstances provide shielding good visibility comfortable fit examples include polycarbonate glasses goggles plastic safety glasses face shields welding helmets specifically welders use helmet lens blocks uv light avoid uv keratitis important notice people one eye especially vulnerable potentially blinding injuries pay special attention protecting eyes cases protective eyewear ensure degree safety also allowing people participate normal daytoday activitiescitation needed ensuring proper contact lens fit compliance person care measures prevent contact lensrelated stated previously cause mechanic damage cornea risk factor development microbial keratitis thus emphasis placed reducing lens contamination using effective disinfecting solutions well antimicrobial contact lenses cases important avoid swimming contact lenses increases frequency bacterial infections primarily staphylococcus epidermidis organisms found contaminated water finally people use contact lenses also avoid mechanical infectious trauma using contacts beyond length intended usecitation needed treatment corneal abrasions aims prevent bacterial superinfection speed healing provide symptomatic foreign body found needs removed current recommendations stress need use topical andor oral analgesia topical antibiotics one review found eye drops numb surface eye tetracaine improve pain however safety another review find evidence benefit concluded enough data topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids useful reduce pain caused corneal diclofenac ketorolac used one drop four times day worth noting however diclofenac may delay wound healing ketorolac avoided people wear contact lenses studies recommend using topical nsaids due risk corneal toxicity direct evidence regarding use oral analgesics pain relief main concern people corneal abrasions prescribed according individuals characteristics topical antibiotics used prevent concomitant infections result slower healing corneal ointments considered firstline treatment lubricating drops person uses contact lenses antibiotic antipseudomonal activity preferred ciprofloxacin gentamicin ofloxacin use contact lenses discontinued abrasion healed antibiotic treatment ended contact lens wearers often colonized pseudomonas aeruginosa may cause corneal perforations subsequent permanent vision loss mechanism injury involves contact lenses fingernails organic plant matter antibiotic prophylaxis provided topical fluoroquinolone drops times day fluoroquinolone ointment typically ciprofloxacin night abrasion caused another mechanism recommended treatment includes antibiotic ointments erythromycin bacitracin bacitracinpolymyxin b every hours antibiotic drops usually polymyxin b trimethoprim times day eye patching generally recommended help healing furthermore result decreased oxygen delivery increased moisture higher chance infection another measure longer recommended use mydriatics formerly used relieve pain caused ciliary muscle
