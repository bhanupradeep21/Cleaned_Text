patellofemoral pain syndrome pfps confused jumpers knee knee pain result problems kneecap pain generally front knee comes pain may worsen sitting excessive use climbing descending exact cause unclear believed due risk factors include trauma increased training weak quadriceps particularly common among diagnosis generally based symptoms pushing kneecap femur increases pain diagnosis treatment typically involves rest rehabilitation physical runners may need switch activities cycling insoles may help symptoms may last years despite patellofemoral pain syndrome common cause knee pain affecting young occurs times often females onset condition usually although cases may appear suddenly following common symptom diffuse vague pain around kneecap peripatellar localized pain focused behind kneecap retropatellar affected individuals typically difficulty describing location pain may place hands anterior patella describe circle around patella often called circle pain usually initiated weight put knee extensor mechanism ascending descending stairs slopes squatting kneeling cycling pain prolonged sitting sometimes termed movie sign theatre sign individuals might experience
