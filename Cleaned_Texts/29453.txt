modern history hypertension begins understanding cardiovascular system based work physician william harvey described circulation blood book de motu cordis english clergyman stephen hales made first published measurement blood pressure descriptions would come called hypertension came among others thomas young especially richard bright bright noted link cardiac hypertrophy kidney disease subsequently kidney disease often termed brights disease period george johnson suggested thickened blood vessels seen kidney brights disease might adaptation elevated blood william senhouse kirkes ludwig traube also proposed based pathological observations elevated pressure could account association left ventricular hypertrophy kidney damage brights samuel wilks observed left ventricular hypertrophy diseased arteries necessarily associated diseased implying high blood pressure might occur people healthy kidneys however first report elevated blood pressure person without evidence kidney disease made frederick akbar mahomed using concept hypertensive disease generalized circulatory disease taken sir clifford allbutt termed condition however hypertension medical entity really came invention cuffbased sphygmomanometer scipione rivarocci allowed blood pressure measured clinic nikolai korotkoff improved technique describing korotkoff sounds heard artery ausculted stethoscope sphygmomanometer cuff tracking serial blood pressure measurements enhanced donal nunn invented accurate fully automated oscillometric sphygmomanometer device term essential hypertension essentielle hypertonie coined eberhard frank describe elevated blood pressure cause could term malignant hypertension coined physicians mayo clinic describe syndrome high blood pressure severe retinopathy inadequate kidney function usually resulted death within year strokes heart failure kidney prominent individual severe hypertension franklin however menace severe malignant hypertension well recognised risks moderate elevations blood pressure uncertain benefits treatment doubtful consequently hypertension often classified malignant benign john hay professor medicine liverpool university wrote truth saying greatest danger man high blood pressure lies discovery fool certain try reduce view echoed us cardiologist paul dudley white suggested hypertension may important compensatory mechanism tampered even certain could control charles friedbergs classic textbook diseases stated people mild benign hypertension defined blood pressures levels mm hg need however tide medical opinion turning increasingly recognised benign hypertension next decade increasing evidence accumulated actuarial longitudinal studies framingham heart benign hypertension increased death cardiovascular disease risks increased graded manner increasing blood pressure across whole spectrum population blood pressures subsequently national institutes health also sponsored population studies additionally showed african americans higher burden hypertension historically treatment called hard pulse disease consisted reducing quantity blood blood letting application advocated yellow emperor china cornelius celsus galen late early mid centuries many therapies used treat poorly therapies used period included strict sodium restriction example rice sympathectomy surgical ablation parts sympathetic nervous pyrogen therapy injection substances caused fever indirectly reducing blood first chemical hypertension sodium thiocyanate used many side treatments barbiturates bismuth bromides mainly supportive rather drugs used second world war popular reasonably effective tetramethylammonium chloride derivative also used postwar period reserpine derived medicinal plant rauvolfia major breakthrough achieved discovery welltolerated oral diuretics first chlorothiazide derived antibiotic sulfanilamide became available randomized controlled trial sponsored veterans administration comparing hydrochlorothiazide plus reserpine plus hydralazine versus placebo stopped early receiving treatment developed many complications deemed unethical withhold treatment study continued people lower blood pressures showed treatment even people mild hypertension halved risk cardiovascular lasker special public health award awarded team developed results studies prompted public health campaigns increase public awareness hypertension promoted measurement treatment high blood pressure measures appear contributed least part observed fall stroke ischemic heart disease soon drugs became available treat hypertension british physician james w black developed beta blockers early initially used angina turned lower blood pressure black received lasker award nobel prize physiology medicine next class antihypertensives discovered calcium channel blockers first member verapamil derivative papaverine initially thought beta blocker used angina turned different mode action shown lower blood system known play important role blood pressure regulation angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitors developed rational drug design captopril orally active agent led development number ace recently angiotensin receptor blockers renin inhibitors also introduced antihypertensive httpsenwikipediaorgwikihistoryofhypertension
