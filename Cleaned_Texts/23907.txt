natural toxins acts voltagegated sodium channels neurons preventing normal cellular function leading voltagegated sodium channel essential normal neuronal functioning exists integral membrane proteins interspersed along axon neuron possessing four domains span cell membrane opening voltagegated sodium channel occurs change voltage ligand binds right way foremost importance sodium channels function
