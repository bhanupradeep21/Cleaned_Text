geographic tongue also known several termsnote condition mucous membrane tongue usually dorsal surface common condition affecting approximately general characterized areas smooth red depapillation loss lingual papillae migrate time name comes maplike appearance patches resembling islands cause unknown condition entirely benign importantly represent oral cancer curative treatment uncommonly geographic tongue may cause burning sensation tongue various treatments described little formal evidence efficacy health dorsal surface tongue covered tuftlike projections called lingual papillae associated taste buds give tongue irregular surface texture whitepink color geographic tongue characterized areas atrophy depapillation loss papillae leaving erythematous darker red smoother surface unaffected areas depapillated areas usually bordered slightly raised white yellow grey serpiginous snaking peripheral lesion geographic tongue may start white patch depapillation certain cases may one lesion lesions typically occur multiple locations tongue coalesce time form typical maplike appearance lesions usually change shape size migrate areas sometimes within condition may affect part tongue predilection tip sides entire dorsal surface one time condition goes periods remission relapse loss white peripheral zone thought signify periods mucosal usually symptoms unusual appearance tongue cases persons may experience pain burning eg eating hot acidic spicy kinds foods eg cheese tomatoes burning symptom causes burning sensation tongue considered oral cause geographic tongue usually cause symptoms cases symptoms oral parafunctional habit may contributory persons parafunctional habits related tongue may show scalloping sides tongue crenated tongue suggest hormonal factors may one

smoking tobacco sometimes geographic tongue said run reported associated several different genes though studies show family association may also caused similar diets reported links various human leukocyte antigens increased incidence decreased incidence vitamin deficiency ariboflavinosis cause several signs mouth possibly including geographic although sources state geographic tongue related nutritional fissured tongue often occurs simultaneously geographic consider fissured tongue end stage geographic past research suggested geographic tongue associated diabetes seborrheic dermatitis atopy however newer research corroborate others suggest allergy major factor eg nickel studies reported link geographic tongue although children diagnosed geographic tongue develop however modern
