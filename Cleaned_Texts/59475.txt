vertebral osteomyelitis type osteomyelitis infection inflammation bone bone marrow affects vertebrae rare bone infection concentrated vertebral cases vertebral osteomyelitis rare constitute bone infection classified acute chronic depending severity onset acute patients often experience better outcomes living chronic symptoms characteristic disease although vertebral osteomyelitis found patients across wide range ages infection commonly reported young children older adults vertebral osteomyelitis often attacks two vertebrae corresponding intervertebral disk causing narrowing disc space prognosis disease dependent infection concentrated spine time initial onset treatment approach used treat disease disease known subtle onset patients symptoms characterize vertebral osteomyelitis correct diagnosis disease often delayed average six twelve weeks due vague ambiguous general symptoms found crosssection patients vertebral osteomyelitis include fever swelling infection site weakness vertebral column surrounding muscles episodes night sweats difficulty transitioning standing sitting additionally persistent back pain muscle spasms may become debilitating confine patient sedentary state even slight movement jolting body results excruciating pain children presence vertebral osteomyelitis signaled symptoms along highgrade fevers increase bodys leukocyte patients advanced case may present none symptoms associated general cases vertebral osteomyelitis osteomyelitis isolated back vertebral osteomyelitis patient report muscle spasms coming back may report experiencing symptomatic signs vary patient depend severity case neurologic deficiency characterizes advanced threatening cases disease average patients advanced case vertebral osteomyelitis experience type neurological deficiency sign infection progressing time advanced cases untreated infection attack nervous system spinal cord runs parallel vertebral column placing patient risk paralysis extremities additionally loss ability move trademark symptom neurologic problems advanced cases vertebral osteomyelitis signs neurological deficit signal advanced case vertebral osteomyelitis requires immediate intervention prevent threat spinal notable aspect disease found ability start anywhere body spread regions number bacterial strains enter body manner making origin infection hard trace thus many patients infection characteristic delay accurate diagnosis prolong suffering common microorganism associated vertebral osteomyelitis bacteria staphylococcus aureus another strain staphylococcus aureus commonly known methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa particularly harmful microorganism difficult treat related strains streptococcus equisimilis may also responsible onset vertebral osteomyelitis though thought less virulent staphylococcus recently healthcare associated vertebral osteomyelitis havo reported make relevant share vo cases lead higher rates mortality recurrence infection compared community acquired vertebral osteomyelitis cavo particularly context medical interventions havo lowvirulent coagulasenegative staphylococci playing increasing role bringing problem methicillin diagnosis vertebral osteomyelitis often complicated due delay onset disease initial display symptoms pursuing radiological methods testing physicians often order full blood test see patients levels compare normal blood levels healthy complete blood test creactive protein crp indicator infection levels complete blood count cbc evaluates presence white red blood cells erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr tests inflammation body anomalous values lie outside acceptable ranges subcategories confirm presence infection body indicate diagnostic measures necessary blood tests may prove inconclusive may serve enough evidence confirm presence vertebral osteomyelitis diagnosis also complicated due diseases similarity discitis commonly known infection disc space diseases characterized patients inability walk concentrated back pain however patients vertebral osteomyelitis often appear ill additional measures may called upon rule possibility discitis approaches include diagnosing disease various medical imaging techniquescitation needed radiological intervention often necessary confirm presence vertebral osteomyelitis body plainfilm radiological orders necessary patients displaying symptoms disease diagnostic approach often preliminary radiological procedures magnetic resonance imaging mri computed tomography ct scan fineneedle aspiration biopsy nuclear scintigraphy initial plainfilm xray images scanned indication disc compression two vertebrae degeneration one vertebrae findings ambiguous testing necessary diagnose disease radiological approaches offer comprehensive imaging spinal area often prove inconclusive mri scans expose patient radiation highly sensitive changes size appearance intervertebral discs however findings mri scan may confused conditions presence tumors bone fractures mri imaging inconclusive high sensitivity erosions vertebrae intervertebral discs ct scans may preferred ability indicate signs disease clearly mri additional tests may ordered preliminary tests confirm diagnosis example needle biopsies may needed take samples bone surrounding disc space infection thought live nuclear bone scans may used contrast areas healthy bone areas treatment options vertebral osteomyelitis depend severity infection since use intravenous antibiotics seems eliminate responsible pathogen cases vertebral osteomyelitis physicians often attempt nonsurgical intervention considering surgical options nonsurgical intervention often desired possesses less risk body infection occur body unnecessarily exposed outside pathogens surgery intravaneous antibiotics may prescribed kill microorganism causing infection antibiotics administered continuous rate varying amount time lasting four weeks several months outcome patients undergo intravaneous infusion differs according factors age strength immune system erythrocyte sedimentation rate intervention antibiotics fails patients directed toward surgical treatment absolute indications surgical treatment must include sepsis epidural abscess neurologic deficitscomplications instabilitydeformity affected motion segment surgery may required patients advanced cases vertebral osteomyelitis spinal fusion common approach destroying microorganism causing disease rebuilding parts spine lost due infection fusions approached anteriorly posteriorly depending infection located vertebral area spinal fusions involve cleaning infected area spine inserting instrumentation stabilize vertebrae instrumentation often includes bone grafts harvested areas body bone bank bone fragments harvested deceased new bone graft secured appropriate spinal region use supporting rods screws made titanium rods material promote healing fusion bones efficiently stainless steel rods also visible cases severe osteolysis instability ventral column use vertebral body replacement implants may necessary implanted minimally invasively thoracoscopically thoracolumbar spine mortality rates noted higher patients whose infection due bacteria staphylococcus aureus however diagnosed quickly treated correctly patients staphylococcus aureus experience better outcomes disease caused microorganisms subtle progression vertebral osteomyelitis places patients risk paralysis especially infection concentrated thoracic cervical research published journal bone joint surgery notes patients experience symptoms infection following surgical therefore patients advanced case vertebral osteomyelitis undergo surgical approach often experience better outcomes
