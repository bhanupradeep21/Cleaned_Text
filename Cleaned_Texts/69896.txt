remains like unexpected discovery hominid fossils korea shows continuation upper paleolithic culture late pleistocene period although late pleistocene hominin fossil records china japan relatively well known record korean peninsula poorly understood outside korea peopling japanese archipelago likely type watercraft korean peninsula easternmost part eurasian landmass reached terrestrially restricted hominins middle late pleistocene furthermore korean peninsula never cut chinese mainland japanese archipelago almost periods except extreme glaciations thus quite possible hominins presumably h erectus reached china early andor middle pleistocene could reached korean peninsula well research korean pleistocene initiated early since time thirteen caves fifteen openair sites korean
