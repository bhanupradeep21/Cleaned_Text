discovered prospect theory daniel kahneman amos one main controversies understanding loss aversion whether phenomenon manifests brain perhaps increased attention arousal losses another area research whether loss aversion evident subcortices limbic system thereby involving emotional basic controversy loss aversion research whether losses actually experienced negatively equivalent gains merely

physiological signals loss aversion may suggest experience losses merely attention known loss attention attentional orienting responses also lead increased autonomic brain studies initially suggested increased medial prefrontal anterior cingulate cortex rapid response following losses compared interpreted neural signature loss aversion however subsequent reviews noticed paradigm individuals actually show behavioral loss casting doubts interpretability findings respect fmri studies one study found evidence increase activation areas related negative emotional reactions response loss another found individuals damaged amygdalas lack loss aversion even though normal levels general risk aversion suggesting behavior specific potential conflicting studies suggest research needs done
