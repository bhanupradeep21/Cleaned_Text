undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma ups also termed pleomorphic highgrade myofibroblastic sarcoma highgrade characterized world health organization rare poorly differentiated neoplasm ie abnormal growth cells unclear identity andor cell classified one undifferentiatedunclassified sarcomas category tumors uncertain sarcomas cancers known thought derive mesenchymal stem cells typically develop bone muscle fat blood vessels lymphatic vessels tendons sarcoma subtypes ups subtype sarcomas consists tumor cells poorly differentiated may appear spindleshaped cells histiocytes giant ups considered diagnosis defies formal subclassification thorough histologic immunohistochemical ultrastructural examinations fail identify type cells diagnosis ups initially included malignant fibrous histiocytomas mfh regarded wastebasket category various sarcoma types including sarcomalike carcinomas studies strongly suggest mfh tumors derived histiocytes cells descended blood rather mesenchymal ups also regarded aggressive metastasizing form lowgrade myofibroblastic sarcomas myofibroblasic combined low intermediategrade myofibroblastic sarcomas single entity lowgrade myofibroblastic sarcomas categorized one type intermediate rarely metastasizing fibroblastic myofibroblastic tumors quite distinct low incidence frequent grouping considered sarcoma types past findings clinical behaviour proper treatment prognosis ups may revised majority ups tumors highly aggressive often recur surgical removal often treated combination surgical resection radiotherapy andor recently ups tumors treated antibody therapy ie antibodies case ups bind specific antigens surface tcells type lymphocyte thereby promote ability tcells organizes attack ups tumor ups commonly presents deepseated rapidly enlarging painless mass individuals aged years masses rarely superficial lesions rarely occur pediatric retrospective study individuals ups tumors ranged cm greatest diameter average cm greatest

retrospective study distant metastases detected time initial diagnosis overall metastases develop individuals metastases reported occur lung cases less commonly sites lymph nodes near primary review study conducted china individuals ups reported individuals age years median age years subtype paraneoplastic syndrome termed neoplastic fever ie individuals suffered continuous disabling fevers tumors located within thigh muscle cases upper arm cases lower leg case compared individuals median age years similar distribution ups tumors individuals neoplastic syndrome similar tumor recurrence rates vs

individuals ups evidence ups diagnosis exclusion diagnosis reached process elimination histopathology disorders tumors nonspecific ups tumor cells undifferentiated ie resemble particular cell type pleomorphic ie highly variable size shape andor color examined microscopically therefore diagnosis ups commonly based detecting specific set proteins expressed ups tumor cells cells undifferentiated pleomorphic tumors visa versa see diagnosis study individuals found ups tumor cells expressed surface membranes protein ie programmed deathligand protein either focally cases strongly cases individuals tumor cells also expressed protein ie indoleamine tumor cells strongly expressed also expressed protein ie cklf like marvel transmembrane domain containing strong expression proved poor

copies gene ie later study examined individuals ups tumor cells expressed cases showing weak intermediate strong expression study patients ups cases showed cases showed low showed intermediate strong immunoreactivity ie amp deaminase protein gains protein immunoreactivity associated copy number gains gene patients higher levels poorer prognoses year survivals positive versus negative cases abnormalities found isolated cases ups include amplification hippo signaling pathway intracellular cell signaling pathway regulates cell proliferation cell amplification associated overexpression two

suppressor protein deletions andor mutations gene encodes tumor protein protein regulates cell proliferation cell death mutations atrx gene encodes transcriptional regulator atrx protein contributes regulating expression various mutations gene encodes lysine nmethyltransferase protein gene mutated various cancer amplification gene encodes receptorÎ± protein mutations gene commonly found acute

undifferentiated tumor cells features suggestive ups features tumor types also consist pleomorphic undifferentiated cells features primarily involve expression certain proteins tumor cells identifying

features often used treatment localized ie metastases ups tumors complete surgical removal object leaving tumor cells behind evidenced microscopic examinations adjuvant therapy combining radiotherapy orand chemotherapy surgical resection employed reduce risk developing recurrent metastatic disease cases highrisk disease eg large tumors tumors deemed highly aggressive based pathology andor local invasiveness inoperable tumors resections remove tumor standard chemotherapy twodrug regimen epirubicin plus ifosfamide may used place combined surgery andor radiotherapy severe andor metastatic cases

cyclophosphamide doxorubicin plus dacarbazine high dose methotrexate etoposide ifosfamide treatment regimens reported lower local recurrence prolong diseasefree survival rates ie time treatment disease increase overall survival rates ie time treatment death however studies report addition radiotherapy andor chemotherapy surgical resection improve recurrence overall survival addition radiotherapy surgery improves local control ups tumors diseasefree survival rates ie time treatment recurrence adjuvant chemotherapy radiotherapy significant effects local recurrencefree survival
