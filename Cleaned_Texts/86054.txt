lolitrem b one many toxins produced fungus called epichloë festucae var lolii grows lolium perenne perennial ryegrass fungus symbiotic ryegrass doesnt harm plant toxins produces kill insects feed ryegrass lolitrem b one toxins also harmful mammals shoots flowers infected ryegrass especially high concentrations lolitrem b livestock eat much get perennial ryegrass staggers low doses animals tremors higher doses stagger higher yet doses animals become paralyzed die blood pressure animals also goes effect lolitrem b comes slowly fades slowly stored fat ryegrass eaten condition especially common new zealand australia plant breeders trying develop strains fungus produce toxins harmful pests mammals lolitrem b affects kind ion channel called bk channels channels normally open temporarily allow neurons electrically sensitive cells like heart cells reset fire lolitrem b blocks preventing neuron heart cell firing affects nerve heart function channel also involved blood vessel relaxation blocking channel causes blood vessels constrict raising blood pressure lolitrem b toxin derives first part name loli host fungus lolium perenne middle part trem due tremors toxin known cause last part name b part way distinguish different lolitrems based difference chemical structure see chemistry lolitrem b found perennial ryegrass infected fungus e f formerly neotyphodium fungus endophyte part lifecycle lives inside plants growing plant cells prevalent ryegrass fungus produces lolitrem b one several mycotoxins kill pests also neurotoxins animals eat ryegrass stems infected e f lolii get condition called perennial ryegrass staggers cases mild poisoning animals get tremors severe poisoning stagger horses tremors eyeball muscles seen severe eating lolitrem b also increase heart rate blood pressure respiration rate disrupt digestion lolitrems distinguish among tremorgenic neurotoxins induce long lasting effect motor function heart rate tremors last hours high concentrations cause death animals lolitrem b often causes death related unfortunate accidents falling pond neurotoxic effects completely threshold toxicity varies species animals sheep threshold value mgkg found cattle measuring lolitrem b concentration fat tissue used estimate amount lolitrem b consumed used determine cause death cattle presenting neurological lolitrem b likely acts synergistically ergotamine increase smooth muscle e f lolii infects ryegrass worldwide cases perennial ryegrass staggers rare outside australia new zealand reasons unclear may purposeful selection endophyteinfected ryegrass plant breeders prize resistance pests prevalent australia new zealand elsewhere practice monoculture farmers plant breeders working mycologists australia new zealand develop strains fungus produce mycotoxins toxic pests become commercially established best prevention avoiding grazing livestock ryegrass stems emerging plant flowering concentrations highest mature inflorescence base plant avoiding overgrazing exposure lolitrem b ends symptoms gradually lolitrem b rapidly eliminated serum halflife lolitrem b soluble generally stored fat ingestion slowly released likely effects come slowly linger ingestion ingested stored lolitrem b targets large conductance calciumactivated potassium channels bk channels particular α subunit hslo bk channels open temporarily allow neurons reset fire lolitrem b blocks preventing neuron firing depolarizes low doses leads tremors high doses paralysis binding site lolitrem b likely located α lolitrem b added potassium current quickly gets abolished inhibition reversed washout reversal possible paxilline however time lolitrem b slowly dissociates binding site inhibition lolitrem b calcium concentrationdependent concentration half maximal inhibition hslo found nm lolitrem b potent neurotoxin vitro compared lolitrem b preferably blocks open configuration bk channels high calcium concentrations promoting opening bk channels apparent affinity increases inhibition lolitrem b affinity differs calcium concentration lolitrem b highest affinity bk channels high probability open conformation thus calcium binds high affinity sites inhibition occurs channels open bk channels oppose vasoconstriction blood vessels resulting vasorelaxation blocking channels leads vasoconstriction increase blood bk channel α subunit expressed muscle nerve tissue bk channels abundant bk channels modulate neurotransmitter release form action potential repetitive inhibition channels explain would increased release excitatory neurotransmitters resulting tremors ataxia hypersensitivity increased smooth muscle contraction colon increased heart lolitrem b potent member lolitrem possesses indolediterpene unit well reactive epoxide structurally looks like paxilline related tremor multiple lolitrems labelled letter difference position number aryl hydroxyl substituents plus absence presence ring ring seems necessary prolonged tremors intermediate metabolites terpendoles paspaline become lolitrems addition two rings b position indole moiety production lolitrems including b requires different locus ltm locus organized three clusters clusters separated large atrich sequences cluster contains genes ltmg ltmk ltmm cluster contains ltmp ltmf ltmb ltmq ltmc cluster ltme ltmj four genes cluster orthologues functional characterized paxilline genes meaning genes show homologous sequences genes cluster appear unique epichloë much research lolitrem synthesis performed young group including young et al young et al provides
