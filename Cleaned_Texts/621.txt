communication accommodation theory cat theory communication developed howard giles theory concerns behavioral changes people make attune communication partner extent people perceive partner appropriately attuning basis theory lies idea people adjust accommodate style speech one another helps message sender gain approval receiver increases efficiency communication parties helps sender maintain positive social identity theory concerned links language context focuses intergroup interpersonal factors lead accommodation well ways power macro microcontext concerns affect communication behaviors emphasizing important duplexity factors predicting understanding intergroup accommodation usually considered message sender message receiver communicator also often accommodates larger audience either group people watching interaction society general communication accommodation theory cat predicts explains communicants make adjustments increase decrease maintain social communication accommodation theorists focus patterns convergence divergence communication behaviors particularly relate people goals social approval communication efficiency convergence refers strategies individuals adapt others communicative behaviors reduce social convergence likely occur perceived costs proportionally lower anticipated meanwhile divergence refers instances individuals accentuate speech nonverbal differences social psychologists giles taylor bourhis laid foundations named speech accommodation theory sat dissatisfaction sociolinguistics descriptive rather explanatory appraisal linguistic variation social contexts well provide burgeoning study language attitudes theoretical speech accommodation theory developed demonstrate value social psychological concepts understanding dynamics sought explain motivations underlying certain shifts peoples speech styles social encounters social consequences arising particularly focused cognitive affective processes underlying individuals convergence divergence speech communication accommodation theory broadened theory include speech also nonverbal discursive dimensions social cat also created different perspective research language social communication focuses either interpersonal intergroup like speech accommodation theory communication accommodation theory continues draw social psychology particularly four main sociopsychology theories similarityattraction social exchange causal attribution intergroup distinctiveness theories help explain speakers seek converge diverge language dialect accent behavior interlocutors cat also relies heavily social identity theory latter theory argues persons selfconcept comprises personal identity social identity social identity based comparisons people make ingroups groups belong outgroups groups belong according social identity theory people strive maintain positive social identity either joining groups feel comfortable making positive experience belonging groups already belong since speech way express group membership people adopt convergence divergence communication signal salient group distinctiveness reinforce social communication accommodation thus becomes tool emphasize group distinctiveness positive way strengthen individuals social identity four main sociopsychological theories similarityattraction one biggest contributors theory communication accommodation similarityattraction theory posits similar attitudes beliefs others likely attracted convergence verbal nonverbal communication one mechanisms use become similar others increasing attraction towards reason said one factors leads individuals use convergence desire obtain social approval could hence concluded greater ones need social approval greater ones tendency natal√© instance found speakers high needs approval converge anothers vocal intensity pause length low needs individual receiving end high level accommodation likely develop greater sense selfesteem satisfaction receiver low accommodation social exchange process theory states prior acting attempt assess rewards costs alternate courses tend choose whatever course action bring greater rewards less costs social exchange theory theory looks people evaluate relationships throughout process evaluating relationships individuals want feel receiving relationship expending within relationship words people like relationships rewards outweigh costs although often convergence bring forth rewards occasions also bring forth costs increased effort converge loss perceived integrity personal sometimes group hence choosing whether use convergence people assess costs causal attribution theory suggests interpret peoples behavior evaluate individual terms motivations intentions attribute cause applies convergence convergence might viewed positively negatively depending causes attribute although interpersonal convergence generally favorably received nonconvergence generally unfavorably received extent holds true undoubtedly influenced listeners attributions speakers giles smith provide example experiment conducted amongst french english speaking canadians illustrate experiment individuals believed person different group used language convergence reduce cultural barriers evaluated positively attributed pressures situation french canadian listeners attributed english canadians convergence french due desire break cultural barriers shift viewed favorably however behavior attributed pressures situation forcing converge positive feelings strongly process intergroup distinctiveness theorized tajfel argues members different groups contact compare dimensions important personal attributes abilities material possessions intergroup social comparisons individuals seek find ways make positively distinct outgroup enhance social speech style language important factor defining social groups divergence speech style language often used maintain intergroup distinctiveness differentiate outgroup especially group membership salient issue individuals identity group membership many principles concepts social identity theory also applicable communication accommodation theory influence social psychology especially social identity theory communication accommodation theory guided mainly four assumptions first assumption indicates people bring past experience conversations therefore communication influenced situational conditions initial reactions also socialhistorical context interaction prior experiences people others influence communication future accommodate others peoples attitudes beliefs derived factors determine extent willing accommodate conversation similarities share likely accommodate second assumption concerned people perceive evaluate conversation perception process attending interpreting evaluation process judging someone enters conversation usually first observes takes place decides whether adjust fit example would walking break room work two coworkers discussing birthday celebration boss person walked would evaluate talking determine proceed would decide join conversation acknowledge two coworkers leave decided join conversation would determine communicate based people talking situation however decision accommodation always necessary two strangers meet may random small talk simply say goodbye neither likely evaluate conversation since little chance meeting importance language behavior illustrated third assumption since indicators social status group belongings two people speak different languages try conversation language used likely one used higher status person occurs two reasons first individual lower status likely desires approval liking individual higher status similarity increases liking desire leads convergence second individual recognizes hold higher status person communicating likely converge communication behavior lower status individual fact likely example lower status individual choice converge language higher status individual idea salient social negotiation illustrated well interview interviewee usually makes efforts identify interviewer accommodating way spoken behaved raise chance getting job interviewer knows higher status interviewee therefore converge communication behavior interviewee desires liking achieved similarity order achieve similarity interviewee must converge communication behavior last assumption puts emphasis social appropriateness norms norms defined expectations behaviors individuals feel occur expectations give guidance peoples behaviors helping figure appropriate way accommodate time accommodation made according norms perceived socially appropriate instance young person talks seniors family avoid using jargons among generation show respect communicate smoothly communicator careful result stereotyping communicator sure norms person considers socially appropriate making incorrect assumptions harmful relationship helpful convergence refers process individual shifts speech patterns interaction closely resemble speech patterns speech people converge many features communication use language pronunciation pause utterance lengths vocal intensities non verbal behaviors intimacy self disclosures giles smith necessarily converge simultaneously levels fact people converge levels diverge others people use convergence based perceptions others well able infer backgrounds attraction likability charisma credibility also triggers convergence turner west note communicators attracted others converge hand similarity attraction theory highlights people similar beliefs personality behaviors tend attracted towards achieve desired social distance pardo people use language converge towards conversational partner attracted desire make social interaction flow subsequently results convergence many people tend converge one another want feel sense fitting experience social approval people around thus one individual shifts speech nonverbal behaviors order assimilate result favorable appraisal convergence perceived positively likely enhance conversation attraction listener speaker reason could said convergence reflects individuals desire social interlocutor greater individuals need social approval likely converge besides attraction factors influence intensity need approval hence level convergence include probability future interactions social status addressee interpersonal variability need social factors determine whether extent individuals converge interaction relational history social norms power individuals likely converge individual higher status likely speech conversation reflect speech individual higher converging also increases effectiveness communication turn lowers uncertainty interpersonal anxiety increases mutual understanding another factor motivates people converge people adapt communication behaviors establish common ground another individual includes vocal tonevolume word choice etc social distance extent two people communicating similar different discourse management selection topics communication lead successful exchanges minimizing social distance however chance message sender displaying overconvergence overaccommodation communicator adjusts style little experience often result stereotyping attempt overdo efforts regulating modifying responding others effect making target feel examples may speaking elderly person baby talk regardless mental psychological state shouting exaggerating behaviors speaking blind person speaking slowly simply communicating someone fluent language though message sender often good intentions overaccommodating actually alienate receiver divergence linguistic strategy whereby member speech community accentuates linguistic differences themself divergence accomplished one two ways purposefully changing communication behavior already different communication partner changing communication behavior different communication partner would naturally given communication features often core dimensions member group divergence regarded important tactic displaying valued distinctiveness helps sustain positive image ones ingroup hence strengthen ones social identity divergence commonly used establish dominance power interaction example recent college graduate becomes professor might teaching students around age therefore important professor communicate way students aware professor authority another case need divergence professionals clients study doctors patients discussed musculoskeletal disorders observed miscommunications occurred participants chose converge communication rather accentuate position differences patients study felt comfortable discussing problems felt positive doctor capacity understand divergence used separate speaker group person speech patterns change based talking feel person communicating fashion make speech different also interpreted sign dislike towards person example run disliked classmate high school vocal pattern becomes different represents act divergence purposely changing speech sound like person research conducted gallois et al expanded theory include propositions influence
