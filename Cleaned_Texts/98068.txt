bradykinin bk greek brady slow kinin kīneîn move peptide promotes inflammation causes arterioles dilate enlarge via release prostacyclin nitric oxide endotheliumderived hyperpolarizing factor makes veins constrict via prostaglandin thereby leading leakage capillary beds due increased pressure capillaries bradykinin consists nine amino acids physiologically pharmacologically active peptide kinin group proteins class drugs called angiotensinconvertingenzyme inhibitors ace inhibitors increase bradykinin levels inhibiting degradation thereby increasing blood pressure lowering effect ace inhibitors fda approved treatment hypertension heart failure bradykinin sometimes referred bk acid peptide chain amino acid sequence bradykinin argproproglypheserprophearg empirical formula therefore system makes bradykinin proteolytic cleavage kininogen precursor highmolecularweight kininogen hmwk hk enzyme kallikrein moreover compelling evidence plasmin fibrinolytic enzyme able generate bradykinin hmwk humans bradykinin broken many different kininases angiotensinconverting enzyme ace kininase ii aminopeptidase p app carboxypeptidase n cpn kininase carboxypeptidase neutral endopeptidase endothelin converting endothelin converting bradykinin potent endotheliumdependent vasodilator mild diuretic may cause lowering blood pressure also causes contraction nonvascular smooth muscle bronchus gut increases vascular permeability also involved mechanism inflammation released locally mast cells basophils tissue specifically relation pain bradykinin shown sensitize receptors thus lowering temperature threshold activate thus presumably contributing initial secretion bradykinin postnatally causes constriction eventual atrophy ductus arteriosus forming ligamentum arteriosum pulmonary trunk aortic arch also plays role constriction eventual occlusion number fetal vessels including umbilical arteries vein differential vasoconstriction fetal vessels compared vasodilator response vessels suggests walls fetal vessels different kinin receptors belong g protein coupled receptor gpcr family bradykinin also thought cause dry cough patients widely prescribed angiotensinconverting enzyme ace inhibitor drugs thought bradykinin converted inactive metabolites ace therefore inhibition enzyme leads increased levels bradykinin increased bradykinin sensitizes somatosensory fibers thus causes hyperalgesia bradykinin may mediate via proinflammatory peptides eg substance p neuropeptide local release severe cases elevation bradykinin may result angioedema medical people african descent five times increased risk ace inhibitor induced angioedema due hereditary predisposing risk factors hereditary refractory cough common cause stopping ace inhibitor therapy overactivation bradykinin thought play role rare disease called hereditary low levels bradykinin body correlate high body mass index adolescents proposed bradykinin used biomarker metabolic bradykinins implicated number cancer progression increased levels bradykinins resulting ace inhibitor use associated increased lung cancer bradykinins implicated cell proliferation migration gastric bradykinin antagonists investigated anticancer bradykinin proposed explanation many symptoms associated including dry coughs myalgia fatigue nausea vomiting diarrhea anorexia headaches decreased
