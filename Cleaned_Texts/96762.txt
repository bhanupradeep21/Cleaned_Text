growth hormone deficiency ghd human growth hormone deficiency medical condition resulting enough growth hormone generally noticeable symptom individual attains short newborns may also present low blood sugar small penis adults may decreased muscle mass high cholesterol levels poor bone ghd present birth develop later causes may include genetics trauma infections tumors radiation genes may involved include ghrhr third cases cause underlying mechanism generally involves problems pituitary cases associated lack pituitary hormones case known combined pituitary hormone diagnosis involves blood tests measure growth hormone treatment growth hormone replacement using synthetic human growth frequency condition cases initially noticed genetic forms disease estimated affect types occur equally males females though males often severe prenatal deficiency gh occurs congenital hypopituitarism little effect fetal growth however prenatal congenital deficiency reduce size males penis especially gonadotropins also deficient besides micropenis males additional consequences severe deficiency first days life include hypoglycemia exaggerated jaundice direct indirect needed even congenital gh deficiency usually impair length growth first months life late first year midteens poor growth andor shortness hallmark childhood gh deficiency growth severely affected gh deficiency

composition ie relative amounts bone muscle fat affected many children severe deficiency mild moderate chubbiness common though gh deficiency alone rarely causes severe obesity severely ghdeficient children recognizable cherubic facial features characterized maxillary hypoplasia forehead side effects children include sparse hair growth frontal recession pili torti trichorrhexis nodosa also sometimes recognised effects growth hormone deficiency childhood commonly identifiable cause idiopathic adultonset ghd commonly due pituitary tumours treatment cranial complete list causes includes variety rare diseases resemble gh deficiency including childhood growth failure facial appearance delayed bone age low insulinlike growth levels however gh testing elicits normal high levels gh blood demonstrating problem due deficiency gh rather reduced sensitivity action insensitivity gh traditionally termed laron dwarfism last years many different types gh resistance identified primarily involving mutations gh binding protein familial isolated growth hormone deficiency ighd inherited autosomal recessive type autosomal dominant type ii xlinked type iii adult ages normal pituitary produce diminishing amounts gh many hormones particularly sex steroids physicians therefore distinguish natural reduction gh levels comes age much lower levels true deficiency deficiency almost always identifiable cause adultonset ghd without definable cause idiopathic gh deficiency extremely gh function adulthood maintain muscle bone mass strength poorly understood effects cognition although gh readily measured blood sample testing gh deficiency constrained fact levels nearly undetectable day makes simple measurement gh single blood sample useless detecting deficiency physicians therefore use combination indirect direct criteria assessing ghd provocative tests involve giving dose agent normally provoke pituitary release burst growth hormone intravenous line established agent given small amounts blood drawn intervals next hour determine rise gh provoked agents used clinically stimulate assess gh secretion levodopa clonidine epinephrine propranolol glucagon insulin insulin tolerance test shown reproducible ageindependent able distinguish ghd normal test choice severe gh deficiency childhood additionally following measurable childhood adulthood diagnosing doctor look

licensed children requiring treatment usually receive daily injections growth hormone pediatric endocrinologists monitor growth adjust dose every months many visits involve blood tests xrays treatment
