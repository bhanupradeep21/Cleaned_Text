mammoth species extinct elephantid genus mammuthus various species mammoth commonly equipped long curved tusks lived pliocene epoch around million years ago holocene years ago various species existed africa europe asia north america mammoths closely related living asian elephants african elephants oldest mammoth representative mammuthus subplanifrons appeared around five million years ago early pliocene southern eastern africa later pliocene three million years ago mammoths dispersed eurasia eventually covering eurasia migrating north america around million years ago becoming ancestral columbian mammoth columbi last species emerge woolly mammoth primigenius developed years ago east asia surviving russias wrangel island arctic ocean well possibly taymyr peninsula mainland siberia recently roughly years ago still extant existence earliest civilisations ancient egypt mesopotamia earliest known proboscideans clade contains elephants existed million years ago around tethys sea area closest relatives proboscidea sirenians hyraxes family elephantidae known existed six million years ago africa includes living elephants mammoths among many extinct clades mastodon distant

molars ridges years ago siberia becoming woolly mammoth primigenius woolly mammoth would replace steppe mammoth europe late middle pleistocene around years genetic study showed two examined specimens columbian mammoth grouped within subclade woolly mammoths suggests two populations interbred produced fertile offspring also suggested north american form known jeffersonii may hybrid two late

mammoth diet differed somewhat depending location although mammoths ate similar things columbian mammoth columbi diet mainly grazing american columbian mammoths fed primarily cactus leaves trees shrubs assumptions based mammoth feces mammoth teeth mammoths like modern day elephants hypsodont molars features also allowed mammoths live expansive life availability grasses mongochen mammoth diet

accompanied glacial retreat rising sea levels suggested contributing factor forests replaced open woodlands grasslands across continent available habitat would reduced megafaunal species mammoth however climate changes nothing new numerous similar warming episodes occurred previously within ice age last several million years without producing comparable megafaunal extinctions climate alone unlikely played decisive spread advanced human hunters northern eurasia americas around time extinctions however new development thus might contributed whether general mammoth population died climatic reasons due overhunting humans transition late pleistocene epoch holocene epoch shrinkage distribution mammoth progressive warming end pleistocene epoch changed mammoths environment mammoth steppe periglacial landscape rich herb grass vegetation disappeared along mammoth environmental changes climate mammoths moved isolated spots eurasia disappeared completely also thought late paleolithic mesolithic human hunters might affected size last mammoth populations evidence suggest humans cause mammoth extinction although definitive proof found humans living south mammoth steppe learned adapt harsher climates north steppe mammoths resided concluded humans could survive harsh north climate particular mammoth steppe possible humans could hunt eventually extinguish mammoths everywhere another hypothesis suggests mammoths fell victim infectious disease combination climate change hunting humans may possible explanation extinction homo erectus known consumed mammoth meat early million years though may mean successful scavenging rather actual hunting later humans show greater evidence hunting mammoths mammoth bones site south britain suggest neanderthals butchered various sites eastern europe dating years old suggest humans probably homo sapiens built dwellings using mammoth bones age earlier structures suggests neanderthals began however american institute biological sciences notes bones dead elephants left ground subsequently trampled elephants tend bear marks resembling butchery marks allegedly misinterpreted study using ancient environmental dna concluded extinction mammoth
