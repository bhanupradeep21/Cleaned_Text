increasing evidence suggesting causes acute chronic psychological caregivers patients also show higher average prevalence mental health symptoms result multiple different factors directly infects olfactory neurons smell nerve cells expressing taste receptors although cells communicate directly brain virus exhibit strong infection nerve cells central nervous system many neurological sequelae

sustentacullar cells lead desquamation shedding olfactory epithelium collateral loss olfactory receptor neurons however olfactory epithelium continually regenerated neurons damaged typically replaced nerve cells controlling taste termed gustatory nerve cells turn even faster renewed clinical help exists patients experiencing disorders olfaction patients experience loss smell longer two weeks
