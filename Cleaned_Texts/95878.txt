hypothesis also known theory theory aggression proposed john dollard neal miller leonard doob orval mowrer robert sears developed neal miller leonard berkowitz theory says aggression result blocking frustrating persons efforts attain first formulated hypothesis stated frustration always precedes aggression aggression sure consequence two years later however reformulated hypothesis suggest frustration creates need respond form aggression one possible outcome therefore reformulated hypothesis stated frustration prompts behavior may may aggressive aggressive behavior result frustration making frustration sufficient necessary condition hypothesis attempts explain people attempts give explanation cause according dollard colleagues frustration condition exists goalresponse suffers interference aggression defined act whose goalresponse injury organism organism surrogate theory says frustration causes aggression source frustration challenged aggression gets displaced onto innocent target example man disrespected humiliated work respond fear losing job may go home take anger frustration family theory also used explain riots revolutions believed caused poorer deprived sections society may express bottled frustration anger researchers criticized hypothesis proposed moderating factors frustration several empirical studies able confirm berkowitz expanded hypothesis suggesting negative affect personal attributions play major role whether frustration instigates aggressive frustrationaggression hypothesis emerged form monograph published yale university institute human relations yale psychologists behind monograph john dollard leonard doob neal miller h mowrer robert book based many studies conducted group touched variety disciplines including psychology anthropology sociology marxism psychoanalysis behaviorism used yale group throughout research work frustration aggression soon repercussions explanation aggressive behavior theory applied human beings also animals book created controversy subject led articles critiquing new theory psychological review reading social psychology two papers published articles subject many social scientists disclaimed rather strict definition frustration reactions well frustration concept defined yale group modified theory following multiple critics studies published psychologists many pioneers social science world modified brought knowledge original berkowitz published article frustrationaggression hypothesis examination reformulation addressed inconsistency empirical studies aiming test hypothesis well criticism proposed modification hypothesis would take account negative affect individual recently breuer elson published comprehensive overview frustrationaggression authors stated despite ample amount empirical research examines link frustration aggressive behaviors decline number studies specifically refers frustrationaggression hypothesis breuer elson propose utility using frustrationaggression hypothesis theoretical foundation aggression literature theory may novel applications areas media yale group clarified original statement occurrence aggressive behavior always presuppose existence frustration contrariwise existence frustration always lead form second part hypothesis lead readers think frustration could aggression consequence allow possibility responses could arise override aggression response yale group thus reformulated hypothesis following frustration produces instigation number different types response one new formulation researchers left place idea aggressive impulses kinds emerge individual feels frustration impulses fear punishment outweigh even attenuate aggression instigations disappears would explain situations frustration lead outright article published gregory bateson observed frustrationaggression hypothesis cultural angle according culture implicitly involved hypothesis dealing human behaviour always formed influenced environment social stated easier fit hypothesis people whose culture portray life series neutral frustrating events lead satisfying ends would case european culture iatmul culture however harder apply hypothesis balinese culture indeed balinese children taught take pleasure satisfaction steps lead goals without waiting satisfaction climaxes completion following line thoughts arthur r cohen considered social norms important factor whether aggression following published results study conducted included female students showed people less likely demonstrate aggression social standards moreover built doob sears study previously claimed demonstration aggressive behavior depend anticipation indeed cohens result showed people less likely demonstrate aggression towards frustration agent latter authoritative also investigated nicholas pastores statement aggression likely follow context arbitrary context compared nonarbitrary one reached theory studied since modifications dill anderson conducted study investigating whether hostile aggression differs justified vs unjustified frustration control condition would induce study task required participants learn make origami bird experimental procedure comprised instruction phase folding phase instruction phase participant paired confederate shown fold bird one time folding phase timed subject required make bird alone quickly accurately possible conditions experimenter started presenting instructions deliberately fast manner conditions differed experimenter responded confederates request slow nonfrustration control condition experimenter apologized slowed unjustified frustration condition experimenter revealed desire leave quickly possible due personal reasons justified frustration condition experimenter revealed need clear room fast possible due supervisor demand subjects given questionnaires levels aggression well questionnaires competence research staff told questionnaires would determine whether research staff would receive financial aid verbal reprimands reduction financial awards questions presented questionnaire designed reflect research staffs competence likability dill anderson found participants unjustified frustration condition rated research staff less able less likable knowing would affect financial situation graduate students justified frustration group rated staff less likable less competent control group higher rating scales unjustified condition participants authors concluded unjustified frustration leads greater level aggression compared justified frustration turn results higher levels aggression compared nonfrustration leonard berkowitz stated necessary aggression stimulus make aggression take place remodified frustrationaggression hypothesis theory removed importance aggressive cues aggressive behavior say extremely angry subject show aggression even aggression cue absent provocative theory introduced berkowitz aggressive cues hypothesis stating young children previous exposure objects events military weapon toys showing destruction effects work aggressive cues increase chances aggression behaviors modification frustrationaggression hypothesis berkowitz discussed aggressive behavior originates internal forces anger aggressive habits external stimuli theories help explain reasons aggression evoked didnt explain well procedure aggressive habits developments aggressive article published leonard berkowitz discussed relationship frustration level aggression adding differentiation internal external reaction frustration first part experiment found types frustration legitimate illegitimate compared control group finished task successfully internal reaction measured heart rate rating three bipolar scales shows great level nevertheless significant difference internal reaction legitimate illegitimate groups part experiment previous groups experiencing legitimate illegitimate frustration encounter innocent partner order perform unrelated task group previous illegitimate frustration shows greater external reaction openly punitive actions towards innocent partner group experiencing previous legitimate frustration cognitiveconsistency theories assume two simultaneously active cognitive structures logically inconsistent arousal increased activates processes expected consequence increasing consistency decreasing defining frustration arising perceived resistance attain certain goal frustration conceptualized arising inconsistency perceived situation desired expected situation availability preconditions required able complete internal response approach aggressive behavior functions forcefully manipulate perception matching expected furthermore approach puts aggression broader context inconsistency reduction also involving fear curiosity indeed depending size inconsistency specific context frustration suggested also one causing factors fear gray p even concluded fear frustration studies shown frustrating equally threatening events may generate feelings aggression based account one neural systems responsible executing basic responses happens one basic responses system aggression system made follows amygdala hypothalamus finally periaqueductal gray matter greater detail research suggests one threatened frustrated stimuli parts frontal cortex orbital medial ventrolateral frontal cortex activated works tandem threat response system simply put threatening events generate action potentials frontal cortex regions relay onto amygdalahypothalamuspag basic threat response system decision response take hold based information received frontal cortex regions mentioned varying degrees responses could take hold within animal presence frustrating event shown interfere basic circuitry neuronal level simply implies certain stimuli generate action potentials others thus stronger responses others respectively face animals portray response hierarchy onset frustrating event example low levels danger perceived threat response system induces freezing animal closer subjects threat generate act fleeing surroundings finally source threat close escape longer option threat circuitry system induce reactive aggression means closer frustrating stimulus presented us greater chances basic response systems activated thus give rise certain behaviors accordingly furthermore research shown individuals elevated susceptibility frustration showed greater activity within regions amygdalahypothalarmuspag response frustrating events relative less research suggests people get frustrated easily others show greater activity frontal cortex connection amygdalahypothalamuspag system makes us act given strong enough stimulus aggressively reference studies hand one study examined impact violent content frustration gameplay assessed factors related aggressive personality ie trait hostility study collected data male college undergraduates study consisted two phases first phase lasted minutes large group setting phase participants asked complete series questionnaires assessed video game playing habits aggression second phase oneonone session participant phase participants played video games assigned one four conditions video game violent content lownonfrustrating mode video game violent content frustrating mode video game nonviolent content lownonfrustrating mode video game nonviolent content frustration mode part frustrating conditions participants informed scores would compared participants higher performance would rewarded gift card afterwards participants completed questionnaire similar phase one ultimately study found exposure violent content influenced participants aggressive responses playing video games also found frustration gameplay impactful greater participants aggressive responses participants exposed violent content presented frustration gameplay reported highest scores trait hostility another study shackman tested impact physical maltreatment children reactive aggression authors tested relationships individual differences social information processing history physical maltreatment child negative affect aggressive behaviors study collected data boys madison wisconsin public schools within sample children history physical maltreatment families attended two separate sessions laboratory first session involved children completing emotional oddball task neural responses recorded via eventrelated potentials erps task parents children participated semistructured dyadic interaction involved researchers assessment childdirected parental hostility interaction families returned laboratory days second session experiment second session asked children participate provocation task designed evoke reactive aggression response families paid participation debriefed authors reported physically maltreated children displayed greater negative affect aggressive behavior compared children physically maltreated relationship mediated childrens attention angry faces measured erp ultimately findings suggest physical maltreatment children leads child dysregulation negative affect aggression publication frustration aggression gave rise criticism several scientists including animal behaviorists psychologists example seward studied rat behavior suggested aggression also caused dominance struggles different durbin bowlby observing apes children placed reasons breaking fight three different categories one categories frustration two classified possession disputes resentment stranger addressing criticism berkowitz suggested controversy around frustrationaggression hypothesis roots lack common definition frustration advocated frustration defined reaction blocking drive interruption internal response sequence various reasons aggression actually fall frustration later research focused refining hypothesis rather denying correctness one earlier studies following publication dollard et als book pastore hypothesis distinguish arbitrary nonarbitrary situations nonarbitrary situations decrease aggressiveness response study participants sample college students presented verbal description two types situations arbitrary nonarbitrary one arbitrary situation examples intentionally passed bus driver waiting correct bus stops nonarbitrary situation described one examples passed bus specifically marked heading garage study results suggested arbitrariness situation important factor eliciting aggressive behavior frustrating situations arbitrary situations inducing aggression building pastores work empirical study cohen arbitrariness situation affects level aggressiveness however study also supported hypothesis two factors need accounted frustrationaggression hypothesis factors social norms relationship frustrating agent study volunteer participants rating statements levels predicted aggressiveness cohen found people tend respond less aggressively frustrating agent authority figure rather friend people respond frustration less aggression socially accepted norms require berkowitz addressed criticism article proposed frustration ultimately aggression induced individuals think deliberately wrongly kept sources suggest little empirical support even though researchers studied sixty also theory suggests frustrated prejudiced individuals act aggressively towards outgroups prejudiced studies shown aggressive towards frustrationaggression hypothesis implies aggression followed triggered feeling frustration proposed yale group yet studies support contradictory claims certain subjects studies shown respond aggressively frustration given personal moral educational backgrounds instance indian culture uses satyagraha means nonviolent resistance trigger mahatma gandhi exemplified technique essentially denounces principles frustrationaggression theory restrained feeling innate indeed hypothesis take consideration individuality human beings according dixon johnson two people respond differently frustration stimuli instance could respond aggressively driving highway cut another car whereas others different temperament could react however theory assumes two different people receive frustration stimuli react similarly equally yale groups hypothesis explain aggressive behavior could manifested different social environments without previous provocation feeling frustration however according gross osterman people may lose sense uniqueness mass societal contexts tends deindividuate instance individuals may behave aggressively friends big crowd eg watching hockey game might behave aggressively eg watching game alone home individuals crowd likely become desensitised actions less likely take responsibility phenomenon known
