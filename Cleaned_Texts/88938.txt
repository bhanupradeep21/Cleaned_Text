spinal tumors neoplasms located either vertebral column spinal three main types spinal tumors classified based location extradural intradural intraduralintramedullary intraduralextramedullary

within dura spinal cord parenchyma intraduralextramedullary tumors located within dura outside spinal cord parenchyma common presenting symptom spinal tumors nocturnal back common symptoms include muscle weakness sensory loss difficulty loss bowel bladder control may occur later stages cause spinal tumors unknown extradural tumors metastatic commonly breast prostate lung kidney many genetic factors associated intradural tumors commonly neurofibromatosis neurofibromatosis vonhippel lindau vhl common type intraduralextramedullary tumors meningiomas nervesheath common type intraduralintramedullary tumors ependymomas diagnosis involves complete medical evaluation followed imaging ct mri biopsy may obtained certain cases categorize lesion diagnosis treatment often involves combination surgery radiation observation followup imaging may option small benign steroids may also given surgery cases significant cord outcomes depend number factors including whether tumor benign malignant primary metastatic location tumor treatment often palliative vast majority metastatic symptoms spinal tumors often nonspecific resulting delay diagnosis spinal nerve compression weakening vertebral structure cause symptoms pain common symptom common symptoms spinal cord compression include muscle weakness sensory loss numbness hands legs rapid onset paralysis bowel bladder incontinence often occur later stages children may present spinal deformities diagnosis challenging primarily symptoms often mimic common benign degenerative spinal spinal cord compression commonly found patients metastatic back pain primary symptom spinal cord compression patients known back pain may prompt bone scan confirm exclude spinal metastasis rapid identification intervention metastatic spinal cord compression necessary preserve neurologic cause majority spinal tumors currently known primary spinal tumors associated genetic neurofibromas associated neurofibromatosis meningiomas

symptoms may point towards serious condition includes complete neurological exam focusing motor sensory patients either benign degenerative spinal disease spinal tumors often present back pain patient radiculopathy myelopathy raises suspicion serious imaging often next step diagnosis unclear greater suspicion serious condition may need immediate intervention common types medical imaging include xrays computer tomography scan ct magnetic resonance imaging mri myelography bone mri imaging choice spinal mri protocol frequently used includes sequences including contrast enhanced shortti inversion recovery stir also commonly added mri protocol detecting spinal cord myelography may used substitute patient undergo mri xrays ct commonly used view bony less frequently used spinal cord tumors however since reliably detect bone scanning may used supplementary imaging modality tumors involving bony structures treatment greatly varies depending type spinal cord tumors goals care primary forms treatment include surgical resection radiotherapy steroids eg may administered evidence spinal cord compression affect tumor mass tend reduce inflammatory reaction around decrease overall volume mass impinging spinal cordcitation needed surgery several indications depending type tumor includes complete resection decompression nerves attempt total gross resection possible cure option patients primary spinal cord extramedullary tumours amenable resection intramedullary tumours even possible operated microendoscopic pure endoscopic patients metastatic tumors treatment palliative goal improving patients quality cases indications surgery include pain stabilization spinal cord observation chemotherapy radiotherapy possible options adjunct surgery tumors amenable surgery intraduralextramedullary tumors often benign observation followup imaging option cases lesions small patient radiotherapy chemotherapy may administered alone conjunction surgery choice chemotherapy radiotherapy multidisciplinary process depends histological grade type tumor amount surgical resection cases radiotherapy chosen radiation usually delivered involved segment spinal cord uninvolved segment involved combination minimally invasive surgery radiation chemotherapy new technique treating spinal treatment tailored particular tumor spine either metastatic suggest direct decompressive surgery combined postoperative radiotherapy provide better outcomes treatment radiotherapy alone patients spinal cord compression due metastatic httpsenwikipediaorgwikispinaltumor
