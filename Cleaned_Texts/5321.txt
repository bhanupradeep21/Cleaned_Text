sequencing ligation dna sequencing method uses enzyme dna ligase identify nucleotide present given position dna sequence unlike currently popular dna sequencing methods method use dna polymerase create second strand instead mismatch sensitivity dna ligase enzyme used determine underlying sequence target dna molecule dna ligase enzyme joins together ends dna molecules although commonly represented joining two pairs ends ligation restriction enzyme fragments ligase also join ends one two strands example strand already continuous lacks terminal phosphate necessary ligation dna ligase sensitive structure dna low efficiency mismatches bases two strands sequencing ligation relies upon sensitivity dna ligase basepairing mismatches target molecule sequenced single strand unknown dna sequence flanked least one end known sequence short anchor strand brought bind known sequence mixed pool probe oligonucleotides brought eight nine bases long labeled typically fluorescent dyes according position sequenced molecules hybridize target dna sequence next anchor sequence dna ligase preferentially joins molecule anchor bases match unknown dna sequence based fluorescence produced molecule one infer identity nucleotide position unknown sequence oligonucleotide probes may also constructed cleavable linkages cleaved identifying label remove label regenerate phosphate end ligated probe preparing system another round ligation cycle repeated several times read longer sequences every nth base n length probe left behind cleavage sequence skipped positions anchor ligated oligonucleotides may stripped target dna sequence another round sequencing ligation started anchor one bases shorter simpler albeit limited technique repeated rounds single ligation label corresponds different position probe followed stripping anchor ligated sequencing ligation proceed either direction either depending end probe oligonucleotides blocked label direction efficient multiple cycles ligation note opposite direction polymerase based sequencing methods sequencing ligation method reported problems sequencing palindromic httpsenwikipediaorgwikisequencingbyligation
