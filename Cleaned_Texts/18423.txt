human hair color pigmentation human hair follicles due two types melanin eumelanin pheomelanin generally melanin present color hair darker less melanin present hair lighter tone hair dependent ratio black brown eumelanin yellow red pheomelanin levels melanin vary time causing persons hair color change possible hair follicles one color person hair colors associated ethnic groups due observed higher frequency particular hair color within geographical region eg straight dark hair amongst east asians southeast asians polynesians native americans large variety dark fair curly straight wavy bushy hair amongst europeans west asians north africans curly dark uniquely helical hair sub saharan africans whilst gray white silver hair often associated age full genetic basis hair color complex fully regulatory dna believed closely involved pigmentation humans study branicki et al identified dna variations across different genes could used predict hair two types pigment give hair color blackbrown eumelanin pheomelanin synthesized inside melanocytes tyrosine converted ldopa ldopaquinone turn formed pheomelanin different hair color phenotypes arise primarily result varying ratios two pigments human although europeans show greatest range pigmentation addition genetic environmental factors affect hair color humans instance mutations melanocortin receptor gene lead red auburn exposure ultraviolet radiation damage hair alter ultraviolet radiation uv radiation triggers greater synthesis several compounds including proopiomelanocortin pomc Î±msh acth result increased eumelanin uv radiation commonly comes sun thus populations places closer equator tend darker eumelanin generally photoprotective pheomelanin colors hair orange red eumelanin two subtypes black brown determines darkness hair black eumelanin leads blacker hair brown eumelanin browner human hair amount melanin content black brown hair pheomelanin generally found elevated concentrations blond red
