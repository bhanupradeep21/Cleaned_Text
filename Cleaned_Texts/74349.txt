anterior ischemic optic neuropathy aion medical condition involving loss vision caused damage optic nerve result insufficient blood supply ischemia form ischemic optic neuropathy generally categorized two types arteritic aion aaion loss vision result inflammatory disease arteries head called temporal arteritis nonarteritic aion abbreviated naion sometimes simply aion due noninflammatory disease small blood naion typically presents suddenly upon awakening affected person notes seeing poorly one eye vision eye obscured dark shadow often involving upper lower half vision usually area closer nose pain within approximately six months following infarct visual acuity improves three lines vision snellen chart chart smaller letters lower line patients patients vision worsens three lines opposite eye involvement occurs approximately patients naion within always devastating visual acuity may remain moderately impaired furthermore cases naion involve loss hemifield either upper lower half visual field cases naion involve neartotal loss visioncitation needed mechanism injury naion used quite controversial however experts field come consensus cases involve two main risk factors first predisposition form type optic disc shape optic disc axons retinal ganglion cells collect optic nerve optic nerve bundle axons carry visual signals eye brain optic nerve must penetrate wall eye hole accommodate usually larger nerve diameter patients optic nerve nearly large opening back eye optic disc appears crowded seen ophthalmoscopy crowded disc also referred disc risk risk factor vast majority individuals crowded discs experience naioncitation needed second major risk factor involves general cardiovascular risk factors common diabetes hypertension high cholesterol levels factors predispose patient develop naion common precipitating factor marked fall blood pressure sleep nocturnal arterial hypotension least patients first discover visual loss first waking sleep risk factors naion present taking blood pressure medications night avoided exacerbate nighttime hypotension beta blockers particular associated increased incidence vascular risk factors lead ischemia poor blood supply portion optic disc disc swells crowded optic disc leads compression ischemiacitation needed since eyes tend similar shape optometrist ophthalmologist look good eye assess anatomical predisposition unaffected eye risk naion within five number uncontrolled single case small number patient reports associated naion use oral erectile dysfunction since arteritic aion similar presentation nonarteritic aion patients age diagnosed naion must evaluated exclude aaion symptoms painful jaw muscle spasms scalp tenderness unintentional weight loss fatigue myalgias loss appetite
