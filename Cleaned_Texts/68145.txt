upper respiratory tract infection urti illness caused acute infection involves upper respiratory tract including nose sinuses pharynx larynx commonly includes nasal obstruction sore throat tonsillitis pharyngitis laryngitis sinusitis otitis media common infections viral nature instances cause urtis also fungal helminthic origin less billion cases urtis estimated caused deaths uncomplicated colds coughing nasal discharge may persist days even symptoms acute urtis include rhinitis pharyngitistonsillitis laryngitis often referred common cold complications sinusitis ear infection sometimes bronchitis though bronchi generally classified part lower respiratory tract symptoms urtis commonly include cough sore throat runny nose nasal congestion headache lowgrade fever facial pressure

bacteria developing resistance health authorities strongly encouraging physicians decrease prescribing antibiotics treat common urtis antibiotic usage significantly reduce recovery time viral systematic review found three interventions probably effective reducing antibiotic use acute respiratory infections creactive protein testing procalcitoninguided management shared decisionmaking physicians use narrowspectrum antibiotics shown effective broadspectrum alternatives children acute bacterial urtis lower risk side effects decreased antibiotic usage may also help prevent
