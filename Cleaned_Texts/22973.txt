phonology linguistics phoneme ˈfoʊniːm set phones distinguish one word another particular language example dialects english notable exception west midlands northwest sound patterns sɪn sin sɪŋ sing two separate words distinguished substitution one phoneme n another phoneme ŋ two words like differ meaning contrast single phoneme form minimal pair another language two sequences differing pronunciation final sounds n ŋ perceived meaning two sounds interpreted phonetic variants single phoneme language phonemes established use minimal pairs tap vs tab pat vs bat written slashes p b show pronunciation linguists use square brackets pʰ indicating aspirated p pat differing views exactly phonemes given language analyzed phonemic phonematic terms however phoneme generally regarded abstraction set equivalence class speech sounds phones perceived equivalent given language example english k sounds words kill skill identical described distributional variants single phoneme k speech sounds differ create meaningful change word known allophones phoneme allophonic variation may conditioned case certain phoneme realized certain allophone particular phonological environments may otherwise free may vary speaker dialect therefore phonemes often considered constitute abstract underlying representation segments words speech sounds make corresponding phonetic realization surface form phonemes conventionally placed slashes transcription whereas speech sounds phones placed square brackets thus pʊʃ represents sequence three phonemes p ʊ ʃ word push standard english pʰʊʃ represents phonetic sequence sounds pʰ aspirated p ʊ ʃ usual pronunciation push confused similar convention use angle brackets enclose units orthography graphemes example represents written letter grapheme f symbols used particular phonemes often taken international phonetic alphabet ipa set symbols commonly used phones computertyping purposes systems xsampa exist represent ipa symbols using

letters may used denote phonemes although approach often hampered complexity relationship orthography pronunciation see correspondence letters phonemes phoneme sound group different sounds perceived function speakers language dialect question example english phoneme k occurs words cat kit scat skit although native speakers notice english dialects ck sounds words identical kʰɪt sound aspirated skɪl unaspirated words therefore contain different speech sounds phones transcribed kʰ aspirated form k unaspirated one different sounds nonetheless considered belong phoneme speaker used one instead meaning word would change using aspirated form kʰ skill might sound odd word would still recognized contrast sounds would cause change meaning substituted example substitution sound would produce different word still sound must therefore considered represent different phoneme phoneme shows english k kʰ allophones single phoneme k languages however kʰ k perceived native speakers significantly different sounds substituting one change meaning word languages therefore two sounds represent different phonemes example icelandic kʰ first sound kátur meaning cheerful k first sound gátur meaning riddles icelandic therefore two separate phonemes kʰ k pair words like kátur gátur differ one phone called minimal pair two alternative phones question case kʰ k existence minimal pairs common test decide whether two phones represent different phonemes allophones phoneme take another example minimal pair tip dip illustrates english belong separate phonemes since words different meanings englishspeakers must conscious distinction two sounds signed languages american sign language asl also minimal pairs differing exactly one signs parameters handshape movement location palm orientation nonmanual signal marker minimal pair may exist signed language basic sign stays one parameters however absence minimal pairs given pair phones always mean belong phoneme may dissimilar phonetically unlikely speakers perceive sound example english minimal pair sounds h hat ŋ bang fact shown complementary distribution could used argue allophones phoneme however dissimilar phonetically considered separate phonologists sometimes recourse near minimal pairs show speakers language perceive two sounds significantly different even exact minimal pair exists lexicon challenging find minimal pair

nothing additional difference r vs l expected somehow condition voicing difference single underlying postalveolar fricative one however find true minimal pairs ʃ ʒ less common words considered example confucian confusion valid minimal pair besides segmental phonemes vowels consonants also suprasegmental features pronunciation tone stress syllable boundaries forms juncture nasalization vowel harmony many languages change meaning words phonemic phonemic stress encountered languages english example two words spelled invite one verb stressed second syllable noun stressed first syllable without changing individual sounds position stress distinguishes words full phonemic specification would include indication position stress ɪnˈvaɪt verb ˈɪnvaɪt noun languages french word stress function
