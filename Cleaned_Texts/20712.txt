orthosuchus meaning straight crocodile extinct genus notochampsidaean crocodyliform lived early jurassic million years ago first discovered red beds formation qachas nek province lesotho southern africa characteristics showed postcranial skeleton skull indicated finding significant since characteristics found specimen believed absent orthosuchus body proportion similar lizards body length meters flattened skull typical skull external skull surface covered randomly small pits orbits huge complete dorsal roof made paired maxilla sharp edge extends forward covers part lateral notch ears protected earflaps prevent water inflow otic recess animal fossil resembles features primitive crocodilian one reduced antorbital quadratojugal backbone skull connects jugal flattened head shape orthosuchus made posterior quadrate contact rear end form typical archosaurian characteristic lost modern crocodiles also absent developed short secondary bony palate crocodilian featuring elongated choana located behind secondary palate made premaxilla modern crocodiles choana vomers anterior processes dentary forms largest part lower jaw shallow pits indicated animal probably teeth fewer teeth far teeth equal size similar orthosuchus vertebrae believed cervical vertebrae appear tall neural spine height decrease head vertebrae neck region tightly bonded together ribs start twelfth vertebra supports tail consists vertebrae different size shape first one contact sacral ribs three vertebrae far end tail tiny size four vertebrae form middle tail ribs form anteroventral posterodorsal flanges muscle orthosuchus similar pectoral girdles pelvic girdles compare living crocodiles long scapula shorter interclavicle hypothesized cartilaginous forelimb fossil records showed orthosuchus similar humerus distal proximal expansions lay plane modern also like living crocodiles ulna radius orthosuchus typical archosaurs around length humerus radius ulna modern crocodiles shortest elements forelimb two nonelongated carpals one elliptical shape orthosuchus appeared digits first digit shortest fifth digit weakest although phalanges missing believed phalanges formula femur thought longest bone tibia developed fibula length femur taking bones account forelimb length hind orthosuchus similar astragalus calcaneum compared astragalus rectangular shaped calcaneum small size forms prominent first fossil materials collected expedition south african museum april led alfred w materials collected lower jurassic red bed formation upper elliot formation stormberg soon found fossils belongs new crocodilian species named species orthosuchus stormbergi paper published nash also found smaller skull also belongs orthosuchus stormbergi horizon different place main part skull law jaw well preserved phalanges ribs one side pelvic girdle hind limb missing since specimens distortions major issues fix site new primitive form crocodilian found dinosaur canyon beds northern arizona united states beds top upper triassic formation lower jurassic sediments crocodilian found meter long flattened head large frontals advanced transverse process indicates new crocodilian species barnum brown named archaeosuchus changed protosuchus form family classification protosuchidae debatable however since orthosuchus resemble characteristics protosuchidae believed part modern crocodiles considered within group archosaurs also include birds dinosaurs however appearance archosaurs resemble crocodiles orthosuchus resembles primitive form crocodilian traits fusion midline together parietal form secondary palate fusion pterygoid quadrate extension coracoid radius ulna form tuber orthosuchus closely related protosuchus notochampsa erythrochampsa probably crocodilian although orthosuchus could grouped notochampsa people want keep family protosuchidae widely accepted revision notochampsa found valid taxon phylogenetic analysis recovered sister orthosuchus monophyletic existing specimens orthosuchus found lower jurassic red bed formation south africa hypothesized orthosuchus lived mainly terrestrial land key factors contribute fact spent time mostly water first notable evidence palate covered soft tissue bone choanae back palate valve used help close features help orthosuchus keep breathing submerging aquatic system ears protected earflaps prevent water inflow otic recess animal modern crocodiles also earflaps decrease water shape skull especially snout similar indian gharial gavialis gangeticus prey small possible orthosuchus predation slowly moving toward schools small fish swallow aquatic environment provides plenty food animal besides small fish animal could also feed lake invertebrates orthosuchus small saltsecreting gland indicates marine animal pubis articulates front region ischium believed basal animal lived swamps animal probably quadrupedal fore limbs approximately length hind limb also makes walking land unlike modern crocodiles orthosuchus creep belly probably walks high position femur vertical ground according parrish primitive crocodylomorphs crawling stance used terrestrial however orthosuchus may good swimmer since amphicoelous vertebrae whereas modern crocodiles procoelous vertebrae increase mobility httpsenwikipediaorgwikiorthosuchus
