esophageal atresia congenital medical condition birth defect affects alimentary tract causes esophagus end blindended pouch rather connecting normally stomach comprises variety congenital anatomic defects caused abnormal embryological development esophagus characterized anatomically congenital obstruction esophagus interruption continuity esophageal birth defect arises fourth fetal week trachea esophagus begin separate associated disorders tracheoesophageal attempt feeding could cause aspiration pneumonia milk collects blind pouch overflows trachea lungs furthermore fistula lower esophagus trachea may allow stomach acid flow lungs cause damage dangers condition must treated soon possible birth defects may coexist particularly heart sometimes also anus spinal column kidneys known vacterl

stomach setting polyhydramnios considered potential symptom esophageal atresia however findings low positive predictive value upper neck pouch sign another sign helps antenatal diagnosis esophageal atresia may detected soon birth affected infant unable swallow plain xray feeding tube seen pass esophagus remain coiled upper oesophageal condition takes several different forms often involving one fistulas connecting trachea esophagus tracheoesophageal fistula treatments condition vary depending severity immediate effective treatment majority cases surgical repair close fistulas reconnect two ends esophagus although usually done incision ribs right side baby technique using three small incisions thoracoscopy used minority cases gap upper lower esophageal segments may long bridge situations traditional surgical approaches include gastrostomy followed gastric pullup colonic transposition jejunum gastric pullup preferred approach many specialized centers including great ormond street london mott childrens hospital ann gastrostomy gtube allows tube feedings stomach abdominal wall often cervical esophagostomy also done allow saliva swallowed drain hole neck months years later esophagus may repaired sometimes using segment bowel brought chest interposing upper lower segments socalled long gap cases though advanced surgical treatment developed john foker may utilized elongate join short esophageal segments using foker technique surgeons place traction sutures tiny esophageal ends increase tension sutures daily ends close enough sewn together result normally functioning esophagus virtually indistinguishable one congenitally well formed unfortunately results somewhat difficult replicate surgeons need multiple operations tempered enthusiasm approach optimal treatment cases long gap esophageal atresia remains magnetic compression method another method repairing longgap esophageal atresia method require replacing missing section grafts intestine body parts using electromagnetic force attract upper lower ends esophagus together first tried using steel pellets attracted applying external electromagnets patient refinement developed mario zaritzkys group newer method uses permanent magnets balloon april annalise dapo became first patient united states esophageal atresia corrected using postoperative complications may include leak site closure esophagus sometimes stricture tight spot develop esophagus making difficult swallow esophageal stricture usually dilated using medical instruments later life children disorder trouble either
