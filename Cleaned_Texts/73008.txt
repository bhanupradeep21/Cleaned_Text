tolerogenic dendritic cells k toldcs tdcs dcregs heterogenous pool dendritic cells immunosuppressive properties priming immune system tolerogenic state various antigens tolerogenic effects mostly mediated regulation cells inducing cell anergy cell apoptosis induction toldcs also affect local microenvironment toward tolerogenic state producing antiinflammatory cytokines toldcs lineage specific immunesuppressive functions due state activation andor differentiation generally properties types dendritic cells highly affected local microenvironment presence pro antiinflammatory cytokines therefore tolerogenic properties toldcs often context dependant even eventually overridden proinflammatory tolerogenic dcs present potential strategy treatment autoimmune diseases allergic diseases transplant rejections moreover agspecific tolerance humans induced vivo via vaccination agpulsed ex vivo generated tolerogenic reason tolerogenic dcs important promising therapeutic dendritic cells dcs first discovered described ralph steinman represent bridge innate adaptive immunity play key role regulation initiation immune responses dcs populate almost body surfaces kill pathogens directly utilize subsequently degrade antigens peptides proteolytic activity present peptides complexes together mhc molecules cell surface dcs also cell type activate naïve cells induce antigenspecific immune therefore role crucially important balance tolerance immune response tolerogenic dcs essential maintenance central peripheral tolerance induction cell clonal deletion cell anergy generation activation regulatory treg cells reason tolerogenic dcs possible candidates specific cellular therapy treatment allergic diseases autoimmune diseases eg type diabetes multiple sclerosis rheumatoid arthritis transplant tolerogenic dcs often display immature semimature phenotype characteristically low expression costimulatory eg mhc molecules surface tolerogenic dcs also produce different cytokines mature dcs eg antiinflammatory cytokines interleukin transforming growth factorβ tgfβ moreover tolerogenic dcs may also express various inhibitory surface molecules eg programmed cell death ligand modulate metabolic parameters change cell response example tolerogenic dcs release induce enzymes indoleamine ido heme ido promotes degradation tryptophan nformylkynurenin leading reduced cell proliferation whereas ho catalyzes degradation hemoglobin resulting production monoxide lower dc immunogenicity besides tolerogenic dcs also may produce retinoic acid ra induces treg human tolerogenic dcs may induced various immunosuppressive drugs biomediators immunosuppressive drugs eg corticosteroid dexamethasone rapamycin cyclosporine acetylsalicylic acid cause low expression costimulatory molecules reduced expression mhc higher expression inhibitory molecules eg higher secretion ido addition incubation inhibitory cytokines tgfβ leads generation tolerogenic phenotype mediators also affect generation tolerogenic dc eg vitamin vitamin hepatocyte growth factor vasoactive intestinal peptide oldest mostly used cytokine cocktail vitro dc generation tolerogenic dcs may potential candidate specific immunotherapy studied using treatment inflammatory autoimmune allergic diseases also transplant medicine important interesting feature tolerogenic dcs also migratory capacity toward secondary lymph organs leading tcell mediated immunosuppression first trial transfer tolerogenic dcs humans undertaken ralph steinmans group relating dc administration various application used humans last years
