sexual selection insects sexual selection functions insects males species evolved exaggerated adornments mechanisms selfdefense traits play role increasing male reproductive expectations triggering malemale competition influencing female mate thought functioning three different levels individuals colonies populations within amount space accessible time male female usually determines site copulation many hymenopteran males constantly fly around specific sites usually tops tall trees summits along hedges approachable females found also resources visited females purpose feeding honey bee queens join mating area alone pursued dynamic swarm males located front line usually achieve reproduction success queen usually mates twelve males average two mating flights stores sperm throughout entire lifetime colonies sustain many males queens males able successfully mate onthophagus taurus species dung beetle competition fertilisation females occurs males engage trials strength possession breeding tunnels competition prominent feature mating system beetles ionizing radiation applied males mutations induced reduce expression strengthrelated precopulatory sexual traits competition breeding however sexual selection females proved sufficient remove mutations progeny two generations males choosier females offering males capable providing nuptial gifts secretions expensive female reproductive parental care reproductive costs males higher females invest large quantities resources time egg fertilization foraging nesting sites females moreover factors decrease subsequent male reproductive opportunities availability males example male parental care found belostomatid water bugs male fertilizing eggs allows female glue eggs onto back broods nymphs hatch weeks later eggs large reduce ability male fertilize females catch prey increases predation females usually conflict acquisition resources also tend compete male provided resources thus generating sex role reversal females compete monopolize parental displace rivals claspers appear specialized keeping hold males avoiding takeover attempts females maletomale competition access females resources females require offspring common explain morphological phenotypic traits behaviors large body size weapons territoriality early sexual maturation increase possibilities gaining access many social insects larger males competitive tend monopolize females resources need bees females may choose males faster agile persistent fliers sequestering females forced copulation may also favor large male size males longer horns mandibles use fight take attempts rivals copulating beetle species male horns long males body early sexually mature males start reproductive life rest male population scramble competition inseminate females early matured males smaller favored cases courtship occurs ground attain highest reproductive success thus fly drosophila suboscura smaller males better large males tracking females courtship effect mating female fitness may vary depending upon kind benefit females receive males choices direct benefits include nutritional resources used females donation foods mates males offering prey female seen scorpion flies dance flies several orthopteran species butterflies flies beetle males donate secretions nutritional substances females transferred ejaculate produced male glands contribute

odors one prevalent ways social male insects find females mate produced either males females central roles pheromones trigger behavioral interactions two ultimately brings sexes together mating

andor uninterrupted songs often attract females insects females may choose mate relation aspects songs case possible females compare songs several males making female calling syndrome occurs female social insects emit typical call males close proximity natal nests males attracted callings fly extensively pursuit potential mates gasters raise stings start protrude venom glands basis chemical male attractant xenomyrmex floridanus queens venom glands gasters attracted males prompted callosobruchus maculatus species beetle also known cowpea seed beetle recessive deleterious mutations beetle generally directly selected males mutations deleterious effects population growth due effects females indirectly selected efficiently purged way male tribolium castaneum species beetle also known red flour beetle experimental populations red flour beetle subjected strong sexual selection multiple years became resilient extinction furthermore beetles subjected inbreeding maintained fitness however experimental lineages derived form populations either weak sexual selection experienced rapid fitness decline inbreeding populations became extinct within generations concluded findings sexual selection reduces mutational load improves population viability httpsenwikipediaorgwikisexualselectionininsects
