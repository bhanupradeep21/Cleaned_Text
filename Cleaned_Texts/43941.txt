glomerulation refers bladder hemorrhages thought associated types interstitial cystitis ic presence glomerulations also known petechial hemorrhages bladder suggests bladder wall damaged irritated andor inflamed petechial hemorrhages originate punctuate national institute diabetes digestive kidney diseases niddk diagnostic criteria ic developed required presence glomerulations hunners ulcers diagnosis ic still used today determine eligibility clinical however research theorized hydrodistention procedure used diagnosis ic may created tiny broken blood studies found glomerulations asymptomatic populations suggesting applicable marker thus diagnosis ic based upon less invasive methods puf scale pelvic pain urgencyfrequency patient symptom scale glomerulation observed one feature prostate however efforts determine whether association causation concluded glomerulations may common finding individuals prostate cancer significant glomerulations appear checkerboardlattice patterns splotches pinpointsized red marks glomerulations classified five grades take consideration type location injury grade normal mucosa grade petechiae least two quadrants grade ii large submucosal

bladder pain syndrome bps associated chronic pelvic pain pressure discomfort within urinary national institute diabetes digestive kidney diseases niddk developed diagnostic criteria ic included presence glomerulations petechial purpose niddk diagnostic criteria facilitate comparable groups intended set strict criteria diagnosis ic interstitial cystitis may also induce angiogenic factors including vegf vascular endothelial growth factor pdecgf plateletderived endothelial cell growth factor resulting angiogenic factors crucial vessel development high values may lead vessels without enough pericyte formation newer weaker vessels submucosa associated specifically ic bps may rupture hydrodistention causing addition hydrodistension related glomerulations study rosamilia et al shown biopsied bladders women interstitial cystitis decreased vessel density subepithelium data collected irwin et al also showed blood perfusion interstitial cystitis bladders reduced thus decreased blood perfusion may increase expression angiogenic factors vegf alongside vegf increase hypoxiainducible binds vegf oxygen limited many guidelines use glomerulations diagnostic criteria bpsic review
