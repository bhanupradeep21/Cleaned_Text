congenital mirror movement disorder cmm disorder rare genetic neurological disorder characterized mirrored movement sometimes referred associated synkinetic movement often upper extremity movements voluntary intentional movements one ipsilateral side body mirrored simultaneously involuntary movements contralateral reproduction involuntary movement usually happens along headtail axis leftright example someone voluntarily make fist left hand right hand would cases accompanying contralateral involuntary movements much weaker ipsilateral voluntary ones although extent magnitude mirrored movement vary across disorder yet found associated neurologic disease cognitive disability currently cures means improve signs symptoms congenital mirror movements begin infancy persist throughout patients life often little improvement consequently patients movement disorder serious difficulty carrying tasks require manual dexterity precision playing two handed musical instrument typing keyboard whole patients also often experience discomfort pain upper limbs due prolonged use muscles therefore quality life severely cmm disorders prevalence world thought less million rarity researchers suggest mildly affected individuals may never important confuse congenital mirror movement disorders rare genetically based neurologic disease acquired mirror movement disorders present ones lifetime due reasons stroke specific molecular mechanism underpins movement disorder well however researchers suggest follows autosomal dominant genetic inheritance pattern mutations certain genes give rise structural abnormalities nervous system networks responsible voluntary skeletal muscle movement turn result functional movement abnormalities seen despite autosomal dominant important note disease variable patients inherited mutated dominant allele along genetically affected parent symptomatic asymptomatic cmm genes currently evidence associated cmm disorder include dcc deleted colorectal carcinoma dynein axonemal light chain recombination protein dcc encodes receptor protein thought responsible axon guidance neuronal cell migration mutation gene including nonsense splice site mutation insertions frameshift identified possible cause cmm experiments mice also support claim cmm disorder associated genetic mutations kanga mice lacking intracellular domain dcc receptor show hopping gait moving hind legs strictly paired fashion encodes component dynein motor complex commissural neurons corpus contrast dcc thought recessive inheritance pattern cmm cmm disorder patients researchers found splice site mutations caused skipping exon thereby omission amino acids mutant protein turn could lead faulty crosshemisphere wiring resulting maintains genome integrity repairing dna doublestrand breaks homologous heterozygous mutations specifically premature termination codons found many cmm disorder patients genomewide linkage analysis exome mouse model researchers also found products corticospinal tract axons pyramidal therefore suggest might gene haploinsufficient causes cmm disorder despite identification three prospective genes correlations yet severity clinical signs symptoms correlate type genetic mutations genes account total percent mutations genes identified likely account cases three main pathophysiological hypotheses congenital mirror movement disorder exist first researchers believe neurological disorder due abnormal communication cerebral explain mechanism physiological miscommunication amongst many neuronal changes brain normal human brain development researchers claim corpus callosum shows gradual increase number myelinated suggests certain age corpus callosum heavily unmyelinated would explain children normal development seen cmm disorder age years likely due lack corpus callosum normal disappearance clinically significant mirror movements age associated anatomical functional maturation interhemispheric connections corpus callosum motor researchers hypothesize axonal density corpus callosum responsible interhemispheric communication ultimately responsible suppression mirror movements voluntary movements healthy therefore disruptions corpus callosum circuits could lead another pathophysiological explanation researchers suggest cmm disorder miscommunication motor movement claim supported evidence structural abnormalities primary motor cortex cmm structural abnormalities motor cortex might explain hands requiring great motor dexterity therefore large cortical representation often target severe mirror movement cmm third pathophysiological explanation proposed researchers corticospinal tract healthy newborns fact ipsilateral cst projections age around normal adult development axonal projects disappear might provide alternate explanation presence mild mirror movements normally developing young children typically disappear age researchers propose dcc mutations cause reduction gene expression less robust midline guidance may lead partial failure axonal fiber crossing encourage development abnormal ipsilateral confirmed researchers demonstrate patients ddc mutants show increased proportion ipsilateral axonal projections show even small number aberrant ipsilateral descending axons sufficient induce incorrect movement findings corroborated evidence mice models kanga mice deletion dcc whose cst shown altered rather partially rerouted currently clinical diagnosis cmm disorder based clinical findings molecular genetic clinical findings signs molecular genetic cmm clear severe impacts patients ability carry daily manual recommended children placed forgiving school environments allowing time written evaluations limiting handwritten assignments ease burden movement furthermore patients inability perform pure unilateral movements difficulty tasks requiring skilled bimanual coordination young new members workforce encouraged consider professions require complex bimanual movements repetitive sustained hand movements extensive handwriting reduce overuse pain discomfort upper pronounced obviously noticeable signs symptoms cmm patients suffer social stigma however physicians need make clear parents family friends disorder bears relation intellectual however rarity neurologic disease found one million people makes societal cultural significance quite
