vein matching also called vascular technique biometric identification analysis patterns blood vessels visible surface though used federal bureau investigation central intelligence method identification still development yet universally adopted crime labs considered reliable established techniques fingerprinting however used conjunction existing forensic data support types biometric scanners widely employed security systems vascular scanners growing popularity fingerprint scanners frequently used generally provide enough data points critical verification decisions since fingerprint scanners require direct contact finger scanner dry abraded skin interfere reliability system skin diseases psoriasis also limit accuracy scanner mention direct contact scanner result need frequent cleaning higher risk equipment damage hand vascular scanners require contact scanner since information read inside body skin conditions affect accuracy vascular scanners also work quickly scanning less second scan capture unique pattern formed veins branch hand retinal scanner reliable vascular scanner less widely used intrusive nature people generally uncomfortable exposing eyes
