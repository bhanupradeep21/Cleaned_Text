drugresistant epilepsy dre also known refractory epilepsy intractable epilepsy pharmacoresistant epilepsy diagnosed following failure adequate trials two tolerated appropriately chosen used antiepileptic drugs aeds whether monotherapies combination achieve sustained seizure probability next medication achieve seizure freedom drops every failed aed example two failed aeds probability third achieve seizure freedom around drugresistant epilepsy commonly diagnosed several years uncontrolled seizures however cases evident much earlier approximately people epilepsy drugresistant aed regimens failed produce sustained seizurefreedom important initiate treatments control seizures next indirect consequences like injuries falls accidents drowning impairment daily life seizure control critical uncontrolled seizures specifically generalized tonic clonic seizures damage brain increase risk sudden unexpected death epilepsy called first step physicians refer dre patients epilepsy center one first steps management drug resistant epilepsy confirming diagnosis eeg typically patients admitted hospital prolonged eeg typically patients taken antiseizure medications evolution seizure symptoms relation changes electrical activity brain determined minimizing adverse consequences seizures far possible additional maneuvers provoke seizures also frequently performed like sleep deprivation photic stimulation hyperventilation study take days length study depends factors like baseline seizure frequency number types seizure medication patient taking prior study institutional protocols etc goal record typical seizures though cases less seizures may need recorded evaluation patients may determined nonepileptic causes symptoms eg syncope psychogenic nonepileptic seizures cardiac arrhythmia etc patients confirmed epilepsy testing helps confirm type epilepsy generalized vs focal case focal epilepsy evaluation provides crucial information determine area brain seizures

seizure likely starts seizure onset zone specific cases prolonged eeg may done outpatient ambulatory study patient goes home eeg setup type monitoring usually limited days patients taken medications mri brain common neuroimaging modality used evaluation epilepsy tesla mri generally recommended opposed scanning lower magnet strengths mri evaluation epilepsy often include images small voxel size optimized appreciate graywhite matter differentiation oblique coronal images along axis hippocampus identification lesions like focal cortical dysplasia mesial temporal sclerosis microencephalocele heterotopia require thorough review images trained clinicians changes subtle easily missed specifically evaluated active research develop newer ways processing information mri better identify subtle structural lesions associated seizures also ongoing quantitative analysis standard mri images identify subtle lesions use stronger magnetic fields like mri better delineation anatomical details positron emission tomography scan using often used evaluation drug resistant epilepsy well use epilepsy evaluation based idea areas brain responsible seizure onset also persistent metabolic dysfunction use glucose rate normal healthy brain areas involved seizure onset early propagation expected lower glucose uptake hence lower radiotracer uptake compared parts ligands like also used mostly research basis help identify areas seizure onset petmri involves coregisteration pet mri images better identify areas cortex relative hypometabolism spect scan another radiotracer based imaging technique uses oxygen radioisotope assess blood flow imaging performed inpatient video eeg monitoring tracer injected patients vein soon seizure starts idea areas brain associated seizure onset increase blood flow seizure onset hence show increase uptake tracer injected appropriate time imaging performed seizure patient medically stable taken scanner post hoc analysis assess areas showing significant increase blood flow seizure onset compared resting state used identify areas onset early propagation major limitation technique early identification seizure onset injection radiotracer given well seizure discharge spread widely includes battery tests assess higher mental functions like memory executive function language functions overall iq etc poor performance measures specific cognitive domains like verbal memory naming visuospatial orientation may point areas brain dysfunctional likely related seizure onset testing could also indicate poor performance measures suggest widespread dysfunction brain besides helping assess likely area seizure onset testing also informs cognitive risks epilepsy surgery epilepsy surgery considered often test performed determine hemisphere brain dominant language memory function helps inform potential risks language memory surgery two main tests available objective wada test fmri wada test one commonly used tests around world since invasive procedure requires neurointerventionalists neuropsychologists neurophysiologists eeg technologists anesthetists among team members catheter threaded wrist groin carotid artery middle cerebral injection sodium amytal given temporarily anesthetize cerebral hemisphere one side neuropsychological testing done assess language memory function hemisphere patient fully recovered injection

loss mesial structures either wada increasingly replaced fmri noninvasive test functional mri fmri measure change blood flow oxygenation different parts brain response activity different tasks paradigms presented patient mri scanner tasks designed make patient think words meaning words read listen language stimuli etc hence activate areas involved different language functions continuous scanning done post processing images helps identify areas activated different language tasks meg epilepsy surgery distinction made resective disconnective procedures resective procedure area brain
