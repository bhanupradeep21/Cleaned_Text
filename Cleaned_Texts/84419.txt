field articulatory phonetics subfield phonetics studies articulation ways humans produce speech articulatory phoneticians explain humans produce speech sounds via interaction different physiological structures generally articulatory phonetics concerned transformation aerodynamic energy acoustic energy aerodynamic energy refers airflow vocal tract potential form air pressure kinetic form actual dynamic airflow acoustic energy variation air pressure represented sound waves perceived human auditory system sounda respiratory sounds produced expelling air lungs however vary sound quality way useful speaking two speech organs normally move towards contact create obstruction shapes air particular fashion point maximum obstruction called place articulation way obstruction forms releases manner articulation example making p sound lips come together tightly blocking air momentarily causing buildup air pressure lips release suddenly causing burst sound place articulation sound therefore called bilabial manner called stop also known plosive vocal tract viewed aerodynamicbiomechanic model includes three main components air cavities containers air molecules specific volumes masses main

tongue body creates velaric airstream changing pressure within oral cavity tongue body changes mouth subcavity click consonants use velaric airstream mechanism pistons controlled various muscles valves regulate airflow cavities airflow occurs air valve open pressure difference connecting cavities air valve closed airflow air valves vocal folds glottis regulate supraglottal subglottal cavities velopharyngeal port regulates oral nasal cavities tongue regulates oral cavity atmosphere lips also regulate oral cavity atmosphere like pistons air valves also controlled various muscles produce kind sound must movement air produce sounds people interpret spoken words movement air must pass vocal cords throat mouth nose leave body different sounds formed different positions linguists call oral

closure tongue consonants pronounced vocal tract usually mouth order describe place articulation active passive articulator need known cases active articulators lips tongue passive articulator surface constriction created constrictions made lips called labials constrictions made several parts vocal tract broadly classified coronal dorsal radical places articulation coronal articulations made front tongue dorsal articulations made back tongue radical articulations made divisions sufficient distinguishing describing speech example english sounds ʃ coronal produced different places mouth account detailed places articulation needed based upon area mouth constriction articulations involving lips made three different ways lips bilabial one lip teeth labiodental tongue upper lip depending definition used kinds articulations may categorized class labial articulations ladefoged maddieson propose linguolabial articulations considered coronals rather labials make clear grouping like groupings articulations equivocal cleanly linguolabials included section labials given use lips place articulation bilabial consonants made lips producing sounds lower lip moves farthest meet upper lip also moves though cases force air moving aperture opening lips may cause lips separate faster come unlike articulations articulators made soft tissue bilabial stops likely produced incomplete closures articulations involving hard surfaces like teeth palate bilabial stops also unusual articulator upper section vocal tract actively moves downwards upper lip shows active downward labiodental consonants made lower lip rising upper teeth labiodental consonants often fricatives labiodental nasals also typologically debate whether true labiodental plosives occur natural though number languages reported labiodental plosives including labiodental affricates reported would require stop portion affricate labiodental stop though ladefoged maddieson raise possibility labiodental affricates involve bilabial closure like pf german unlike plosives affricates labiodental nasals common across linguolabial consonants made blade tongue approaching contacting upper lip like bilabial articulations upper lip moves slightly towards active articulator articulations group symbols international phonetic alphabet rather formed combining apical symbol diacritic implicitly placing coronal

stop though example temne bulgarian follow language apical laminal stop laminal stop likely affricated like isoko though dahalo show opposite pattern alveolar stops retroflex consonants several different definitions depending whether position tongue position roof mouth given prominence general represent group articulations tip tongue curled upwards degree way retroflex articulations occur several different locations roof mouth including alveolar postalveolar palatal regions underside tongue tip makes contact roof mouth subapical though apical postalveolar sounds also described typical examples subapical retroflex stops commonly found dravidian languages languages indigenous southwest united states contrastive difference dental alveolar stops slight retroflexion alveolar acoustically retroflexion tends affect higher articulations taking place behind alveolar ridge known postalveolar consonants referred using number different terms apical postalveolar consonants often called retroflex laminal articulations sometimes called australianist literature laminal stops often described palatal though produced forward palate region typically described individual anatomical variation precise articulation palatoalveolar stops coronals general vary widely within speech dorsal consonants consonants made using tongue body rather tip blade palatal consonants made using tongue

velum incredibly common crosslinguistically almost languages velar stop velars vowels made using tongue body highly affected coarticulation vowels produced far forward hard palate far back uvula variations typically divided front central back velars parallel vowel hard distinguish phonetically palatal consonants though produced slightly behind area prototypical palatal uvular consonants made tongue body contacting approaching uvula rare occurring estimated percent languages large regions americas africa languages uvular consonants languages uvular consonants stops frequent followed continuants including radical consonants either use root tongue epiglottis pharyngeal consonants made retracting root tongue far enough touch wall pharynx due production difficulties fricatives approximants produced epiglottal consonants made epiglottis back wall pharynx epiglottal stops recorded voiced epiglottal consonants deemed possible due cavity glottis epiglottis small permit glottal consonants produced using vocal folds larynx vocal folds source phonation oronasal vocal tract number glottal consonants impossible voiced glottal stop three glottal consonants possible voiceless glottal stop two glottal fricatives attested natural glottal stops produced closing vocal folds notably common worlds many languages use demarcate phrase boundaries languages like huatla mazatec contrastive phonemes additionally glottal stops realized laryngealization following vowel glottal stops especially vowels usually form complete closure true glottal stops normally occur knowing place articulation enough fully describe consonant way stricture happens equally important manners articulation describe exactly active articulator modifies narrows closes vocal stops also referred plosives consonants airstream completely obstructed pressure builds mouth stricture released small burst sound articulators move apart velum raised air flow nasal cavity velum lowered allows air flow nose result nasal stop however phoneticians almost always refer nasal stops sequence stops followed fricative fricatives consonants airstream made turbulent partially completely obstructing part vocal sibilants special type fricative turbulent airstream directed towards creating highpitched hissing nasals sometimes referred nasal stops consonants theres closure oral cavity velum lowered allowing air flow approximant articulators come close together extent allows turbulent laterals consonants airstream obstructed along center vocal tract allowing airstream flow freely one laterals also defined consonants tongue contracted way airstream greater around sides center first definition allow air flow tongue trills consonants tongue lips set motion stricture formed way airstream causes repeating pattern opening closing soft apical trills typically consist two three periods taps flaps single rapid usually apical gestures tongue thrown roof mouth comparable rapid terms sometimes used interchangeably phoneticians make tap tongue contacts roof single motion whereas flap tongue moves tangentially roof mouth striking passing glottalic airstream mechanism glottis closed trapping body air allows remaining air vocal tract moved separately upward movement closed glottis move air resulting ejective consonant alternatively glottis lower sucking air mouth results implosive clicks stops tongue movement causes air sucked mouth referred velaric click air becomes rarefied two articulatory closures producing loud click sound anterior closure released release anterior closure referred click influx release posterior closure velar uvular click efflux clicks used several african language families khoisan bantu vowels produced passage air larynx vocal tract vowels voiced ie vocal folds vibrating except marginal cases vocal tract open airstream able escape without generating fricative noise variation vowel quality produced means following articulatory structures glottis opening vocal folds located larynx position creates different vibration patterns distinguish voiced voiceless addition pitch vowel changed altering frequency vibration vocal folds languages contrasts among vowels different phonation pharynx region vocal tract velum larynx vowels may made pharyngealized also epiglottalized sphincteric strident means retraction tongue vowels may also articulated advanced tongue discussion whether vowel feature atr different tenselax distinction soft airflow nasal cavity nasals nasalized sounds produced lowering velum allowing air escape nose vowels normally produced soft palate raised air escapes nose however vowels may nasalized result lowering soft palate many languages use nasalization tongue highly flexible organ capable moved many different ways vowel articulation principal variations vowel height dimension backness less common variation vowel quality produced change shape front tongue resulting rhotic rhotacized lips play major role vowel articulation generally believed two major variables effect liprounding labialization lip protrusion practical purposes temperature treated constant articulatory system thus boyles law usefully written following two equations equations express given initial pressure volume time product two values equal product pressure volume later time means increase volume cavity corresponding decrease pressure cavity vice versa words volume pressure inversely proportional negatively correlated applied description subglottal cavity lung pistons contract lungs volume subglottal cavity decreases subglottal air pressure increases conversely lungs expanded pressure decreases situation considered vocal fold valve closed separating supraglottal cavity subglottal cavity mouth open therefore supraglottal air pressure equal atmospheric pressure lungs contracted resulting subglottal pressure increased pressure greater atmospheric pressure vocal fold valve subsequently opened previously two separate cavities become one unified cavity although cavities still aerodynamically isolated glottic valve relatively small constrictive pascals law states pressure within system must equal throughout system subglottal pressure greater supraglottal pressure pressure inequality unified cavity since pressure force applied surface area definition force product mass acceleration according newtons second law motion pressure inequality resolved part mass air molecules found subglottal cavity move supraglottal cavity movement mass airflow airflow continue pressure equilibrium reached similarly ejective consonant glottalic airstream mechanism lips tongue ie buccal lingual valve initially closed closed glottis laryngeal piston raised decreasing oral cavity volume behind valve closure increasing pressure compared volume pressure resting state closed valve opened airflow result cavity behind initial closure outward intraoral pressure equal atmospheric pressure air flow cavity higher pressure cavity lower pressure equilibrium point pressure potential energy thus converted airflow kinetic energy sound sources refer conversion aerodynamic energy acoustic energy two main types sound sources articulatory system periodic precisely semiperiodic aperiodic periodic sound source vocal fold vibration produced glottis found vowels voiced consonants less common periodic sound source vibration
