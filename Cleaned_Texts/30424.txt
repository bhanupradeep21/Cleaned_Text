thus term ape obtained two different meanings shown encyclopædia britannica entry could used synonym monkey could denote tailless humanlike primate recently hominoids also called apes term used broadly several different senses within popular scientific settings ape used synonym monkey naming primate humanlike appearance particularly without biologists traditionally used term ape mean member
