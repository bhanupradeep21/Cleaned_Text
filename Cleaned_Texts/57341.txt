inbreeding production offspring mating breeding individuals organisms closely related analogy term used human reproduction commonly refers genetic disorders consequences may arise expression deleterious recessive traits resulting incestuous sexual relationships consanguinity animals avoid incest inbreeding results homozygosity increase chances offspring affected recessive extreme cases usually leads least temporarily decreased biological fitness called inbreeding depression ability survive reproduce individual inherits deleterious traits colloquially referred inbred avoidance expression deleterious recessive alleles caused inbreeding via inbreeding avoidance mechanisms main selective reason crossbreeding populations sometimes positive effects fitnessrelated also sometimes leads negative effects known outbreeding depression however increased homozygosity increases probability fixing beneficial alleles also slightly decreases probability fixing deleterious alleles inbreeding result purging deleterious alleles population purifying inbreeding technique used selective breeding example livestock breeding breeders may use inbreeding trying establish new desirable
