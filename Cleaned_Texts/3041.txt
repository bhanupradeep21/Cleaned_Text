lymphocytic esophagitis rare poorly understood medical disorder involving inflammation esophagus disease named primary inflammatory process wherein lymphocytes seen within esophageal mucosa symptoms condition include difficulty swallowing heartburn food bolus obstruction condition first described rubio colleagues initial reports questioned whether true medical disorder whether inflammation secondary another condition gastroesophageal reflux disease cause lymphocytic esophagitis unknown disease may cause different symptoms caused different processes childhood compared adulthood studies shown associated either medical conditions involving esophagus including gastroesophageal reflux disease achalasia inflammatory conditions crohns disease coeliac disease allergic conditions diagnosis based upon biopsy mucosa esophagus showing characteristic appearance inflammation involving lymphocytes relative absence another group inflammatory cells granulocytes complications disorder include stricture esophagus lead food bolus obstruction weight loss treatment lymphocytic esophagitis includes medications meant target esophagus topically budesonide also procedures deal complications esophageal dilation common symptom lymphocytic esophagitis dysphagia difficulty swallowing prevalent individuals due inflammation narrowing altered movement esophagus symptoms include heartburn abdominal pain nausea food bolus patients may symptoms found significant percentage patients first description although recent reports indicate absence symptoms food bolus impaction common complication lymphocytic occurs food acutely obstructing esophagus area narrowing typically requires endoscopic procedure order remove dislodge obstructing foodcitation needed cause lymphocytic esophagitis attempts better understand cause lymphocytic esophagitis include identification diseases associate conditions include esophageal conditions including gastroesophageal reflux well inflammatory diseases crohns coeliac allergic conditions additionally use tobacco may associate lymphocytic lymphocytic esophagitis occur high frequency gastrointestinal conditions lymphocytosis found mucosa including lymphocytic colitis lymphocytic gastritis however disease association coeliac disease wherein lymphocytic inflammation occurs small bowel exposure little known pathophysiology lymphocytic hypothesized lymphocytic esophagitis may either primary inflammatory disorder inflammation triggered external stimulus leading injury mucosal lining esophagus gastric acid diagnosis lymphocytic esophagitis made biopsy mucosal lining esophagus typically achieved time esophagogastroduodenoscopy medical procedure wherein endoscope inserted mouth esophagus order visualize biopsy mucosacitation needed histologic changes biopsies characterized presence inflammatory infiltrate consisting primarily lymphocytes absence inflammatory cells granulocytes criteria making diagnosis still location biopsies cutoff number lymphocytes found highpower field view microscope presence spongiosis need immunohistochemical staining define lymphocytes unclear diagnosis lymphocytic esophagitis depends biopsy results certain changes visualized directly time endoscopy esophagus may narrow may show multiple linear mucosal lining may slide demonstrating crepepaper complications

imaging modality show characteristic changes lymphocytic treatment lymphocytic esophagitis still treatment either targets symptoms inflammation complications example heartburn symptom lymphocytic esophagitis proton pump inhibitors reduce acidity stomach consequently used treatment respect treatment inflammation steroids topical coat lining esophagus budesonide used treat condition one german prednisone also used treat inflammation lymphocytic respect complications strictures esophagus treated esophageal little studied natural history lymphocytic longest study condition involved median followup years wherein participants surveyed demonstrated patients alive vast majority patients still two reports esophageal perforation associated condition one case occurring endoscopic treatment percentage individuals lymphocytic esophagitis early studies indicated prevalence however reports children indicate higher prevalence perhaps suggestive incidental findings lymphocytes endoscopies performed disease may occur frequently women age increasing awareness lymphocytic esophagitis among physicians perhaps affecting prevalence majority studies lymphocytic esophagitis condition first described series patients karolinska institutet carlos rubio much reports condition subsequent several years focused ascertaining whether lymphocytic esophagitis true condition establishing uniform criteria majority research lymphocytic esophagitis performed remain many questions unanswered condition establishing natural clarifying diagnostic ascertaining best treatment
