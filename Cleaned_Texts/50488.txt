panzootic start three conditions met disease condition panzootic merely widespread kills large number animals must also infectious example cancer responsible large number deaths considered panzootic disease generally speaking infectious unlike epizootic panzootic covers nearly species large surface area ex rabies anthrax typically enzootic epizootic cause may act potential preparatory factor contagion infection far play biggest role dissemination spread epizootic panzootic diseases include virulent ex cattle plague septic caused change food quality parasitic ex malaria miasmatic infections ex typhoid fever many claim accidental morbific cause infects great number animals ceases activity prolonged time certain factors come play spread certain panzootic diseases seen
