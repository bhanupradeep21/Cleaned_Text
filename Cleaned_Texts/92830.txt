biology constructive development refers hypothesis organisms shape developmental trajectory constantly responding causing changes internal state external constructive development contrasted programmed development hypothesis organisms develop according genetic program constructivist perspective found philosophy notably developmental systems theory biological social sciences including developmental psychobiology key themes extended evolutionary synthesis constructive development may important evolution enables organisms produce functional phenotypes response genetic environmental perturbation thereby contributes adaptation point time organisms development depends current state organism state environment developmental system including genome epigenetic regulation responds flexibly internal external inputs one example conditiondependent gene expression regulatory systems also rely physical properties cells tissues exploratory behavior among microtubular neural muscular vascular organisms inherit ie receive predecessors diverse set developmental resources including dna epigenetic marks organelles enzymes hormones antibodies transcription factors symbionts socially transmitted knowledge environmental conditions modified course development organisms help shape internal external environment way influence development organisms also construct developmental environments offspring various forms extragenetic single source influence central control organisms whilst genetic influence development fundamental causation occur bottom also flows downwards complex levels organismal organization eg tissuespecific regulation gene expression result many features organisms emergent properties encoded genome constructive development manifest contextdependent gene expression physical properties cells tissues exploratory behavior physiological systems learning although cells organism contain dna hundreds different types cells single organism diverse cell shapes behaviors functions created

membrane forms barrier inside outside cell lipid bilayer forms result thermodynamic properties phospholipids made hydrophilic head hydrophobic tails exploratory processes selective processes operate within individual organisms many animals vascular immune nervous systems develop producing variety forms functional solutions selected retained others lost example shape circulatory system constructed according oxygen nutrient needs tissues rather genetically predetermined likewise nervous system develops axonal exploration initially muscle fibers connected multiple neurons synaptic competition selects certain connections others define mature pattern muscle innervation shape cell determined structure cytoskeleton major element cytoskeleton microtubules grow random directions origin microtubuleassociated proteins aid inhibit microtubule growth guide microtubules specific cellular locations mediate interactions proteins therefore microtubules stabilized new configurations give rise new cell shapes potentially new behaviors functions without changes microtubule system animals many behaviors acquired learning social learning cultural transmission important sources adaptive phenotypic plasticity enabling animals adapt environments even environments frequently encountered evolutionary history species social learning also enables stable inheritance many characters crossfostering great tit blue tit chicks show social learning result stable inheritance speciestypical foraging behaviors foraging height prey type prey size foraging method well nest site choice alarm calls songs mate recent killer whale research demonstrated divergence orcas several species mediated learned socially transmitted differences within evolutionary biology development traditionally viewed direction genetic program metaphors genetic blueprint program instructions still widespread biology contrast constructive development perspective views genome subsystem cell shaped evolution detect respond signals different perspectives affect evolutionary interpretations one example evolutionary significance environmentally induced phenotypes mary jane westeberhard famously suggested responses environment starting point evolutionary termed plasticityled evolution programmed development perspective developmental plasticity considered controlled genetically specified switches reaction norms produce functional responses environmental change reaction norms must prescreened prior selection therefore plasticityled evolution reduces standard evolutionary explanation natural selection acting genetic variation conversely plasticityled evolution gains greater significance development constructive openended new functional phenotypes emerge little initial genetic modification see facilitated provide new raw material natural selection act
