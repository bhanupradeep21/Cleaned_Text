county holotype smu shuler museum paleontology southern methodist university dallas specific name honors collector fossil chris wadleigh reference species genus coloborhynchus based fact c wadleighi

previously described david martill indeterminate member genus coloborhynchus account anteriorlyprojecting teeth snout holgado pêgas recognized shared features u wadleighi thus assigned new species holotype specimen u wadleighi partial snout length fifteen centimetres consists front end skull containing premaxilla small part maxilla top base crest present gradually curving upwards ending height centimeters attained point thickness millimeters snout broadens towards front left side eight tooth sockets alveoli visible right side six first pair teeth located flat tip snout pointing forwards alveoli first increase size tip towards back third pair largest diameter either millimeters millimeters fourth pair much smaller back gradually tooth sockets increase size thus prey grab formed according rodrigues kellner species two unique traits presence oval depression first pair teeth ventral medial depression second pair teeth circular hollow positioned lower edge snout tip lee interpreted possible pneumatic holotype u rodriguesae shares oval depression also bulbous projection palate holotype u wadleighi however differs u wadleighi depression shallower second pair teeth projects laterally margins deltoid facet upturned region front palate concave opposed rodrigues kellner base distinction uktenadactylus coloborhynchus clavirostris several stratigraphical methodological phylogenetic considerations possible age difference perhaps thirty million years berriasianvalanginian british younger albiancenomanian american form taxa based limited remains however even within limits clearly distinguishable species level reject rash assumption generic identity also uncertain affinity closely related form siroccopteryx would make assumption problematical rodrigues kellner identify one shared derived trait uktenadactylus coloborhynchus clavirostris extreme enlargement second third pairs teeth differences taxa include forward position crest c clavirostris beginning tip snout deeper palatal groove shallow grooves running parallel ridge front part palate depression located first alveoli lateral position second third fourth tooth pairs whereas fifth sixth pair contrary much closer midline skull forms share derived traits siroccopteryx second third teeth pairs larger fourth tip snout flat causing prey grab rectangular crosssection similar thickness crest authors conclude three taxa likely formed yet unnamed clade together within topology andres myers placed uktenadactylus within family ornithocheiridae sister taxon coloborhynchus clavirostris though analysis uktenadactylus identified coloborhynchus slightly different topology jacobs et al also recovered uktenadactylus within ornithocheiridae sister taxon several
