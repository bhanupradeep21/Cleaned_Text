performed evaluate disease injury may present research educational purposes term necropsy generally used nonhuman animals autopsies usually performed specialized medical doctor called pathologist small portion deaths require autopsy performed certain circumstances cases medical examiner coroner determine cause death autopsies performed either legal medical purposes autopsies performed following information desired example forensic autopsy carried cause death may criminal matter clinical academic autopsy performed find medical cause death used cases unknown uncertain death research
