pathophysiology study explains function body relates diseases conditions pathophysiology hypertension area attempts explain mechanistically causes hypertension chronic disease characterized elevation blood pressure hypertension classified cause either essential also known primary idiopathic secondary hypertension essential authorities define essential hypertension known explanation others define cause due overconsumption sodium underconsumption potassium secondary hypertension indicates hypertension result specific underlying condition wellknown mechanism chronic kidney disease narrowing

maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis via pressure volume chemoreceptor signals regulating peripheral vasculature kidney function turn affect cardiac output vascular resistance fluid retention excess activity sympathetic nervous system increases blood pressure contributes mechanisms increased sympathetic nervous system activity hypertension involve alterations baroreflex chemoreflex pathways peripheral central levels arterial baroreceptors reset higher pressure hypertensive patients peripheral resetting reverts normal arterial pressure furthermore central resetting aortic baroreflex hypertensive patients resulting suppression sympathetic inhibition activation aortic baroreceptor nerves baroreflex resetting seems mediated least partly central action angiotensin additional smallmolecule mediators suppress baroreceptor activity contribute exaggerated sympathetic drive hypertension include reactive oxygen species studies shown hypertensive patients manifest greater vasoconstrictor responses infused norepinephrine normotensive hypertensive patients show normal response increased circulating norepinephrine levels generally induces downregulation noradrenergic receptor believed abnormal response genetically exposure stress increases sympathetic outflow repeated stressinduced vasoconstriction may result vascular hypertrophy leading progressive increases
