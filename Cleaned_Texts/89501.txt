paul hardin born september american scientist field chronobiology pioneering researcher understanding circadian clocks flies mammals hardin currently serves distinguished professor biology department texas best known discovery circadian oscillations mrna clock gene period per importance ebox per activation interlocked feedback loops control rhythms activator gene transcription circadian regulation olfaction drosophila melanogaster born suburb chicago matteson illinois hardin currently resides college station texas wife three children hardin earned bs biology southern methodist university smu continued pursue phd genetics indiana university william h klein went conduct postdoctoral research brandeis university supervision chronobiologist michael hardin worked professor texas university university houston since hardin worked professor researcher biology department texas university teaches courses introductory biology molecular cell biology graduate level class biological clocks also serves director texas ams center biological clocks research faculty texas institute neuroscience phd program addition hardin also actively involved society research biological rhythms served secretary treasurer president ron konopka geneticist california institute technology discovered period gene found involved circadian clock paul hardin discovered per mrna underwent strong circadian oscillations exposing isolated wildtype per mrna series lightdark ld cycles followed cycles constant darkness postdoctorate lab chronobiologist dr michael rosbash hardin specifically noted per mrna levels drosophila brains fluctuate typical lightdark cycle hardin demonstrated wildtype protein per rescue rhythmicity mrna arrhythmic mutant per gene findings suggested feedback per protein regulates levels per hardin ultimately published seminal work rhythmic nature per mrna drosophila journal nature discovery led hardin prominent members field chronobiology develop model describes clock mechanism drosophila model referred transcription feedback loop suggests translated protein provides negative feedback mrna transcription hardin haiping hao david allen analyzed sequence per gene drosophila found enhancer upstream gene enhancer sequence contained ebox cacgtg determined necessary highlevel per eboxes typically bound proteins containing basic helixloophelix bhlh protein structural motif presence ebox per led hypothesis proteins involved circadian rhythms may contain bhlh domain proved vital establishing function previously discovered clock protein known play role circadian rhythms contained bhlh domain well discovery also aided identification cycle proteins critical players circadian rhythms mammalian drosophila circadian systems teaching university houston hardin along fellow scientists balaji krishnan stuart dryer investigated circadian rhythms olfaction drosophila previous experiments shown drosophila antennae demonstrate circadian rhythms however mechanism circadian rhythms antennae unknown determine mechanism rhythms antennae hardin team kept wildtype mutant flies lightdark ld cycles measured olfaction antennae electroantennogram eag measures average output insect antenna brain given odor period wildtype flies demonstrated rhythmicity electrical activity indicated circadian rhythms present olfactory contrast mutants showed cyclic activity therefore hardins team discovered circadian rhythms control olfactory response drosophila antennae results eventually published hardin along nick glossop lisa lyons conducted research specific role clk interlocked feedback loops present drosophila circadian oscillators previously known five genes per tim dbt clk cyc controlled circadian rhythms drosophila pertim regulation mechanism known time though clk regulation yet hardin team conducted series experiments identify two interlocked feedback loops circadian mechanism drosophila means pertim feedback loop connects clkcyc feedback loop one loop effect vice versa measured wildtype mutant clk mrna levels identify changes transcription levels observed pertim complex suppresses transcription hypothesized clk repressor either clkcyc complex repressor activated clkcyc observed presence active clk cyc resulted repression clk arrhythmic per mutants exhibited low levels clk evidence led propose following model regarding two interlocked feedback hardins team uncovered second feedback loop associated circadian clock vrille vri par domain protein encode related transcription factors whose expression directly activated dclockcycle show vri proteins feed back directly regulate dclock expression thus vri together dclock comprise second feedback loop drosophila clock gives rhythmic expression dclock probably genes generate accurate circadian hardins current research centers function circadian clock drosophila one hardins main research topics understanding mechanism behind circadian rhythms olfaction gustatory physiology research also focuses understanding role posttranslational regulatory mechanisms feedback loop set rhythm lastly lab working identifying interlocked loops feedback mechanism function circadian oscillator clock
