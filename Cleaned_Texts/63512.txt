deextinction also known resurrection biology species revivalism process generating organism either resembles extinct several ways carry process deextinction cloning widely proposed method although genome editing selective breeding also considered similar techniques applied certain endangered species hopes boost genetic diversity method three would provide animal genetic identity benefits drawbacks process deextinction ranging technological advancements ethical issues cloning commonly suggested method potential restoration extinct species done extracting nucleus preserved cell extinct species swapping egg without nucleus species nearest living egg inserted host extinct species nearest living relative important note method used preserved cell available meaning would feasible recently extinct cloning used scientists since one well known clones dolly sheep dolly born mid lived normally abrupt midlife onset health complications resembling premature aging led known cloned animal species include domestic cats dogs pigs genome editing rapidly advancing help crisprcas systems particularly system originally discovered part bacterial immune viral dna injected bacterium became incorporated bacterial chromosome specific regions regions called clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats otherwise known crispr since viral dna within chromosome gets transcribed rna occurs binds rna recognize foreign insert cleaves discovery crucial cas protein viewed scissor genome editing process using cells closely related species extinct species genome editing play role deextinction process germ cells may edited directly egg sperm produced extant parent species produce offspring extinct species somatic cells may edited transferred via somatic cell nuclear transfer result animal completely extinct species rather hybrid extinct species closely related nonextinct species possible sequence assemble genome extinct organisms highly degraded tissues technique enables scientists pursue deextinction wider array species including wellpreserved remains however degraded old tissue extinct species fragmented resulting dna making genome assembly challenging back breeding form selective breeding opposed breeding animals trait advance species selective breeding back breeding involves breeding animals ancestral characteristic may seen throughout species method recreate traits extinct species genome differ original back breeding however contingent ancestral trait species still population back breeding also form artificial selection deliberate selective breeding domestic animals attempt achieve animal breed phenotype resembles wild type ancestor usually one gone extinct breeding back confused dedomestication natural process deextinction iterative evolution occurs species becomes extinct time different species evolves almost identical creature example aldabra rail flightless bird lived island aldabra evolved time past flighted whitethroated rail became extinct years ago due unknown event caused sea levels rise years ago sea levels dropped island reappeared fauna whitethroated rail recolonized island soon evolved flightless species taxonomically identical extinct technologies developed deextinction could lead large advances various fields prioritising deextinction could lead improvement current conservation strategies conservation measures would initially necessary order reintroduce species ecosystem revived population sustain reintroduction extinct species could also help improve ecosystems destroyed human development may also argued reviving species driven extinction humans ethical reintroduction extinct species could negative impact extant species ecosystem extinct species ecological niche may filled former habitat making invasive species could lead extinction species due competition food competitive exclusion could also lead extinction prey species predators environment predators reintroduction extinct species extinct long period time environment introduced could wildly different one survive changes environment due human development could mean species may survive reintroduced species could also become extinct deextinction reasons extinction still threat woolly mammoth might hunted poachers like elephants ivory could go extinct happen species reintroduced environment disease immunity reintroduced species could wiped disease current species survive deextinction expensive process bringing back one species cost millions dollars money deextinction would likely come current conservation efforts efforts could weakened funding taken conservation put deextinction would mean critically endangered species would start go extinct faster longer resources needed maintain also since cloning techniques perfectly replicate species existed wild reintroduction species may bring positive environmental benefits may role food chain therefore restore damaged existence preserved soft tissue remains dna woolly mammoths mammuthus primigenius led idea species could recreated scientific means two methods proposed achieve first would use cloning process however even intact mammoth samples little usable dna conditions preservation enough dna intact guide production second method would involve artificially inseminating elephant egg cell preserved sperm mammoth resulting offspring would hybrid mammoth closest living relative asian elephant several generations crossbreeding hybrids almost pure woolly mammoth could produced however sperm cells modern mammals typically potent years deepfreezing could hinder japanese team found usable dna brains mice frozen years hope use similar methods find usable mammoth japanese scientists announced plans clone mammoths within six march russian association medical anthropologists reported blood recovered frozen mammoth carcass would provide good opportunity cloning woolly another way create living woolly mammoth would migrate genes mammoth genome genes closest living relative asian elephant create hybridized animals notable adaptations living much colder environment modern day elephants currently done team led harvard geneticist george team made changes elephant genome genes gave woolly mammoth coldresistant blood longer hair extra layer according geneticist hendrik poinar revived woolly mammoth mammothelephant hybrid may find suitable habitat tundra taiga forest george church hypothesized positive effects bringing back extinct woolly mammoth would environment potential reversing damage caused global fellow researchers
