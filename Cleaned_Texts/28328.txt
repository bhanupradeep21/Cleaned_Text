skin condition also known cutaneous condition medical condition affects integumentary organ system encloses body includes skin nails related muscle major function system barrier external conditions human integumentary system constitute broad spectrum diseases also known dermatoses well many nonpathologic states like certain circumstances melanonychia racquet small number skin diseases account visits physician thousands skin conditions classification conditions often presents many nosological challenges since underlying causes pathogenetics often therefore current textbooks present classification based location example conditions mucous membrane morphology chronic blistering conditions cause skin conditions resulting physical factors clinically diagnosis particular skin condition begins gathering pertinent information presenting skin lesions including location eg arms head legs symptoms pruritus pain duration acute chronic arrangement solitary generalized annular linear morphology macules papules vesicles color red yellow diagnoses may also require skin biopsy yields histologic correlated clinical presentation laboratory introduction cutaneous ultrasound allowed detection cutaneous tumors inflammatory processes skin skin weighs average kg lb covers area sq ft made three distinct layers epidermis dermis subcutaneous two main types human skin glabrous skin nonhairy skin palms soles also referred palmoplantar surfaces hairbearing within latter type hairs structures called pilosebaceous units hair follicle sebaceous gland associated arrector pili embryo epidermis hair glands ectoderm chemically influenced underlying mesoderm forms dermis subcutaneous epidermis superficial layer skin squamous epithelium several strata stratum corneum stratum lucidum stratum granulosum stratum spinosum stratum nourishment provided layers via diffusion dermis since epidermis without direct blood epidermis contains four cell types keratinocytes melanocytes langerhans cells merkel cells keratinocytes major component constituting roughly stratified squamous epithelium maintained cell division within stratum basale differentiating cells slowly displace outwards stratum spinosum stratum corneum cells continually shed normal skin rate production equals rate loss two weeks needed cell migrate basal cell layer top granular cell layer additional two

layers interact basement membrane structural components dermis collagen elastic fibers ground substance also called extra fibrillar within components pilosebaceous units arrector pili muscles eccrine apocrine dermis contains two vascular networks run parallel skin superficial one deep connected vertical communicating function blood vessels within dermis fourfold supply nutrition regulate
