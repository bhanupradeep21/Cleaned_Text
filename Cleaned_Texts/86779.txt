athletic heart syndrome ahs nonpathological condition commonly seen sports medicine human heart enlarged resting heart rate lower normal athletes heart associated physiological cardiac remodeling consequence repetitive cardiac athletes heart common athletes routinely exercise hour day occurs primarily endurance athletes though occasionally arise heavy weight trainers condition generally considered benign may occasionally hide serious medical condition may even mistaken athletes heart often physical symptoms although indicator would consistently low resting heart rate athletes ahs often realize condition unless undergo specific medical tests athletes heart normal physiological adaptation body stresses physical conditioning aerobic people diagnosed athletes heart commonly display three signs would usually indicate heart condition seen regular person bradycardia cardiomegaly cardiac hypertrophy bradycardia slower normal heartbeat around beats per minute cardiomegaly state enlarged heart cardiac hypertrophy thickening muscular wall heart specifically left ventricle pumps oxygenated blood aorta especially intensive workout blood oxygen required peripheral tissues arms legs highly trained athletes bodies larger heart results higher cardiac output may allow beat slowly rest blood pumped beatmedical citation needed another sign athletes heart syndrome gallop heard stethoscope sound heard diastolic pressure irregularly shaped heart creates disordered blood flow however gallop heard patient given immediate attention gallop stronger louder sound created heart diseased way typically sign serious medical athletes heart result dynamic physical activity aerobic training hours week rather static training weightlifting intensive prolonged endurance strength training body signals heart pump blood body counteract oxygen deficit building skeletal muscles enlargement heart natural physical adaptation body deal high pressures large amounts blood affect heart periods time time body increase chamber size left ventricle muscle mass wall thickness cardiac output amount blood leaves heart given time period ie liters per minute proportional chamber sizes heart rate heart beats larger left ventricle heart rate decrease still maintain level cardiac output necessary body therefore athletes ahs commonly lower resting heart rates nonathletesmedical citation needed heart becomes enlarged hypertrophic due intense cardiovascular workouts creating increase stroke volume enlarged left ventricle right ventricle decrease resting heart rate along irregular rhythms wall left ventricle increases size normal capacity decrease diastolic function left ventricle athlete may also experience irregular heartbeat resting pulse rate beats per minute level physical activity person determines physiological changes heart makes two types exercise static strengthtraining dynamic endurancetraining static exercise consists weight lifting mostly anaerobic meaning body rely oxygen performance also moderately increases heart rate stroke volume oxygen debt dynamic exercises include running swimming skiing rowing cycling rely oxygen body type exercise also increases heart rate stroke volume heart static dynamic exercises involve thickening left ventricular wall due increased cardiac output leads physiologic hypertrophy heart athletes stop training heart returns normal athletes heart usually incidental finding routine screening tests medical issues enlarged heart seen echocardiography sometimes chest xray similarities presentation athletes heart clinically relevant cardiac problems may prompt electrocardiography ecg exercise cardiac stress tests ecg detect sinus bradycardia resting heart rate fewer beats per minute often accompanied sinus arrhythmia pulse person athletes heart sometimes irregular rest usually returns normal exercise regarding differential diagnosis left ventricular hypertrophy usually indistinguishable athletes heart ecg usually discounted young important distinguish athletes heart hypertrophic cardiomyopathy hcm serious cardiovascular disease characterised thickening hearts walls

medical history patient endurance sports physical examination bradycardia maybe third fourth heart sound give important hints several wellknown highprofile cases athletes experiencing sudden unexpected death due cardiac arrest reggie white marcvivien fo√© growing movement making effort professional schoolbased athletes screened cardiac related conditions usually careful medical health

symptoms bradycardia cardiomegaly cardiac hypertrophy another illness may present athletes heart cause sudden cardiac death shortly workout mainly occurs due hypertrophic cardiomyopathy arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy arvc two genetic disorders although link intensive exercise exerciseinduced arythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy treatment required people athletic heart syndrome pose physical threats athlete despite theoretical concerns ventricular remodeling might conceivably predispose serious evidence found increased risk longterm athletes see physician receive clearance sure symptoms due athletes heart another heart disease cardiomyopathy athlete uncomfortable athletes heart differential diagnosis difficult deconditioning exercise period three months allows heart return regular size however one longterm study elitetrained athletes found dilation left ventricle partially reversible long period deconditioning often met resistance accompanying lifestyle changes real risk attached athletes heart athletes nonathletes simply assume condition instead making sure lifethreatening heart athletes heart syndrome first described salomon henschen compared heart size crosscountry skiers lived sedentary lives noticed participated competitive sports displayed symptoms athletes heart syndrome henschen believed symptoms normal adjustment exercise felt concern henschen believed entire heart became enlarged fact left side becomes hypertrophic also believed athletes ahs lived shorter lives acquire syndrome research occurred throughout century technology limited became difficult devise appropriate ways measure hearts athletes believed henschens theory athletes larger hearts participate sports theory httpsenwikipediaorgwikiathleticheartsyndrome
