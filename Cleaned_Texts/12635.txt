macropsia neurological condition affecting human visual perception objects within affected section visual field appear larger normal causing person feel smaller actually macropsia along opposite condition micropsia categorized dysmetropsia macropsia related conditions dealing visual perception aniseikonia alice wonderland syndrome aiws also known todds syndrome macropsia wide range causes prescription illicit drugs migraines rarely complex partial epilepsy different retinal conditions epiretinal physiologically retinal macropsia results compression cones eye compression receptor distribution results greater stimulation thus larger perceived image object obvious symptom macropsia presence exceptionally enlarged objects throughout visual field example young girl might see sisters books size sister stemming symptom someone macropsia may feel undersized relation surrounding environment patients macropsia also noted cessation auditory function prior onset visual hallucination indicating possible seizure either buzzing sound ears also reported immediately macropsia development patients claim symptoms may eased attempt made physically touch object appears enormous important note however patients typically remain lucid alert throughout episodes able recount specific details person macropsia may psychiatric conditions symptoms caused chemically drugs cannabis magic mushrooms cocaine tend dissipate chemical compound excreted body acquire macropsia symptom virus usually experience complete recovery restoration normal visioncitation needed dysmetropsia one eye case aniseikonia present symptoms headaches asthenopia reading difficulties depth perception problems double visual distortion cause uncorrelated images stimulate corresponding retinal regions simultaneously impairing fusion images without suppression one images symptoms mild poor stereopsis binocular diplopia intolerable rivalry broad range psychological emotional effects person macropsia may experience one competing theory radically stated macropsia may entirely psychological pathological phenomenon without structural defect definite may irritable angry state contrast euphoric state evidence experience alice wonderland syndrome associated macropsia able recount experiences thorough detail may evidence psychiatric disturbance result psychiatric therapy may psychological conditions often arise macropsia general consensus cause macropsia affected may experience extreme anxiety episodes result overwhelming nature distorted visual field due fear anxiety associated condition previously episode hesitate recount episode although retain ability psychologically person macropsia may feel separation dissociation outside world even immediate family feeling dissociation mostly noted child adolescent patients patient may feel must unfairly contend hostile aggressive forces due gigantic nature surrounding defense said forces usually expressed verbally patient may falsely present outgoing flamboyant persona remaining fearful people internally attempt balance size distortion may try make others feel small size insult hostile behavior psychological impact macropsia longtime people condition since childhood may greater lead severe alternative interpretation condition macropsia response biophysiological contraction psychological roots thus patient reaches enlarged object overcoming physiological however theory much scrutinycitation needed cases macropsia affects one eye resulting differences way two eyes perceive size shape images condition known aniseikonia known associated certain retinal conditions epiretinal membrane found cause metamorphopsia vitreomacular traction caused excessive adhesion vitreous fluid retina related aniseikonia due separation compression photoreceptor macular surgical reattachment maculaoff rhegmatogenous retinal also cause increased separation macular photoreceptor cells resulting dysmetropsia retinoschisis another eye disease shown cause evidence lesion appearing posterior area ventral occipitotemporal visual pathway cause macropsia lesion due ischemic cell death acute posterior cerebral prevalent research prescription drugs side effects macropsia deals zolpidem citalopram zolpidem drug prescribed insomnia although proven beneficial effects numerous reported cases adverse perceptual one cases

woman experienced macropsia first administration mg citalopram zolpidem immediate discontinuation citalopram episodes suggestions visual distortions macropsia associated cocaine episodes temporary druginduced macropsia subside chemicals leave bodycitation needed past research linked macropsia migraine one studies conducted japanese adolescents reported visual episodic illusions macropsia showed illusions three times likely occur association migraine illusions prevalent among girls ages unlikely macropsia japanese adolescents could due epileptic seizure since japanese adolescents evidence drugs found eliminates possibility macropsia adolescents druginduced also unlikely macropsia adolescent children associated serious usually macropsia visual disturbance precedes painful migrainous headaches episodes macropsia occur part aura migraine episodes often brief lasting minutes adolescents deemed multiple distortions per episode slow motion vision macropsia even likely people macropsia episodes associated migraine typically equivalent duration aura range moments minutes nonmigrainous headaches known associated episodic even absence migraine fever hypnogogic state provoke visual illusions one might claim macropsia person macropsia may fail see connection migraine macropsia since conditions may elicit symptoms time pathophysiology condition fully understood timing episodic occurrences headaches suggests connection macropsia vasoconstrictive phase differences visual phenomena macropsia slow motion versus macropsia without slow motion may result different areas brain affected macropsia may present symptom frontal lobe epilepsy temporal lobe epilepsy may actually help diagnosis diseases children experience nocturnal hallucinations accompanied macropsia may seek medical care panic attack disorders instead diagnosed forms epilepsy epilepsy patients may memory seizure remember hallucinations aura proceed attack electroencephalography eeg imaging utilized patient experiences episode may subsequently concluded eeg congruent temporal frontal lobe anxiety headaches accompany episodes visual distortion associated epilepsy valproic acid used treat type antiseizure medications appropriate focalonset seizures like oxcarbazapine also used successfully treatment epilepsyrelated macropsiacitation needed endogenous hypoglycaemia result number visual disturbances sometimes macropsia kind hypoglycaemia defined abnormally low bloodsugar level due anything exogenous administration macropsia observed experimental hypoglycaemia patients receiving insulin patients epsteinbarr virus infectious mononucleosis cited increase sizes perceived objects coinciding symptoms alice wonderland additionally observed epsteinbarr patients cite hallucinations display abnormal mri scans mri may show swelling cerebral cortex transient prolongation transient lesions unlike mris abnormalities reported ct scans thus recommended epsteinbarr patient cites visual hallucinations mri macropsia may appear either onset resolution clinical symptoms associated duration disturbances shown range two weeks seven almost patients macropsia due infectious mononucleosis make full recoveries patients coxsackievirus reported numerous symptoms alice wonderland syndrome common macropsia macropsia may result optical magnification differences eyes retinal receptor cortical processing sampled current hypothesis occurrence dysmetropsia due stretching compression retina leading displacement receptors macropsia arises compressed receptor distribution leading larger perceived image size conversely micropsia results stretching retina leading sparse receptor distribution gives smaller perceived image size case macropsia greater density photoreceptor cells leads greater stimulation making object seem cases effects macropsia shown field dependent degree visual distortion related visual field angle nonuniform stretching compression receptor distribution could explain field dependency macropsia compression forces closer fovea resulting compression would cause greater amount macropsia lower field angles little effect higher field angles receptor distribution alterations receptor distribution result epiretinal membrane neuroretina detachment andor reattachment retinoschisis macropsia caused surgical reattachment maculaoff rhegmatogenous retinal detachment symmetrical around fovea resulting differences size changes horizontal vertical asymmetry also observed retinoschisis macropsia generally results vertical direction micropsia presents horizontal
