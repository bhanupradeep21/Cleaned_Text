giant caenagnathids elements like dentary probably fused together symphysis ie left right sides cartilaginously fused together union hatching retained consistent size relative skull elements growth individual although genera feature different mandibletofemur length ratios approximately beibeilong vs gigantoraptor indicating differences relative skull sizes likely result respective growth shuo wang colleagues concluded caenagnathids experienced dietary shift aged based several features dentaries lateral occlusal grooves ridges occlusal surfaces interpreted vestigial tooth sockets according team juvenile caenagnathids teeth progressively lost growth noting perinate baby louie specimen beibeilong lacks features dentary despite young age wang team suggested three scenarios explain lack vestigial alveoli beibeilong taxon may strictly edentulous teeth indeed present beibeilong lost eruption null generation teeth teeth erupted later lost much higher rate beibeilong caenagnathids thus team concluded vestigial tooth structures preserved mature gregory f funston colleagues rejected wang colleagues hypothesis argued phylogeny caenagnathidae along primitive oviraptorosaurs avimimus implies simple dentaries lacking complex structures vestigial alveoli ancestral condition caenagnathids also rejected second scenario proposed wang colleagues would require slowdown development horny beak would turn require caenagnathids reacquire functional teeth edentulous ancestor teeth would offer adaptive benefit lastly funston team rejected third scenario given similar beibeilong represents
