collected late triassic carnian ischigualasto formation ischigualastovilla unión basin northwestern argentina deposited around million years ago fossil material termed holotype specimen pvl venaticosuchus incorporated myriad features present two genera ornithosuchids ornithosuchus riojasuchus however also several unique traits relating lower reconstructions jaw musculature venaticosuchus showed slow strong bite similar herbivorous aetosaurs desmatosuchus venaticosuchus ornithosuchids likely specialized scavengers due combinations features suggested ate meat poorly adapted dealing

estimated ornithosuchid jaw musculature using osteological correlates comparison modern reptiles caiman yacare iguana iguana found several interesting results surrounding jaw action venaticosuchus ornithosuchids aetosaurs modern crocodilians represented alligator mississippiensis example ornithosuchids aetosaurs taller skulls modern crocodilians creating longer vertically inclined moment arms adductor muscles ie distance jaw joint middle muscles pull jaw longer moment arms allow venaticosuchus highest value corresponding sum adductor muscle moment arms ornithosuchids though muscles lower

alligator also received substantial contributions mame mamp mi contributed large portion value aetosaurs aetosaurs also highest moment arm mandibular depressor muscle mdm lowers jaw venaticosuchus lowest value muscle followed ornithosuchus nevertheless ornithosuchid jaw musculature particularly venaticosuchus generally resembled aetosaurs modern considering distribution moment arms position teeth allowed von baczko estimate bite moment ease movement front rear jaw compare total bite moment value determine total bite force despite average bite moment high value venaticosuchus gave highest ratio bite moment corresponding highest bite force reptiles sampled however high value also means muscles would take longer retract giving fairly slow bite slow strong bite also shared ornithosuchids well aetosaur desmatosuchus contrasts weak fast bite carnivorous basal aetosaur neoaetosauroides fast moderately strong bite serrated teeth ornithosuchids indicates ate meat slow bite would disadvantageous catching small prey addition diastema ornithosuchids would weakened snout making susceptible damage large struggling prey thin teeth also structurally weak dealing large prey compared conical teeth modern crocodilians sturdy directions von baczko proposed ornithosuchids specialized scavengers could deal carcasses using strong bite force serrated teeth way slow bite speed weak snout structure disadvantageous would ornithosuchids active study biomechanical analysis found related riojasuchus poor resistance lateral forces greater resistance traction torsion forces noted short mandible shorter upper jaw typical ornithosuchids allow occlusion mandibular teeth premaxilla even maxillary posterior mandibular teeth occluded therefore generate sharp edge dental configuration seem suitable action grabbing slicing pieces meat carcass thus excluding scavenger lifestyle according new interpretation jaw mechanics compatible piscivorous lifestyle lifestyle dissimilar heron proposed
