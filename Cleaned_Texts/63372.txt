study evolution emotions dates back century evolution natural selection applied study human communication mainly charles darwin work expression emotions man darwin researched expression emotions effort support materialist theory unguided evolution proposed much like traits found animals emotions apparently also evolved adapted work looked facial expressions animals specifically humans attempted point parallels behaviors humans animals according evolutionary theory different emotions evolved different times primal emotions love fear associated ancient parts psyche social emotions guilt pride evolved among social primates evolutionary psychologists consider human emotions best adapted life ancestors led nomadic foraging bands darwins original plan include findings expression emotions chapter work descent man selection relation sex darwin found enough material whole book based observations around people many parts world one important observation made even individuals born blind body facial expressions displayed similar anyone else ideas found book universality emotions intended go sir charles bells human facial muscles created give unique ability express main purpose darwins work support theory evolution demonstrating emotions humans animals similar similarities found species closely related found similarities distantly related species well proposed idea emotional states adaptive therefore able express certain emotions passed work darwin proposed three principles first three principle serviceable habits defined certain habits perform different actions certain states mind get associated state mind induced even needed used example contracting eyebrows furrowing brow noted serviceable prevent much light entering eyes also said raising eyebrows serves increase field vision cited examples people attempting remember something raising brows though could see trying remember second principles antithesis habits serviceable darwin proposed actions habits carried merely opposite nature serviceable habit serviceable shrugging shoulders example darwin used antithesis service shoulder shrugging passive expression opposite confident aggressive third principles expressive habits nervous discharge nervous system principle proposes habits performed buildup nervous system causes discharge excitement examples include foot finger tapping well vocal expressions expressions anger darwin noted many animals rarely make noises even pain extreme circumstances vocalize response pain paul ekman noted field conducting research involving facial expressions emotions work provided data back darwins ideas universality facial expressions even across cultures conducted research showing photographs exhibiting expressions basic emotion people asking identify emotion expressed ekman wallace friesen presented people preliterate culture story involving certain emotion along photographs specific facial expressions photographs previously used studies using subjects western cultures asked choose two three photographs emotion expressed story preliterate subjects choices matched western subjects time results indicated certain expressions universally associated particular emotions even instances people little exposure western culture emotions preliterate people found hard distinguish fear ekman noted universal expressions necessarily prove darwins theory evolved provide strong evidence mentioned similarities human expressions primates well overall universality certain expressions back darwins ideas expressions emotion ekman noted universal based research anger fear disgust sadness common view facial expressions initially served noncommunicative adaptive function thus widened eyes facial expression fear shown increase visual field speed moving eyes helps finding following threats wrinkled nose mouth facial expression disgust limit intake foulsmelling possibly dangerous air particles later reactions could observed members group increasingly become distinctive exaggerated order fulfill primarily socially communicative function communicative function dramatically subtly influence behavior members group thus rhesus monkeys human infants learn fear potential dangers based facial expressions fear group members parents seeing fear expressions increases tendency flight responses seeing anger expressions increases tendency fight responses classical conditioning studies found easier create pairing negative stimulant angerfear expressions negative stimulant happiness expression crosscultural studies studies congenitally blind found groups display expressions shame pride situations related social status expressions clear similarities displays submission dominance primates humans viewing expression pride automatically assign higher social status individuals expressing robert zajonc published two reviews facial efference theory emotion also known facial feedback first introduced scientific literature article published science theory proposes facial musculature mammals control temperature base brain particular hypothalamus varying degree forward backward flow vascular network socalled rete mirabile theory based idea increasing temperature portions hypothalamus produce aggressive behavior whereas cooling produce relaxation emotional language comparable descriptors hothead coolbreezy theory offers explanation evolution common facial expressions emotion mammals little experimental work done extend theory however carroll izard discussed gains losses associated evolution emotions said discrete emotion experiences emerge ontogeny language conceptual structures frame qualia known discrete emotion feelings acquired noted evolution humans gained capability expressing language contributed greatly emotional evolution humans articulate share emotions use experiences foresee take appropriate action future experiences however raise question whether humans lost empathy one another citing things murder crime one another joseph ledoux focuses much research emotion fear fear evoked two systems brain involving thalamus amygdala one old short fast recently evolved circuitous slower older system sensory information travels directly quickly thalamus amygdala elicits autonomic motor responses call fear younger system sensory information travels thalamus relevant cortical sensory areas touch somatosensory cortex vision visual cortex etc frontal association areas appraisal occurs frontal areas communicate directly amygdala light appraisal may reduce magnify amygdalas fear response glimpse
