sexy son hypothesis evolutionary biology sexual selection proposed patrick j weatherhead raleigh j robertson queens university kingston ontario states females ideal mate choice among potential mates one whose genes produce males best chance reproductive success implies benefits father offer mother offspring less relevant may appear including capacity parental caregiver territory nuptial gifts fishers principle means sex ratio except certain eusocial insects always near males females yet matters sexy sons future breeding successes likely promiscuous father creating large numbers offspring carrying copies needed sexual selection hypothesis researched species european pied female mating preferences widely recognized responsible rapid divergent evolution male secondary sex ronald fisher granted taste preference prevails among females species males grow elaborate beautiful tail feathers question must answered females taste use species select seemingly useless ornament first step solution lies fact success animal struggle existence measured number offspring produces rears also probable success offspring selecting mate number different competitors important select one likely produce successful prior weatherhead robertsons richard dawkins written book selfish gene society males compete chosen hemen females one best things mother genes make son turn turn attractive heman ensure son one fortunate males wins copulations society grows enormous number grandchildren result one desirable qualities male eyes female quite simply sexual attractiveness ronald fishers principle published book genetical theory natural selection one several possible explanations highly diverse often astonishing ornaments females choose physically attractive males tend get physically attractive sons thus grandchildren choosy females prefer attractive sexy sons theory function regardless physical behavioral trait female chooses long heritable trait varies individuals population possessing trait makes males attractive qualities trait preference becomes established females choosing males elaborate secondary sexual traits produce sons carry alleles trait produce daughters carry alleles preference generating genetic coupling drive selfreinforcing coevolution trait preference due mating advantage males trait creating fisherian runaway sexy sons similar models proposed postcopulatory female preferences time females removed males sperm ampulla mating sexual selection direct andor indirect benefits well sexual conflict determine evolution animal mating original context narrowsense sexy son hypothesis weatherhead robertson refers mating systems care parents mating systems females mate polygynous male normally receive less assistance females mated monogamous thus suffer direct fitness consequences least compensated breeding successes sexy sons hand broadsense sexy son hypothesis encompasses polygyny promiscuous mating systems without care parents alatalo argues costs additional choice may minor female choice honestly signaling males good genes may evolve even indirect benefits offspring quality small similar argument made sexy son hypothesis mates attractive males suffer direct fitness sexual conflict refers conflicting goals breeding males females describes diverging interests males females optimizing fitness viewpoint one partner best outcome would partners mate care young thus freeing resources eg time energy typically invest sex may create additional offspring polygynous mating systems sexual conflict means optimization male reproductive success mated multiple females even though reproductive success polygynously mated female thereby case guianan cockoftherocks whose male members spend majority time energy maintaining plumage attempting seek matings females hand spend time building maintaining nest lay eggs raise young good genes theory proposes females select males seen genetic advantages increase offspring quality increased viability offspring provides compensation lower reproductive success results picky goodgene hypothesis polyandry proposes females encounter better males previous mates remate order fertilize eggs better males dung beetles selected mates better genetics tend offspring survive longer able reproduce pick mates genetic quality suggests carefully choosing mate another study notes pronghorn females engage obvious energetically expensive mate sampling process identify vigorous males though female selects independently outcome small proportion herds males sire young offspring attractive males likely survive weaning age classes late years apparently due faster growth pronghorn males costly ornaments authors conclude female choice good genes exist absence obvious sexual selection cues elaborate antlers sexy son hypothesis closely related good genes assumption fisherian runaway selection process like good genes sexy son hypothesis assumes existence indirect genetic benefits able compensate inferior direct reproductive success ie fewer offspring main difference good genes sexy son hypothesis latter assumes indirect effect due attractiveness sons whereas good genes focus viability sons daughters however attractiveness narrowly defined refer every trait increases males probability become polygynous goodsperm models predict positive genetic associations males sperm competitiveness general viability whereas sexysperm models predict multiplemating females produce precopulatory processes postcopulatory models predict trait males determines fertilization success become genetically
