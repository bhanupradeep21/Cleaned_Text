furosemide loop diuretic medication used treat edema due heart failure liver scarring kidney many trade names including discoid frusemide lasix uremide furosemide may also used treatment high blood taken intravenously given intravenously furosemide typically takes effect within five minutes taken orally typically metabolizes within common side effects include orthostatic hypotension decrease blood pressure standing associated lightheadedness tinnitus ringing ears photosensitivity sensitivity potentially serious side effects include electrolyte abnormalities low blood pressure hearing recommended serum electrolytes especially potassium serum creatinine bun levels monitored people taking furosemide well monitoring liver kidney functioning also recommended alert occurrence potential blood furosemide type loop diuretic works decreasing reabsorption sodium common side effects furosemide injection include hypokalemia low potassium level hypotension low blood pressure furosemide patented approved medical use world health organizations list essential united states available generic nineteenth commonly prescribed medication united states million twentieth prescribed medication

also kidney heart often viewed firstline agent people edema caused congestive heart failure antivasoconstrictor diuretic compared furosemide however torasemide aka torsemide demonstrated show improvements heart failure symptoms possibly lowering rates rehospitalisation associated heart failure difference risk death torsemide may also safer providing selfadministered subcutaneous furosemide found reduce hospital admissions people heart failure resulting significant savings healthcare furosemide also used liver cirrhosis kidney impairment nephrotic syndrome adjunct therapy swelling brain lungs rapid diuresis required iv injection management severe hypercalcemia combination adequate chronic kidney diseases hypoalbuminemia furosemide used along albumin increase also used along albumin nephrotic syndrome reduce furosemide mainly excreted tubular secretion kidney kidney impairment clearance reduced increasing risk adverse lower initial doses recommended older patients minimize sideeffects high doses may needed kidney also cause kidney damage mainly loss excessive fluid ie dehydration usually reversiblecitation needed furosemide acts within hour oral administration iv injection peak effect within minutes diuresis usually complete within hours oral administration significant variation furosemide also lead gout caused hyperuricemia hyperglycemia also common side tendency loop diuretics cause low serum potassium concentration hypokalemia given rise combination products either potassium potassiumsparing diuretic amiloride coamilofruse electrolyte abnormalities result furosemide use include hyponatremia hypochloremia hypomagnesemia treatment heart failure many studies shown longterm use furosemide cause varying degrees thiamine deficiency thiamine supplementation also furosemide known ototoxic agent generally causing transient hearing loss permanent reported cases furosemide induced hearing loss appeared associated rapid intravenous administration high dosages concomitant renal disease coadministration ototoxic however recently reported longitudinal study showed participants treated loop diuretics years likely develop hearing loss likely progressive hearing loss compared participants use loop suggests longterm consequences loop diuretics hearing could significant previously thought research required area precautions
