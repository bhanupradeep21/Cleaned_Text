mechanistic models niche apportionment biological models used explain relative species abundance distributions niche apportionment models describe species break resource pool multidimensional space determining distribution abundances individuals among species relative abundances species usually expressed whittaker plot rank abundance plot species ranked number individuals xaxis plotted log relative abundance species yaxis relative abundance measured relative number individuals within species relative biomass individuals within species niche apportionment models developed ecologists sought biological explanations relative species abundance distributions macarthur one earliest express dissatisfaction purely statistical models presenting instead mechanistic niche apportionment

beetles hymenopteran parasites plankton assemblages salt marsh grass mechanistic models describe plots work assumption rank abundance plots based rigorous estimate abundances individuals within species measures represent actual species abundance distribution furthermore whether using number individuals abundance measure biomass individuals models assume quantity directly proportional size niche occupied organism one suggestion abundance measured numbers individuals may exhibit lower variances using biomass thus studies using abundance proxy niche allocation may overestimate evenness community happens clear distinction relationship body size abundance ecology resource use often studies fail incorporate size structure biomass estimates measures actual abundance measure create
