ursodoxicoltaurine international nonproprietary name inn pharmaceutical form tauroursodeoxycholic acid tudca also known taurursodiol tauroursodeoxycholic acid naturally occurring hydrophilic bile acid taurine conjugated form ursodeoxycholic acid udca humans trace amounts tauroursodeoxycholic acid bears large amounts tauroursodeoxycholic acid ursodeoxycholic acid bile acids naturally synthesized cholesterol liver conjugated specific aminoacids specifically taurine bear bile contains several bile acids including taurochenodeoxycholic acid ursodeoxycholic acid chenodeoxycholic udca taurine
