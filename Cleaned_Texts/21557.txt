romundina small heavily armored extinct genus acanthothoracid placoderms lived shallow marine environments early devonian name romundina honors canadian geologist paleontologist dr rómundur raymond thorsteinsson calgary alberta canada romundina believed lived earth million years ago closest known relative romundina acanthothoracid type described species r stellina first specimen romundina originally discovered swedish paleontologist tor ørvig prince wales island nunavut formation geologically dates back one known species romundina discovered named romundina stellina ørvig species name stellina refers stellate derived latin word stella meaning star tubercles placoderm ornamenting dermal romundina stellina one earliest known acanthothoraciforms discovered recently romundina stellina heavily researched shows signs extremely primitive teeth structurally share characteristics dermal tubercles teeth modern fossil although romundina known relatively small especially compared large predatory placoderms time still thought carnivorous due toothlike structures gnathal supragnathal romundina shares many characteristics cyclostomes gnathostomes varying degrees reinforces hypothesis placoderms grade features closely related cyclostomes placoderms features much closely related crown group romundina currently understood first placoderm develop primitive toothlike structures originally teeth thought arise following placodermi prior crown gnathostomata however recent research suggests teeth may arisen derived placoderms currentlywhen much debate surrounding whether toothlike structures well gnathal plates sit seen true primitive condition gnathostome dentition researchers see toothlike structures extensions primitive crushing plate common primitive toothlike structures lie supragnathal plates multicuspid appearance suggesting degree toothtotooth occlusion occurred additionally synchrotron radiation xray tomographic microscopy reveals toothlike tubercle structures likely consist dentine based core enameloid cap common many extant fish groups however lack internal presence enameloid cap suggests romundina either closely related crown gnathostomata feature arose convergent evolution later lost romundinas dental tubercles lack apparent organization primitive feature found cyclostomes suggesting organized tooth rows evolved prior evolution first supragnathal plates toothlike tubercles sit ovalshaped flat relatively symmetrical suggests tubercles added radially episodically margins gnathal plates around central large pioneer tubercles added gnathal plates thickened leading presence growth rest lines gnathal plates consist three layers superficial containing marginal toothlike tubercles medial layer containing structures containing vascularization basal lamellar furthermore romundinas tubercle structures gnathal plates suggest teeth evolved external epithelial structure moved internal rather nonskeletal antecedent organ system likely coming stellate tubercles dermal skull romundina consists thin proportional dermal bones heavily ornamented mesodentine rich stellate star shaped tubercles stellate tubercles likely grew top two three furthermore tubercles exhibit rough ridges radiation apex contrast species smooth ridged stellate tubercles radotina stellate tubercles likely used form protection additionally romundina stellina one dermal cheek element suborbital plate species placoderms radotina multiple dermal cheek elements suggests romundina lost submarginal plates postsuborbital seen earlier vertebrates additional feature distinguishes romundina previous placoderms absence tesserae type mineralized tile dermal bones roof skull dermal bones roof romundinas skull fused anatomy romundina nasal capsule combines characteristics jawless cyclostomata jawed gnathostomes previous discovery romundina appeared large jump cranial features two extant taxa apparent prominent bridge features positioning nasal capsule dorsally eyes feature present early mid cyclostomes lack nasal capsule instead nasohypophysial opening gnathostomes anterior nasal romundina shown unambiguously jaw however cranial anatomy proportions brain closely aligned jawless analysis cranial structure reveals romundina large precerebral region broad suborbital shelves small potentially non existent telencephalon furthermore romundina large protruding bony upper lip begins anteriorly nasal capsule romundina stellina relatively small body length cm cranial portion romundinas body likely heavily armored stellate tubercles similarly lies dermal plates skull caudal sections romundinas body likely flexible allowing entirety romundina likely covered irregularly shaped dermal scales characteristic unlike symmetrical scales appear additionally romundina likely vascular spine grew posteriorly proximally cranial side spine posterior head spine likely played heavily defensive role grew similarly scales grow furthermore defensive spine made semidentine odontodes dermal bone perichondral bone suggesting derived dermal romundina small placoderms therefore rely heavily armored skull anterior sections body fend larger fish present corals shallow water organisms also found alongside romundina formation prince wales island suggesting lived relatively shallow small size also consistent shallow water research suggests romundina also ate mostly invertebrates crustaceans worms romundinas large crushing toothlike structures well large gnathal plates would appear useful eating organisms hard shells romundina likely migrate swim long distances known specimens found relatively small range area prince wales island lack geographical range also suggests romundina lived highly specialized overall relatively little research done paleobiology romundina discovered norwegian paleontologist named tor ørvig fossil discovered rocks collected geologist dr rómundur thorsteinsson later given ørvig search fossils dr thorsteinsson pioneer geology canadian arctic working institute sedimentary petroleum geology dr thorsteinsson came across formation dated back gedinnian age significant amounts vertebrate invertebrate fossils located western part prince wales island canadian rock sample given tor ørvig study romundina discovered thick layer taken middle long section unnamed carbonate rocks locality ørvig prepared specimen using combination formic acetic acid eat away rocks leaving fully preserved threedimensional romundina specimen initially discovered consisted head mostly complete dermal skullroof associated endocranial elements lacked body segments additional bony plates discovered rock however impossible confirm came currently commonly cited romundina specimen specimen originally discovered ørvig preserved threedimensionally specimen encased limestone eaten away using formic acid solution allowing threedimensional analysis specimen well known specimens kept national museum natural history paris commonly referred researched specimens include found formation prince wales island romundina specimens found near stream unnamed formation carbonate rocks western side prince wales island canadian arctic archipelago species found formation include additional arthrodiraes althaspis dinaspidella pinnaspis traquairaspis gastropods cephalopods well fossil evidence colonial solitary suggests geological environment likely shallow water tidal throughout island fossils recovered range period late silurian late land makes prince wales island would located close equator silurian additionally average water temperature would around suggesting romundina tended live relatively warm waters compared average water temperature major geological formations namely reed bay peel sound formations lie eastern side island similar fossilized organisms unnamed formations islands west region first romundina specimen found lying beside westernmost stretches peel sound formation rock dates lochkovian age silurian period majority island including location fossils discovered consists mainly limestone andor dolomite rocky material first romundina specimen found western stretches peel sound formation highest carbonrich dolomite formation composed northtrending strata graded grade likely due uplifting rocks lower paleozoic precambrian eras exists eastern side island rocks move westward across island sedimentary rock eroded away revealing fossils silurian silurian eastern additionally erosion sedimentary rock moves towards west leading higher percentage rock dolomite compared eastern side formation explains discrepancy rock composition across romundina commonly characterized middle placoderm grade much structural analysis romundina reinforces hypothesis placoderms grade rather clade share characteristics crown cyclostomes crown structural analysis possible tooth like structures tends place romundina close crown gnathostomes looking skull body structures place romundina centrally among placoderm location nasal capsule skull widely agreed upon definitive feature shared among romundina stellina specimens yet variations among placoderm grade whole hence used
