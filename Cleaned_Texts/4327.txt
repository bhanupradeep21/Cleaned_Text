alternating hemiplegia also known crossed hemiplegia form hemiplegia ipsilateral cranial nerve palsies contralateral hemiplegia hemiparesis extremities body disorder characterized recurrent episodes paralysis one side multiple forms alternating hemiplegia webers syndrome middle alternating hemiplegia inferior alternating hemiplegia type syndrome result unilateral lesion brainstem affecting upper motor neurons lower motor neurons muscles would receive signals damaged upper motor neurons result spastic paralysis lesion brainstem affects majority limb trunk muscles contralateral side due upper motor neurons decussation brainstem cranial nerves cranial nerve nuclei also located brainstem making susceptible damage brainstem lesion cranial nerves iii oculomotor vi abducens xii hypoglossal often associated syndrome given close proximity pyramidal tract location upper motor neurons way spinal cord damages structures produce ipsilateral presentation paralysis palsy due lack cranial nerve decussation aside trochlear nerve innervating target muscles paralysis may brief may last several days many times episodes resolve sleep common symptoms alternating hemiplegia mental impairment gait balance difficulties excessive sweating changes body superior alternating hemiplegia also known weber syndrome distinct symptoms contralateral hemiparesis limb facial muscle accompanied weakness one muscles control eye movement another symptom appears loss eye movement due damage oculomotor nerve fibers upper lower extremities increased middle alternating hemiplegia also known foville syndrome typically constitutes weakness extremities accompanied paralysis extraocular muscle specifically lateral rectus opposite side affected extremities indicates lesion caudal medial pons involving abducens nerve root controls movement eye corticospinal fibers carries motor commands brain spinal inferior alternating hemiplegia also known medial medullary syndrome typically involves weakness extremities accompanied paralysis muscles ipsilateral side tongue seen deviation tongue side protrusion symptoms indicate lesion medulla involving corticospinal fibers pyramid exiting hypoglossal nerve note description focused alternating hemiplegia childhood similar syndromes may develop following brainstem infarction cause alternating hemiplegia childhood mutation gene study fifteen female nine male patients alternating hemiplegia mutation gene present three patients showed heterozygous denovo missense mutation six patients found denovo missense mutation one patient identified denovo splice site de novo mutation mutation occurs germ cell one parent neither parent mutation passed child sperm diagnostic test alternating hemiplegia makes difficult diagnose also alternating hemiplegia extremely rare frequently missed patient often misdiagnosed proper diagnosis however critical early treatment disorder many criteria help proper general diagnosis alternating hemiplegiacitation needed first symptoms must observed patient months age second must frequent episodes hemiplegia involving either side body third paroxysmal disorders including tonic attacks dystonia nystagmus strabismus dyspnoea uncontrollable disorders noticed occur although common paroxysmal disorders involving eye nystagmus strabismus may apparent older children may remembered childhood lack symptoms rule alternating hemiplegia fourth symptoms clear directly falling asleep usually come back waking attack occurrence indicative alternating hemiplegia display usually diagnosed probable alternating hemiplegia fifth indications developmental delays learning disability neurological irregularities present issues may obvious young patients however appears almost older final criteria diagnosis alternating hemiplegia made symptoms must due another disorder symptoms attributed another disease disorder definitive diagnosis difficult webers syndrome form alternating hemiplegia somewhat easy diagnose beyond general criteria although webers syndrome rare child born disorder typically portwine stain face around eye portwine stain necessarily mean child webers syndrome portwine stain involves ophthalmic division trigeminal nerve likelihood webers syndrome greatly increases portwine stain around eye found patient screened intracranial leptomeningeal angiomatosis magnetic resonance imaging mri used determine presence severity computed cranial tomography used determine effect mri preferred diagnostic test children presenting portwine stain imaging techniques used addition determine severity disorder initial diagnosis made based presence neurologic ophthalmic disease disease progresses differently patient initial diagnosis patient monitored frequently order handle complications resulting medical treatment hemiplegia separate several different seizure trigger include exposure cold emotional stress fatigue bathing hyperthermiahypothermia upper respiratory infection drug called flunarizine calcium channel blocker help reduce severity length attacks many children affected alternating hemiplegia also epilepsy seizures may occur attack often occur attacks antiepilepsy drugs given prevent lessen seizures drugs often dont work severe side effects require patient discontinue use flunarizine blocks calcium channels antiepilepsy drugs used patients shown shorten duration attacks well reducing severity attacks flunarizine stop attacks common drug prescribed treat alternating sleep also used management technique early indication episode tiredness medication melatonin buccal midazolam administered induce sleep avoid episode people alternating hemiplegia often underweight help dietitians meal plan developed times attack consumption food may
