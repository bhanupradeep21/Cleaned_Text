visual agnosia impairment recognition visually presented objects due deficit vision acuity visual field scanning language memory cortical blindness results lesions primary visual cortex visual agnosia often due damage anterior cortex posterior occipital andor temporal lobes two types visual agnosia apperceptive agnosia associative agnosia recognition visual objects occurs two primary levels apperceptive level features visual information retina put together form perceptual representation object associative level meaning object attached perceptual representation object person unable recognize objects perceive correct forms objects although knowledge objects intact ie anomia apperceptive agnosia person correctly perceives forms knowledge objects identify objects associative cases visual agnosia seen older adults experienced extensive brain damage also cases young children less brain damage developmental years acquiring commonly visual agnosia presents inability recognize object absence explanations blindness partial blindness anomia memory loss etc common manifestations visual agnosia generally tested include difficulty identifying objects look similar shape difficulty identifying line drawings objects recognizing objects shown less common views horse topdown within given patient variety symptoms occur impairment ability binary range severity example patient sm prosopagnosic unilateral lesion left extrastriate cortex due accident twenties displays behavior similar congenital although recognize facial features emotions indeed sometimes uses standout feature recognize face face recognition almost impossible purely visual stimuli even faces friends family disorder also affects memory faces storing new memories faces recalling stored nevertheless important note reach symptoms domains sms object recognition similarly impaired though entirely given line drawings identify able give names objects properties similar drawing implying able see features drawing similarly copying line drawing beach scene led simplified version drawing though main features accounted recognition places still impaired familiar places remembered new places stored visual agnosia occurs damage visual association cortex parts ventral stream vision known pathway vision role object occurs even damage done eyes optic tract leads visual information brain fact visual agnosia occurs symptoms explained damage damage specific areas ventral stream impair ability recognize certain categories visual information case patients visual agnosia generally damage dorsal stream vision known pathway vision role determining objects position space allowing individuals visual agnosia show relatively normal visually guided example patient df lesions ventral surface gave apperceptive one tasks tested required place card thin slot could rotated orientations apperceptive agnosic would expected since recognize slot able correctly place card slot indeed asked give direction slot responses better chance yet asked place card slot success almost level controls implies event ventral stream deficit dorsal stream help processing special information aid movement regardless object specifically lateral occipital complex appears respond many different types prosopagnosia inability recognize faces due damage fusiform face area ffa area fusiform gyrus temporal lobe strongly associated role facial however area exclusive faces recognition objects expertise also processed area extrastriate body cortex eba found activated photographs silhouettes stick drawings human parahippocampal place area ppa limbic cortex found activated sight scenes cerebral achromatopsia inability discriminate different hues caused damage area visual association left hemisphere seems play critical role recognizing meaning common broadly visual agnosia divided apperceptive associative visual apperceptive agnosia failure object recognition even basic visual functions acuity color motion mental processing language intelligence brain must correctly integrate features edges light intensity color sensory information form complete percept object failure occurs process percept object fully formed thus tasks requiring copying matching drawing simple figures distinguish individuals apperceptive agnosia perform taskscitation needed associative agnosia inability identify objects even apparent perception knowledge involves higher level processing apperceptive individuals associative agnosia copy match simple figures indicating perceive objects correctly also display knowledge objects tested tactile verbal information however tested visually name describe common means impairment associating perception objects stored knowledge themcitation needed although visual agnosia general exist many variants impair recognition specific types variants visual agnosia include prosopagnosia inability recognize faces pure word blindness inability recognize words often called agnosic alexia pure alexia agnosias colors inability differentiate colors agnosias environment inability recognize landmarks difficulty spatial layout environment ie topographagnosia simultanagnosia inability sort multiple objects visual two main categories visual agnosia patient ck born england emigrated canada january ck sustained head injury motor vehicle accident jog following accident ck experienced many cognitive issues mood swings poor memory temper outbursts ck also motor weakness left side left homonymous hemianopia recovered well retaining normal intelligence normal visual acuity able complete masters degree history later working manager large corporation although recovery successful areas cognition ck still struggles make sense visual magnetic resonance imaging mri showed bilateral thinning cks occipital lobe resulted associative visual patients visual agnosia unable identify visually presented objects identify objects modalities touch presented visually unable associative agnosic patients create detailed representation visual world brains perceive elements whole also form associations objects assign meaning ck makes many mistakes trying identify objects example called abacus skewers kebab badminton racquet fencers mask dart feather duster protractor mistaken cockpit despite impairment visual object recognition ck retained many abilities drawing visual imagery internal imagery native england tasked drawing england marking london born accurate drawing england one example excellent drawing aforementioned ck able identify parts objects generate whole representation surprising visual imagery object size shape color intact example shown picture animal correctly answer questions ears tail long short correctly identify colors example inside

identify object heart picturing transformation patient ck provided evidence double dissociation face processing visual object processing patients prosopagnosia damage fusiform face area ffa unable recognize upright faces ck difficulty face processing matches performance controls tasked identifying upright famous faces shown inverted faces famous people ck performs significantly worse controls processing inverted faces involves piecemeal strategy cks performance compared patients prosopagnosia impaired face processing perform well identifying inverted faces first evidence double
