dna adenine methyltransferase identification often abbreviated molecular biology protocol used map binding sites dna chromatinbinding proteins eukaryotes damid identifies binding sites expressing proposed dnabinding protein fusion protein dna methyltransferase binding protein interest dna localizes methyltransferase region binding site adenine methylation occur naturally eukaryotes therefore adenine methylation region concluded caused fusion protein implying region located near binding site damid alternate method chiponchip product addition methyl group position adenine modified nucleotide absent vast majority eukaryotes exception c widespread bacterial part restriction modification dna repair systems escherichia coli adenine methylation catalyzed adenine methyltransferase dam dna adenine methyltransferase catalyses adenine methylation exclusively palindromic sequence gatc ectopic expression dam eukaryotic cells leads methylation adenine gatc sequences without noticeable side effect based damid consists fusing dam protein interest usually protein interacts dna transcription factors chromatin component protein interest thus targets dam cognate vivo binding

matching adaptors carried leading specific amplification genomic fragments flanked methylated gatcs chromatin immunoprecipitation chip alternative method assay protein binding specific loci genome unlike chip damid require specific antibody protein interest one hand allows map proteins antibody available hand makes impossible specifically map posttranslationally modified proteins another fundamental difference chip assays protein interests given time whereas damid assays reason stays dna dam fusion protein goes away proteins either bound unbound target sites change big picture however lead strong differences case proteins slide along dna eg rna polymerase depending experiment carried damid subject plasmid methylation biases plasmids usually amplified e coli dam naturally expressed
