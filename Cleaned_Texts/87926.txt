eurycephalosuchus extinct genus orientalosuchine alligatoroid late cretaceous jiangxi province china known well preserved skull mandible alongside various postcranial remains eurycephalosuchus possessed short broad skull short skulltable eurycephalosuchus lived least one crocodilian indetermined member clade brevirostres genus monotypic containing species eurycephalosuchus eurycephalosuchus

late cretaceous hekou formation possibly correlating maastrichtian age block contained nearly complete skull attached mandible vertebrae axis ribs partial front limb several osteoderms together designated specimen ivpp v forms holotype genus compression affected skull preservation pushing parts frontal prefrontal bones rear edge nasal bone locality also yielded shoulder blade articulated coracoid thought belong another type crocodile described member brevirostres notably bigger eurycephalosuchus name eurycephalosuchus composite word greek eurys meaning wide broad kephalos meaning head suchus derived egyptian crocodile god sobek species name hand specifically points gannan another name ganzhou material eurycephalosuchus small medium sized alligatoroid incredibly broad short head almost wide long fossil skull measures cm dorsal cranial length meaning measured tip snout rear end skulltable accounting slight compression fossil underwent fully intact skull would likely measure cm approximately maximum across quadratojugals measuring tip snout end quadrate condyle would render skull slightly longer wide parts skull likewise show bizarre proportions snout short cm long thus making less half total skull length skulltable typically shorter wide crocodilians takes condition extreme length element two thirds smaller width external nares damaged towards front meaning uncertain whether form singular confluent opening assuming condition similar orientalosuchus confluent opening would wider long eyesockets heavily distorted clearly bigger triangular supratemporal

short spine runs almost parallel rear edge infratemporal resembling alligatoroids like brachychampsa differing orientalosuchines mandible shows great increase depth towards back skull starting relatively shallow depth mm position fourth dentary tooth increasing depth mm around mandibular fenestra means mandible increases depth three times number measured shallowest point dentary bone reaches greatest breadth position dentary tooth symphysis extends surangular bone interlocks dentary towards forming two processes nearly equal length surrangular thickens towards back tapering contributes retroarticular process almost reaching end angular bone also reaches greatest depth around mandibular fenestra tapering underlying dentary towards front tapering retroarticular process towards back viewed retroarticular process roughly triangular ballshaped end surface concave bears broad prominence however weakly developed premaxilla bears five teeth notably larger rest fourteen
