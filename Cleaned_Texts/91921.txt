incomplete degree variability occur members family documented many signs symptoms direct indirect consequences deficiency organized based types involvement transcription factor contains two zinc finger ie znf motifs cznf located toward proteins cterminus responsible binding specific dna sites nznf located toward proteins nterminus responsible interacting various nuclear proteins regulate activity transcription factor also contains two transactivation domains one negative regulatory domain interact nuclear proteins upregulate downregulate respectively promoting haematopoiesis ie maturation hematological immunological cells interacts transcription factors viz myb transcription factor cellular receptors viz mpl binds specific nucleic acid sequence viz tagataag promoter enhancer

target gene least five separate sites bind nuclear factors regulate expression one particularly important site located intron site termed kb enhancer located kilobases ie kb downstream genes transcript initiation site critically important enhancer genes regulation expression highly complex example hematological stem cells transcription factor binds one sites part functionally important positive feedback autoregulation circuit wherein transcription factor acts promote production second example positive feed back circuit stimulates production interleukin beta act indirectly simulate
