grainfed stereotypies defined repetitive invariant behaviour patterns obvious goal therefore cribbing windsucking one possible functions may inappropriate label stereotypy however causes resulting reinforcement behaviors probably multifactorial remain abnormal behaviors indicates husbandry changes needed animals exhibit cribbing windsucking study suggested ghrelin levels higher cribbiting horse perform cribbing also increased salivary however different study found relation salivary secretion reducing gastric meaning cribbing provide comfort ulcers rather stimulatedcaused several methods devised prevent cribbing behavior started however ethologists argued prevention behavior without addressing causes cure may result cribbing expressed modified form may interfere animals attempt adapt shown feeding cribbing horses antacid diet significantly reduce frequency current research indicates prevention cribbing related behavior based upon management conditions allow daily free movement feeding practices provide higher amounts roughage limited amounts growing body work suggests fat fiberbased diets may also result calmer patterns one study investigated effects providing feeder delivered small amounts concentrate feed activated animal feeder increased feeding time cribbers noncribbers however although feeder decreased cribbing increased feeder number traditional devices used minimize prevent cribbing windsucking however effectiveness methods arguable since address underlying causal behaviour stress related use cribbing collar may counterproductive would allow animal release stress hormones performing behaviour cribbing may beneficial reducing one method involves horse wearing collarlike device stops horse arching swelling neck suck air however one studies equipment showed although wearing collar hours reduced cribbing six eight horses collar removed cribbing returned greater levels authors concluded cribbing function preventing using anticribbing
