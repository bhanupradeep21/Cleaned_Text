evoked culture may well rest domain evolutionary psychology transmitted culture studied culture evolution social psychology disciplines differentiating two difficult may appear however example given level crosscultural variation human societies variation two cultures may result separate histories cultural evolutionary pathways different evoked cultures based different local environmental cues uniformity across cultures could result convergent cultural evolution similarly functioning psychological adaptations fessler et al specifically two cultures exhibit similar behaviors avoid pathogens one differentiate either two groups independently inventing similar behaviors groups displaying underlying psychological adaptation pathogen avoidance well issue behavioral variation transmitted culture may seen major point contention evolutionary psychology disciplines especially geneculture coevolution evolutionary psychology human behavioral ecology admit cultural transmission source behavioral variation see evolutionary process potential significantly affected human evolution geneculture coevolution would argue culture traits may altered genetic change selection pressures ultimately affecting cognition however brown et al stateswhether human behavioural ecologists evolutionary psychologists willing accommodate idea portion human behavioural diversity could result genetic differences arisen via selection pressures imposed socially transmitted behaviour remains seen may difficult evolutionary psychologists gangestad haselton buss argued future discipline rests unifying transmitted evoked culture order authors suggest comprehensive definition culture needs developed since different cultural phenomena need different kinds analysis investigate effects state culture however thing singularity umbrella concept subsuming collection extraordinarily varied phenomena requires scientific analysis gangestad et al ultimately issues behavioral variation evoked
