chainlike biological molecule protein nucleic acid structural motif common threedimensional structure appears variety different evolutionarily unrelated structural motif associated sequence motif represented different completely unrelated sequences different proteins rna depending upon sequence conditions nucleic acids form variety structural motifs thought biological significance proteins structural motif describes connectivity secondary structural elements individual motif usually consists elements eg helixturnhelix motif three note spatial sequence elements may identical instances motif may encoded order within underlying gene addition secondary structural elements protein structural motifs often include loops variable length unspecified structure structural motifs may also appear tandem repeats httpsenwikipediaorgwikistructuralmotif
