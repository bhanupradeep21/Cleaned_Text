ego depletion controversial idea selfcontrol willpower draws upon limited pool mental resources used word ego used psychoanalytic sense rather colloquial energy mental activity low selfcontrol typically impaired would considered state ego depletion particular experiencing state ego depletion impairs ability control oneself later depleting task requiring selfcontrol hindering effect subsequent selfcontrol task even tasks seemingly unrelated selfcontrol plays valuable role functioning self individualistic interpersonal levels ego depletion therefore critical topic experimental psychology specifically social psychology mechanism contributes understanding processes human selfcontrol studies validity egodepletion meta analyses studies questioned size existence ego depletion ultimate validity conclusions later studies universally agreed martin hagger nikos chatzisrantis whose metaanalysis seemed support existence ego depletion subsequently performed preregistered lab replication study find egodepletion american social psychologist roy baumeister colleagues proposed model described selfcontrol like muscle become strengthened fatigued researches proposed initial use muscle selfcontrol could cause decrease strength ego depletion subsequent tasks later experimental findings showed support muscle model selfcontrol ego key experiment baumeister ellen bratslavsky mark muraven dianne tice demonstrated first evidence ego depletion effects diverse contexts showed people initially resisted temptation chocolates subsequently less able persist difficult frustrating puzzle task attributed effect ego depletion resulted prior resisting tempting treat additionally demonstrated people voluntarily gave speech included beliefs contrary also less able persist difficult puzzle indicating state ego depletion effect nearly strong individuals given choice forced write counterattitudinal speech thus proposed act choice counterattitudinal behaviors draw upon pool limited resources giving counterattitudinal speech expected produce ego depletion introducing element choice increases level experienced depletion findings demonstrated effects ego depletion differential situations emphasized ego depletion may contextspecific experiment critical researchers synthesized ideas proposed prior studies suggested evidence strength model willpower study baumeister colleagues therefore provided first direct experimental evidence ego depletion initiated research interest subject role glucose specific form energy needed selfcontrol explored researchers glucose sugar found many foods primary fuel body brain multiple experiments connected selfcontrol depletion reduced blood glucose suggested selfcontrol performance could replenished consuming findings later however several recent experiments found resource depletion effects reversed simply tasting swallowing consuming sweet rewarding properties others suggested taste sugar artificial sweetener psychophysiological signaling experiment segertrom nes found hrv heart rate variability marker ego depletion well index selfcontrol power neural activity associated selfcontrol failure recently examined using neurophysiological techniques according cognitive neuroscientific models mental control conflictmonitoringerrordetection system identifies discrepancies intended goals actual

recordings inzlicht gutsell found individuals undergone emotionsuppression task displayed weaker ern signals compared individuals undergone emotionsuppression findings demonstrate preliminary evidence depletion experienced exerting selfcontrol weaken neural mechanisms responsible conflict monitoring majority ego depletion studies carried university students raises concerns generalizable results really effects age unknown maybe younger people susceptible effects ego depletion given areas brain involved selfcontrol continue develop mid example recent study found people age become ego depleted following typical depletion manipulation whereas younger university students ego depletion also implicated guilt prosocial behavior feeling guilt unpleasant necessary facilitate adaptive human experience guilt dependent ones ability reflect past actions behaviors ego depletion shown hinder ability engage reflection thereby making difficult experience since guilt typically leads prosocial behavior ego depletion therefore reduce good deeds often result guilty conscience study xu colleagues participants required suppress emotions watching movie butchering animals resulted depleted participants induced feel guilty playing game opponent player blasted loud unpleasant noises made errors end experiment participants given chance leave money subsequent participant also given choice making charitable donation measures prosocial behavior results study indicated people experienced ego depletion felt less guilty donated less money nondepleted people demonstrates ego depletion indirect effect prosocial behavior decreasing ones ability experience guilt individuals perceived level fatigue shown influence subsequent performance task requiring selfregulation independent actual state effect known illusory fatigue shown experiment participants engaged task either depleting nondepleting determined individuals true state depletion ultimately participants led believe level depletion lower true state depletion performed much worse difficult working memory task indicates increased perceived level fatigue hinder selfregulatory performance independent actual state depletion ego depletion shown rather debilitating consequences notably selfregulation impairments effects however temporarily buffered external motivations beliefs unlimited willpower example external motivator demonstrated boucher kofos depleted participants reminded money performed better subsequent selfcontrol experiment carol dweck subsequent work roy baumeister kathleen vohs shown beliefs unlimited selfcontrol helps mitigate ego depletion short long participants led believe get fatigued performed well second task fully depleted third state ego depletion individuals impaired ability selfregulate implicated wide range undesirable maladaptive behaviors acts aggression knowledge strategies counteract ego depletion would therefore highly beneficial various reallife situationscitation needed experiment performed kathleen vohs todd heatherton demonstrated ego depletion particularly relevant considering chronic dieters compared chronic dieters constantly work resisting cravings limiting food intake vohs heatherton showed task regulating food intake could undermined face tempting snacks especially individual experiencing state ego depletion dieters nondieters attempted suppress emotional responses watching movie afterwards participants required consume ice cream order engage tastetest major finding dieters suppressed emotional responses movie experienced ego depletion required suppress emotions additionally individuals subsequently ate much ice cream tastetesting task nondieters show selfregulatory failures dieters tasks therefore seems act dieting form resource expenditure dieters spend much energy trying limit food intake efforts likely undermined faced overwhelming temptation research found competitive athletes mental determination hindered completing difficult cognitive task completing easy cognitive indicates hindering effects ego depletion applied subsequent performance cognitive tasks physical tasks well world consumerism individuals faced decisions choices require use valuable energy resources order make informed purchases resisting temptation impulsive unnecessary purchases consumers constantly bombarded broad range options order make best choice one must compare many different aspects various products complexity consumer decisions result ego turn could impact subsequent decisions consumers must make consumers depleted likely become passive make impulsive decisions may fall line true values consumers faced choices different price ranges product qualities market many options make consumers feel overwhelmed causing ego advertisements telling consumers deserve must product cause mental fatigue frustration leading people give buying fatigue frustration also stem deals specific requirements ways purchase product along spending effort deciding store best deals trying get store people led buy high priced cheapest consumers low selfcontrol susceptible invested obtaining product high consumers likely motivated persistent pay product lead consumers sense empowerment feel control feel though overcoming ego depleted states also lead purchasing brand high status consumer might feel brand beneficial secure product recent experiment shown inducing positive mood buffer impairing effects ego depletion subsequent positive mood induced getting individuals watch comedy videos giving surprise gift positive mood seemed allow people recover faster ego depletion furthermore improved ability selfregulate claim positive mood provide general benefit people previously engaged selfregulatory tasks rather positive mood restore depleted individuals capacity selfregulate furthermore experimental work consider depth mechanisms performance restored known whether positive mood counteracts ego depletion whether positive mood merely motivates individual persist task despite depleted state ego depletion effect without mood intervention however shown unrelated mood changes shown multiple ego depletion experiments either controlled mood saw mood changes thus positive affect way counteract ego depletion person depleted conservation hypothesis partial explanation ego depletion suggests two sorts depletion according view people feel depleted might still exist reserve store energy used extreme high priority situations could encountered future adaptive extent expending resources given time might render individual fully depleted resources unexpected situation requiring selfregulation selfmonitoring behaviours existence spare reservoir mental energy ultimately explains various motivators buffer effects mild moderate ego depletion state low resources individual lacks motivation exert energy motivation presented still extra resources used thus ego depletion could conceptualized psychological constraint necessary safeguard precious resources might needed emergency situations future mild depletion people still small amount energy left tank access normal although selfcontrol traditionally thought limited resource depleted researchers disagree model multiple studies provided support ego depletion effect currently direct measure ego depletion studies mainly observe measuring long people persist second task performing selfcontrol task depleting furthermore researchers usually examine average task performance rather longitudinal performance trajectory studies available performance trajectories modelled two studies evidence ego depletion group performed worse first trials second many ego depletion studies however shown mood relevant results fact many earlier experiments tested effects mood saw effect mood whatsoever furthermore study measurement ego depletion may affected confounding effect cognitive dissonance researchers questioned whether subjects truly experiencing ego depletion whether individuals merely experiencing cognitive dissonance psychological contrast original known model selfcontrol michael inzlicht brandon j schmeichel propose alternative model depletion refer process process model holds initial exertions willpower lead individuals motivation shift away control towards gratification part process ones attention shifts away cues signal need control towards cues signal indulgence inzlicht schmeichel argue process model provides starting point understanding selfcontrol research examining cognitive motivational affective influences selfcontrol needed preregistered study participants inzlicht colleagues provided evidence fitted computational models decision making show depleted decision boundary reduced suggesting people disengage become less interested exerting effort furthermore showed depletion impair inhibitory control although widespread confidence robustness ego depletion effect substantial body research since cast doubt replicability effect meta analysis independent tests found effect significant moderate effect size even accounting possible unpublished failed studies analysis concluded extremely unlikely effect doesnt meta analysis studies carter mccullough argued metaanalysis failed take publication bias account showed statistical evidence publication bias statistically controlled publication bias effect size estimate small significantly different michael inzlicht colleagues praised carters meta analysis argued biascorrection techniques precise enough give precise control size response cunningham baumeister argued carter mccullough analysis contained errors data collection various analyses ulrich schimmack conducted metaanalysis published studies found studies could produce significant results help random sampling error based low power studies one would expect large number nonsignificant results results missing published articles finding supports carter mcculloughs metaanalysis showed publication bias different statistical method schimmacks replicability report also identified small set studies adequate power provided evidence egodepletion studies promising studies replication project examine whether egodepletion effects replicated consistently across several independent major multilab replication study participants carried two dozen labs across world using single protocol failed find evidence ego response baumeister vohs argued baumeisters original protocol rejected project coordinators discussion stalled reluctantly agreed task differed degree original however subsequent separate multilab replication project led kathleen vohs involving labs testing also failed find egodepletion effect order magnitude smaller effect size estimate original hagger metaanalysis
