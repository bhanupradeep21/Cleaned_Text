pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency also known pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency pdcd pdh deficiency rare neurodegenerative disorder associated abnormal mitochondrial metabolism pdcd genetic disease resulting mutations one components pyruvate dehydrogenase complex pdc multienzyme complex plays vital role key regulatory step central pathways energy metabolism disorder shows heterogeneous characteristics clinical presentation biochemical pdcd generally presented one two forms metabolic form appears lactic acidosis neurological form pdcd contributes hypotonia poor feeding lethargy structural abnormalities patients may develop seizures andor neuropathological spasms presentations disease usually progress mental retardation microcephaly blindness females residual pyruvate dehydrogenase activity uncontrollable systemic lactic acidosis neurological symptoms conversely females little enzyme activity major structural brain abnormalities atrophy males mutations abolish almost abolish enzyme activity presumably die utero brain cells able generate enough atp functionally viable expected cases mild severity clinical presentation involving lactic male infants reach full term display severe symptoms females exhibit high mortality within first years life prenatal onset may present nonspecific signs low apgar scores small gestational age cases display hydrocephalus thinning cerebral metabolic disturbances may also considered poor feeding lethargy proportion mild viral illness especially bacterial infection ruled pdh activity may enhanced exercise phenylbutyrate dichloroacetatecitation needed clinical presentation congenital pdh deficiency typically characterized heterogenous neurological features usually appear within first year life addition patients usually show severe hyperventillation due profound metabolic acidosis mostly related lactic acidosis metabolic acidosis patients usually refractory correction following table lists common symptoms pyruvate dehydrogenase less severe cases signs lactic acidosis include ataxia episodes may occur ill stress consuming high amounts carbohydrates aerobic respiration process converting energy form

transported mitochondria converted pyruvate dehydrogenase complex acetylcoa starting substrate krebs cycle pdc activity reduced abolished mutation pyruvate levels rise excess pyruvate converted lactic acid lactate dehydrogenase lactic acid enters blood stream causing acidification condition known lactic acidosiscitation needed commonly seen form pdcd caused mutations xlinked alpha gene approximately equally prevalent males females however males severely affected heterozygous females explained xinactivation females carry one normal one mutant gene cells normal allele active

lias gene responsible synthesizing lipoic acid cofactor required pyruvate dehydrogenase pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency diagnosed via following differential diagnosis pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency consist either dlactic acidosis abnormalities associated direct treatment stimulates pyruvate dehydrogenase complex pdc provides alternative fuels prevents acute worsening however correction acidosis reverse symptoms cns damage common limits full ketogenic diets high fat low carbohydrate intake used control minimize lactic acidosis anecdotal evidence shows successful control disease slowing progress often showing rapid ketogenic baby formulas nutricia ketocal ketogenic diet atp synthesized catabolism fatty acids rather glucose produces ketone bodies acetoacetate acetone ketone bodies serve alternate source energy body preliminary data pdhd patients ketogenic diet indicate milder cases reduction frequency seizures abnormal eeg readings ataxia abnormal sleeping patterns extension remission periods severe cases less responsive ketogenic diet displayed modest improvement gross fine motor skills speech language development development social ketogenic diet several long term drawbacks including pancreatitis sialorrhea obstipation vomiting patients must monitored regularly blood lactate levels transaminase plasma ketone evidence dichloroacetate reduces inhibitory phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex thereby activates residual functioning complex resolution lactic acidosis observed patients alpha enzyme subunit mutations reduce enzyme stability however treatment dichloroacetate improve neurological oral citrate often used treat clinical trials improve scientific medical understanding pdcd underway information located vast majority
