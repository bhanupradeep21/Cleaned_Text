bells mania also known delirious mania refers acute neurobehavioral usually characterized expeditious onset delirium mania psychosis followed grandiosity emotional lability altered consciousness hyperthermia extreme cases sometimes misdiagnosed excited delirium exd catatonia due presence overlapping pathophysiology studies reveal elevated dopamine levels neural circuit underlying psychostimulant users well individuals experiencing severe manic episodes prone manifestation management solutions sedation ketamine injections discussed medical professionals individuals condition bells mania cases commonly reported countries like united states canada commonly associated psychostimulant use majority bells mania cases studied triggered psychostimulant drug usage preexisting medical neurological conditions impedes apprehension hence present still scientific consensus clinical features bells mania researchers currently working varying case studies derive common clinical characteristics frequent signs symptoms include acute onset delirium mania patients bells mania fluctuating severity symptoms time altered consciousness emotional tend excited agitated paranoid delusional display impulsive hostile destructive behavior towards others last hours days well unexpected physical catatonic symptoms grimacing echopraxia negativism echolalia stereotypy often impaired concentration memory loss disorientation insomnia auditory visual hallucinations additional symptoms shifts loud disorganized speech typical physiological signs include hyperthermia tachycardia hypertension condition currently recognized diagnosable issue psychiatric journals diagnostic statistical manual mental american psychiatric association tenth revision international statistical classification diseases related health problems world health organization examined patients bells mania fail recall names recent experiences poorly oriented location date moreover blood pressure respiratory rate additionally mental status examination using three diagnostic tests taken including drawing facehand hidden figures patients bells mania tend make obvious mistakes tests instance drawing clockface incorrect numbering missing clock upon acute onset symptoms instant investigation toxic systemic cause prominence thought disorder grandiosity delusional ideation catatonic signs indicates diagnosis acute schizophrenia bipolar disorder catatonia diagnostic complications arise signs also often notable feature bells cause undetermined bells mania diagnosis usually justified presence mania delirium regardless catatonic bells mania catatonia regarded overlapping making differential diagnosis essential catatonic signs thus researchers must distinguish excited catatonia bells mania among malignant catatonia excited catatonia neuroleptic malignant syndrome catatonic features prominent diagnosed excited catatonia absent subtle identified bells alternatively presence delirium recognized discerning factor difference two catatonia viewed movement aspect whereas delirium nevertheless formal set diagnostic criteria required distinguish bells mania failure diagnose bells mania appearing catatonia could lead deleterious consequences worse cases dopamine primary neurotransmitter involved pathophysiology bells elevated dopamine levels neural circuit concerned neuropsychiatric disorders postulated responsible manic psychosis symptoms signs including fluctuations body temperatures increased extracellular dopamine levels caused low levels dopaminergic transporters sensitization postsynaptic dopaminergic receptors dopamine transporters mania prominent symptom bipolar disorder bells mania hence studying bipolar patients provide insight pathophysiology bells mania pet scans manic patients illustrate anomalous activation dorsal anterior cingulate right inferior frontal cortical manic symptoms exacerbate increasing anterior cingulate activation posited associated escalating dopamine transmission nucleus dopamine transporter regulates reuptake dopamine keep synaptic dopamine levels within normal hence elevation transporter levels striatum decreases genetic studies hypothesized relationship low transporter protein levels gene dopamine transporter bipolar affective external sources contributing hypothesized hyperdopaminergic mechanism include psychostimulants like substances provoke behavioral changes similar chronic users drug sensitization occurs induces increased neurotransmission modified protein expression within mesolimbic dopamine neurons adaptations dopamine transporters triggered causing behavioral phenomenon distinct drug abuse also psychomotor stimulants dopaminergic transporters dysfunction caused acute mania bipolar disorder psychostimulant use environmental stress suggested common mechanism excited delirium exd commonly observed psychostimulant abusers drugs directly impact dopaminergic transporters increasing extracellular dopamine amplified excitation dopaminergic systems induce extreme fear magnify approach avoidance hyperdopaminergic state triggers aggression agitation psychomotor additionally cns dopamine signaling active heart rate respiration body temperature dopamine imbalance hence result hyperthermia tachycardia hyperventilation hypertension sleep disturbance given hyperdopaminergic state postulated underlying mechanism bells mania people prone dopamine imbalance sensitization low levels dopamine transporters furthermore syndrome usually precipitated prevailing neurological physiological hence risk include whilst scope bells mania extensively studied remain significant challenges need solved respect treatment course time significance syndrome increasingly recognized correspondence manner death specifically anatomic cause death hard define autopsy recent studies elicited neurochemical resulting autonomic hyperactivity increase dopamine levels emergency personnel need recognize symptoms promptly avoid individual spiraling metabolic acidosis rhabdomyolysis multiorgan failure ultimately death light clinical findings treatments described include effective sedation followed closely external cooling monitoring medical complications administration intravenous iv one management technique rapid sedation view unpredictable aggressive nature patient bells mania especially symptoms need handled associated causes like dopamine regulation turning catecholamine cascade rapidly sedating patient using several sedatives like benzodiazepines help several studies also point increased effectiveness combination two sedatives treatment hyper agitated patients bells mania may optimum time sedatives start showing effect due fact electroconvulsive intramuscular ketamine alternative solutions proposed onset time seconds minutes ketamine proves effective although adult data use ketamine patients isnt readily available study strayer et concluded use ketamine controlling hyperactivity reliable facilitate management techniques fewer side along sedation techniques prevention protection measures decrease fatal outcomes urgency medical severity condition needs given impetus terms handling patients bells mania due homologous nature syndrome malignant hyperthermia mh neuroleptic malignant syndrome also probable treatment route owing swift acidosis correction although research needed correspondence cause consequences disease significance behavioral physical symptoms need given importance provide medical
