pellucid marginal degeneration pmd degenerative corneal condition often confused keratoconus typically presents painless vision loss affecting eyes rarely may cause acute vision loss severe pain due perforation cornea typically characterized clear bilateral thinning ectasia inferior peripheral region cornea although cases affect one eye cause disease remains unclear pellucid marginal degeneration diagnosed corneal topography corneal pachymetry may useful confirming diagnosis treatment usually consists vision correction eyeglasses contact lenses intacs implants corneal collagen crosslinking corneal transplant surgery additional options surgery reserved individuals tolerate contact lenses term pellucid marginal degeneration first coined ophthalmologist word pellucid means clear indicating corneas retain clarity pellucid marginal condition rare though exact prevalence incidence unknown pain typically present pellucid marginal degeneration aside vision loss symptoms accompany condition however rare cases pmd may present sudden onset vision loss excruciating eye pain occurs thinning cornea leads pmd usually affects eyes unilateral cases pmd characterized bilateral thinning ectasia inferior peripheral region cornea distribution degeneration crescent arcuate shaped cornea region thinning normal thickness may protrude anteriorly creates irregular described beer belly appearance since greatest protrusion occurs horizontal midline unlike keratoconus normally pmd present vascularization cornea scarring deposits pmd noninflammatory condition thinning corneas may approach normal thickness may increase number mucopolysaccharides corneal stroma bowmans layer cornea may absent irregular ruptured areascitation needed center cornea shows normal thickness intact central epithelium inferior cornea exhibits peripheral band thinning mm portion cornea immediately adjacent limbus spared usually strip pmd see high rule along horizontal bow ties inferior peripheral thinning seen oclock oclock pmd lacks apical corneal scarring rizuttis phenomenon munsons sign central corneal thickness usually gold standard diagnostic test pmd corneal however may specific corneal pachymetry corneal topography evaluates degree distribution surface irregularities cornea thickness corneal topography may show crab clawlike appearance finding seen keratoconus pellucid marginal degeneration thus corneal topography used diagnosis conjunction clinical findings peripheral inferior corneal people treated nonsurgically eyeglasses contact early stages pellucid marginal degeneration may also managed soft contact success shown use rigid gas permeable contact lenses combined overrefraction people wearing contacts dont report increased problems glare contrast sensitivity clear due corneal disease contact lenses themselvescitation needed new studies found use scleral contact lens type rigid gas permeable rgp lens may good option people pmd lenses range diameter regardless lens size thought larger rgp lens cases comfortable standard rigid corneal lenses times comfortable soft lenses regardless fact rigid lens highlight scleral design correction eye disorders pellucid marginal degeneration vision types lenses exceptional fit correctlycitation needed use intacs implants tested treatment pmd slight improvement visual acuity noted eleven intacs used keratoconus evidence suggesting corneal collagen crosslinking may beneficial patients pellucid marginal research shows promising results combining collagen cross linking photorefractive keratectomy topographyguided transepithelial surface corneal transplant surgery may difficult due peripheral thinning cornea even large offcenter therefore surgery usually reserved people tolerate contact lenses several different surgical approaches may taken one approach currently established standard examples surgical procedures used pmd include wedge resection lamellar crescentic resection penetrating keratoplasty lamellar keratoplasty epikeratoplasty intracorneal segments transplantation entire thickness cornea penetrating keratoplasty may performed enough normal tissue present however enough normal tissue present attaching graft difficult new surgical techniques evaluation intrastromal lamellar keratoplasties sclerocorneal intrastromal lamellar keratoplasty silk techniques allow thickening inferior peripheral cornea steepening vertical due thinning cornea people pmd poor candidates procedures lasik photorefractive visual function declines result irregular corneal shape resulting astigmatism causing distortion vision deterioration become severe incidence prevalence pmd unknown studies yet investigated prevalence incidence however generally agreed pmd rare uncertainty regarding incidence pmd may attributed confusion keratoconus pmd linked race age although cases present early life years pmd usually considered affect men women equally studies suggest may affect men several diseases observed people pmd however causal relationships established associated diseases pathogenesis pmd diseases include chronic open angle glaucoma retinitis pigmentosa retinal lattice degeneration
