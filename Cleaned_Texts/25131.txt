sex trait determines whether sexually reproducing organism produces male female male organism produces small mobile gametes spermatozoa sperm pollen female organism produces larger nonmobile gametes ova often called egg organism produces types gamete called sexual reproduction male female gamete fuse form zygote develops offspring inherits traits parent male female species may physically alike sexual monomorphism physical differences sexual dimorphism reflect various reproductive pressures sex sexual selection mate choice accelerate evolution differences sexes terms male female typically

stage called diploid sexual reproduction diploid organism produces specialized haploid sex cells called gametes via single set chromosomes meiosis involves stage genetic recombination via chromosomal crossover regions dna exchanged matched pairs chromosomes form new chromosomes new combination genes parents chromosomes separated single sets gametes gamete offspring thus half genetic material mother half combination chromosomal crossover fertilization bringing two single sets chromosomes together make new diploid zygote results new organism contains different set genetic traits parent animals haploid stage occurs gametes haploid cells specialized fuse form zygote develops new diploid organism plant species diploid organism produces type haploid spore meiosis capable undergoing repeated cell division produce multicellular haploid organism either case gametes may externally similar isogamy green alga ulva may different size aspects size difference greatest oogamy type anisogamy small motile gamete combines much larger nonmotile anisogamic organisms convention larger gamete called ovum egg cell considered female smaller gamete called spermatozoon sperm cell considered male individual produces large gametes female one produces small gametes individual produces types gamete hermaphrodite species hermaphrodite selffertilize produce offspring sexually reproducing animals spend lives diploid haploid stage reduced singlecell gametes animals male female egg cells respectively gametes combine form embryos develop new organisms male gamete spermatozoon produced vertebrates within testes small cell containing single long flagellum propels spermatozoa extremely reduced cells lacking many cellular components would necessary embryonic development specialized motility seeking egg cell fusing process called fertilization female gametes egg cells vertebrates produced within ovaries large immobile cells contain nutrients cellular components necessary developing egg cells often associated cells support development embryo forming egg mammals fertilized embryo instead develops within female receiving nutrition directly mother animals usually mobile seek partner opposite sex mating animals live water mate using external fertilization eggs sperm released combine within surrounding animals live outside water however use internal fertilization transferring sperm directly female prevent gametes drying birds excretion reproduction done single posterior opening called female birds touch cloaca transfer sperm process called cloacal many terrestrial animals males use specialized sex organs assist transport male sex organs called intromittent organs humans mammals male organ known penis enters female reproductive tract called vagina achieve process called sexual intercourse penis contains tube semen fluid containing sperm travels female mammals vagina connects uterus organ directly supports development fertilized embryo within process called gestation motility animal sexual behavior involve coercive sex traumatic insemination example used insect species inseminate females wound abdominal process detrimental females health like animals land plants specialized male female seed plants male gametes produced reduced male gametophytes contained within hard coats forming pollen female gametes seed plants contained within ovules fertilized form seeds like eggs contain nutrients necessary initial development embryonic plant flowers flowering plants contain sexual organs flowers usually hermaphroditic containing male female sexual organs female parts center flower pistils unit consisting carpel style stigma two reproductive units may merged form single compound pistil fused carpels forming ovary within carpels ovules develop seeds fertilization male parts flower stamens consist long filaments arranged pistil petals produce pollen anthers tips pollen grain lands upon stigma top carpels style germinates produce pollen tube grows tissues style carpel delivers male gamete nuclei fertilize ovule eventually develops seed hermaphroditic plants selffertile plants evolved multiple different selfincompatibility mechanisms avoid selffertilization involving sequential hermaphroditism molecular recognition systems morphological mechanisms pines conifers sex organs produced within cones male female forms male cones smaller female ones produce pollen transported wind land female cones larger longerlived female cones typically durable contain ovules within develop seeds fertilization seed plants immobile depend upon passive methods transporting pollen grains plants many including conifers grasses produce lightweight pollen carried wind neighboring plants flowering plants heavier sticky pollen specialized transportation insects larger animals hummingbirds bats may attracted flowers containing rewards nectar pollen animals transport pollen move flowers also contain female reproductive organs resulting pollination species fungus reproduce sexually life cycles haploid diploid phases species fungus typically isogamous ie lacking male female specialization one haploid fungus grows

phenomenon called sexual sexual dimorphism animals often associated sexual mating competition individuals one sex visàvis opposite many cases male species larger female mammal species extreme sexual size dimorphism tend highly polygynous mating due selection success competition elephant seals examples demonstrate preference females drives sexual dimorphism case stalkeyed females larger sex
