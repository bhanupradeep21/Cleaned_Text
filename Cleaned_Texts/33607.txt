urinary incontinence ui also known involuntary urination uncontrolled leakage urine common distressing problem may large impact quality identified important issue geriatric health term enuresis often used refer urinary incontinence primarily children nocturnal enuresis bed ui example stigmatized medical condition creates barriers successful management makes problem people may embarrassed seek medical help attempt selfmanage symptom secrecy others pelvic surgery pregnancy childbirth menopause major risk urinary incontinence often result underlying medical condition underreported medical four main types treatments include pelvic floor muscle training bladder training surgery electrical behavioral therapy generally works better medication stress urge benefit medications small long term safety urinary incontinence common older urinary incontinence result urologic nonurologic causes urologic causes classified either bladder dysfunction urethral sphincter incompetence may include detrusor overactivity poor bladder compliance urethral hypermobility intrinsic sphincter deficiency nonurologic causes may include infection medication drugs psychological factors polyuria stool impaction restricted causes leading urinary incontinence usually specific sex however causes common men womencitation needed common types urinary incontinence women stress urinary incontinence urge urinary incontinence women symptoms types said mixed urinary incontinence menopause estrogen production decreases women urethral tissue demonstrate atrophy becoming weaker thinner possibly playing role development urinary stress urinary incontinence women commonly caused loss support urethra usually consequence damage pelvic support structures result pregnancy childbirth obesity age among women experience urinary incontinence giving birth women deliver vaginally twice likely urinary incontinence women give birth via caesarean stress incontinence characterized leaking small amounts urine activities increase abdominal pressure coughing sneezing laughing lifting happens urethral sphincter close completely due damage sphincter surrounding tissue additionally frequent exercise highimpact activities cause athletic incontinence develop urge urinary incontinence caused uninhibited contractions detrusor muscle condition known overactive bladder syndrome characterized leaking large amounts urine association insufficient warning get bathroom timecitation needed urge incontinence common type incontinence similar women urine leakage happens following intense feeling urination allowing enough time reach bathroom condition called overactive bladder syndrome men condition commonly associated benign prostatic hyperplasia enlarged prostate causes bladder outlet obstruction dysfunction detrusor muscle muscle bladder eventually causing overactive bladder syndrome associated stress urinary incontinence common type incontinence men commonly happens prostate prostatectomy transurethral resection prostate prostate brachytherapy radiotherapy damage urethral sphincter surrounding tissue causing incompetent incompetent urethral sphincter prevent urine leaking urinary bladder activities increase intraabdominal pressure coughing sneezing laughing continence usually improves within months prostate surgery without specific interventions people report persistent body stores urine water wastes removed kidneys urinary bladder balloonlike organ bladder connects urethra tube urine leaves needed continence micturition involve balance urethral closure detrusor muscle activity muscle bladder urination detrusor muscles wall bladder contract forcing urine bladder urethra time sphincter muscles surrounding urethra relax letting urine pass body urethral sphincter muscular ring closes outlet urinary bladder preventing urine pass outside body urethral pressure normally exceeds bladder pressure resulting urine remaining bladder maintaining urethra supported pelvic floor muscles tissue allowing close firmly damage balance detrusor muscle urethral sphincter supportive tissue nerves lead type incontinence citation needed example stress urinary incontinence usually result incompetent closure urethral sphincter caused damage sphincter muscles support nerves supply men damage usually happens prostate surgery women usually caused childbirth pressure inside abdomen coughing sneezing normally transmitted urethra bladder equally leaving pressure difference unchanged resulting continence sphincter incompetent increase pressure push urine leading incontinencecitation needed another example urge incontinence incontinence associated sudden forceful contractions detrusor muscle bladder muscle leading intense feeling urination incontinence person reach bathroom time syndrome known overactive bladder syndrome related dysfunction detrusor urination voiding complex activity bladder balloonlike muscle lies lowest part abdomen bladder stores urine releases urethra canal carries urine outside body controlling activity involves nerves muscles spinal cord braincitation needed bladder made two types muscles detrusor muscular sac stores urine squeezes empty sphincter circular group muscles bottom neck bladder automatically stays contracted hold urine automatically relax detrusor contracts let urine urethra third group muscles bladder pelvic floor muscles contract keep urine backcitation needed babys bladder fills set point automatically contracts empties child gets older nervous system develops childs brain begins get messages

complexcitation needed pattern voiding urine leakage important suggests type incontinence points include straining discomfort use drugs recent surgery illnesscitation needed physical examination looks signs medical conditions causing incontinence tumors block urinary tract stool impaction poor reflexes sensations may evidence nerverelated causecitation needed tests people often asked keep diary day week record pattern voiding noting times amounts urine produced research projects assess efficacy antiincontinence therapies often quantify extent urinary incontinence methods include pad test measuring leakage volume using voiding diary counting number incontinence episodes leakage episodes per day assessing strength pelvic floor muscles measuring maximum vaginal squeeze pressure main types urinary incontinence yearly screening recommended women womens preventive services initiative wpsi people test positive screening process would need referred testing understand help treat screening questions inquire symptoms experienced severe symptoms symptoms affect daily studies shown change outcomes urinary incontinence screenings treatment options include conservative treatment

overflow avoiding heavy lifting preventing constipation may help uncontrollable urine leakage stopping smoking also recommended associated improvements urinary incontinence men weight loss may also helpful people overweight improve symptoms physical therapy effective women reducing urinary pelvic floor physical therapists work patients identify treat underlying pelvic muscle dysfunction cease urinary incontinence may recommend exercises strengthen muscles electrostimulation biofeedback exercising muscles pelvis kegel exercises first line treatment women stress efforts increase time urination known bladder training recommended urge may used mixed small vaginal cones increasing weight may used help seem better active treatment women stress urinary incontinence similar effects training pelvic floor muscles biofeedback uses measuring devices help patient become aware bodys functioning using electronic devices diaries track bladder urethral muscles contract patient gain control muscles biofeedback used pelvic muscle exercises electrical stimulation relieve stress urge incontinence evidence supporting role biofeedback devices treating urinary incontinence weak evidence electrical stimulation low frequency may helpful combination standard treatments women overactive bladder however evidence supporting role biofeedback combined pelvic floor muscle training

similar medications recommended stress incontinence recommended urge incontinence improve bladder injectable bulking agents may used enhance urethral support however unclear women men persistent incontinence despite optimal conservative therapy may candidates surgery surgery may used help stress overflow common surgical techniques stress incontinence include slings tensionfree vaginal tape bladder suspension artificial urinary sphincters among clear antibiotics taken prophylactically surgery helpful decreasing risk infection use transvaginal mesh implants bladder slings controversial due risk debilitating painful side effects vaginal transvaginal mesh implants classified high risk device us food drug urodynamic testing seems confirm surgical restoration vault prolapse cure motor urge incontinence traditional suburethral sling operations probably slightly better open abdominal retropubic colposuspension probably slightly less effective midurethral sling operations reducing urinary incontinence women still uncertain different types traditional suburethral sling operations better similarly insufficient long term evidence certain effectiveness safety singleincision sling operations urinary incontinence traditional suburethral slings may higher risk surgical complications minimally invasive slings risk complications compared types operation still laparoscopic colposuspension keyhole surgery abdomen sutures effective open colposuspension curing incontinence women months surgery unclear whether fewer risk complications probably higher risk complications traditional suburethral slings open abdominal retropubic artificial urinary sphincter implantable device used treat stress incontinence mostly men device made parts pump cuff balloon reservoir
