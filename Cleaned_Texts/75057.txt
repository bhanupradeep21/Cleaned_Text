sleep disorders applications circadian sleep principles clinical medicine occupational safety health also examines relationship circadian oscillator sleep homeostasis including landmark science paper demonstrating sleep episodes correlated circadian phase body temperature rhythm bedtime length prior czeislers research interests encompass many areas including effects light human circadian rhythms role sleep circadian rhythms metabolism impact shift work health productivity effects melatonin melatonin receptor agonists humans czeisler investigates physiological system works reset human central circadian pacemaker located hypothalamus called suprachiasmatic nucleus among salient contributions research area pair seminal science original research articles published first entitled bright light resets human circadian pacemaker independent timing sleepwake cycle provided convincing evidence light influences human circadian pacemaker contributing control daily variations physiologic behavioral cognitive function finding challenged thencommon idea synchronization day accomplished either social contacts sleepwake schedule scientific breakthrough featured front page new york times june czeisler led discovery light transduced nonvisual input melanopsin activation could reset circadian clock patients without indicated blind humans entrain light nonvisual photoreceptors czeisler found intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells iprgcs influence circadian clock visual perception indicating iprgcs contribute visual light perception even absence rod cone significantly challenged misconception rod cone photoreceptors sole receptors photoentrainment czeisler published study defended longheld notion mammals extraoccular findings study definitively refuted famous science publication extraocular circadian phototransduction humans reported bright light behind knees help regulated human circadian czeislers study debunked publication czeisler examined effects sleep deprivation sleepwake cycle circadian rhythms impacts attention found bright light duration impacts circadian pacemaker melatonin suppression also discovered even room lighting suppress melatonin production czeisler also dedicated portion career examining effects light timing duration intensity wavelength resetting pacemaker iprgcs contain photopigment czeislers work many important applications showed sleep deprivation could adverse consequences affecting obesity diabetes among health also investigated effects chronic sleep deprivation restriction night shifts circadian disruption neurobehavioral performance furthermore czeisler studied sleep deprivation impairs psychomotor performance night shift workers specifically surgeons residents police officers truck drivers
