targeted therapy lung cancer refers using agents specifically designed selectively target molecular pathways responsible substantially drive malignant phenotype lung cancer cells consequence relative selectivity cause fewer toxic effects normal cells previous chemotherapy drugs cancer relatively nonselective activity although exact mechanisms action varied complex generally worked damaging cells undergoing mitosis usually common malignant tumors normal tissues targeted agents designed selective effects modulating activity proteins necessary essential oncogenesis maintenance cancer particularly enzymes driving uncontrolled growth angiogenesis invasiveness metastasis characteristic malignant tumors increased differential activity usually results fewer troubling side effects cancer patients particularly less nausea vomiting death cells bone marrow gastrointestinal tract increased effectiveness tumor cells lung cancer extremely heterogeneous family malignant well different histological variants recognized revision world health organization typing system currently widely used lung cancer classification variants differing genetic biological clinical properties including response treatment correct classification lung cancer cases necessary assure lung cancer patients receive optimum approximately lung cancers carcinoma term describing malignancies derived transformed cells exhibiting characteristics epithelium lung cancers noncarcinoma mainly sarcoma tumors hematopoietic origin germ cell forms lung cancer usually treated differently carcinomas ubiquity lung carcinomas however term lung cancer generally refers carcinomas everyday clinical practicecitation needed despite large number histological variants lung carcinoma oncologists long tended favor dichotomous division small cell nonsmall cell forms based differences clinical behavior response treatment small cell lung carcinomas sclcs metastasize distant organs early course rendering surgery ineffective curing cancer contrast nonsmall cell lung carcinomas nsclcs likely remain localized thorax development thus amenable cure using radical surgical resection additionally sclcs typically much sensitive chemotherapy andor radiation therapy nsclcs therefore current traditional treatment guidelines standards care recommend possible use surgery nsclc chemotherapy without radiotherapy large
