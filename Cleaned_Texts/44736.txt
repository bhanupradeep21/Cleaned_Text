guttural pouches large auditorytube diverticula contain ml air present oddtoed mammals bats hyraxes american forest mouse paired bilaterally ears behind skull connect due general inaccessibility pouches horses area infection fungi bacteria infections extremely severe hard treat condition guttural pouch tympany affects several breeds including arabian horse condition predisposes young horses infection often including severe swelling often requires surgery correct guttural pouch also site infection equine guttural pouches located behind cranial cavity caudally skull wings atlas enclosed parotid mandibular salivary glands pterygoid muscles ventral portion lies pharynx beginning esophagus retropharyngeal lymph nodes located ventral wall pharynx left right pouches separated longus capitis rectus capitis ventralis muscles dorsomedially muscles two pouches fuse form median guttural pouches connect middle ear pharynx opening pharynx called nasopharyngeal ostium composed pharyngeal wall laterally fibrocartilaginous fold medially opening leads short soft tissue passageway respective guttural pouch openings located rostrally enable drainage mucous head lowered prevent fluid plica salpingopharyngea mucosal fold caudal portion eustachian tube forms uninterrupted channel medial lamina eustachian tube lateral wall pharynx plica salpingopharyngea sometimes act oneway valve trapping air pouch causing guttural pouch pouch moulded around stylohyoid bone divides medial lateral compartments medial compartment much larger protrudes caudally epithelium pseudostratified ciliated containing mucoussecreting goblet cells lymph nodules also compartments guttural pouch contain many important structures including several cranial nerves arteries lie directly pouch pass foramina caudal aspect skull glossopharyngeal vagus accessory hypoglossal nervescitation needed sympathetic trunk leaving cranial cervical ganglion internal carotid cause mucosal fold indent within medial compartment visible viewed facial nerve contact dorsal part pouch external carotid artery passes ventral medial compartment crossing lateral wall lateral pouch also covers temporohyoid function guttural pouches shown experimental data participate rapid cooling arterial blood destined brain surrounding structures words horses guttural pouches braincooling devices cooling blood within internal carotid arteries hyperthermia occurs heavy however proven function called question another study neither examined guttural pouches internal carotid others argued cooling function would require unattainable high rate inspiratory air flow partly diverted guttural issue necessary guttural pouch air flow rates provide rapid cooling internal carotid arteries solved supporting evidence microvascular studies guttural pouch many guttural pouch mucosal superficial arterioles capillaries extend outwards forming two types vascular plexuses surrounding internal carotid arteries one capillary bundles parallel internal carotid arteries outer layer tunica adventitia outer periarterial plexus veinarteryvein triads within inner layer tunica adventitia inner periarterial plexus guttural pouch microvascular plexuses engulfing internal carotid arteries typical countercurrent heat exchangers recognised animal species supporting data guttural pouches participate selective brain cooling even lower air flow rates completes triad internal carotid artery cooling protects horses brain hyperthermia triad including function guttural pouches achieving arterial cooling via utilizing inspiratory air cooling well microvascular countercurrent heat exchangers surrounding internal carotid arteries finally afterwards internal carotid arteries project upwards passing intracranial cavernous venous sinuses accepting cooled venous blood nasal drainage tract becomes blocked reason mucous secretions accumulate cause pouch distend producing visible palpable protrusion behind mandible exudate may become contaminated pathogens bacteria streptococcus equi causative agent strangles commonly involved mycotic infections also visible symptoms guttural pouch disease include abnormal head neck carriage nasal discharge painful swelling occasional abnormal functioning structures associated secondary problems may include inflammation middle ear due migration infection along auditory tube nasal bleeding caused damage internal carotid artery vagus nerve involvement may laryngeal hemiplegia roaring difficulty swallowing also glossopharyngeal nerve involved horners syndrome involvement sympathetic nerves involvement facial nerve guttural pouches covered respiratory epithelium mucosa potential affected respiratory infections selflimiting requiring little medical intervention upon endoscopy affected guttural pouches often house mucopurulent fluid process guttural pouch empyema characterized accretion purulent bacteria infested exudate pouch bacteria primarily streptococcus equi infectious agent strangles clinically apparent symptoms include painful swelling parotid area recurrent infected nasal discharge severe circumstances difficulty breathing abnormal head carriage may fever anorexia difficulty swallowing soft palate displacement may may empyema often secondary guttural pouch tympany distention pouches air foals weanlings arabians particular inclined guttural pouch tympany many congenital defect pharyngeal orifices infection also due rupture nearby retropharyngeal lymph nodes usually caused diagnosis established endoscopic examination radiographic examination area show opaque fluid line pouch retropharyngeal lymph node involved may reveal mild acute cases empyema saline polyionic solution lavage often performed via endoscope catheter repeatedly exudate antimicrobial therapy without lavage seldom remedies complex cases concretions formed surgical intervention may necessary ensure appropriate drainage removal hardened material area accessed surgically viborgs guttural pouch tympany uncommon ailment excessive amounts air become trapped pouch resulting abnormal expansion tympany usually unilateral cases affect pouches seen often young foals common females tympany results nonpainful soft swelling beneath ear behind jaw additional symptoms may include roaring difficulty breathing difficulty swallowing andor aspiration diagnosis achieved radiography endoscopic evaluation specific cause guttural pouch tympany known suspected common defects plica salpingopharyngeus andor pharyngeal orifice act oneway valve allow air risk secondary infection crucial tympany treated soon possible treatment protocols may include limited surgical intervention cases surgery option insertion transnasal foley balloon catheter attempt remodel pharyngeal guttural pouch mycosis gpm fungal disease rare potentially lifethreatening gpm unknown pathogenesis currently predisposing factors identified fungal plaque usually located medial guttural pouch near internal carotid clinical signs include unilateral bilateral epistaxis due erosion artery nasal discharge cranial nerve gpm dangerous condition spontaneous fatal hemorrhaging occur usually within days weeks first bout common fungus associated gpm diagnosis made based history animal presenting clinical signs endoscopic exploration pharmaceutical treatment
