stimulustriggered acquisition pluripotency stap proposed method generating pluripotent stem cells subjecting ordinary cells certain types stress application bacterial toxin submersion weak acid physical technique gained prominence january research haruko obokata et al published nature following months scientists tried duplicate results failed suspicion arose obokatas results due error fraud investigation employer riken launched april riken concluded obokata falsified data obtain june obokata agreed retract august yoshiki supervisor riken one coauthors stap cell found dead riken facility apparent suicide stap would radically simpler method stem cell generation previously researched methods requires neither nuclear transfer introduction transcription haruko obokata claimed stap cells produced exposing murine spleen cells certain stresses including acidic medium ph half following treatment cells verified pluripotent observing increasing levels transcription factor expressed embryonic stem cells following week using average cells survived acid treatment survived converted pluripotent researchers also claimed treatment bacterial toxins physical stress conducive acquisition pluripotent stap cells injected mouse embryos grew variety tissues organs found throughout body according researchers chimaeric mice appeared healthy fertile normal onetotwo years additionally mice produced healthy offspring thereby demonstrating germline transmission strict criterion pluripotency well genetic epigenetic stap cells supposedly able differentiate placental cells meaning would potent embryonic stem cells induced pluripotent stem cells clear ordinary cells convert stem cells subjected similar stimuli ordinary conditions acidity body obokata et al suggested vivo inhibitory mechanisms may block conversion research underway generate stimulustriggered acquisition pluripotency stap cells using human tissue february charles vacanti koji kojima harvard researchers originally involved discovery publication stap claimed preliminary results stap cells generated human fibroblasts concomitantly cautioned preliminary results require analysis early charles vacanti martin vacanti conducted studies led idea stem spontaneously recovered ordinary tissues stressed via mechanical injury increased technique producing stap cells subsequently studied obokata brigham womens hospital bwh studying post doc charles vacanti riken center developmental biology working harvard medical school verified request charles vacanti cultured cells working shrank size stem cells mechanically injured capillary went directed test effects various stimuli cells modifying technique obokata able show white blood cells newborn mice could transformed cells behaved much like stem cells repeated experiment cell types including brain skin muscle cells initially obokatas findings met skepticism even among coworkers everyone said artefact really hard days manuscript describing work rejected multiple times eventual publication article together shorter jointlywritten letter within journal series experiments first turning mouse embryo green fluorescently tagging stap cells videotaping transformation tcells pluripotent cells finally convinced skeptics results months two nature papers released scientists tried duplicate obokatas results failed suspicion arose results due error fraud investigation alleged irregularities launched riken february allegations questioned use seemingly duplicated images papers reported failure reproduce results prominent stemcell laboratories nature also announced investigating several stemcell scientists defended obokata reserved opinion investigation address problem reproducibility laboratories obokata published technical tips protocols march promising detailed procedure would published due march teruhiko wakayama one obokatas coauthors urged researchers involved withdraw articles citing many questionable charles vacanti said opposed retraction posted revised protocol creating stap cells website taken resigned bwh march riken released interim report investigation six items investigated committee concluded inappropriate handling data two items judge mishandling research april riken concluded obokata engaged research misconduct falsifying data two occasions coauthors cleared misconduct bore grave responsibility verifying data riken also announced internal group established verify whether stimulustriggered acquisition pluripotency obokata maintained innocence said would appeal june obokata agreed retract article article officially retracted july article analyzing controversy concluded issues image manipulation duplication plagiarism potentially detectable reviewers could concluded article product academic misconduct prior wake controversy observers journalists former members riken stated organization riddled unprofessional inadequate scientific rigor consistency reflective serious issues scientific research japan riken commissioned team scientists attempt verify obokatas original results asked obokata participate effort august obokatas supervisor coauthor original paper yoshiki sasai discovered dead apparent suicide hanging building riken facility kobe september riken scientists reported obokatas stap cells came embryonic stem cell day research groups attempted reproduce stap protocol jointly reported found findings proven valid stimulustriggered pluripotency cells could generated easily efficiently existing ips adapted human tissue technique could led cheap simple procedures create patientspecific stem cells stemcell researcher dusko ilic kings college london called stap cells major scientific discovery opening new era stemcell shinya yamanaka pioneer ips research called findings important understand nuclear reprogramming new approach generate ipslike idea stap cells form placental tissue meant could made cloning considerably easier bypassing need donor egg vitro one previous way creating stem cells via genetic manipulation adult cells ips cells progress ipsbased therapies slow due regulatory hurdles surrounding genetic additionally ips techniques observed efficiency around
