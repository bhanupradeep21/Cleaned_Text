men affected symptoms include pelvic pain pressure pain sex urinary incontinence ui overactive bladder bowel incontinence incomplete emptying feces constipation myofascial pelvic pain pelvic organ pelvic organ prolapse occurs may visible organ protrusion lump felt vagina research carried uk shown symptoms restrict everyday life women however many people found difficult talk seek care experienced embarassment stigma common treatments pelvic floor dysfunction surgery medication physical therapy lifestyle term pelvic floor dysfunction criticized since represent particular pelvic floor therefore recommended term used medical literature without additional pelvic floor dysfunction defined herniation pelvic organs pelvic organ walls pelvic floor condition widespread affecting percent women point percent women undergo surgery urinary incontinence pelvic organ prolapse age women experience pelvic floor dysfunction likely report issues arousal combined dyspareunia women risk surgical intervention related stress urinary incontinence literature suggests white women increased risk stress urinary though pelvic floor dysfunction thought commonly affect women men identified pelvic floor pelvic floor dysfunction multiple consequences including urinary incontinence concerning health issue becoming evident population advancing age individuals rises mechanistically causes pelvic floor dysfunction twofold widening pelvic floor hiatus descent pelvic floor pubococcygeal line specific organ prolapse graded relative people inherited deficiency collagen type may likely develop pelvic floor dysfunction additionally people congenitally weak connective tissue fascia increased risk stress urinary incontinence pelvic organ recent literature demonstrates defects endopelvic fascia compromised levator ani muscle function categorized important etiologic factors development pelvic floor dysfunction circumstances clearly associated collagen defects include vaginally delivering child postmenopausal advanced lifestyle behaviors lead pelvic floor dysfunction includes avoiding urinating bowel movements obesity use muscle relaxants narcotics use antihistamines anticholinergics using muscle relaxants narcotics lead increased smooth skeletal muscle relaxation potentially related urinary incontinence antihistamines anticholinergics additive effects lead urinary hesitancy retention ultimately leading pelvic floor dysfunction urinary incontinence also affect athletes especially sports require high impact gymnasts example report high prevalence urinary incontinence studies show athletes sports requiring high spinal stability may also condition activation abdominal wall muscles cause urinary alterations cases sexual abuse also associated chronic pelvic pain pelvic floor pelvic floor dysfunction result pelvic radiation well treatments gynecological pelvic floor dysfunction assessed strong clinical history physical exam though imaging often needed diagnosis part clinical history healthcare provider may ask obstetric history including many pregnancies deliveries mode delivery complications providers also ask presence severity symptoms pelvic pain pressure problems urination defecation painful sex sexual dysfunction physical exam may include examination speculum visualize cervix check inflammation well manual examination providers fingers assess pain strength pelvic floor muscle imaging provides complete picture type severity pelvic floor dysfunction history physical exam alone historically fluoroscopy defecography cystography used recently mri used complement sometimes replace fluoroscopic assessment disorder technique less invasive allows less radiation exposure increased patient comfort though enema required evening procedure fluoroscopy mri assess pelvic floor rest maximum strain using coronal sagittal grading individual organ prolapse severity rectum bladder uterus individually assessed prolapse rectum referred rectocele bladder prolapse anterior vaginal wall called cystocele prolapse small bowel assess degree dysfunction three measurements taken account first anatomic landmark known pubococcygeal line must determined straight line connecting inferior margin pubic symphysis midline junction first second coccygeal elements sagittal image location puborectalis muscle sling assessed perpendicular line pubococcygeal line muscle sling drawn line provides reference point measurement pelvic floor descent descent greater cm line considered mild descent greater cm considered severe lastly line pubic symphysis puborectalis muscle sling drawn measurement pelvic floor hiatus measurements greater cm considered mild greater cm severe degree organ prolapse assessed relative hiatus grading organ prolapse relative hiatus strict descent hiatus considered abnormal descent greater cm considered ultrasound also used diagnose pelvic floor dysfunction transabdominal transvaginal transperineal endoanal ultrasound eus important tools diagnosing pelvic floor dysfunction eus ultrasound probe inserted anal canal used visualize assess anatomy function pelvic ultrasound easily accessible noninvasive however may compress certain structures produce highquality images used visualize entire pelvic several approaches treatment pelvic floor dysfunction often several approaches used combination pelvic floor muscle pfm training vital treating different types pelvic floor dysfunction two common problems uterine prolapse urinary incontinence stem muscle weakness pelvic floor muscle therapy first line treatment urinary incontinence thus considered invasive procedures able control pelvic floor muscles vital well functioning pelvic floor without ability control pelvic floor muscles pelvic floor training done successfully pelvic floor muscle therapy strengthens muscles pelvic floor repeated contractions varying vaginal palpation exams use biofeedback tightening lifting squeezing actions muscles determined biofeedback used treat urinary incontinence records contractions pelvic floor muscles help patients become aware use pfm training also increase female sexual satisfaction improving sexual function ability men pfm exercises also help maintain strong addition abdominal muscle training shown improve pelvic floor muscle increasing abdominal muscle strength control person may easier time activating pelvic floor muscles sync abdominal muscles many physiotherapists specially trained address muscle weaknesses associated pelvic floor dysfunction effectively treat pelvic floor dysfunction strengthening overall physical therapy significantly improve quality life pelvic floor dysfunction relieving symptoms overactive bladder treated medications including class antimuscarinics beta agonists antimuscarinics commonly used however beta agonists used unable take antimuscarinics due side effects pessary plastic silicone device may used women pelvic organ prolapse vaginal pessaries immediately relieve prolapse prolapserelated treatment useful individuals want surgery unable surgery due risk procedure pessaries knob also treat urinary incontinence effective pessaries must fit medical provider largest device fits comfortably devices train pelvic floor via internal exercises biofeedback treatment pelvic floor dysfunction especially symptom urinary incontinence essential prevention patients usually encouraged change lifestyles interventions reducing body weight limiting use stimulants quitting smoking limiting strenuous efforts preventing constipation increasing physical activity help prevent pelvic floor already diagnosed pelvic floor dysfunction symptoms eased physical activity especially abdominal exercises pelvic floor exercises kegels strengthen pelvic floor symptoms urinary incontinence also reduced making dietary changes limiting intake acidic spicy foods alcohol surgery performed desired patient less invasive treatments lifestyle modification physical therapy various procedures used address prolapse cystoceles treated surgical procedure known burch colposuspension goal suspending prolapsed urethra urethrovesical junction proximal urethra replaced pelvic cavity uterine prolapse treated hysterectomy uterosacral suspension enteroceles prolapsed small bowel elevated pelvis cavity rectovaginal fascia reapproximated rectoceles anterior wall rectum protrudes posterior wall vagina require posterior colporrhaphy also known repair vaginal though pelvic floor dysfunction common women also proven methods assist men severe cases pelvic floor dysfunction causing urinary incontinence radical prostatectomy followed postoperative pelvic floor muscle therapy
