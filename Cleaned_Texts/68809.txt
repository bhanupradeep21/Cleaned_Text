neuroferritinopathy reported since identification incidence largely localized northeast suggesting founder due genetic nature current research focused therapeutic management symptoms caused neuroferritinopathy several distinguishing signs symptoms fall two categories diagnostic findings physically visible symptoms symptoms categorized medically tested diagnosed include iron accumulation brain basal ganglia cavitation patients diagnosed neuroferritinopathy abnormal iron accumulation brain within neurons glia striatum cerebellar along accumulation iron brain neuroferritinopathy typically causes severe neuronal loss secondary symptoms may also arise possible initial iron accumulation cause additional neuronal damage neuronal damaged neurons may replaced cells effort reverse neurodegeneration cells often higher iron content breakdown blood brain barrier may also occur due loss neurons subsequently allow iron access brain accumulate neuroferritinopathy mainly seen reached late adulthood generally seen slowly progress throughout many decades lifetime mean age onset years loss cognition generally seen late stages diagnosed patients seen retain cognitive functioning

neuroferritinopathy results abnormal brain iron accumulation iron accumulation due mutations ftl polypeptide responsible encoding proteins involved iron metabolism neuroferritinopathy commonly caused single insertion nucleotide adenine gene lchain ferritin turn alters carboxyl end entire protein however exact location insertion exon varies neuroferritinopathy may also caused insertion two extra nucleotide bases insertion bases lchain ferritin gene causes chain lengthen alter sequence amino acids found gene also known frameshift mutations result decreased ironbinding oxidative damage caused increased iron leads apoptosis programmed cell accumulation iron brain extremely dangerous excess iron catalyzes formation free radicals damaging effects iron accumulation characteristic neuroferritinopathy particularly affects cerebellum basal ganglia motor cortex regions protein ferritin functions sequester release iron acting iron buffering system cells iron essential brain function oxygen transport cellular metabolism example however careful control iron important increased brain iron levels catalyze formation free radicals create oxidative molecules via fenton oxidative molecules cause oxidative brain damage iron bound ferritin fenton reaction h ferritin protein made heavy chain h light chain l subunits neuroferritinopathy gene encoding light chain mutated several different mutation variations led diagnosis neuroferritinopathy mutations occur light chain mutated light chain believed inhibit ferritins ability effectively sequester hold iron without control iron free cause oxidative brain damage described concentration iron healthy brain varies greatly region region specific regions brain associated motor functions appear larger accumulations iron nonmotorrelated regions observation varying iron concentrations possible explanation correlation movement disorders iron imbalance within central nervous neuroferritinopathy primarily diagnosed older adults specifically adults affected alzheimers disease parkinsons disease iron accumulates brain long periods neuroferritinopathy diagnosed using either neuroimaging techniques physiological

using mri neuroimaging mris help identify iron deposits cerebellum basal ganglia motor cortex common mris affected individuals also show mild cerebellar cerebral atrophy tissue breakdown gas cavity formation importantly mris show misfolded ferritin proteins iron deposits glial cells caudate putamen globus pallidus cerebral cortex thalamus purkinje cells causing neuronal death blood tests usually come back normal affected individuals serve reliable means blood tests show low serum ferritin levels however unreliable method diagnosis patients show typical serum ferritin levels even latest stages cerebral spinal fluid tests also typically ferritin aggregates found skin liver kidney muscle tissues may help diagnosing cytochrome c oxidasenegative fibers also often found muscle biopsies affected
