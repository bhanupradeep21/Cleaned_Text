myrmecia inquilina species ant endemic australia subfamily myrmeciinae first discovered described athol douglas william brown jr ants large measuring millimetres time discovery douglas brown announced inquilina first social parasite among primitive subfamilies today one two known myrmecia species worker caste two host species known myrmecia nigriceps myrmecia vindex aggression inquilina host species occur colonies may produce inquilina brood months inquiline queens begin lay eggs queens eat colony brood trophic eggs myrmecia species may kill inquilina queens reject due restricted distribution threats habitat ant vulnerable according iucn red list discovery inquilina scientists believed parasitic ants exist primitive ant subfamilies known dolichoderinae formicinae myrmicinae many authors believed primitive ants lacked certain trait would prevent parasitic ants forming discovery inquilina hints possible parasitic lifeforms ponerinae army brown collected first specimens large fallen trees western australia officially announced first parasitic ant among primitive subfamilies australian naturalist athol douglas american entomologist william brown jr provided first description ant insectes sociaux journal article specific epithet inquilina derives word inquilinus meaning tenant name references parasitic nature species living inside colony guest another brown discovered holotype female vindex nest march northwest wagin badjanning rocks western australia specimen currently housed western australian museum two dealated paratype females also collected holotype looking similar except mandibles colouration mandibular dentition varies among three one paratypes darker holotype published journal reviewing species groups assigned inquilina cephalotes

southwest western australia holotype collected kilometres miles inquilina occurs colonies vindex nigriceps found soil logs flat rocks commonly found granite outcrops wooded areas trees corymbia calophylla acacia acuminata large unidentified species allocasuarina possibly allocasuarina huegeliana type locality area cleared agricultural purposes areas still wooded many fallen large trees inquilina typically found deep inside nests around centimetres inches found next queen myrmecia inquilina one two known myrmecia species worker caste inquiline nigriceps vindex inquilina polygynous species colonies house two several dozen queens nesting colony originally due inquilina females ergatoid ants lose wings eclosing cocoons parasitic queens may coexist indefinitely inquilina queens replace host brood eggs several months infiltrating occurs inquilina queens eat destroy brood laid host workers even tend brood protect potential invaders inquilina queens tend nest near host queen brood attended worker ants without form aggression observations suggest parasitic queens feed trophic eggs laid workers predatory threats include myrmecia species rejected potential host example regularis workers immediately seize inquilina queens kill soon two species come contact aerial dispersion important species despite restricted distribution queens never forage outside leave nest unless severe deprivation nuptial flight fully developed females start occur pm january queens males start emerge host nest begin mate observations show alates climb onto objects lighted fluorescent lamps begin fly half hour endless running queens looking host nest wandering openly vindex foragers may identify queen seize behaviour suggests workers actively recruit fertilised queens host colonies tend smaller depauperated compared colonies without inquiline queens host colonies still produce alate offspring myrmecia inquilina species genus listed vulnerable iucn red list however needs habitat loss may responsible ant potentially endangered douglas brown note contamination dieldrin spray control argentine ant destroyed many nests housing inquilina burnoffs also threat colonies housing
