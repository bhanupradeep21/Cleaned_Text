immunosuppressive drugs also known immunosuppressive agents immunosuppressants antirejection medications drugs inhibit prevent activity immune system immunosuppressive drugs classified five groupscitation needed pharmacologic supraphysiologic doses glucocorticoids prednisone dexamethasone hydrocortisone used suppress various allergic inflammatory autoimmune disorders also administered posttransplantory immunosuppressants prevent acute transplant rejection graftversushost disease nevertheless prevent infection also inhibit later reparative processes glucocorticoids suppress cellmediated immunity act inhibiting gene expression cytokines including interleukin tnfalpha binding corticosteroid response elements decrease cytokine production reduces cell proliferation decreased cell proliferation decreased production decreases proliferation glucocorticoids also suppress humoral immunity causing b cells express smaller amounts receptors diminishes b cell clone expansion antibody synthesis glucocorticoids influence types inflammatory events matter cause induce synthesis binds cell membranes preventing phospholipase coming contact substrate arachidonic acid leads diminished eicosanoid production cyclooxygenase expression also suppressed potentiating effect glucocorticoids also stimulate escaping extracellular space binds leukocyte membrane receptors inhibits various inflammatory events epithelial adhesion emigration chemotaxis phagocytosis respiratory burst release various inflammatory mediators lysosomal enzymes cytokines tissue plasminogen activator chemokines etc neutrophils macrophages mastocytes cytostatics inhibit cell division immunotherapy used smaller doses treatment malignant diseases affect proliferation cells b cells due highest effectiveness purine analogs frequently administered alkylating agents used immunotherapy nitrogen mustards cyclophosphamide nitrosoureas platinum compounds others cyclophosphamide baxters cytoxan probably potent immunosuppressive compound small doses efficient therapy systemic lupus erythematosus autoimmune hemolytic anemias granulomatosis polyangiitis immune diseases high doses cause pancytopenia hemorrhagic cystitis antimetabolites interfere synthesis nucleic acids include methotrexate folic acid analogue binds dihydrofolate reductase prevents synthesis tetrahydrofolate used treatment autoimmune diseases example rheumatoid arthritis behcets disease transplantations azathioprine prometheus imuran main immunosuppressive cytotoxic substance extensively used control transplant rejection reactions nonenzymatically cleaved mercaptopurine acts purine analogue inhibitor dna synthesis mercaptopurine also administered directly preventing clonal expansion lymphocytes induction phase immune response affects cell humoral immunity also efficient treatment autoimmune diseases among dactinomycin important used kidney transplantations cytotoxic antibiotics anthracyclines mitomycin c bleomycin mithramycin antibodies sometimes used quick potent immunosuppressive therapy prevent acute rejection reactions well targeted treatment lymphoproliferative autoimmune disorders eg monoclonals heterologous polyclonal antibodies obtained serum animals eg rabbit horse injected patients thymocytes lymphocytes antilymphocyte alg antithymocyte antigens atg used part steroidresistant acute rejection reaction grave aplastic anemia treatment however added primarily immunosuppressives diminish dosage toxicity also allow transition cyclosporin therapy polyclonal antibodies inhibit lymphocytes cause lysis complementmediated cytolysis cellmediated opsonization followed removal reticuloendothelial cells circulation spleen liver way polyclonal antibodies inhibit cellmediated immune reactions including graft rejection delayed hypersensitivity ie tuberculin skin reaction graftversushost disease gvhd influence thymusdependent antibody production march two preparations available market atgam obtained horse serum thymoglobuline obtained rabbit serum polyclonal antibodies affect lymphocytes cause general immunosuppression possibly leading posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders ptld serious infections especially cytomegalovirus reduce risks treatment provided hospital adequate isolation infection available usually administered five days intravenously appropriate quantity patients stay hospital long three weeks give immune system time recover point longer risk serum sickness high immunogenicity polyclonal antibodies almost patients acute reaction treatment characterized fever rigor episodes even anaphylaxis later treatment patients develop serum sickness immune complex glomerulonephritis serum sickness arises seven fourteen days therapy begun patient fever joint pain erythema soothed use steroids analgesics urticaria hives also present possible diminish toxicity using highly purified serum fractions intravenous administration combination immunosuppressants example calcineurin inhibitors cytostatics corticosteroids frequent combination use antibodies ciclosporin simultaneously order prevent patients gradually developing strong immune response drugs reducing eliminating effectiveness monoclonal antibodies directed towards exactly defined antigens therefore cause fewer sideeffects especially significant receptor antibodies used prevent rejection transplanted organs also track changes lymphocyte subpopulations reasonable expect similar new drugs future murine monoclonal antibody type previously used prevent tcell activation proliferation binding tcell receptor complex present differentiated cells one first potent immunosuppressive substances administered control steroid andor polyclonal antibodiesresistant acute rejection episodes acts specifically polyclonal antibodies also used prophylactically transplantations however longer mouse monoclonal antibody replaced clinic chimeric humanized human monoclonal antibodies muromonabs mechanism action partially understood known molecule binds receptor complex first administrations binding nonspecifically activates tcells leading serious syndrome minutes later characterized fever myalgia headache arthralgia sometimes develops lifethreatening reaction cardiovascular system central nervous system requiring lengthy therapy past period blocks tcrantigen binding causes conformational change removal entire complex tcell surface lowers number available tcells perhaps sensitizing uptake epithelial reticular cells crossbinding molecules well activates intracellular signal causing cell anergy apoptosis unless cells receive another signal costimulatory molecule antibodies shift balance cells stimulates patient may develop neutralizing antibodies reducing effectiveness cause excessive immunosuppression although antibodies act specifically polyclonal antibodies lower cellmediated immunity significantly predisposing patient opportunistic infections important immune system regulator necessary clone expansion survival activated lymphocytes effects mediated trimer cell surface receptor consisting α β γ

ciclosporin thought bind cytosolic protein cyclophilin immunophilin immunocompetent lymphocytes especially tlymphocytes complex ciclosporin cyclophilin inhibits phosphatase calcineurin normal circumstances induces transcription drug also inhibits lymphokine production interleukin release leading reduced function effector tcells ciclosporin used treatment acute rejection reactions increasingly substituted newer less immunosuppressants calcineurin inhibitors azathioprine linked posttransplant malignancies skin cancers organ transplant recipients nonmelanoma skin cancer nmsc kidney transplantation common result significant morbidity mortality results several studies suggest calcineurin inhibitors oncogenic properties mainly linked production cytokines promote tumor growth metastasis angiogenesis drug reported reduce frequency regulatory cells treg converting cni monotherapy mycophenolate monotherapy patients found increased graft success treg tacrolimus trade names prograf astagraf xl envarsus xr product bacterium streptomyces tsukubensis macrolide lactone acts inhibiting calcineurin drug used primarily liver kidney transplantations although clinics used heart
