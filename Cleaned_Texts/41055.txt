sinus augmentation performed less invasive osteotome technique several variations technique originate original technique dr tatum first published drs boyne james dr robert b described technique normally performed sinus floor needs lifted less mm technique performed flapping back gum tissue making socket bone within mm short sinus membrane floor sinus lifted tapping sinus floor use osteotomes amount augmentation achieved osteotome technique usually less achieved lateral window technique dental implant normally placed socket formed time sinus lift procedure left integrate bone bone integration normally lasts months goal procedure stimulate bone growth form thicker sinus floor order support dental implants teeth replacement sinus dimensions shape significantly influence new bone formation transcrestal sinus floor elevation technique regeneration substantial amount new bone predictable outcome narrow sinus cavities presurgical planning bucco palatal sinus width regarded crucial parameter choosing sinus floor elevation transcrestal approach treatment dr bruschi described similar technique localized management sinus floor lmsf based partial thickness flap procedure technique increases malleability crestal bone uses bone directly sinus rather bone medial wall thus used extreme cases bone resorption would normally need treated lateral wall technique healing period reduced months recently electrical introduced simplify application similar techniques major risk sinus augmentation sinus membrane could pierced ripped remedies occur include stitching tear placing patch cases surgery stopped altogether tear given time heal usually three six months often sinus membrane grows back thicker stronger making success likely second operationcitation needed although rarely reported secondary intervention also successful primary surgery limited elevation membrane without insertion additional besides tearing sinus membrane risks involved sinus augmentation surgery
