haemophilus influenzae formerly called pfeiffers bacillus bacillus influenzae gramnegative nonmotile coccobacillary facultatively anaerobic capnophilic pathogenic bacterium family pasteurellaceae bacteria mesophilic grow best temperatures h influenzae first described richard pfeiffer influenza incorrectly attributed haemophilus influenzae causative microbe bacteria retain name h influenzae responsible wide range localized invasive infections typically infants including pneumonia meningitis bloodstream treatment consists antibiotics however h influenzae often resistant penicillin family amoxicillinclavulanic acid used mild recommended form prevention type b form h influenzae series hib vaccine boosters often given age sometimes conjunction vaccines form dtapipvhib species first freeliving microorganism entire genome two major categories h influenzae defined unencapsulated strains encapsulated strains encapsulated strains classified basis distinct capsular antigens six generally recognized types encapsulated h influenzae b c e h influenzae type b also known hib common form recognizable polyribosyl ribitol phosphate prp capsule found mostly types e f isolated infrequently types c rarely isolated unencapsulated strains genetically diverse encapsulated unencapsulated strains termed nontypable nthi lack capsular serotypes however classified multilocus sequence typing nthi strains considered part normal human flora upper lower respiratory tract genitals conjunctivae mucous membranes h influenzae small gramnegative bacterium approximately micrometer like gramnegative bacteria h influenzae thin peptidoglycan layer surrounded outer membrane containing types h influenzae contain polysaccharide capsule around outer membrane aid protection bacteria pleomorphic meaning shape bacterium variable however typically coccobacillus h influenzae contains pili specialized adhere human nasopharynx h influenzae pili unlike e coli resist unwinding allowing stronger adhesion resist expulsion coughing minority nontypeable unencapsulated h influenzae employ variety attachment techniques pili adhesins hia hap though bacteria possess pili used traditional movement motility bacterium still considered cell wall h influenzae bacterium contains various proteins referred autotransporters adherence colony formation h influenzae prefers bind mucus linings nonciliated epithelial cells facilitated hapùò¥ autotransporters cell wall binding unknown receptors within hapùò¥ autotransporters also facilitate formation microcolonies bacteria microcolonies likely responsible formation various biofilms within body responsible middle ear lung penicillin binding proteins pbps contain penicillin binding domains involved peptidoglycan metabolism makes cell wall give bacterial cells betalactams used antibiotics bind pbps order target peptidoglycan isolates h influenzae contained modified pbps resist betalactam action producing betalactamases resistance likely due mutation substitution conjunction another unknown mutation substitution alone lower affinity penicillin therefore cause resistance betalactamase emergence caused therapy severe cases h influenzae changed ampicillin cephalosporins however resistance cephalosporins occurred due changes transpeptidase domain penicillin binding protein clinical features may include initial symptoms upper respiratory tract infection mimicking viral infection usually associated lowgrade fevers may progress lower respiratory tract within days features often resembling wheezy bronchitis sputum may difficult expectorate often grey creamy color cough may persist weeks without appropriate treatment many cases diagnosed presenting chest infections respond penicillins firstgeneration cephalosporins chest xray identify alveolar clinical diagnosis invasive h influenzae infection typically confirmed bacterial culture latex particle agglutination tests polymerase chain reaction tests clinical samples obtained sterile body site respect h influenzae cultured nasopharyngeal cavity throat would indicate h influenzae disease sites colonized diseasefree however h influenzae isolated cerebrospinal fluid blood joint fluid would indicate h influenzae infection bacterial culture h influenzae performed agar plates preferable one chocolate agar added x hemin v nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide factors ideal concentration culture blood agar growth achieved satellite phenomenon around bacteria colonies h influenzae appear convex smooth pale grey transparent gram stained microscopic observation specimen h influenzae show gramnegative coccobacillus cultured organism characterized using catalase oxidase tests positive serological testing necessary distinguish capsular polysaccharide differentiate h influenzae b nonencapsulated speciescitation needed although highly specific bacterial culture h influenzae lacks sensitivity use antibiotics prior sample collection greatly reduces isolation rate killing bacteria identification recent work shown hinfluenzae uses highly specialized spectrum nutrients lactate preferred carbon h influenzae grow hemolytic zone staphylococcus aureus blood agar plates hemolysis cells aureus releases factor v needed growth h influenzae grow outside hemolytic zone aureus due lack nutrients factor v latex particle agglutination test lat sensitive method detect h influenzae method relies antigen rather viable bacteria results disrupted prior antibiotic use also added benefit much quicker culture methods however antibiotic sensitivity testing possible lat alone parallel culture polymerase chain reaction pcr assays proven sensitive either lat culture tests highly pcr tests used capsular typing encapsulated h influenzae h influenzae generally found within upon human body also live various dry hard surfaces strains h influenzae opportunistic pathogens usually live host without causing disease cause problems factors viral infection reduced immune function chronically inflamed tissues eg allergies create opportunity infect host sticking host cell using trimeric autotransporter pathogenesis h influenzae infections completely understood although presence polyribosyl ribitol phosphate prp capsule encapsulated type b hib serotype causing conditions epiglottitis known major factor capsule allows resist phagocytosis complementmediated lysis nonimmune host unencapsulated strains almost always less invasive however produce inflammatory response humans lead many symptoms vaccination hib conjugate vaccine effective preventing hib infection prevent infection nthi haemophilus influenzae cause respiratory tract infections including pneumonia otitis media epiglottitis swelling throat eye infections bloodstream

responsible aggressive infections introduction hib infants young children h influenzae type b hib causes bacteremia pneumonia epiglottitis acute bacterial occasion causes cellulitis osteomyelitis infectious arthritis one cause neonatal due routine use hib vaccine us since incidence invasive hib disease decreased however hib remains major cause lower respiratory tract infections infants children developing countries vaccine widely used unencapsulated h influenzae strains unaffected hib vaccine cause ear infections otitis media eye infections conjunctivitis sinusitis children associated many microbes colonize within host organism colonization occurs microorganism continues multiply within host without interaction causing visible signs illness infection haemophilus influenzae colonizes differently adults young children bacterium colonizes rapidly young children capable carrying one strain bacterium adult stage life human likely carrying one strain bacterium colonize aggressively adults nearly infants undergo colonization bacteria within first year strains haemophilus influenzae produce betalactamases also able modify penicillinbinding proteins bacteria gained resistance penicillin family antibiotics severe cases cefotaxime ceftriaxone delivered directly bloodstream elected antibiotics less severe cases association ampicillin sulbactam cephalosporins second third generation fluoroquinolones preferred fluoroquinoloneresistant haemophilus influenzae macrolides fluoroquinolones activity nontypeable h influenzae could used patients history allergy
