versicolor males begin trading advertisement calls even though advertisement calls primarily used attract females still play role malemale interactions rarely conflict escalates point transitions

however increasing distance males producing overlapping calls may reduce cost usually causes females choose potential mates distance males allows female distinguish calls opposed overlapping calls produced close points make two individual males harder distinguish sound means h versicolor males forced make specific timedcall responses initiations increase mate attractiveness compared chorus

produced may occasionally still attracted aggressive calls females also exhibit preference within range advertisement call frequencies generally prefer advertisement calls aggressive ones range advertisement aggressive call frequencies h versicolor males capable producing certain frequencies based size properties vocal females attracted longer male calls also supported preference advertisement calls aggressive aggressive calls nearby males reduce attractiveness advertisement calls given male frogs change vocalizations female frogs move closer order increase likelihood advertisement call received female noise vocalizations could obscure versicolor males specifically increasing length calls several lengths normal advertisement males also lengthen duration calls see female sense touch females initiate mating position touching male frog resulting male frog vocalizing one two especially long calls known courting versicolor males known follow similar pattern seen species termed graded aggressive calling compared aggressive calls h versicolor male aggressive calls lower frequency advertisement calls however decrease frequency aggressive calls aggressiveness
