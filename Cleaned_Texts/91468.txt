antihistamines control symptoms people experience hives angioedema require emergency treatment lifethreatening condition treatment guidelines management chronic hives according american practice parameters treatment involves stepwise approach step consists second generation receptor blocking antihistamines systemic glucocorticoids also used episodes severe disease used long term due long list side effects step consists increasing dose current antihistamine adding antihistamines adding leukotriene receptor antagonist montelukast step consists adding replacing current treatment hydroxyzine doxepin individual doesnt respond steps considered refractory symptoms point antiinflammatory medications dapsone sulfasalazine immunosuppressants cyclosporin sirolimus medications like omalizumab used options explained detail nonsedating second generation antihistamines block histamine receptors first line firstgeneration antihistamines diphenhydramine hydroxyzine recommended first line therapy block brain peripheral receptors causing sedation secondgeneration antihistamines loratadine cetirizine fexofenadine desloratadine selectively antagonize peripheral receptors less sedating less anticholinergic generally preferred firstgeneration fexofenadine newgeneration antihistamine blocks histamine receptors may less sedating secondgeneration people respond maximum dose antihistamines may benefit increasing dose switching another nonsedating antihistamine adding leukotriene antagonist using older antihistamine using systemic steroids finally using ciclosporin steroids often associated rebound hives antagonists sometimes used addition treat urticaria limited evidence oral glucocorticoids effective controlling symptoms chronic hives however extensive list
