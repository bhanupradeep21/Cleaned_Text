central place foraging cpf theory evolutionary ecology model analyzing organism maximize foraging rates traveling patch discrete resource concentration maintains key distinction forager traveling home

anthropologists studying human behavioral ecology orians pearson found redwinged blackbirds eastern washington state tend capture larger number single species prey items per trip compared species costa rica brought back large single foraging specialization costa rican blackbirds attributed increased search handling costs nocturnal foraging whereas birds eastern washington forage diurnally prey
