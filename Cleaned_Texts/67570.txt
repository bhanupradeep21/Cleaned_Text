phenytoin believed protect seizures causing voltagedependent block voltage gated sodium blocks sustained high frequency repetitive firing action potentials accomplished reducing amplitude sodiumdependent action potentials enhancing steadystate inactivation sodium channels exist three main conformations resting state open state inactive state phenytoin binds preferentially inactive form
