unitary theories memory hypotheses attempt unify mechanisms shortterm longterm memory one find early contributions unitary memory theories works john mcgeoch benton underwood geoffrey keppel arthur melton robert crowder argued separate shortterm store starting late james nairne proposed one first unitary theories criticized alan baddeleys working memory dominant theory functions shortterm memory theories since nairne proposed highlight alternative mechanisms working memory model initially overlooked working memory system responsible transient holding processing new already stored information important process reasoning comprehension learning memory updating working memory generally used synonymously short term memory depends two forms memory working memory includes subsystems store manipulate visual images verbal information well central executive coordinates subsystems includes visual representation possible moves awareness flow information memory stored limited amount baddeley introduced made popular multicomponent model working memory theory proposes central executive among things responsible directing attention relevant information suppressing irrelevant information inappropriate actions coordinating cognitive processes one task must done time central executive two slave systems responsible shortterm maintenance information central executive responsible supervision information integration coordinating slave systems one slave system phonological loop pl stores phonological information sound language prevents decay continuously articulating contents thereby refreshing information rehearsal loop example maintain sevendigit telephone number long one repeats number oneself slave system visuospatial sketchpad stores visual spatial information used example constructing manipulating visual images representation mental maps sketchpad broken visual subsystem dealing instance shape colour texture spatial subsystem dealing location baddeley extended model adding fourth component episodic buffer holds representations integrate phonological visual spatial information possibly information covered slave systems eg semantic information musical information component episodic assumed bind information unitary episodic representation episodic buffer resembles tulvings concept episodic memory differs episodic buffer temporary feature model first described nairne primary feature model use cues short term memory long term memory cues become associated memory later used retrieve memories long term storage memory formed cues associated formed memory form constellation nerve networks memory stored cues present nerves form constellation active memory worked short term memory cues longer present constellation longer active waiting long term memory storage cues present rather using theory decay explaining memories get forgotten feature model focuses item based interference instead means items use similar constellations cues get way remembering memories example trying remember fruit list electronics find fruit easy recall recalling fruit list fruit hand prove far difficult task theory behind memory loss used feature model oscillator based associative recall oscar model proposed browne preece hulme oscar model another cue driven model memory model cues work pointer memory position mind memories stored context vectors brown calls oscillator part theory memory used short term memory context vector oscillates away starting position cue becomes present context vector cue points gets oscillated back starting point memory used short term memory theory decay model account memory loss fading theory states memories move starting point retrieval becomes difficult memory gas station starting position furthermore memories oscillate faster others theory behind memories frequently accessed used move slower away starting point since probability memory retrieved relatively high critics model unlike standard models short termworking memory unitary theories assume direct connection activation level memory success also propose role rehearsal focus item based interference rather memory unitary theories also generally one loop loop whereas working memory model relies multiple loops explain different forms memory input multiple loop theory working memory difficult time explaining short term memory gets consolidated long term memory whereas unitary theories generally explain long term memory using single principle use explain short term memory hand unitary theories trouble explaining situations short term memory differs word length easily explained working memory model prevalent criticism unitary models try oversimplify many complex processes single mechanism studies shown shortterm memory longterm memory two distinct processes emphasize different levels activation brain among different cortical areas furthermore rate decay much faster shortterm memory opposed longterm memory oscar model particular account phenomenon also makes assumption memories always circulating different areas definite cortical space stores memory transfer storage occurring rate decay oscar model either constant nonexistent rates implausible constant rate decay neglects external factors may contribute faster rate decay eg stress focusing attention things failing neglect decay even implausible makes two wrong forgotten information remembered remembered perfectly every time unitary theories memory may give attention alternate factors working memory model initially overlooked new data surfaced model adapted new findings still standard model shortterm memory works continue standard model new evidence overturns httpsenwikipediaorgwikiunitarytheoriesofmemory
