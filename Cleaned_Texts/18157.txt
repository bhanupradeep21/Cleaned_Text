silver nitrate inorganic compound chemical formula versatile precursor many silver compounds used photography far less sensitive light halides called lunar caustic silver called luna ancient alchemists associated silver solid silver nitrate silver ions threecoordinated trigonal planar albertus magnus century documented ability nitric acid separate gold silver dissolving indeed silver nitrate prepared dissolving silver nitric acid followed evaporation solution stoichiometry reaction depends upon concentration nitric acid used structure silver nitrate examined xray crystallography

nitrate decomposes heated qualitatively decomposition negligible melting point becomes appreciable around fully decomposes metal nitrates thermally decompose respective oxides silver oxide decomposes lower temperature silver nitrate decomposition silver nitrate yields elemental silver instead silver nitrate least expensive salt silver offers several advantages well nonhygroscopic contrast silver fluoroborate silver perchlorate addition relatively stable light dissolves numerous solvents including water nitrate easily replaced ligands rendering versatile treatment solutions halide ions gives

halide sources produce insoluble silver halide cream precipitate used white precipitate used yellow precipitate used reaction commonly used inorganic chemistry abstract halides silver salts noncoordinating anions namely silver tetrafluoroborate silver hexafluorophosphate used demanding applications similarly reaction used analytical chemistry confirm presence chloride bromide iodide ions
