epinephrine also known adrenaline medication medication used treat several conditions including anaphylaxis cardiac arrest asthma superficial inhaled epinephrine may used improve symptoms may also used asthma treatments given intravenously injection muscle inhalation injection common side effects include shakiness anxiety fast heart rate high blood pressure may occasionally may result abnormal

product available intramuscular injection complicated depth subcutaneous fat varies may result subcutaneous injection may injected intravenously error wrong strength intramuscular injection gives faster higher pharmacokinetic profile compared subcutaneous epinephrine also used bronchodilator asthma specific agonists unavailable given subcutaneous intramuscular routes asthma appropriate dose high intrinsic efficacy receptor binding ability epinephrine high drug concentrations cause adverse side effects treating asthma value using nebulized epinephrine acute asthma racemic epinephrine historically used treatment regular epinephrine however works equally wellfact opinioncitation needed racemic adrenaline mixture two enantiomers lform active racemic adrenaline works stimulating alphaadrenergic receptors airway resultant mucosal vasoconstriction decreased subglottic edema stimulating β adrenergic receptors resultant relaxation bronchial smooth lack consensus whether inhaled

commonly used treat glaucoma may also lead buildup adrenochrome pigments conjunctiva iris lens retina rarely exposure medically administered epinephrine may cause takotsubo use contraindicated people nonselective βblockers severe hypertension even cerebral hemorrhage may hormone epinephrine acts nearly body tissues actions vary tissue type tissue expression adrenergic receptors example high epinephrine levels cause smooth muscle relaxation airways cause contraction smooth muscle lines arteriolescitation needed epinephrine acts binding variety adrenergic receptors epinephrine nonselective agonist adrenergic receptors including major subtypes epinephrines binding receptors triggers several metabolic changes binding αadrenergic receptors inhibits insulin secretion pancreas stimulates glycogenolysis liver stimulates glycolysis inhibits insulinmediated glycogenesis β adrenergic receptor binding triggers glucagon secretion pancreas increased adrenocorticotropic hormone acth secretion pituitary gland increased lipolysis adipose tissue together effects increase blood glucose fatty acids providing substrates energy production within cells throughout heart coronary arteries predominance receptors cause vasodilation coronary arteries presence actions increase peripheral resistance via receptordependent vasoconstriction increase cardiac output via binding receptors goal reducing peripheral circulation increase coronary cerebral perfusion pressures therefore increase oxygen exchange cellular epinephrine increase aortic cerebral carotid circulation pressure lowers carotid blood flow endtidal levels appears epinephrine may improve macrocirculation expense capillary beds perfusion takes extracts adrenal gland first obtained polish physiologist napoleon cybulski
