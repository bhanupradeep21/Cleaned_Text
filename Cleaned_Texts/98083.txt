plant genetic resources describe variability within plants comes human natural selection millennia intrinsic value mainly concerns agricultural crops crop biodiversity according revised international undertaking plant genetic resources food agriculture food agriculture organization fao plant genetic resources defined entire generative vegetative reproductive material species economical andor social value especially agriculture present future special emphasis nutritional state world plant genetic resources food agriculture fao defined plant genetic resources food agriculture pgrfa diversity genetic material contained traditional varieties modern cultivars well crop wild relatives wild plant species used future food first use plant genetic resources dates years ago farmers selected genetic variation found wild plants develop crops human populations moved different climates ecosystems taking crops crops adapted new environments developing example genetic traits providing tolerance conditions drought water logging frost extreme heat traits plasticity inherent wide genetic variability important properties plant genetic resourcescitation needed recent centuries although humans prolific collecting exotic flora corners globe fill gardens early century widespread organized collection plant genetic resources agricultural use began earnest russian geneticist nikolai vavilov considered father plant genetic resources realized value genetic variability breeding collected thousands seeds extensive travels establish one first gene vavilov inspired american jack harlan collect seeds across globe united states department agriculture david fairchild another botanist usda successfully introduced many important crops eg cherries soybeans pistachios united term genetic resources coined otto frankel erna bennett historic international conference crop plant exploration conservation organized fao international biological program effective utilization genetic resources requires adequately classified evaluated key message plant genetic resource conservation become increasingly important plants become threatened rare time exploding world population rapid climate
