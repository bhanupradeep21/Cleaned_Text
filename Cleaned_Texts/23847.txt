apostatic selection form negative frequencydependent selection describes survival individual prey animals different mutation species way makes likely ignored predators operates polymorphic species species different forms apostatic selection common forms species preyed rarer forms giving rare forms selective advantage also discussed apostatic selection acts stabilize prey polymorphisms term apostatic selection introduced bryan clarke reference predation polymorphic grove snails since used synonym negative frequencydependent behavioural basis apostatic selection initially neglected eventually established ab apostatic selection also apply predator predator various morphs multiple concepts closely linked apostatic selection one idea prey switching another term used look different aspect phenomenon well concept search image search images relevant apostatic selection predator able detect organism possible prey apostatic selection important evolution sustain stable equilibrium morph frequencies hence maintains large amounts genetic diversity natural important note however rare morph present population always mean apostatic selection occur rare morph could targeted higher rate predators view able select rare morphs actually increases predators prey switching predators switch primary prey alternative food source various related apostatic selection rare morph selected going increase abundance specific population becomes recognized predator prey switching therefore seems result apostatic selection prey switching related prey preference well abundance also determined apostatic selection causes stabilization prey polymorphisms due limitations predators since common prey type abundant able produce offspring grow exponentially faster rate rare morph since much smaller numbers however due fact common morph preyed upon frequently diminishes expected rate reproduction thus maintaining population stable amounts common rare essentially unless environmental change evolutionary change predator prey occurs stable equilibrium produced search image individual uses order detect prey predator detect something prey must fit criteria rare morph species may fit search image thus seen prey gives rare morphs advantage takes time predator learn new search search image shift require multiple encounters new form prey since rare morph typically encountered multiple times especially row prey left undetected example blue tit searches insect prey using search image leaving scarcer types prey untouched predatory birds insecteating tits parus sometimes look single cryptic type prey even though equally palatable cryptic prey present lower luuk tinbergen proposed birds formed search image typical image prey predator remember use spot prey image search image beneficial increases proficiency predator finding common morph apostatic selection serves hypothesis persistence polymorphism population variation maintains prey apostatic selection referred selection variation used explanation many types polymorphism various species including diversity tropical insects selective pressure tropical insects look distinct possible high insects appear lowest density population ones preyed order apostatic selection occur rare morph advantage variety criteria need met first needs polymorphism present addition prey present equal proportions since would benefit able detect either related frequencydependent predation predator obtains greatest advantage search image common type prey causes common form prey changes prey detection predators occur speed occur flexibility predators search image depend environment frequency different prey types continuously changes predator may able change behavior rate provide situations predators able change search image rapidly flexible search image able survive relation apostatic selection rapid changes prey frequencies decrease advantage rare morph predators broad search image able rapidly change search however rapid changes polymorphism frequencies also advantage prey rare morph since long periods time generally required natural selection act predators degree flexibility search image may able changed short time therefore quickly arising rare morphs favored apostatic selection predators able change behavior search image short time frame thus biological process victim evolutionary time delay apostatic selection strongest environments prey rare morphism match suggested frequencydependent predation number encounters prey shapes predators ability detect prey based assumption predator learning foraging behaviour going obtain common form prey frequently since predator learns frequently captured common morph identified foraging behaviour shaped learned preference thus causing apostatic selection conferring fitness benefit rare prey concluded search image formation adaption mechanism causes common prey type easily distinguished environment thus eaten frequently rarer types various types experiments done look apostatic selection involve artificial prey easier control external variables simulated environment though using wild specimens increases studys external validity often computer screen simulation program used animals birds prey detect prey another type looks apostatic selection act predator well prey predator plumage polymorphism also influenced apostatic selection hypothesized mutant predator morph become abundant population due apostatic selection prey able recognize often common predator apostatic selection observed humans animals proving exclusive lower organisms cognition requires applicable organisms display learning though lot work experimental lab controlled examples happening wild specimens natural habitat species hawks almost polymorphism found ventral side allows less common coloration favored since recognized polymorphism established foraging strategies creating opportunities apostatic different morphs varying selection prey perception bias maintains prey polymorphism due apostatic apostatic selection reflected batesian mimicry aposematism apostatic selection used explain defensive signaling like batesian mimicry certain paper pfenning et al looks concept allopatric situations situations separate species overlap geographically mimic phenotypes high fitness selected model present absent suffer intense predation pfennings article suggested caused apostatic selection strength selection higher mimics original model batesian mimicry mimic less common model rare mimic phenotype selected predator continued reinforcement prey harmful unpalatable mimic becomes common model situation reverses mimic preyed upon often therefore dishonest signals prey selected depending predation example apostatic selection birds observed allen clarke grounddwelling passerines presented wild birds natural habitat artificial dimorphic two colors prey presented ratios prey switched colors opportunity four passerine species observed common morph artificial prey consumed frequently regardless study also second component allowed birds become familiar one color prey presented dimorphic prey equal amounts case passerines consumed prey accustomed consistent idea search image influences apostatic selection familiar form encountered frequently preferred prey apostatic selection also studied cichlid fish presents rare
