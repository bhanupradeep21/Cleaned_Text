early discoveries include development monoclonal antibodybased twosite elisa institute became known work fibronectin extracellular matrix components cell adhesion highlights include discovery rgd tripeptide cell attachment site fibronectin fibrinogen adhesive proteins discovery integrins cell surface receptors recognize rgd sequence matrix institute scientists made important contributions research programmed cell death prominence discovery several previously unknown pro antiapoptotic proteins namely caspases iaps family demonstration institute scientists cells deprived attachment extracellular matrix commit suicide apoptosis named anoikis connected cell adhesion apoptosis findings essentially explained normal cells stay appropriate place whereas cancer cells spread metastasize reduced integrin function malignant cells makes possible leave original tissue increased expression antiapoptotic proteins prevents anoikis enabling cancer invasion metastasis several drugs brought
