focused hard studies sometimes forgot skłodowska studied day tutored evenings barely earning keep awarded degree physics began work industrial laboratory gabriel lippmann meanwhile continued studying university paris aid fellowship able earn second degree skłodowska begun scientific career paris investigation magnetic properties various steels commissioned society encouragement national year pierre curie entered life mutual interest natural sciences drew pierre curie instructor city paris industrial physics chemistry higher educational institution espci introduced polish physicist józef wieruszkowalski learned looking larger laboratory space something wieruszkowalski thought pierre could though curie large laboratory able find space skłodowska able begin mutual passion science brought increasingly closer began develop feelings one eventually pierre proposed marriage first skłodowska accept still planning go back native country curie however declared ready move poland even

married neither wanted religious curies dark blue outfit worn instead bridal gown would serve many years laboratory shared two pastimes long bicycle trips journeys abroad brought even closer pierre marie found new love partner scientific collaborator could wilhelm röntgen discovered existence xrays though mechanism behind production yet henri becquerel discovered uranium salts emitted rays resembled xrays penetrating demonstrated radiation unlike phosphorescence depend external source energy seemed arise spontaneously uranium influenced two important discoveries curie decided look uranium rays possible field research used innovative technique investigate samples fifteen years earlier husband brother developed version electrometer sensitive device measuring electric using husbands electrometer discovered uranium rays caused air around sample conduct electricity using technique first result finding activity uranium compounds depended quantity uranium hypothesized radiation outcome interaction molecules must come atom hypothesis important step disproving assumption atoms daughter irène born support family curie began teaching école normale curies dedicated laboratory research carried converted shed next shed formerly medical school dissecting room poorly ventilated even unaware deleterious effects radiation exposure attendant continued unprotected work radioactive substances espci sponsor research would receive subsidies metallurgical mining companies various organizations curies systematic studies included two uranium minerals pitchblende torbernite also known electrometer showed pitchblende four times active uranium chalcolite twice active concluded earlier results relating quantity uranium activity correct two minerals must contain small quantities another substance far active began systematic search additional substances emit radiation discovered element thorium also pierre curie increasingly intrigued work invested decided drop work crystals join research idea writes reid one helped formulate although took husband opinion clearly established ownership later recorded fact twice biography husband ensure chance whatever ambiguity likely already early stage career realized many scientists would find difficult believe woman could capable original work acutely aware importance promptly publishing discoveries thus establishing priority becquerel two years earlier presented discovery académie des sciences day made credit discovery radioactivity even nobel prize would instead gone silvanus thompson curie chose rapid means publication paper giving brief simple account work presented académie april former professor gabriel even thompson beaten becquerel curie beaten race tell discovery thorium gives rays way uranium two months earlier gerhard carl schmidt published finding time one else world physics noticed curie recorded sentence paper describing much greater activities pitchblende chalcolite uranium fact remarkable leads belief minerals may contain element much active uranium later would recall felt passionate desire verify hypothesis rapidly april curies optimistically weighed sample pitchblende ground pestle mortar realize time searching present minute quantities would eventually process tonnes july curie husband published joint paper announcing existence element named polonium honour native poland would another twenty years remain partitioned among three empires russian austrian december curies announced existence second element named radium latin word course research also coined word prove discoveries beyond doubt curies sought isolate polonium radium pure pitchblende complex mineral chemical separation constituents arduous task discovery polonium relatively easy chemically resembles element bismuth polonium bismuthlike substance radium however elusive closely related chemically barium pitchblende contains elements curies obtained traces radium appreciable quantities uncontaminated barium still beyond curies undertook arduous task separating radium salt differential crystallization tonne pitchblende onetenth gram radium chloride separated isolated pure radium never succeeded isolating polonium halflife curies published jointly separately total scientific papers including one announced exposed radium diseased tumourforming cells destroyed faster healthy curie became first woman faculty member école normale supérieure husband joined faculty university visited poland occasion fathers june supervised gabriel lippmann curie awarded doctorate university month couple invited royal institution london give speech radioactivity woman prevented speaking pierre curie alone allowed meanwhile new industry began developing based curies patent discovery
