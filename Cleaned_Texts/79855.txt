tyrannosaurids highly narrowed premaxilla pneumatic opening upper extension maxilla lack vertical ridgelike structure lateral surface unlike traditional tyrannosaurids prominent deepset jaws thick teeth qianzhousaurus particularly elongated snout restored narrow teeth holotype specimen notably larger mature holotypes species alioramus however since sutures cervical dorsal vertebrae partially fused holotype seems come immature animal likely subadult qianzhousaurus longlegged animal cm long femur cm long discovery qianzhousaurus led new branch tyrannosaur family named consisting longsnouted q sinensis two known species alioramus clade named tribe alioramini uncertain placement relative members tyrannosaur branch initial analysis discovered primary phylogenetic analysis found alioramini closer tyrannosaurus albertosaurus therefore member group tyrannosaurinae however second analysis paper found located outside clade including albertosaurinae tyrannosaurinae therefore sister group tyrannosauridae first analysis found gorgosaurus albertosaurus qianzhousaurus alioramus altai alioramus remotus teratophoneus daspletosaurus tyrannosaurus tarbosaurus thomas carr colleagues regarded qianzhousaurus junior synonym alioramus based reasoning recovered sister species phylogenetic analysis despite argument indicated synonymy necessarily constitute taxonomic reevaluation however foster colleagues conducted detailed redescription holotype skull qianzhousaurus finding several traits unique genus hence supporting separation alioramus study three known species two known alioramin genera qianzhousaurus alioramus altai remotus respectively suggests variation seen various species consistent growth trends seen tyrannosaurid genera though specimens could constitute full growth series infant adult species recovered theropods qianzhousaurus represents largest mature animal found within alioramini thus far represents adult level maturity one part growth series across specimens study discovered remain unique alioramin tyrannosaurs rugose process jugal starts small conical becomes massive indistinct animals grow study also suggests alioramins undergo secondary metamorphosis slender juveniles robust adults like tyrannosaurs maintained unique physiology better suited pursuit fast foster colleagues indicated qianzhousaurus alioramins due slim gracile build may hunters small particularly fast nimble prey would allowed tyrannosaurids avoid competition larger robust relatives specialized killing larger animals long delicate snouts alioramins like alioramus qianzhousaurus may prevented killing prey juvenile adult tyrannosaurids like tarbosaurus hunted though larger tyrannosaurs may hunted alioramins prey occasion alioramins may also different feeding strategy tyrannosaurids jaws seem weaker larger genera even juveniles larger species proportionately higher bite forces alioramins equivalent size furthermore alioramini seemingly remained confined asia suggesting factor prevented colonizing bettersampled fossil deposits north america may remains mystery present qianzhousaurus known nanxiong formation dated latest maastrichtian age late cretaceous
