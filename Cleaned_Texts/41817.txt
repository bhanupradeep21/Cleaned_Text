leslie eleazer orgel january october british chemist known theories origin life leslie orgel born london england january received bachelor arts degree chemistry firstclass honours university oxford elected fellow magdalen college oxford awarded phd chemistry orgel started career theoretical inorganic chemist continued studies field oxford california institute technology university chicago together sydney brenner jack dunitz dorothy hodgkin beryl oughton one first people april see model structure dna constructed francis crick james watson time scientists working oxford universitys chemistry according late dr beryl oughton later rimmer travelled together two cars dorothy hodgkin announced cambridge see model structure dna impressed new dna model especially brenner subsequently worked crick orgel also worked crick salk institute biological joined chemistry department cambridge university work transition metal chemistry ligand field theory published several peerreviewed journal articles wrote textbook entitled transition metal chemistry ligand field theory developed orgel diagram showing energies electronic terms transition metal complexes orgel formulated proteintranslation errorcatastrophe theory aging prior use term manfred eigen mutational error catastrophe since experimentally orgel appointed senior fellow research professor salk institute biological studies la jolla california directed chemical evolution laboratory also adjunct professor department chemistry biochemistry university california san diego one five principal investigators nasasponsored nscort program exobiology orgel also participated nasas viking mars lander program member molecular analysis team designed gas chromatography mass spectrometer instrument robots took planet mars orgels lab came across economical way make cytarabine compound one todays commonly used anticancer agents together stanley miller orgel also suggested peptide nucleic acids rather ribonucleic acids constituted first prebiotic systems capable selfreplication early earth name popularly known orgels rules credited particularly orgels second rule evolution cleverer book origins life orgel coined concept specified complexity describe criterion living organisms distinguished nonliving matter published three hundred articles research areas orgel presented life conference trinity college dublin ireland along many prominent scientists exploring origin life research manfred eigen john maynard smith stephen jay gould orgels talk molecular structure disordered orgel died pancreatic cancer october san diego hospice palliative care san diego california orgel proposed novel solution problem juan oros proposed mechanism nucleobase synthesis early earth relied reaction five molecules hydrogen cyanide hcn form adenine problem would require much concentrated hydrogen cyanide evidence suggested present orgel suggested hydrogen cyanide frozen would concentrate hcn molecules spaces crystal lattice ice also solve problem hcn volatile liquid water solution nucleoside nucleobase ribose sugar synthesis orgel suggested almost opposite approach heating mixture ribose purine nucleobases hypoxanthine adenine guanine dryness presence magnesium reaction puts glycosidic bond correct position two ways nucleobase attaches correct carbon ribose correct orientation beta anomer however synthesis later criticised worked hypoxanthine nucleobase relevant current life earth specific ribose sugar could instead applied sugars continuing work studying prebiotic synthesis rna orgel explored mechanisms inorganic nucleotide phosphoryl could chemically activated condensation nucleic acid polymers starting orgel explored variety cyanidebased activating agents could plausibly present young earth carbodiimide reagent found effective activating nucleotide phosphoryl groups promoting formation short adenosine dimers john sutherland coworkers proposed methyl isocyanide acetaldehyde could combine form prebiotic phosphate activating agent could plausibly formed earlyearth orgel also theorised one single strand rna could template first life earth imidazoleactivated nucleotides could used rna template strand polymerise replicate lohrmann orgel reported phosphorimidazolide derivative adenosine monophosphate phosphoryl group oxygen substituted imidazole ring forms short adenosine oligomers presence polyuridine discovered divalent metal cation used catalyze reaction influenced regiochemistry internucleotide gave primarily linked nucleotides gave primarily linked nucleotides guanosine phosphorimidazolides presence polycytidine template montmorillonite clay also shown promote polymerization adenosine phosphorimidazolide oligonucleotides tens bases length starting polyadenosine absence montmorillonite primer capped formation adenosine pyrophosphate oligonucleotide products early studies typically characterized combination radiolabeling gel electrophoresis paper electrophoresis enzymatic digestion used differentiate advent hplc allowed characterization long oligomers though later downplayed hypothesis orgel along francis crick proposed detailed panspermia scenario origin life earth going far suggest life earth designed alien species sent proposed design spaceship aliens could used seed life earth late orgel proposed life based rna based dna proteins theory included genes based rna rna view would developed shaped widely accepted rna world hypothesis almost thirty years later orgel wrote lengthy review rna world review highlighted many proposed syntheses rna parts abiotic conditions noted significance discovery ribozymes rna molecules function enzymes orgel predicted time demonstrated nucleic acid polymers alternatives ribose threose nucleic acid tna peptide nucleic acid pna conclusion orgel wrote one must recognize despite considerable progress problem origin rna world far
