modflow us geological survey modular finitedifference flow model computer code solves groundwater flow equation program used hydrogeologists simulate flow groundwater aquifers source code free public domain written primarily fortran compile run microsoft windows unixlike operating systems since original development early usgs made six major releases considered de facto standard code aquifer simulation several actively developed commercial noncommercial graphical user interfaces modflow modflow constructed called modular design means many attributes came called objectoriented programming example capabilities called packages simulate subsidence lakes streams easily turned execution time storage requirements packages go away entirely programmer wants change something modflow clean organization makes easy indeed kind innovation exactly anticipated modflow designed importantly modularity modflow makes possible different packages written intended address simulation goal different ways allows differences opinion system processes function tested testing important part multimodeling alternative hypothesis testing models like modflow make kind testing definitive controlled results aspects program remain tests become definitive become less prone influenced unknowingly numerical programming differences governing partial differential equation confined aquifer used modflow finite difference form partial differential discretized aquifer domain represented using rows columns layers equation formulated system equations solved matrix form usgs throughout developed several hundred models written different dialects fortran time common practice rewrite new model fit need new groundwater scenario concept modflow originally designed provide common modular groundwater model could compiled multiple platforms without major modification read write common formats different aspects groundwater system would handled using modules similar idea component stereo system original name code usgs modular threedimensional finitedifference groundwater flow model informally modular model name modflow coined several years initial code development started first version published december coded entirely fortran source code version listed usgs open file report referred version rewritten fortran originally released july current version released september modpath initially developed postprocess steadystate data determine threedimensional pathlines particles innovation indispensable fields contaminant hydrogeology still used postprocessor recent versions modflow separate program modflowp developed estimate various parameters used modflow program eventually built version originally released december cleanedup revised continuation three final releases several graphical interfaces first developed using code version version numbering reset released july merged modflowp hydmod codes main program integrated observation sensitivity analysis parameter estimation uncertainty evaluation many new packages enhancements also included including new solvers stream saturated flow packages internal design concepts also changed previous versions packages processes modules distinct version coded mixture fortran fortran one solver programmed c also compiled parallel computing allow multiple processors used increase model complexity andor reduce simulation time parallelization capability designed support sensitivity analysis parameter estimation uncertainty analysis capabilities final version version released march four related branched codes based differs sensitivity analysis parameter estimation uncertainty evaluation capabilities removed thus support capabilities falls clip codes supported externally modflow support effort addition code reorganized support multiple models within one modflow run needed lgr local grid refinement written primarily fortran c c used one solver current version version released february related branched codes include modflow first released sixth core version modflow released release rewrite modflow following objectoriented programming paradigm fortran provides platform includes capabilities several previous versions including modflownwt modflowusg modflow supports structured unstructured grids full support newtonraphson formulation unique water mover package allows flows routed advanced packages including streamflow routing lake multiaquifer well unsaturated zone flow packages modflow also contains groundwater transport gwt model simulates transient threedimensional solute transport structured unstructured grids advanced flow mover packages application programming interface api also available modflow allows program coupled models controlled popular scripting languages python features lacking current release supported popular capabilities previous modflow versions available modflow current version released july names table labels used turn modflow capabilities via key input file capabilities many alternatives omitted ones related basic package always required many capabilities introduced supported later versions though grid change enabled modflowusg modflow meant backward compatibility rather selective several graphical interfaces modflow often include compiled modflow code modifications programs aid input data creating modflow models noncommercial modflow versions free however licensing usually limit use nonprofit educational research purposes commercial modflow programs typically used governments consultants practical applications modflow realworld groundwater problems professional versions modflow generally priced minimum around typically range upward list commercial programs modflow current versions programs run microsoft windows however
