researchers emma schachner university utah matthew lamanna carnegie museum natural history tyler lyson smithsonian washington realized partial skeletons species began collaborating study assisted hansdieter sues paleontologist national museum natural history smithsonian institution main fossils held carnegie museum natural history genus notable first wellpreserved example north american oviraptorosaur according sues almost hundred years presence oviraptorosaurs north america known bits skeleton details appearance biology remained mystery discovery wyliei finally fossil evidence show species looked like related creatures appearance big crests skulls beak teeth birdlike discovery hell creek formation led jokingly nicknamed chicken hell matthew lamanna devised species name originally wanted use latin greek version chicken hell however found nickname translate well languages eventually settled evoking using name birdlike daemon anzu mythology ancient roughly translates heavenly specific name wyliei honors wylie j tuttle grandson one museums donors lee b anzu wyliei characterized toothless beak prominent crest long arms ending slender relatively straight claws long

cladistic analysis showed possible sister species microvenator celer gigantoraptor erlianensis caenagnathasia martinsoni alberta dentary morph leptorhynchos gaddisi caenagnathus sternbergi anzu wyliei caenagnathus collinsi oviraptoridae expected oviraptorosaurs would found north america well documented specimens asia two continents land connection cretaceous discovery anzu wyliei indicates north american oviraptorosaurs related closely counterparts anzu probably omnivore herbivore although beak heavily constructed asian differences asian cousins include size asian oviraptoridae smaller well thicker legs different lower fossils anzu wyliei found mudstone rock part ancient floodplains indicates species likely lifestyle significantly different asian counterparts lived arid semiarid lifestyle according stephen brusatte university edinburgh fastrunning ecological generalist didnt quite fit usual moulds meateating planteating jaw morphology suggests could eat variety food items including vegetation small animals possibly number features similar modern birds avian dinosaur line died extinction event million years ago along rest nonavian dinosaurs birdlike features instead example convergent evolution matthew lamanna comments would lot birdy behaviors people think dinosaur think something like rex brontosaurus think bird think something like sparrow chicken animal anzu mosaic features groups basically provides really nice link evolutionary purpose anzus large crest unclear sues notes large made paperthin bone able take much stress oviraptosaurs crest certainly largest wyliei likely function display showing members species australian cassowary similar crest thought used attract mates possible wyliei could used crest similar fossils showed evidence injuries
