intravenous therapy abbreviated iv therapy medical technique administers fluids medications nutrients directly persons vein intravenous route administration commonly used rehydration provide nutrients reduced mental states food water mouth may also used administer medications medical therapy blood products electrolytes correct electrolyte imbalances attempts providing intravenous therapy recorded early practice become widespread development techniques safe effective use intravenous route fastest way deliver medications fluid replacement throughout body introduced directly circulatory system thus quickly distributed reason intravenous route administration also used consumption recreational drugs many therapies administered bolus onetime dose may also administered extended infusion drip act administering therapy intravenously placing intravenous line iv line later use procedure performed skilled professional basic intravenous access consists needle piercing skin entering vein connected syringe external tubing used administer desired therapy cases patient likely receive many interventions short period consequent risk trauma vein normal practice insert cannula leaves one end vein subsequent therapies administered easily tubing end cases multiple medications therapies administered iv line iv lines classified central lines end large vein close heart peripheral lines output small vein periphery arm iv line threaded peripheral vein end near heart termed peripherally inserted central catheter picc line person likely need longterm intravenous therapy medical port may implanted enable easier repeated access vein without pierce vein repeatedly catheter also inserted central vein chest known tunneled line specific type catheter used site insertion affected desired substance administered health veins desired site insertion placement iv line may cause pain necessarily involves piercing skin infections inflammation termed phlebitis also common side effects iv line phlebitis may likely vein used repeatedly intravenous access eventually develop hard cord unsuitable iv access unintentional administration therapy outside vein termed extravasation infiltration may cause side effects intravenous iv access used administer medications fluid replacement must distributed throughout body especially rapid distribution desired another use iv administration avoidance firstpass metabolism liver substances may infused intravenously include volume expanders bloodbased products blood substitutes medications nutrition fluids may administered part volume expansion fluid replacement intravenous route volume expansion consists administration fluidbased solutions suspensions designed target specific areas body need water two main types volume expander crystalloids colloids crystalloids aqueous solutions mineral salts watersoluble molecules colloids contain larger insoluble molecules gelatin blood considered commonly used crystalloid fluid normal saline solution sodium chloride concentration isotonic blood lactated ringers also known ringers lactate closely related ringers acetate mildly hypotonic solutions often used significant burns colloids preserve high colloid osmotic pressure blood hand parameter decreased crystalloids due crystalloids generally much cheaper buffer solutions used correct acidosis alkalosis also administered intravenous access lactated ringers solution used fluid expander base solution medications added also buffering effect another solution administered intravenously buffering solution sodium medications may mixed fluids mentioned commonly normal saline dextrose compared routes administration oral medications iv route fastest way deliver fluids medications throughout reason iv route commonly preferred emergency situations fast onset action desirable extremely high blood pressure termed hypertensive emergency iv antihypertensives may given quickly decrease blood pressure controlled manner prevent organ atrial fibrillation iv amiodarone may administered attempt restore normal heart iv medications also used chronic health conditions cancer chemotherapy drugs commonly administered intravenously cases vancomycin loading bolus dose medicine given beginning dosing regimen quickly increase concentration medication bioavailability iv medication definition unlike oral administration medication may fully absorbed may metabolized prior entering medications virtually zero oral bioavailability reason certain types medications given intravenously insufficient uptake routes case severe dehydration patient required treated via iv therapy quick unpredictability oral bioavailability different people also reason medication administered iv oral medications also may less desirable person nauseous vomiting severe diarrhea may prevent medicine fully absorbed gastrointestinal tract cases medication may given iv patient tolerate oral form medication switch iv oral administration usually performed soon viable generally cost time savings iv administration whether medication potentially switched oral form sometimes considered choosing appropriate antibiotic therapy use hospital setting person unlikely discharged still require iv medications aprepitant chemically modified better suited iv administration forming prodrug fosaprepitant pharmacokinetic reasons delay effect drug metabolized active blood product bloodbased product component blood collected donor use blood blood transfusions used massive blood loss due trauma used replace blood lost surgery blood transfusions may also used treat severe anaemia thrombocytopenia caused blood disease early blood transfusions consisted whole blood modern medical practice commonly uses components blood packed red blood cells fresh frozen plasma parenteral nutrition act providing required nutrients person intravenous line used people unable get nutrients normally eating digesting food person receiving parenteral nutrition given intravenous solution may contain salts dextrose amino acids lipids vitamins exact formulation parenteral nutrition used depend specific nutritional needs person given person receiving nutrition intravenously called total parenteral nutrition tpn whereas person receiving nutrition intravenously called partial parenteral nutrition supplemental parenteral medical imaging relies able clearly distinguish internal parts body one way accomplished administration contrast agent specific imaging technique employed determine characteristics appropriate contrast agent increase visibility blood vessels
