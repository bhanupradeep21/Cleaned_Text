personality animals investigated across variety different scientific fields including agricultural science animal behaviour anthropology psychology veterinary medicine thus definition animal personality may vary according context scope study however recent consensus literature broad definition describes animal personality individual differences behaviour consistent across time ecological consistency refers repeatability behavioural differences individuals trait presents way varying animal personality traits measurable described personality animals also referred animal disposition coping style also personality norms species often found diversity animal personality compared crossspecies studies demonstrating pervasiveness evolutionary process research animal personality variation burgeoning since mid recent studies focused proximate causation ecological evolutionary significance personality extent personality phenomena considered examining animal personality significantly reduced compared studied humans concepts personal objects identity attitudes life stories considered relevant animals similarly approach requires subject explain motives beliefs feelings applicable study animal study animal personality largely based observation investigation behavioural traits ecological context traits characters attributes organism shared members species traits

comparative psychology descriptive language used comparative psychologists late nineteenth century often attributed disposition behavioural tendencies individual animals studies many reports result researchers anthropomorphizing animal subjects explicitly examine considered animal personality however studies represent first instances scientists reporting individual differences animal russian physiologist ivan pavlov one first researchers integrate personality research animal behaviour seminal studies conditional reflexes categorized behaviour dogs excitable lively quiet inhibited linked personalities learning ability excitable type example showed signs strong excitatory conditioning limited ability acquisition inhibitory connections lively type balanced displayed rapid associative learning quiet type exhibited consistent slow first study empirically examined animal personality done meredith crawford quantified individual differences behaviour young chimpanzees using behaviour rating scale crawford conducted research yale laboratories primate since psychologists continued investigate personality animals across wide range taxa meanwhile incorporation animal personality fields ecology evolution relatively new practice ecologists began recognize importance individual differences behaviour near end twentieth rating traits involve group observers scrutinize behavioural traits individual animal observers typically given list characters andor descriptions use reference interpreting animal behaviour use list rate rating method uses observers data recording researchers observe individual animals respond behavioural tests code reactions method typically used experimental studies environmental conditions heavily research animal personality became prevalent ecological studies many behavioural ecologists substituting behavioural plasticity animal attributing variation behaviour diverse personality types rather plasticity single behavioural trait thus behavioural reaction norms introduced means incorporating personality individual plasticity study animal behaviour behavioural reaction norms measure behaviour individual environmental gradient therefore providing information animal behaves average behaviour changes across environmental repeatability refers fraction variation population owed differences individuals repeatability estimates one widely

terminology surrounding animal personality example temperament behavioral syndrome disposition animal personality used interchangeably others maintain term unique additionally concern researchers may misinterpreting relationship personality behavioural plasticity behavioural ecologist niels dingemanse illustrates one could erroneously determine variation behaviour individuals exists subjects
