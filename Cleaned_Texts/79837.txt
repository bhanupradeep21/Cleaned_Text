homeland security executives cisco microsoft work kaminsky worked dns vendors secret develop patch make exploiting vulnerability difficult releasing july kaminsky intended publicize details attack days release patch details leaked july information quickly pulled mirrored later presented findings black hat briefings wore suit kaminsky received substantial amount mainstream press disclosing experienced backlash computer security community immediately disclosing reporter asked used dns flaw financial benefit kaminsky responded felt would morally wrong wish mother visit actual vulnerability related dns possible transaction ids number small enough simply guess given enough opportunities dan bernstein author djbdns reported early djbdns dealt issue using source port randomization udp port used second transaction identifier thus raising possible id count billions popular name server implementations left issue unresolved due concerns performance stability many operating system kernels simply werent designed cycle thousands network sockets second instead implementers assumed dnss time live ttl field would limit guesser attempts kaminskys attack bypassed ttl defense targeting sibling names like instead wwwexamplecom directly name unique entry cache thus ttl name sibling transactionid guessing spoofed response could include information target well using many sibling names row could induce dns server make many requests tactic provided enough opportunities guess transaction id successfully spoof reply reasonable amount fix issue major dns servers implemented source port randomization djbdns powerdns done fix makes attack times harder attacker willing send billions packets still corrupt dnssec kaminsky spoke favor since widely universally
