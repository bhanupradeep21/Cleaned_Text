tailings removed aluminium hydroxide precipitated remaining solution sodium aluminate aluminium hydroxide converted aluminium oxide alumina calcination residue bauxite tailings mostly iron oxide highly caustic due residual sodium hydroxide historically stored lagoons led ajka alumina plant accident hungary dam bursting led drowning nine people additional sought treatment chemical burns mud contaminated square kilometres sq mi land reached danube mud considered nontoxic due low levels heavy metals associated slurry ph aluminium hydroxide also finds use fire retardant filler polymer

magnesium carbonate counterbalancing laxative compound also used control hyperphosphatemia elevated phosphate phosphorus levels blood people animals suffering kidney failure normally kidneys filter excess phosphate blood kidney failure cause phosphate accumulate aluminium salt ingested binds phosphate intestines reduce amount phosphorus precipitated aluminium hydroxide included adjuvant vaccines

hydroxide stimulate immune system inducing release uric acid immunological danger signal strongly attracts certain types monocytes differentiate dendritic cells dendritic cells pick antigen carry lymph nodes stimulate cells b appears contribute induction good response useful immunizing pathogens blocked antibodies however little capacity stimulate cellular immune responses important protection
