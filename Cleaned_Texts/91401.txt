attentional focusing arousing stimuli thus delaying disengagement attention ochsner summarized different findings suggested influencing attention selectivity dwell time arousing stimuli distinctively

many researchers use selfreport measures felt emotion manipulation check raises interesting question possible methodological weakness people always accurate recall felt several findings suggest case

similar results demonstrated effects expressive suppression memory generalize emotionally positive socially relevant one possible answer question emotion suppression impair memory might lay self monitoring efforts invested order suppress emotion thinking behavior one trying control recent found heightened self monitoring efforts among suppressors relative control participants suppressors likely report thinking behavior need control conversation increases selfmonitoring predicted decreases memory said people reported thinking lot controlling behavior particularly impoverished memories however additional research needed confirm whether selfmonitoring actually exerts causal effect emotionally arousing stimuli lead retrograde amnesia preceding events anterograde amnesia subsequent

used daily management alzheimers one study found objects recalled significantly better alzheimers patients presented birthday presents ad enhancing effects emotional arousal later memory recall tend maintained among older adults amygdala shows relatively less decline many brain however older adults also show somewhat shift towards favoring positive negative information memory leading positivity effect emotional memory sleep wellresearched emotional memories consolidated greater sleep rather neutral studies investigated high valence arousing words comparison neutral words sleep enhances consolidation high valence arousing words therefore remembered postsleep concept demonstrated many studies using variety media pictures film clips memories future relevance also consolidated greater sleep study wilhelm et al memories items participants knew needed future testing session remembered sleep consolidated memories future relevance greater extent memories emotionally significant
