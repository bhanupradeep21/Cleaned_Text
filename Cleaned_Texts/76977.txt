began using positron emission tomography pet later functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri image brain monitoring tasks involving attention considering expensive equipment generally available hospitals psychologists sought cooperation neurologists psychologist michael posner already renowned influential work visual selective attention neurologist marcus raichle pioneered brain imaging

sophisticated experimental paradigms cognitive psychology new brain imaging techniques although older technique electroencephalography eeg long used study brain activity underlying selective attention cognitive psychophysiologists ability newer techniques actually measure precisely localized activity inside brain generated renewed interest wider community researchers growing body neuroimaging research identified frontoparietal attention network appears responsible control cognitive psychology least two models describe visual attention operates models may considered metaphors used describe internal processes generate hypotheses falsifiable generally speaking visual attention thought operate twostage first stage attention distributed uniformly external visual scene processing information

work william james described attention focus margin focus area extracts information visual scene highresolution geometric center visual attention directed surrounding focus fringe attention extracts

tradeoff size focus efficiency processing attention resources assumed fixed follows larger focus slower processing region visual scene since fixed resource distributed larger area thought focus attention subtend minimum visual however maximum size yet determined significant debate emerged last decade century treismans feature integration theory fit compared duncan humphreys attentional

research vygotsky luria determined large part contemporary understanding definition attention understood start multitasking defined attempt perform two tasks simultaneously however research shows multitasking people make mistakes perform tasks attention must divided among component tasks perform divided attention individuals attend give attention multiple sources information perform one task older research involved looking limits people performing simultaneous tasks like reading stories listening writing something listening two separate messages different ears ie dichotic listening generally classical research attention investigated ability people learn new information multiple tasks performed probe limits perception cf donald broadbent also older literature peoples performance multiple tasks performed simultaneously driving car tuning driving vast majority current research human multitasking based performance two tasks usually involves driving performing another task texting eating even speaking passengers vehicle friend cellphone research reveals human attentional system limits process driving performance worse engaged tasks drivers make mistakes brake harder later get accidents veer lanes andor less aware surroundings engaged previously discussed little difference found speaking handsfree cell phone handheld cell suggests strain attentional system causes problems rather driver hands speaking passenger cognitively demanding speaking friend passengers able change conversation based upon needs driver example traffic intensifies passenger may stop talking allow driver navigate increasingly difficult roadway conversation partner phone would aware change environment multiple theories regarding divided attention one conceived explains single pool attentional resources freely divided among multiple tasks model seems oversimplified however due different modalities eg visual auditory verbal two simultaneous tasks use modality listening radio station writing paper much difficult concentrate tasks likely interfere specific modality model theorized navon gopher however recent research using well controlled dualtask paradigms points importance alternative resource theory proposed accurate metaphor explaining divided attention complex tasks resource theory states complex task automatized performing task requires less individuals limitedcapacity attentional variables play part ability pay attention concentrate many tasks include limited anxiety arousal task difficulty simultaneous attention type attention classified attending

applying mathematical modeling study throughout philosophical era various thinkers made significant contributions field attention studies beginning research extent attention attention directed
