reptiles tyranosaurus sic doubts raised john h ostrom noted hadrosaurids must fed resistant terrestrial plants rather soft aquatic ones skeleton adapted bipedal locomotion land hypothesis finally refuted robert bakker argued skin fingers actually remnant fleshy pad enveloping hand dried flattened mummification similar skin structures derived foot pads found modernday mummified camel carcasses furthermore bakker argued fingers short could hardly spread apart distinguishes fundamentally long spread toes todays paddling animals ducks today hypothesis aquatic lifestyle widely account discovery mummy charles hazelius sternberg noted sprawling posture preserved hind limb comparable amnh mummy suggested could reflected original posture living animal contradiction skeletal mounts time often showed erect limbs sternberg noted walked liked sic lizard body close ground tail dragging following preparation mummy frankfurt german paleobotanist richard kräusel studied earthy mass plant remains found within thoracic cavity mummy considered probable stomach contents based composition location mass mostly comprised conifer needles cunninghamites elegans according kräusel parts tree branches well seeds fruits remains suggest diet consisting terrestrial plants kräusel presented findings annual meeting paläontologische gesellschaft frankfurt german paleontological society questioned immediately probably due prevalent belief hadrosaurids fed aquatic instead terrestrial plants given assumed aquatic lifestyle discussions following talk austrian paleontologist othenio abel argued remains could simply washed cadaver possibility considered unlikely kräusel since pollen fungi eggs water insects would expected washedin mass lacking swedish paleontologist carl wiman argued stomach contents necessarily reflect diet since food items could swallowed accidentally indicated plant remains found specimens modern platypus drevermann defending kräusels hypothesis argued remains found pubis bone mummy could fallen carcass lying right side kräusels presentation together subsequent discussions published short notes societys journal following century supposed stomach contents often regarded one best available evidence diet edmontosaurus hadrosaurids general although credibility evidence repeatedly although sternberg reported stomach contents amnh mummy never ostrom cited stomach contents senckenberg mummy evidence diet consisting terrestrial plants questioning aquatic lifestyle hypothesis universally accepted time later different authors noted since mass removed mummy macerated would longer available research kräusels hypothesis longer german paleontologist dieter uhl analyzed available historic accounts microscope slides plant remains prepared kräusel additional plant remains found within sandstone surrounded mummy concluding presumed stomach gut contents probably external origin according uhl plant fragments described kräusel much smaller known hadrosaurid gut contents coprolites instead compare well plant remains extracted surrounding rock transported water furthermore mass described kräusel found atop prepubis hip therefore upper region body cavity unlikely location stomach gut contents animal found laying underside uhl hypothesized mass plant remains could formed body cavity already filled sand action river leaving chamber acted sediment trap fine plant detritus suspended water mummy surrounded brownish fine medium sandstone although sedimentological structures might hint mode preservation visible surviving rock samples recorded sternbergs according uhl however likely sandstone surrounding mummy fluvial laid rivers sandstone contains fine layers plant material pieces charcoal latter indicating occurrence wild fires body cavity mummy contained fossils plant remains leaf impressions fish may washed inside carcass death amnh mummy discovered area commonly interpreted fossil natural mummy formed dehydration carcass indicated close adherence skin impressions bones fact partially drawn body sternbergs noted preservation senckenberg mummy differed skin adhere closely bone rather traced original body contour indicates carcass dry burial addition senckenberg mummy preserved supine position like trachodon mummy upright position tip muzzle pointing upwards legs pressed body sternbergs suggested animal sank soft sediment possibly quicksand subsequently suffocated peculiar position specimen would animals death pose struggled phil manning stated quicksand hypothesis confirmed sediment samples site discovery animal probably got buried rapidly however resulting high degree uhl argued mummy probably transported long distance burial given wellpreserved skin
