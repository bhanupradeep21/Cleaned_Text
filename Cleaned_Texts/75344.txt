biosafety cabinet called biological safety cabinet microbiological safety enclosed ventilated laboratory workspace safely working materials contaminated potentially contaminated pathogens requiring defined biosafety level several different types bsc exist differentiated degree biocontainment provide bscs first became commercially available primary purpose bsc serve means protect laboratory worker surrounding environment pathogens exhaust air hepafiltered exits biosafety cabinet removing harmful bacteria contrast laminar flow clean bench blows unfiltered exhaust air towards user safe work pathogenic neither bscs safe use fume likewise fume hood fails provide environmental protection hepa filtration bsc would however classes bscs secondary purpose maintain sterility materials inside product us centers disease control prevention cdc classifies bscs three classes types bscs within distinguished two ways level personnel environmental protection provided level product protection class cabinets provide personnel environmental protection product protection fact inward flow air contribute contamination inward airflow maintained minimum velocity ms bscs commonly used enclose specific equipment eg centrifuges procedures eg aerating cultures potentially generate aerosols bscs class either ducted connected building exhaust system unducted recirculating filtered exhaust back class ii cabinets provide kinds protection samples environment since makeup air also hepafiltered five types type formerly type formerly type type type types requirements defined nsf international standard reclassified cabinets classified latter type connected exhaust duct type added type biosafety cabinets installed type principles operation use motor driven blowers fans mounted cabinet draw directional mass airflow around user air grille protecting operator air drawn underneath work surface back top cabinet passes hepa filters column hepa filtered sterile air also blown downward products processes prevent contamination air also exhausted hepa filter depending type class ii bsc air either recirculated back laboratory pulled exhaust fan ductwork expelled needed type cabinet formerly known type minimum inflow velocity ftmin downflow air considered contaminated splits work surface bscs smoke split mixes inflow air drawn ductwork back cabinet blown positive pressure contaminated plenum air either recirculated hepa filter back work zone exhausted cabinet also hepa filter sizing hepa filters internal damper used balance air volumes type safe work hazardous chemicals even exhausted thimble canopy avoid disturbing internal air type cabinet formerly designated minimum inflow velocity ftmin negative air pressure plenum surrounds contaminated positive pressure plenums respects specifications identical type type cabinets minimum inflow velocity ftmin cabinets must hardducted exhaust system rather exhausted thimble connection exhaust systems must also dedicated one bsc per duct run per blower contrast type cabinets type b bscs use single pass airflow air mix recirculate order also control hazardous chemical vapors type cabinets split airflow air behind smokesplit directed exhaust system air operator smokesplit mixes inflow air recirculated downflow since exhaust air drawn rear grille cdc advises work hazardous chemistry conducted rear complicated since smoke split demarking rear cabinet invisible line extends width cabinet approximately inches front grille drifts internal hepa filters load type cabinet also known total exhaust bsc expensive operate air recirculated therefore type mainly found applications toxicology laboratories ability safely use hazardous chemistry additionally risk contaminated air would flow laboratory exhaust system type cabinet fail mitigate risk cabinets types generally monitor exhaust flow shutting supply blower sounding alarm exhaust flow insufficient class iii cabinet generally installed maximum containment laboratories specifically designed work pathogenic agents providing maximum protection enclosure gastight materials enter leave dunk tank doubledoor autoclave gloves attached front prevent direct contact hazardous materials class iii cabinets sometimes called glove boxes custombuilt cabinets often attach line lab equipment installed inside usually custombuilt biosafety cabinets used daily basis hours besides protection user sample material human design factors ergonomics work become important includes reduction noise level convenient working atmosphere height adjustable stand stool footrest optimized sitting position panorama side windows light within cabinet angled front sash enables better sitting position strong light sources better view within cabinet forearm

requirements may include general terms regular service maintenance schedule may include following tasks work open bench tops work performed within bsc must performed carefully safely avoid
