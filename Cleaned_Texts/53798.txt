regression analysis based work p christiansen ra fari√±a estimate mass approximately kilograms however gregory paul estimated weighed kilograms holotype believed completely almost completely fullygrown due observed closure neurocranial sutures estimated size much greater earlier tyrannosauroids dilong guanlong led authors suggest body size increase tyrannosauroids continuous process throughout cretaceous period although legs tail preserved believed body proportions similar autapomorphies genus given authors description include following elongate preorbital region basicranium wider long absence pneumatic foramina lateral edge nasal bone ridge middle premaxillary teeth lateral processes axial neural spines also distinguished later tyrannosauroids lack rugosities nasal bone lack pneumatic elements quadrate skull holotype preserved completely including palate braincase lacks mandible elongated comparison tyrannosauroids significant elongation maxillary lacrimal postorbital bones despite relatively complete skull wellpreserved fossilized mineralized nodule led difficulty differentiating bone matrix preserved led difficulty determining overall topology skull bones obscuring existence maxillary fenestrae however numerous distinctive features evident spite preservation one distinctive features tyrannosauroid skulls nasal bones fused xiongguanlong also

information regarding evolution tyrannosauroids relatively obscure since groups naming early several basal taxa known middle jurassic eg guanlong kileskus proceratosaurus handful intermediate forms early cretaceous eg yutyrannus dilong eotyrannus numerous megafaunal hypercarnivorous genera campanian maastrichtian eg tyrannosaurus albertosaurus researchers described middle cretaceous taxa including noted taxa partially fill cretaceous tyrannosaur multiple theories regarding biogeography tyrannosauroids middle cretaceous landmass laurasia process breaking early cretaceous meaning atlantic ocean much narrow also tyrannosauroids known early cretaceous europe eotyrannus led researchers suggest tyrannosauroids migrated north america europe possibly either rafting land also suggested landmass beringia already formed time would enabled migration animals asia laramidia corroborated emergence animals north america apparent recent asian ancestry including eolambia tyrannosauroid teeth known aptianalbian aged cloverly formation wyoming meaning tyrannosauroids likely migrated north america prior million years researchers believe tyrannosauroids already possessed
