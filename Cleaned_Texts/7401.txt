caloenas nicobarica italian zoologist tommaso salvadori listed bird appendix doubtful species pigeons yet identified scottish ornithologist henry ogg forbes supported validity species examining nicobar pigeon specimens concluding none resembled spotted green pigeon stage development therefore considered distinct species genus nicobar pigeon british zoologist walter rothschild german ornithologist ernst hartert agreed pigeon belonged caloenas suggested probably abnormity though one specimen spotted green pigeon sporadically mentioned literature throughout century little new
