hiv superinfection also called hiv reinfection superaids condition person established human immunodeficiency virus infection acquires second strain hiv often different form recombinant strain coexists strain initial infection well reinfection new virus strain may cause rapid disease progression carry multiple resistances certain hiv medications hiv superinfection may interclade second infecting virus phylogenetically distinct initial virus intraclade two strains people hiv risk superinfection actions would place noninfected person risk acquiring hiv include sharing needles forgoing condoms hivpositive sexual cases reported globally studies shown incidence rate per research uganda published indicates hiv superinfection among hivinfected individuals within general population remains
