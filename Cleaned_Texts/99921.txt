transformation involves integration functional fragment dna target cells gene construct dna cassette containing required regulatory elements proper expression within target needed gene constructs may vary design depending desired outcome transformation procedure constructs typically contain combination promoter sequence terminator sequence gene interest reporter gene gene guns mostly used plant
