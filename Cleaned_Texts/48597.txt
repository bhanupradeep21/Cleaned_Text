complete one hour skilled surgeon would taken ten minutes seniors referred jamanaka pun japanese word gladstone institute cardiovascular disease assistant professor osaka city university medical school found mostly looking mice laboratory actual wife advised become practicing doctor instead applied position nara institute science technology stated could would clarify characteristics embryonic stem cells cando attitude job associate professor started research would later win nobel prize became full professor remained institute position yamanaka professor institute frontier medical sciences kyoto yamanaka director professor center ips cell research application cira kyoto april stepped took place director emeritus cira keeping professor team generated induced pluripotent stem cells ips cells adult mouse ips cells closely resemble embryonic stem cells vitro equivalent part blastocyst embryo days fertilization grows become embryo proper could show ips cells pluripotent ie capable generating cell lineages body later team generated ips cells human adult first group key difference previous attempts field teams use multiple transcription factors instead transfecting one transcription factor per experiment started transcription factors known important early embryo could end reduce transcription factors nobel prize physiology medicine awarded jointly sir john b gurdon shinya yamanaka discovery mature cells reprogrammed become different types stem cells types cells help understanding material theoretically patientspecific transplantations possible much research done immune rejection reducible via stem cell bank pluripotent abnormal aging immune rejection safe clinical trials prevalent view early century mature cells permanently locked differentiated state return fully immature pluripotent stem cell state thought cellular differentiation unidirectional process therefore nondifferentiated eggearly embryo cells develop specialized cells however stem cells limited potency adult stem cells remain bone marrow intestine skin etc act source cell fact differentiated cell types specific patterns proteins suggested irreversible epigenetic modifications genetic alterations cause unidirectional cell differentiation cells progressively become restricted differentiation potential eventually lose john b gurdon demonstrated nucleus differentiated frog intestinal epithelial cell generate fully functional tadpole via transplantation enucleated egg gurdon used somatic cell nuclear transfer scnt method understand reprogramming cells change specialization concluded differentiated somatic cell nuclei potential revert pluripotency paradigm shift time showed differentiated cell nucleus retained capacity successfully revert undifferentiated state potential restart development pluripotent capacity however question still remained whether intact differentiated cell could fully reprogrammed become pluripotent shinya yamanaka proved introduction small set transcription factors differentiated cell sufficient revert cell pluripotent state yamanaka focused factors important maintaining pluripotency embryonic stem es cells first time intact differentiated somatic cell could reprogrammed become pluripotent knowing transcription factors involved maintenance pluripotent state selected set es cell transcriptional factors candidates reinstate pluripotency somatic cells first collected candidate factors genes encoding transcription factors introduced skin fibroblasts actually generated colonies remarkably similar es cells secondly experiments conducted smaller numbers transcription factors added identify key factors simple yet sensitive assay system lastly identified four key genes found transcriptional factors myc sufficient convert mouse embryonic adult fibroblasts pluripotent stem cells capable producing teratomas vivo contributing chimeric mice pluripotent cells called ips induced pluripotent stem cells appeared low frequency ips cells selected inserting bgeo gene locus promoter active pluripotent stem cells induce bgeo expression turn gives rise resistance resistance helps us identify ips cells culture moreover yamanaka colleagues found ips cells germline transmission via selecting nanog gene also first produce human ips cells issues current methods induced pluripotency face low production rate ips cells fact transcriptional factors shown oncogenic july scandal involving japanese stem cell researcher haruko obokata fabricating data doctoring images plagiarizing work others yamanaka faced public scrutiny associated work lacking full documentation yamanaka denied manipulating images papers embryonic mouse stem cells could find lab notes confirm raw data consistent published since original discovery yamanaka much research done field many improvements made technology improvements made yamanakas research well future prospects findings follows yamanakas research opened new door worlds scientists set forth long journey exploration hoping find cells true ips cells used generate human vascularized functional liver mice japan multiple stem cells used differentiate component parts liver selforganized complex structure placed mouse host liver vessels connected hosts vessels performed normal liver functions including breaking drugs liver yamanaka factors shown effect age related measures aged yamanaka
