paleontology united states refers paleontological research occurring within conducted people united states paleontologists found start paleozoic era north america actually southern hemisphere marine life flourished countrys many seas later seas largely replaced swamps home amphibians early reptiles continents assembled pangaea drier conditions prevailed evolutionary precursors mammals dominated country mass extinction event ended reign mesozoic era followed dinosaurs began rise dominance spreading country pangaea split latter jurassic morrison formation dinosaurs lived western states cretaceous gulf mexico expanded split north america half plesiosaurs mosasaurs swam waters later began withdraw western states home hell creek dinosaurs another mass extinction ended reign dinosaurs cenozoic era began afterward inland sea cretaceous vanished mammals came dominate land western states home primitive camels horses well carnivorous creodonts soon mammals entered oceans early whale basilosaurus swam coastal waters southeast rhinolike titanotheres dominated oligocene south dakota point climate united states cooled pleistocene glaciers spread sabertoothed cats woolly mammoths mastodons dire wolves roamed land humans arrived across land bridge siberia alaska may played role hunting animals extinction native americans familiar fossils thousands years first major fossil discovery attract attention formally trained scientists ice age fossils kentuckys big bone lick fossils studied eminent intellectuals like frances george cuvier local statesmen like benjamin franklin thomas jefferson george washington beginning century dinosaur footprints discovered near countrys east coast later century dinosaur fossils uncovered eminent paleontologists edward drinker cope othniel charles marsh embroiled bitter rivalry collect fossils name new species early century major finds continued ice age mammals la brea tar pits midtolate twentiethcentury discoveries united states triggered dinosaur renaissance discovery birdlike deinonychus overturned misguided notions dinosaurs plodding lizardlike animals highlighting sophisticated physiology apparent relationship birds notable finds united states include maiasaura provided early evidence parental care dinosaurs seismosaurus largest known dinosaur paleontologists found precambrian areas composing united states home first known eukaryotes whose remains preserved california simple precambrian life known complex forms north cambrian land masses composing united states separate located southern trilobites characteristic animal especially abundant ordovician america still home wide variety marine invertebrates important fauna preserved states indiana kentucky ohio cincinnati life silurian america especially diverse around coral reefs also time new yorks famous sea scorpion fishes diversified greatly land first known seed plants appeared pennsylvania worlds first forests appeared new mississippian america covered notably home abundant pennsylvanian america largely vast swamps expanded across home reptiles appearing around permian continents collided uniting single supercontinent called pangaea much country precursors mammals like dimetrodon edaphosaurus lived end permian largest mass extinction earths history occurred killing species triassic mesozoic era ichthyosaurs entered sea achieved large sizes petrified forest appeared dinosaurs appeared achieved dominance pterosaurs flew jurassic plesiosaurs began usurping marine dominance dinosaurs continued diversify land increase vast complex floodplains covered western united home iconic creatures like early cretaceous dinosaur faunas began around time sea levels began gradually rise gulf mexico extended alaska dividing north america formed western interior ichthyosaurs plesiosaurs gradually gave way overhead pterosaurs like pteranodon kansas achieved vast end cretaceous seaway began retreat coastal plains montana dakotas home iconic dinosaurs like edmontosaurus triceratops tyrannosaurus soon however marine reptiles dinosaurs pterosaurs dominated planet went extinct likely meteor impact destabilized planets extinction dominant reptile groups ushered age sea levels continued vast western interior seaway reduced small inland body north mammals beginning diversify dominate creodonts forerunners modern carnivores arose prominence eocene western states home small primitive time groups got larger lost several even late eocene mammals entered oceans great primitive whale basilosaurus swam coastal waters southeastern states like rhinolike titanotheres dominated south dakota badlands point climate united states iconic ice age mammals pleistocene like sabertoothed cats woolly mammoths mastodons dire spread across continent advance humans arrived across land bridge siberia may played role hunting animal native americans familiar fossils thousands told applied practical idea powerful natural forces contending balance common motif fossilinfluenced native american practical applications fossils native american cultures include ingestion use food african slaves also contributed knowledge early study paleontology united states first reasonably accurate recorded identification vertebrate fossils new world made slaves south carolina plantation recognized elephant affinities mammoth molars uncovered however first major fossil discovery attract attention formally trained scientists ice age fossils kentuckys big bone fossils studied eminent intellectuals like frances george cuvier local statesmen frontiersman like daniel benjamin william henry thomas george triggered controversy regarding idea entire species animals could become end century possible dinosaur fossils might already found new beginning century fossil footprints definitely found later tracks researched reverend edward hitchcock instrumental establishment ichnology study trace fossils late worlds first reasonably complete dinosaur skeleton discovered new joseph leidy would name hadrosaurus first known dinosaur first dinosaur interpreted twolegged first mounted exhibition later century edward drinker cope described new carnivorous dinosaur new jersey called laelaps gave fellow paleontologist othniel charles marsh tour quarry fossils taken marsh secretly convinced copes workers send fossils instead marsh also learned name laelaps already used different animal renamed copes dinosaur dryptosaurus instigated bitter rivalry collect fossils name new prehistoric species took two paleontologists crews deep west looking fossils attempting undermine others early century major finds continued like ice age mammals la brea tar pits preserved hundreds thousands fossils central los south dakota school mines technology uncovered vast oligocene bonebeds south dakota seven years later another bonebed discovered new mexico preserved hundreds dinosaur john ostrom led expedition montana uncovered remains nimble birdlike carnivorous dinosaur deinonychus based find ostrom student robert bakker began arguing dinosaurs sophisticated physiologies even ancestors modern birds ideas revolutionized dinosaur paleontology period called dinosaur another notable find occurred montana jack horner bob makelas new duckbilled dinosaur genus maiasaura provided first known dinosaur nests north america well early evidence dinosaurs provided parental care young unlike early new genus seismosaurus put forward candidate largest known state rocks stones also fossils state gems also fossils
