birth whelping box simple box pen provided dam help shelter contain puppies person intentionally mates dogs produce puppies referred dog breeder line breeding planned breeding dogs relatives done strengthen appearance specific desired traits offspring line breeding differentiated inbreeding excluding pairings parents offspring full siblings outcrossing planned breeding two unrelated dogs used increase genetic diversity breed decrease genetic issues abnormalities inherited line breeding inbreeding dogs reach puberty months old age female dogs start estrous cycle four stages estrous proestrus estrus diestrus anestrus dog estrus also known heat become pregnant gestation dog days length measured day ovulation since difficult determine exact date ovulation errors often made calculating gestation period canine sperm live days fallopian tubes female bred days oocytes ovum fertilized appear gestation length days bred day oocytes fertilized gestation length appear days long hours old three days old weeks old seven weeks old twelve weeks old newborn puppies nursing humans maintained populations useful animals around places habitat since prehistoric millennia domesticated dogs developed distinct types groups livestock guardian dogs hunting dogs sighthounds maintain distinctions humans intentionally mated dogs certain characteristics encourage characteristics offspring process hundreds dog breeds developed artificial selection dog breeding influenced behavior shape size believed human civilization moved towards agrarian societies dogs selectively bred smaller size docile traits made comfortable humans dogs live together seen traits even prompt adult female wolf act defensively dog puppies wolf example canine neoteny goes even various dog breeds differently neotenized according type behavior researchers believe comparison based grey wolf ancestor dog comparison research indicates concept neoteny means distinguishing dogs wolves development breed clubs
