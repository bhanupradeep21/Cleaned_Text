sexual selection birds concerns birds evolved variety mating behaviors peacock tail perhaps famous example sexual selection fisherian runaway commonly occurring sexual dimorphisms size color differences energetically costly attributes signal competitive breeding many types avian sexual selection identified intersexual selection also known female choice intrasexual competition individuals abundant sex compete privilege mate sexually selected traits often evolve become pronounced competitive breeding situations trait begins limit individuals fitness conflicts individual fitness signaling adaptations ensure sexually selected ornaments plumage coloration courtship behavior honest traits signals must costly ensure goodquality individuals present exaggerated sexual ornaments bird species often demonstrate intersexual selection perhaps due lightweight body structures fights males may ineffective impractical therefore male birds commonly use following methods try seduce females propagandist cock behaves though knew advantageous impress males females species sprightly bearing fine feathers triumphant song quite well adapted warpropaganda courtship fisher bird species male female contribute great deal offspringcare cases male female continuously assessing based sexual characteristics bluefooted booby females tend choose males brighter blue feet birds brighter feet younger thus greater fertility ability provide paternal researchers put makeup males feet make look duller laying first eggs mates consequently laid smaller second eggs shows female boobies continuously evaluate mates reproductive males also vary behaviour based females foot colour males mated females brighter feet willing incubate one prominent forms avian communication means acoustic signals signals widespread avian species often used attract mates different aspects features bird song structure amplitude frequency evolved result sexual large song repertoires preferred females many avian one hypothesis song repertoire positively correlated size brains song control nucleus hvc large hvc would indicate developmental success song sparrows males large repertoires larger hvcs better body condition lower heterophiltolymphocyte ratios indicating better immune health supports idea song sparrows large song repertoires better lifetime fitness song repertoires honest indicators males quality possible explanations adaptation include direct benefits female superior parental care territory defense indirect benefits good genes japanese bush warbler songs island populations acoustically simple structure compared mainland song complexity correlated higher levels sexual selection mainland populations showing complex song structure advantageous environment high levels sexual selection another example purplecrowned fairywrens larger males species sing advertising songs lower frequency smaller rival males since body size characteristic good health lower frequency calls form honest signaling negative correlation body size call frequency supported across multiple species within rock sparrow song frequency positively associated reproductive success slower song rate associated age preferred females reproductive status individual communicated higher maximum frequency also positive correlation age extrapair copulation bird calls also known continue pair formation several socially monogamous bird species one experimental population zebra finches increased singing activity male increase positively correlated partners reproductive investment female finches bred cages two subsequent males differed varying amounts song output females produced larger eggs orange yolks paired male high song output suggests relative amount song production paired zebra finch males might function stimulate partner rather attract extrapair birds also use visual stimuli bright colors large ornamentation sociosexual communication well species ornaments considered honest signs fitness often costly produce show individual healthy enough mate choosing peacocks plumage shows intersexual selection ornate males compete chosen females result stunning feathered display large unwieldy enough pose significant survival disadvantage demonstrating handicap principle possibly provide means demonstrating body symmetry peahens trying discover health male fitness genes diseases injuries genetic disorders may impair bodys symmetry tail experiments eyespots removed tail feathers also known trains significant decline mating success compared control group supports hypothesis train elaboration evolved least part result female choice common explanation adaptation females gain indirect benefits good genes offspring peafowl lekking species males provide care offspring therefore females gain direct benefits mating elaborate however conflicting evidence found removal large number eyespots males train reduce mating success although outside natural variation eyespot loss shows peafowl preference complex originally takahashi et al found evidence peahens expressed preference males elaborate trains shows trains universal target female choice due small variance among males across populations peacocks train also reliable indicator individuals condition although train may necessary mating success females seem affected males behavioral characteristics great bustards age weight display effort significant independent predictors male mating success whiskers neck plumage reliable indicators male age males sexual display consists series extravagant body postures movements end interested female approaches reiterative almost obstinate exhibition cloaca fully surrounded pure white feathers allow easy detection possible parasites remains exposure cloaca widespread precopulatory displays birds related high probability transmission sexual male great bustards may use highly toxic cantharidin taken blister beetles genus meloe clean intestine cloaca plumage cantharidin kill great bustard many beetles selfmedication could evolved great bustards sexual selection mechanism capable transmitting females signal good resistance poisonous compound similar way costly secondary sexual traits exhibited males many species great bustards may eat toxic blister beetles genus meloe increase sexual arousal parrots ornate males brighter plumage preferred females males typically immunologically superior higher leukocyte counts evidence supports idea bright plumage honest signal involved female california quail uses multiple male plumage characteristics deciding mate responds different ways variety artificially manipulated traits various visual signals act combination attract mate female choice shift toward several particularly exaggerated redlegged partridge male carotenoid ornamentation positively correlated relative reproductive investment female species variable egg laying capacity females mated colorenhanced males produced larger quantity eggs less time controls eggs produced similar quality cases showing females adjust laying capacity based apparent carotenoidbased ornamentation cosmetic coloration another mechanism male birds use try attract mate cosmetic coloration involves brightening birds feathers thus making attractive females cosmetic coloration two different types first type substances produced bird uropygial gland secretions skin secretions powder second kind substances bird acquires environment vegetal matter contained carcass viscera fresh first type coloration whereby animal produces substances coloration directed secretions uropygial gland gland secretes waxes oils make feathers appear glossier causes increase brightness feathers coated preen oils look brighter degree plumage glossy way mates could determine diet overall health individual uropygial gland also change shape reflected light feathers alters wavelengths light reflected secretions gland illustrate coloration cosmetic example species hornbill produce colored gland secretions apply plumage thereby changing color feathers sexually mature birds develop coloration would lead inference secretions something sexual activity birds another example greater flamingo phoenicopterus roseus study found flamingo applied carotenoid rich secretions uropygial gland plumage resulting cosmetic coloration may influence mate data supported findings application oils frequent periods flamingos displaying mates presence cosmetic coloration decreased egg hatching indicating coloration function finding mates use mate found last example house finch found preen waxes feathers acted cosmetics waxes increased signal content feather signal content correlated condition individual increased signaling value mates therefore affected mate choice implying cosmetic coloration effect sexual selection carotenoid pigments seen multiple families birds traced back cenozoic era indicating pigments strong evolutionary benefit second type coloration also involves gland secretions powder powder feathers modified feathers disintegrate fine powder powder feathers found pigeons parrots herons herons provide great example cosmetic coloration related mate choice sexual selection whistling heron develop yellowish color neck stomach tail due powder feathers coloration due powder intense breeding season bustards males use red powder courtship displays attract mates powder fades display examples show modifications feathers affect mate choice last kind cosmetic coloration external substances used color feathers dirt bearded vultures individuals bath mud degree mud stains feathers seen sign dominance sign dominance could affect mate choice nest building another way birds visually signal fitness without need plumage ornamentation eurasian wren males build multiple nests territory display large number complete unoccupied nests gives males reproductive advantage nests never used appear completely ornamental avian olfactory signals often overlooked form communication possess developed olfactory apparatuses similar function structure vertebrates known communicate chemically several species birds found discriminate sex using olfactory cues alone spotless starling found individuals able identify sex conspecifics members species using scent produced uropygial gland secretion uropygial secretion composition known differ among evidence supported another study using different species darkeyed junco showing sex recognition olfaction may widespread taxa found juncos able identify sex conspecifics well body specific odors crested auklets directly related courtship behavior species preferentially orient specific tangerinescented plumage odor mechanistic courtship behavior involves smelling scented neck region several species birds also known combine visual auditory stimuli elaborate courtship displays combination song dance create complex courtship display favored sexual selection females assessing males ability perform wellchoreographed display superb lyrebirds longtailed manakins give elaborate displays involving vocal nonvocal sound production well visual male bowerbirds build elaborately decorated structures called bowers attract mates bowers hut towerlike structures often decorated sticks fruits flowers stones vogelkop bowerbird species bowerbird least plumage ornamentation males females nearly identical builds elaborately decorated bowers correlation shows female attention changed body ornamentation bower acrobatic aerial displays another behavior used advertise fitness potential species frequently use aerial displays means courtship behavior smaller agile males selected case dunlin display rate well proportion time spent aerial display negatively correlated male body size one courtship behaviors lead smaller males selected brownheaded cowbirds male displays less intense directed toward females directed males intense displays males likely used demonstrate condition dominance status sometimes displays escalate physical fights less dominant male injured example intrasexual competition requires energy attraction mate visual stimuli also used malemale competition rock sparrows elaborate feather ornamentations best predictor dominance foraging groups shown use social network analysis determine patterns leaderfollower interactions individuals brightest yellow breast patches showed dominance foraging group followers compared less elaborate several sexually selected ornaments may used courtship also used armaments antbird songs sexually monomorphic ornaments function deterrents competitive intrasexual interactions well mate choice several species hypocnemis antbirds acoustic signals function intrasexual competition mate choice removal experiments performed determine function takes precedence sexes use song ornament form competition however males demonstrate stronger signaling cases females giving frequent signals stronger social pairing mating occurs bird song mainly dedicated territorial defense behavior sexually selected trait ensures defense female rearing also evidence vocal amplitude effects malemale competition species great tit courtship songs performed relatively low amplitudes whereas territorial songs broadcast songs performed high amplitudes suggests environment necessary devote energy territory defense attracting performance level territory defense song important context sexual selection manipulating territory defense song banded wren simulate three levels song performance birds much less likely approach high performance recording medium low performance stimuli also low performance stimuli challenged without postcopulatory sexual selection one main factors drives evolution sperm morphology ultimately relative ability fertilize egg copulation sperm competition occurs female inseminated multiple males one breeding season resulting differential fertilization success among males birds last male inseminate female usually fertilizes highest proportion eggs time fertilization occurs oldest spermatozoa known last male sperm precedence best strategy increasing likelihood extra pair fertilization time copulation close onset female oviposition many male adaptations offensive defensive selected due phenomenon variety avian offensive adaptations include variable sperm morphology testes size well strategies evade mate guarding morphological sperm traits flagellum head midpiece length studied several species passerine birds determine phenotypic correlations across large variation sperm length passerine birds total sperm length vary several females passerine species store sperm several weeks insemination fertilization driven evolution sperm able survive longer periods time species sperm longer flagella despite ability swim faster increase fertilization success require energy cause shorter sperm superb fairywren socially monogamous species high frequency extra pair copulations relative amount extrapair paternity greater individuals sperm shorter flagellum larger head males longer flagella smaller heads higher withinpair paternity shorter sperm large heads able withstand long durations storage whereas opposite phenotype better outcompeting previously stored since fertilization chances individual male proportional amount sperm simultaneously transferred female size testes resulting production sperm increases situations high intrasexual negative correlation testis size variation mate guarding behavior several species australian maluridae competition level sperm increases testicular spermatogenic tissue also increases proportionately suggests sperm competition selects greater sperm production per unit volume testicular tissue proportion motile sperm ejaculates also greater species highest intrasexual mate guarding common defensive postcopulatory behavior birds behavior males attempt prevent cuckoldry males exhibit higher levels mate guarding behavior higher chance paternity following one mate guarding method following fertilized female prevent extrapair copulations could decrease particular males chance paternity feasible cases due inability couple always stay together another form mate guarding common male increase inpair copulations increasing females store spermatozoa increasing likelihood mate guarding energetically costly adjusted based risk cuckoldry seen seychelles warbler mate guarding behavior negatively correlated foraging behavior body condition increase number males environment led subsequent increase mate guarding adaptations
