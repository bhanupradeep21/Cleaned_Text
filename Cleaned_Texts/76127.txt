assimilation sound change phonemes typically consonants vowels change become similar nearby sounds common type phonological process across languages assimilation occur either within word words occurs normal speech becomes common rapid speech cases assimilation causes sound spoken differ normal pronunciation isolation prefix english input pronounced phonetic rather n case n becomes since phonetically similar p cases change accepted canonical word phrase especially recognized standard spelling implosion pronounced composed plosion explosion english handbag canonically ˈhændbæɡ often pronounced ˈhæmbæɡ rapid speech b sounds bilabial consonants places articulation similar however sequence db different places similar manner articulation voiced stop sometimes elided sometimes causes canonical n phoneme assimilate b pronunciations ˈhænbæɡ ˈhændbæɡ however common normal speech contrast word cupboard although historically compound cup kʌp board bɔːrd always pronounced ˈkʌbərd never

single segment features components known coalescence fusion assimilation occurs two different types complete assimilation sound affected assimilation becomes exactly sound causing assimilation partial assimilation sound becomes one features remains different features tonal languages may exhibit tone assimilation effect tonal umlaut sign languages also exhibit assimilation characteristics

vowels phonetic features often influenced preceding vowel example finnish case markers come two forms ɑ written æ written ä depending whether preceding vowel back front however difficult know history finnish actual assimilatory change took place distribution pairs endings finnish operation assimilatory innovation probably outbirth innovation long ago opposite direction umlaut vowel modified conform closely vowel next syllable coalescence phonological situation whereby adjacent sounds replaced single sound shares features two originally adjacent sounds words coalescence type assimilation whereby two sounds fuse become one fused sound shares similar characteristics two fused sounds examples english include dəʊnt ju dəʊntʃu instance j fused tʃ tʃ palatoalveolar sound palatal feature derived j alveolar another english example would wʊd ju wʊdʒu examples languages chumburung becomes three horns case ɪ retained coalescence rising tone u appears coalesced two major types coalescence reductive unreductive reductive coalescence type coalescence sound segments reduced fusion made example xhosa lˈalaini becomes e lˈoleni side ai segment first form reduces e hand nonreductive coalescence reduction sound segments even though evidence fusion example shona vá tengesa sell becomes ku téngésá sell original sound reduce respect sound segments even though rising tone vowels coalesced form indicates fusion á vowels
