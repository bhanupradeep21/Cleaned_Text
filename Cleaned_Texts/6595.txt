cyanide poisoning poisoning results exposure number forms early symptoms include headache dizziness fast heart rate shortness breath phase may followed seizures slow heart rate low blood pressure loss consciousness cardiac onset symptoms usually occurs within survivors longterm neurological toxic cyanidecontaining compounds include hydrogen cyanide gas number cyanide poisoning relatively common following breathing smoke house potential routes exposure include workplaces involved metal polishing certain insecticides medication sodium nitroprusside certain seeds apples liquid forms cyanide absorbed cyanide ions interfere cellular respiration resulting bodys tissues unable use diagnosis often may suspected person following house fire decreased level consciousness low blood pressure high lactic blood levels cyanide measured take levels mgl mild mgl moderate mgl severe greater mgl generally result exposure suspected person removed source exposure treatment involves supportive care giving person hydroxocobalamin vitamin appears useful antidote generally sodium thiosulphate may also historically cyanide used mass suicide used genocide hydrogen cyanide inhaled cause coma seizures apnea cardiac arrest death following matter seconds lower doses loss consciousness may preceded general weakness dizziness headaches vertigo confusion perceived difficulty breathing first stages

nitroprusside hypertensive inhalation hydrogen cyanide gas last typically occurs one three mechanisms potential contributing factors cyanide present potential harmreduction factor vitamin form hydroxocobalamin also spelled hydroxycobalamin might reduce negative effects chronic exposure whereas deficiency might worsen negative health effects following exposure cyanide potent cytochrome c oxidase cox aka complex iv inhibitor cyanide poisoning form histotoxic hypoxia interferes oxidative specifically cyanide binds heme binuclear center thus noncompetitive inhibitor prevents electrons passing cox transferred blocks mitochondrial electron transport chain also interferes pumping proton mitochondrial matrix would otherwise occur stage therefore cyanide interferes aerobic respiration also atp synthesis pathway facilitates owing close relationship two one antidote cyanide poisoning nitrite ie via amyl nitrite works converting ferrohemoglobin ferrihemoglobin compete cox free cyanide cyanide bind iron heme groups instead ferrihemoglobin carry oxygen amount ferrihemoglobin formed without impairing oxygen transport much greater amount cox cyanide broadspectrum poison reaction inhibits essential aerobic metabolism cox found many forms however susceptibility cyanide far uniform across affected species instance plants alternative electron transfer pathway available passes electrons directly ubiquinone confers cyanide resistance bypassing lactate produced anaerobic glycolysis oxygen concentration becomes low normal aerobic respiration pathway cyanide poisoning inhibits aerobic respiration therefore increases anaerobic glycolysis causes rise lactate plasma lactate concentration mmol per liter indicator cyanide poisoning defined presence blood cyanide concentration
