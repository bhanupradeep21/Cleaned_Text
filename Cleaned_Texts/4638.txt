corythoraptor lit helmeted thief genus oviraptorid dinosaur late maastrichtian nanxiong formation south china contains one species c jacobsi known single wellpreserved skeleton named paleontologist louis l jacobs bears tall crest similar modern cassowary possibly similar functionality display resonance detect lowerfrequency sounds like oviraptorids bones corythoraptor heavily pneumatized many air pockets microanalysis bones indicates seasonal growth spurts type specimen probably died age meaning growth continued least year development type specimen reached ft length oviraptorids may predominantly inhabited arid environments ate xerophytic droughtresistant plants nuts seeds however corythoraptor coexisted six oviraptorid genera may eaten different foods niche partitioning

represent foramina allowed blood vessels flow indicating keratinous sheath rhamphotheca beak similar ornithomimids ventral side underside premaxillae highly broken could indicate bone lightweight

oviraptorids typically found arid environments well nuts seeds also proposed ate shellfish jaws appear wellequipped crush shells arid environment probably sustain high enough shellfish six different oviraptorid species known ganzhou may exhibited niche partitioning different species targeting different based histological analysis portion fibula radius growth marks indicate holotype older years

therefore still young adult yet reached maximum size crest serve mating display would suggest corythoraptor sexually active finished growing growth continued years point development corythoraptor reached ft length mediumsized crest corythoraptor apparently quite similar casque modern cassowary cassowary uses casque dissipate heat brain cavity resonator aid detection gauge point origin low frequency signals across greater distance corythoraptor latter may used hear predators prey items possibly pick low frequency mating calls modern cassowaries however unclear corythoraptor capable producing low frequencies since produced throat also possible crests used display larger ornamented casques equating higher ranking group hierarchy better fitness mating season cassowary casques vary
