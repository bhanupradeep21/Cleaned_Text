illusion distortion senses reveal mind normally organizes interprets sensory stimulation although illusions distort human perception reality generally shared illusions may occur human senses visual illusions optical illusions bestknown understood emphasis visual illusions occurs vision often dominates senses example individuals watching ventriloquist perceive voice coming dummy since able see dummy mouth illusions based general assumptions brain makes perception assumptions made using organizational principles eg gestalt theory individuals capacity depth perception motion perception perceptual constancy illusions occur due biological sensory structures within human body conditions outside body within ones physical environment term illusion refers specific form sensory distortion unlike hallucination distortion absence stimulus illusion describes misinterpretation true sensation example hearing voices regardless environment would hallucination whereas hearing voices sound running water another auditory source would illusion wrong consider illusions misinterpretations brain perceives something exists unlike hallucination stimulus absent visual illusion optical illusion characterized visually perceived images deceptive misleading therefore information gathered visual sense processed create percept tally information senses physical visual system includes eyes namely retinas central nervous system namely brains visual cortex constructs reality perceptual cognitive neural pathways visual illusions least part thought caused excessive stimulation competing stimuli stimulus follows individual dedicated neural path early stages visual processing intense repetitive activity interaction active adjoining channels perceptual neural circuits usually level causes physiological imbalance alters perception lowlevel visual processing retinal circuit arranges information photoreceptors creating initial visual percepts patterns light fall retina hermann grid illusion mach bands two illusions widely considered caused biological phenomenon named lateral inhibition receptor signal retinas receptive fields light dark areas compete one intermediatelevel visual assembles visual elements collective percept distinguishes objects backgrounds many common visual illusions consequence percept constructed intermediatelevel visual processing elements first captured lowlevel processing might easily interpreted form image differs objective reality example two objects size placed certain background conditions us believe one object might larger background removed replaced percept immediately changes correct scenario effectively concluding objects equal highlevel visual processing consolidates information gathered various sources apply cognitive influences create conscious visual experience thus allowing us recognize complex identity different elements disparate relations cognitive processes visual illusions also often product processing stage stage might ultimately become conscious optical illusion two crucial properties visual system related mostly highlevel visual processing referred selectivity invariance consistently attempted replicate image recognition computer algorithms selectivity refers identification specific features relevant recognize specific element object abstracting features fundamental performing recognition eg see shape house certain contours essential us simply recognize contours image properties color hand invariance refers ability indifferent small variations given feature effectively identifying variations simply different versions feature eg able recognize given handwritten letter alphabet even written different people distinct styles whole process constructs visual experience extremely complex multiple qualities unmatched computer digital system organized many sequential parallel subprocesses essential building conscious image world whole visual system seeks simplify categorize unstructured lowlevel visual information selectivity invariance thus trying organize image filling gaps assumptions become vulnerable auditory illusion illusion hearing auditory equivalent visual illusion listener hears either sound present stimulus impossible sounds short audio illusions highlight areas human ear brain organic makeshift tools differ perfect audio receptors better worse one example auditory illusion shepard tone examples tactile illusions include phantom limb thermal grill illusion cutaneous rabbit illusion curious illusion occurs crossed index middle fingers run along bridge nose one finger side resulting perception two separate noses brain areas activated illusory tactile perception similar activated actual tactile tactile illusions also elicited haptic illusory tactile objects used create virtual temporal illusion distortion perception time occurs time interval two events narrow typically less second cases person may momentarily perceive time slowing stopping speeding running backward illusions occur senses including involved food perception shown modulate perceived staleness crispness food products also discovered even portion taste receptor tongue became damaged illusory taste could produced tactile evidence olfactory smell illusions occurred positive negative verbal labels given prior olfactory mcgurk effect shows hear influenced see hear person speaking auditory component one sound paired visual component another sound leading perception third illusions occur result illness disorder types illusions shared everyone typical condition example people migraines often report fortification illusionscitation needed perception linked specific brain activity elicited brain stimulation illusory percepts evoked range simple phosphenes detections lights visual field highlevel singlecase study patient undergoing presurgical evaluation epilepsy treatment electrical stimulation left temporoparietal junction evoked percept nearby illusory person closely
