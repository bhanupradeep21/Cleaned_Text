biliary colic also known symptomatic cholelithiasis gallbladder attack gallstone attack colic sudden pain occurs due gallstone temporarily blocking cystic typically pain right upper part abdomen pain usually lasts minutes often occurs eating heavy meal repeated attacks cholecystokinin gastrointestinal hormone plays role colic following consumption fatty meals hormone triggers gallbladder contract may expel stones duct temporarily block successfully gallstone formation occurs precipitation crystals aggregate form stones common form cholesterol forms include calcium bilirubin pigment mixed conditions produce similar symptoms include appendicitis stomach ulcers pancreatitis gastroesophageal reflux treatment gallbladder attacks typically surgery remove either done small incisions single larger open surgery larger incision associated complications surgery small surgery typically done general unable surgery medication try dissolve stones shock wave lithotripsy may clear whether surgery indicated everyone biliary developed world adults gallstones biliary colic occurs nearly people problems related gallstones year following people biliary colic eventually develop inflammation gallbladder complications include inflammation pain common presenting symptom usually described sharp crampy dull severe right upper quadrant pain may radiate right shoulder less commonly behind nausea vomiting associated biliary colic individuals may also present pain induced following fatty meal symptom indigestion pain often lasts longer minutes patients usually normal vital signs biliary colic whereas patients cholecystitis usually febrile ill appearing lab studies ordered include complete blood count liver function tests lipase biliary colic lab findings usually within normal limits alanine aminotransferase aspartate transaminase usually suggestive liver disease whereas elevation bilirubin alkaline phosphatase suggests common bile duct pancreatitis considered lipase value elevated gallstone disease major cause pancreatitiscitation needed presence gallstones lead inflammation gallbladder cholecystitis biliary tree cholangitis acute inflammation pancreas pancreatitis rarely gallstone become impacted ileocecal valve joins caecum ileum causing gallstone ileus mechanical complications delayed surgery include pancreatitis empyema perforation gallbladder cholecystitis cholangitis obstructive biliary pain absence gallstones known postcholecystectomy syndrome may severely affect patients quality life even absence disease biliary pain frequently caused obstruction common bile duct cystic duct gallstone however presence gallstones frequent incidental finding always necessitate treatment absence identifiable disease furthermore biliary pain may associated functional disorders biliary tract socalled acalculous biliary pain pain without stones even found patients postcholecystectomy removal gallbladder possibly consequence dysfunction biliary tree sphincter oddi acute episodes biliary pain may induced exacerbated certain foods commonly high cholesterol gallstone formation risk factors include age female sex family history pregnancy parity obesity hormonal birth control diabetes mellitus cirrhosis prolonged fasting rapid weight loss total parenteral nutrition ileal disease impaired gallbladder patients gallstones biliary colic increased risk complications including complications gallstone disease per year therefore prophylactic cholecystectomy rarely indicated unless part special population includes porcelain gallbladder individuals eligible organ transplant diabetics sickle cell diagnosis guided persons presenting symptoms laboratory findings gold standard imaging modality presence gallstones ultrasound right upper quadrant many reasons choice including exposure radiation low cost availability city urban rural hospitals gallstones detected specificity sensitivity greater needed signs ultrasound may suggest cholecystitis computed tomography ct indicated investigating gallbladder disease stones ct utilized intraabdominal pathology exists diagnosis endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ercp used lab tests suggest existence gallstone bile ercp diagnostic therapeuticcitation needed initial management includes relief symptoms correcting electrolyte fluid imbalance may occur antiemetics dimenhydrinate used treat pain may treated antiinflammatories nsaids ketorolac opioids morphine less commonly may nsaids less equivalent hyoscine butylbromide antispasmodic also indicated biliary biliary colic risk infection minimal therefore antibiotics presence infection indicates unclear whether experiencing gallstone attack receive surgical treatment scientific basis assess whether surgery outperformed treatment insufficient better studies needed sbu report treatment biliary colic dictated underlying presence gallstones usually visualized ultrasound generally necessitates surgical treatment removal gall bladder typically via laparoscopy removal gallbladder surgery known cholecystectomy definitive surgical treatment biliary colic cochrane review found tentative evidence suggest early gallbladder removal may better delayed early laparoscopic cholecystectomy happens within hours cochrane review evaluated receiving early versus delayed surgery found waited average months ended hospital complications compared none early intervention early intervention advantages including reduced number visits emergency department fewer conversions open surgery less operating time required reduced time hospital swedish agency sbu estimated increasing acute phase surgeries could free multiple inhospital days per patient would additionally spare pain suffering wait receiving report found acute inflammation gallbladder surgically treated acute phase within days symptom debut without increasing risk complications compared surgery done later asymptomatic annual risk developing biliary colic
