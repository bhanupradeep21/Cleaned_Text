immunology linear epitope also sequential epitope binding site recognized antibodies linear sequence amino acids ie primary structure contrast antibodies recognize conformational epitope specific threedimensional shape tertiary structure antigen substance immune system recognize foreign provokes immune response since antigens usually proteins large bind whole receptor specific segments form antigen bind specific antibody segments called epitopes likewise paratope antibody comes contact epitope proteins composed repeating nitrogencontaining subunits called amino acids linear sequence amino acids compose protein called primary structure typically present simple line sequential proteins much like knot rather straight string antigen broken lysosome yields small peptides recognized amino acids lie continuously line hence called linear performing molecular assays involving use antibodies western blot immunohistochemistry elisa one carefully choose antibodies recognize linear conformational instance protein sample boiled treated betamercaptoethanol run sdspage western blot proteins essentially denatured therefore assume natural threedimensional conformations therefore antibodies recognize linear epitopes instead conformational epitopes chosen immunodetection contrast immunohistochemistry protein structure preserved antibodies recognize conformational epitopes preferred httpsenwikipediaorgwikilinearepitope
