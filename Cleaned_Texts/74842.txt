triazofos chemical compound used acaricides insecticides nematicides triazofos registered federal office consumer protection food safety since authorized insecticide eu december commission regulation july revoked commission regulation production triazofos began hoechst patent company bayer announced termination sale product due poisonous triazofos synthesized various reactions method manufacturing triazofos produces substance presence triethylamine reacting suspended acetone diethoxythiophosphoryl another method produces substance reaction phenylhydrazine sodium cyanate formamide oodiethyl phosphorochlorothioate using cyanate additions condensation improved process manufacturing triazofos uses phase transfer catalyst achieve higher yields purity comprising substituted
