advanced cardiac life support advanced cardiovascular life support acls refers set clinical guidelines urgent emergent treatment lifethreatening cardiovascular conditions cause caused cardiac arrest using advanced medical procedures medications techniques acls expands basic life support bls adding recommendations additional medication advanced procedure use cpr guidelines fundamental efficacious bls acls practiced advanced medical providers including physicians nurses providers usually required hold certifications acls care acls almost always semantically interchangeable term advanced life support als used distinctly acls tends refer immediate cardiac care als tends refer specialized resuscitation care ecmo pci ems community als may refer advanced care provided paramedics bls may refer fundamental care provided emts emrs without terms referring cardiovascularspecific care advanced cardiac life support refers set guidelines used medical providers treat lifethreatening cardiovascular conditions lifethreatening conditions range dangerous arrhythmias cardiac arrest acls algorithms frequently address least five different aspects pericardiac arrest care airway management ventilation cpr compressions continued bls defibrillation medications due seriousness diseases treated paucity data known acls patients need multiple rapid simultaneous treatments acls executed standardized algorithmic set treatments successful acls treatment starts diagnosis correct ekg rhythm causing arrest common cardiac arrest rhythms covered acls guidelines include ventricular tachycardia ventricular fibrillation pulseless electrical activity asystole dangerous nonarrest rhythms typically covered includes narrow widecomplex tachycardias torsades de pointe atrial fibrillationflutter rapid ventricular response successful acls treatment generally requires team trained individuals common team roles include leader backup leader cpr performers airwayrespiratory specialist iv access medication administration specialist monitor defibrillator attendant pharmacist lab member send samples recorder document inhospital events members frequently physicians midlevel providers nurses allied health providers outofhospital events teams usually composed small number emts paramedics acls algorithms include multiple simultaneous treatment recommendations acls providers may required strictly adhere guidelines however physicians may generally deviate pursue different evidencebased treatment especially addressing underlying cause arrest andor unique aspects patients care acls algorithms complex table demonstrates common aspects acls due rapidity complexity acls care well recommendation performed standardized fashion providers must usually hold certifications acls care certifications may provided different generally national organizations legitimacy ultimately determined hospital hiring privileging boards acls certification frequently requirement employment health care provider acls certifications usually provide education aforementioned aspects acls care except specialized resuscitation techniques specialized resuscitation techniques covered acls certifications use restricted specialized providers acls education based ilcor recommendations adapted local practices authoritative medical organizations american red cross european resuscitation council resuscitation council asia bls proficiency usually prerequisite acls training however initial portions acls class may cover initial training usually takes around hours includes classroom instruction handson simulation experience passing test practical component end course usually final requirement receive receiving initial certification providers must usually recertify every two years class similar content lasts seven hours widely accepted providers acls certification include nonexclusively american heart association american red cross european resuscitation council australian resuscitation council holding acls certification simply attests provider tested knowledge application acls guidelines certification supersede providers scope practice determined state law employer protocols provide license practice like medical intervention researchers ask whether acls effective data generally demonstrates patients better survival outcomes increased rosc increased survival hospital discharge andor superior neurological outcomes receive however large study roc patients showed effect may acls delivered first six minutes study also found acls increases survival produce superior neurological outcomes studies raised concerns acls education inconstantly inadequately taught result poor retention leading poor acls one study looked acls use epinephrine atropine bicarbonate calcium lidocaine bretylium cardiac arrests found medications associated higher resuscitation research acls challenging acls bundle care recommendations individual treatment component profoundly consequential active debate within resuscitation research community value certain interventions active areas research include determining value vasopressors ideal airway different waveforms
