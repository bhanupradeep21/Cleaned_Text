bergmanns rule ecogeographical rule states within broadly distributed taxonomic clade populations species larger size found colder environments populations species smaller size found warmer regions rule derives relationship size linear dimensions meaning height volume increase colder environments bergmanns rule describes overall size animals include body proportions like allens rule although originally formulated relation species within genus often recast relation populations within species also often cast relation latitude possible rule also applies plants rapicactus rule named nineteenth century german biologist carl bergmann described pattern although first notice bergmanns rule often applied mammals birds endotherms researchers also found evidence rule studies ectothermic ant leptothorax acervorum bergmanns rule appears hold true many mammals birds largerbodied animals tend conform closely bergmanns rule smallerbodied animals least certain latitudes perhaps reflects reduced ability avoid stressful environments addition general pattern across space bergmanns rule reported populations historical evolutionary time exposed varying thermal particular temporary reversible dwarfing mammals noted two relatively brief upward excursions temperature paleogene paleoceneeocene thermal eocene thermal maximum human populations near poles including inuit aleut sami people average heavier populations midlatitudes consistent bergmanns also tend shorter limbs broader trunks consistent allens according marshall newman native american populations generally consistent bergmanns rule although cold climate small body size combination eastern inuit canoe nation yuki people andes natives harrison lake lillooet runs contrary expectations bergmanns newman contends bergmanns rule holds populations eurasia hold subsaharan human populations also show decrease stature increase mean annual bergmanns rule holds africans pygmy phenotype pygmy peoples populations show shorter stature smaller body size due adaptation hotter humid elevated environmental humidity evaporative cooling sweating less effective way dissipate body heat higher surface area volume ratio

morphological changes regarded resulting global warming may demonstrate example evolutionary change following bergmanns bergmanns rule reported vaguely followed female however rules validity supported evidence bergmanns rule found marine bergmanns rule generally applied regarding cactaceae case saguaro carnegiea gigantea described botanical bergmann instead shown depend rainfall particularly winter precipitation members genus rapicactus larger cooler environments stem diameter increases altitude particularly latitude however since rapicactus grow distributional area average precipitation tends diminish higher latitudes body size conditioned climatic variables could suggest possible bergmann earliest explanation given bergmann originally formulating rule larger animals lower surface area volume ratio smaller animals radiate less body heat per unit mass therefore stay warmer cold climates warmer climates impose opposite problem body heat generated metabolism needs dissipated quickly rather stored thus higher surface areatovolume ratio smaller animals hot dry climates facilitates heat loss skin helps cool body important note analyzing bergmanns rule field groups populations

invertebrates reduced predation pressure high study shallow water brachiopods found predation reduced polar areas relative temperate latitudes trend found deep water predation also reduced comparison tropical temperate brachiopods perhaps tropical brachiopods evolved smaller sizes successfully evade german zoologist ecologist richard hesse proposed extension bergmanns rule hesses rule also known rule states species inhabiting colder climates larger heart relation body weight closely related species inhabiting warmer study valerius geist claimed bergmanns rule false correlation temperature spurious instead geist found body size proportional duration annual productivity pulse food availability per animal growing many factors affect body size many critics bergmanns rule somewho believe latitude poor predictor body mass examples selective factors may contribute body mass changes size food items available effects body size success predator effects body size vulnerability predation resource availability example organism adapted tolerate cold temperatures may also tolerate periods food shortage due correlation cold temperature food larger organism rely greater fat stores provide energy needed survival well able procreate longer periods resource availability major constraint overall success many organisms resource scarcity limit total number organisms habitat time also cause organisms adapt becoming smaller body size resource availability thus becomes modifying restraint bergmanns
