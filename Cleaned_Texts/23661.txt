space ethics astroethics discipline applied ethics discusses moral ethical implications arising astrobiological research space exploration space deals practical contemporary issues like protection space hypothetical future issues pertaining interaction extraterrestrial life forms specific issues space ethics include space debris mitigation militarization space also theoretical topics like space terraforming space mining field also concerns fundamental moral questions ethicality seti meti intrinsic value extraterrestrial life humans treat extraterrestrial nonintelligent life like microbes extraterrestrial intelligent life whether distinction made first place astroethical issues often discussed elements broader issues general environmental protection astroethics described emerging discipline gaining attention necessity astrobiology true issue future guiding principle astroethics planetary protection pp seeks prevent introduction lifeforms earth celestial bodies forward vice versa back contamination thereby possible adverse consequences existing ecospheres resulting contamination principle anchored un outer space treaty established since signed ratified spacefaring nations precautionary principle defined wingspread conference precautionary principle approach supposed guide decisions face lack scientific knowledge consensus matter cospar workshop princeton university experts embraced precautionary principle concluded investigations interference likely harmful earth extraterrestrial bodies including extraterrestrial life contamination disturbance celestial environments seti astrobiologist margaret race methodist theologian richard randolph outlined principles search extraterrestrial life within solar wide range concrete issues discussed astroethics adumbrated following paragraphs millions pieces space debris defunct artificial objects space orbiting average one cataloged piece space debris falls back onto planet every day potentially posing risk organisms total estimated tons space debris reenter earths atmosphere every year due high friction atmospheric gases debris burns causing release chemical components may contribute atmospheric pollution ozone additionally space debris orbits earth extremely high velocity low earth orbit crewed space stations many satellites located debris typically reaches speeds around kms approximately mph result even tiny pieces debris severely damage destroy satellites spacecraft event collision could pose threat lives astronauts manned missions lead phenomenon kessler syndrome collision objects space produces new fragments space debris could set chain reaction collisions could render space around earth untraversable space missions unsuitable use satellites march legally binding international laws responsible extraction space debris mandating reduction new space debris brought earths however space agencies several countries implemented standards policies reduce introduction new space debris interagency space debris coordination committee iadc founded address issues regarding orbital additionally jaxa researching electromagnetic tether could used pull debris moral problem power space agencies launch material earths orbit gains without held accountable general public bear consequences atmospheric pollution risk hit space reconnaissance satellites used variety military intelligence purposes optical imaging signals intelligence noted data could infringe peoples privacy thereby lead ethical legal issues could also turn source national security threats

treaty signed spurred development intercontinental ballistic missiles soviet unions launch sputnik first artificial satellite following arms race united states treaty outlaws kinds military action including weapon tests space limits use space peaceful purposes ensures nations earth free explore space treaty since called question multiple times especially former president united states donald trump june trump announced plans establish space force would constitute new sixth branch united states expressed comes defending america enough merely american presence space must american dominance december united states space force act signed law votes democratic republican senators house result united states space force founded seen american contestation outer space treaty viktor bondarev chair federation council committee defense responded saying us go withdraw treaty would tough response aimed ensuring world despite russia space force branch military emergence space tourism gives rise number ethical concerns future frequent largescale landings celestial bodies like moon may damage pollute landing sites areas around scientific activity space benign guaranteed actions private people criteria laws made ensure space tourism doesnt negatively impact celestial bodies question astroethics terraforming controversial astroethical matter proponents terraforming like robert zubrin argue humans technologically advanced intelligent species earth moral obligation make celestial bodies habitable earths lifeforms ensure survival inevitable destruction ecocentrist biocentrist side debate criticizes position anthropocentrism argues celestial bodies may already contain life always intrinsic value matter advanced may oppose interplanetary contamination changes world would stem terraforming could endanger indigenous life alter evolutionary trajectory seti especially meti active seti uncontroversial come ethical implications meti criticized incompatible precautionary principle could reveal location planet potentially malevolent alien species therefore also potentially puts humanity risk without need individual prior consent violates basic scientific rule informed consent science must abide reflecting human history authors even fear enslavement humanity discovered advanced similarly stephen hawking one prominent meti critics warned potential consequences meeting species citing nearextinction aboriginal tasmanians equivalent case human concerns regarding ethicality meti might solution fermi paradox proposed extraterrestrial life forms may abstain attempting interstellar communication due potential danger may pose line precautionary astroethical considerations regarding meti lack legally enforceable protocols steps taken extraterrestrial life unpredictability cultural consequences discovery potential paradigm changes policy nations religions get speak humanity case contact made person group people selected contents messages point contention field whether extraterrestrial life intrinsic value therefore humans moral obligation protect becomes even difficult considering wide span possible extraterrestrial life forms whether treatment differ based criteria advancement intelligence former nasa chief historian steven j dick put mars belong martians even martians dick argues first step deciding interact life forms assess moral status complicated ambiguous relations animals earth sheltering species pets eating exterminating principle planetary protection provides life celestial bodies worthy protection harm also form contamination therefore confers rights even hypothetical extraterrestrial microbes situation contrasts treatment microbes even higherdeveloped organisms earth difference treatment hardly justifiable therefore according dick astroethical considerations broaden current ethical horizon unveil inconsistencies double standards move humanity anthropocentric ethic ascribing intrinsic value rationing beings cosmocentric biocentric one values living things fact dick says finding extraterrestrial life would necessitate transition away anthropocentric approach would longer consistently applicable
