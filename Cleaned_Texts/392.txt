meditation effect brain activity central nervous system became focus collaborative research neuroscience psychology neurobiology latter half century research meditation sought define characterize various practices effects meditation brain broken two categories state changes trait changes respectively alterations brain activities act meditating changes outcome longterm practice mindfulness meditation buddhist meditation approach found zen vipassana frequently jon kabatzinn describes mindfulness meditation complete unbiased attention current electroencephalography eeg used many studies primary method evaluating meditating brain electroencephalography uses electrical leads placed scalp measure collective electrical activity cerebral cortex specifically eeg measures electric fields large groups neurons eeg benefit excellent temporal resolution able measure aggregate activity portions entire cortex millisecond scale unlike imaging based methods eeg good spatial resolution appropriately used evaluate running spontaneous activity cortex spontaneous activity classified four main classifications based frequency activity ranging low frequency delta waves hz commonly found sleep beta waves hz associated awake alert brain two extremes theta waves hz alpha waves many studies mindfulness meditation assessed review cahn polich linked lower frequency alpha waves well theta waves much older studies report specific findings decreased alpha blocking increased frontal lobe specific theta alpha blocking phenomenon active brain normally presenting beta wave activity easily switch alpha wave activity often involved memory recall findings would suggest meditative state person relaxed maintains sharp awareness two large comprehensive review works however point poor control statistical analyses early studies comment said confidence increased alpha theta wave activity functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri another highly utilized methodology studying state changes meditating brains fmri detects subtle increases blood flow areas brain higher metabolic activity thus areas increased metabolic activity indicate regions brain currently used process whatever stimuli presented counter eeg advantage fmri spatial resolution ability produce detailed spatial maps brain activity suffers however temporal resolution measure progressive activity like eeg much detail relatively new technology fmri recently used assess brain state changes meditation studies shown heightened activity anterior cingulate cortex frontal cortex prefrontal cortex specifically dorsal medial prefrontal area vipassana similarly cingulate cortex frontal cortex areas shown increased activity zen studies comment possibility findings could indicate state heightened voluntary control attention mindfulness meditation review works cahn chiesa state results indicate consistency meditations effect regions brain citing multitude studies spanning meditative disciplines mention need investigation better review cahn also notes findings describing heightened emotional state meditators complex study conducted lutz et al focused emotional response investigation involved creation compassion meditation state novice experienced meditators testing meditators response emotionally charged sounds fmri results indicated heightened activity cingulate cortex also amygdala temporoparietal junction right posterior superior temporal sulcus response emotional sounds authors study believe indicates greater sensitivity emotional expression positive emotion due neural circuitry similar research state changes brain function older studies make specific claims trait changes meditators versus nonmeditators changes alpha wave indicated trait well state phenomena studies reported increase specific frequencies expressed alpha range increased alpha band power overall slowing reduction frequency eeg activity experienced meditators versus less experienced meditators alpha blocking phenomena observed state change brain function investigated possible trait change well one study examined variety meditation techniques tried show alpha blocking affected long term practice meditation testing response auditory review works however comment inconsistent findings well lack repeated results studies remark similar observations brain state changes general assertions made brain trait changes change electroencephalographic profile exists also important note trait changes observed meditation although indicate practitioners electroencephalographic profile modified practice meditation eeg studies yet shown changes nonmeditating brains even experienced meditators brain trait changes also observed neuroimaging studies often employing fmri metaanalysis neuroimaging studies eight brain regions found consistently altered including areas key metaawareness frontopolar cortexbrodmann area exteroceptive interoceptive body awareness sensory cortex insular cortex memory consolidation reconsolidation hippocampus self emotion regulation anterior cingulate cortex orbitofrontal cortex intra interhemispheric communication superior longitudinal fasciculus corpus changes distinguished density increases grey matter regions white matter pathways brains individuals meditate comparison individuals areas reported findings greater number structural changes found left hemisphere also evidence suggest meditation plays protective role natural reduction grey matter volume associated aging one study found evidence zen meditators experienced slower age related decline rate cerebral gray matter volume putamen plays role learning cognitive flexibility attentional processing could suggest better attentiveness aging meditators versus nonmeditators longterm meditation practitioners also shown higher tolerance effect correlated altered function structure somatosensory cortices increased ability decouple regions brain associated cognitive appraisal pain anterior cingulate cortex dorsolateral prefrontal brain state changes found meditators almost exclusively found higherorder executive association supports notion meditation increases selfregulation attentiveness recent studies also investigated changes may alter functionality connectivity default mode network hypothesized network brain regions active individual engaged internal tasks metaanalysis performed fox et al several sources bias indicated bring question validity meditation studies use neuroimaging fox et al suggests publication bias may leading overreporting significant despite however fox et al found consistent differences prefrontal cortex body awareness regions areas key metaawareness exteroceptive interoceptive body awareness memory consolidation reconsolidation self emotion regulation intra interhemispheric communication changes significant moderate global median effect size consistent mediumsized brain structure research needed firm conclusions madecitation needed besides scientific literature authors written promising research meditation books targeted general audiences one book buddhas brain rick hanson phd shares current scientific research investigations hanson neuroscientist researcher explains readers scientific studies plain language discuss impact results hansons main argument positive emotions like love strengthened meditation neuroplastic manner citing dozens scientific studies support hansons viewpoint representative larger popular movement study embrace eastern phenomena including meditation western world critics like owen flanagan phd believe hanson like overextending results current scientific studiescitation needed book bodhisattvas brain buddhism naturalized flanagan presents conservative viewpoint current scientific research cautions readers seemingly exciting results recent flanagan believe current science supports idea positive emotion strengthened way stroke victims recover use limbs flanagan acknowledge meditation may beneficial way mechanism meditation affects brain still similarly awasthi argues meditation nonspecific research studies showing clinical efficacy cases though mechanisms remain flanagan hanson use many scientific studies attempt support differing viewpoint authors identify need importance future studies investigating meditation meditation research still early stages
