changed time trends show slight decrease slight increase current levels prevalence low birth weights trended slightly upward low birth weight associated neonatal infection infant mortality well illness numerous studies attempted varying degrees success show links birth weight laterlife conditions including diabetes obesity tobacco smoking two genetic loci strongly linked birth weight four show evidence hhexide gck heritability birth weight ranges complex relationship babys genes maternal environment child developing foetal genes influence fetus grows utero maternal genes influence environment affects growing health mother pregnancy affect birth weight preexisting disease acquired disease pregnancy sometimes associated decreased birth weight example celiac disease confers odds ratio low birth weight approximately certain medications eg high blood pressure epilepsy put mother higher risk delivering low birth weight women younger older higher risk lowbirth weight multiple births mother one child one time also determinant birth weight baby likely outside aga appropriate gestational age multiple births put children higher rate low birth weight compared children born single birth low birth weight also vary maternal age rate low birth weight highest babies born women younger years old women aged rate low birth weight percent lowest rates low birth weight happened among babies whose mothers ages years years stressful events demonstrated produce significant effects birth weight mothers stressful events pregnancy especially first second trimester higher risk deliver low birth weight researchers furthered study found maternal stressful events occur prior conception negative impact birth weight well result higher risk preterm lower birth weight women experienced abuse physical sexual emotional pregnancy also increased risk delivering low birth weight example study completed witt et al women experienced stressful event ie death close family member infertility issues separation partner prior conception chance low birth weight baby compared experienced stressful life additionally mothers diagnosed posttraumatic stress disorder likely give birth low birth weight theory stress impact baby based two different mechanisms neuroendocrine pathway immuneinflammatory stress causes body produce stress hormones called glucocorticoids suppress immune system well raises levels placental corticotropinreleasing hormone crh lead preterm findings pose evidence future prevention efforts low birth weight babies one way decrease rates low birth weight premature delivery focus health women prior conception reproductive education screening counseling regarding mental health issues stress access primary nonhispanic blacks highest infant mortality rate united states deaths per live births compared national average deaths per live subsequently growing research supporting idea racial discrimination risk factor low birth weight one study collins et al evidence suggested african american mothers experienced high levels racial discrimination significantly higher risk delivering lowbirth weight baby compared african american mothers experienced racial environmental factors including exposure mother secondhand factor determining birth weight child children exposed smoke born low birth weight compared children born children born mothers smoked exposed secondhand smoke likely develop health problems earlier life neurodevelopmental mothers actively smoke pregnancy child higher risk born low birth smoking also stress management tool used expecting support lower socioeconomic status parents determinant low birth weight conflicting evidence socioeconomic status tied many babies admitted nicu born weeks pregnancy low birth weight less pounds could also medical condition requires special care united states nearly half million babies born preterm many babies also low birth four levels care neonatal care units intensive care high dependency care low dependency transitional children born abnormally low birth weight significant problems within first years life may trouble gaining weight obtaining adequate nutrition developing strong immune system also higher risks mortality behavior problems mental low birth weight babies likely develop following conditions compared normal birth weight said effects low birth weight childs first years life often intertwined maternal environmental genetic factors effects low birth weight slightly negatively significant childs life factors controlled factors taken account significant effect low birth weight childs development early physical growth likelihood underweight compared normal birth studies investigated persons birth weight influence future life including potential links obesity diabetes baby born small large gestational age either two extremes previously thought increased risk developing later found high birth weight maternal bmi associated increased risk developing obesity growth hormone gh therapy certain dose induced catchup lean body mass lbm however percentage body fat decreased ghtreated subjects bone mineral density sds measured dexa increased significantly ghtreated group compared untreated subjects though much debate whether sga small gestational age significantly adverse children warrant inducing babies low birth weight thought increased risk developing type diabetes later low birth weight linked increase rates obesity insulin resistance type diabetes shown children low birth weights increased leptin levels catch growth adiponectin levels positively related birth weight bmi babies increase risk type leptin adiponection mechanisms still studied involving low birth much variation regarding birth weight within continents countries
