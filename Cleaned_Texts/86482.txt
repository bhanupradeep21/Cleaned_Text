stanocephalosaurus stano greek stenos meaning narrow cephalo greek kephalÄ“ meaning head extinct genus largesized temnospondyl amphibians living early mid triassic etymology name likely came long narrow skull compared temnospondyls stanocephalosaurus lived aquatic lifestyle species even living salt currently three recognized species another needs material establish legitimacy three known

stanocephalosaurus birdi presumably honoring bird name narrow skull slender parasphenoid internal nairs well interpalatal vacuities key characteristics identifying fossil new genus barnum want designate family without complete skull defined species stanocephalosaurus discovered since variety regions india tanzania algeria currently three known species stanocephalosaurus species rajareddyi assumed belong genus subject still controversial birdi earliest discovered species stanocephalosaurus found middle triassic outside winslow arizona like stanocephalosaurus narrow head obtuse snout amenasensis characterized narrow posterior nares increased expansion pterygoids amenasensis newest species discovered triassic algerian sahara diagnostic characters include subtriangular external nostrils lateral borders small orbits posteriorly wide postfrontals elongate parietals concave posterior margin skull table ovoid anterior palatal vacuities posteriorly pointed choanae oval interpterygoid fenestrae discovery species gypsum layer suggests pronus known exclusively locality west mkongoleko anisian fluviallacustrine mudstonesandstone manda beds formation tanzania named aa howie rajareddyi currently unconfirmed species discovered pg basin central india originally parotosuchus rajareddyi vertebrate fauna constriction otic notch considered member mastodonsauridae new combination known rajareddyi tabular postparietal posteriorly extended postorbital relatively smaller postparietal however fossils found belonging species scattered fragments better material needed confidently classifying rajareddyi new skull stanocephalosaurus key features characteristic temnospondyl order apparent flattened shape dorsal well ventral surfaces stanocephalosaurus skull well ornamented honeycombed patterns throughout palatal views skulls genus show narrow interpalatal vacuities due thin skulls well paired palatal tusks alternately functioning vomer palatine vomerine tusks directed backwards stanocephalosaurus shows increased expansion pterygoids palatines well narrow posterior nares vomer also bears two vomerine rows transversal denticle row longitudinal denticle row runs along inner margin choana palatines ectopterygoids broader temnospondyls barring capitosaurids stanocephalosaurus long triangular skull much longer broad elongated preorbital region continuously narrowing anteriorly obtuse rounded snout though varies species amenasensis tend much narrower snouts stanocephalosaurus least straight conical teeth premaxilla maxilla combined gradually increasing size towards skull regions previously inaccessible poorly preserved stanocephalosaurus observed xray microct scans including otic capsule delta groove exoccipital well parts arterial nervous system air pockets around stapes stanocephalosaurus hypothesized act resonance chambers meaning spoonshaped inner ear bone could related underwater hearing trait possibly associated early tetrapod evolution act link anuran tympanum due cranial morphology stanocephalosaurus narrow head elongated preorbital region compared temnospondyls stress levels biting slightly higher wider shorter vertebrae stanocephalosaurus rhachitomous neural arch bipartite centrum divided large unpaired wedgeshaped intercentrum smaller paired pleurocentra anterior posterior views intercentrum dorsally halfring surrounding persistent notochord ventral lateral sides lateral ventral surfaces intercentrum smooth suggesting continuation cartilage due unfinished medial surface posterodorsal margin intercentrum also shows parapophysis articulation capitulum lifestyle stanocephalosaurus long contended historically classified either bottom dwellers ambushers active histological observations lines arrested growth lags bone structure capitosaurids suggested lived semiarid environments strong seasonal rains forcing adapt aquatic well terrestrial environments however discovery amenasensis proves stanocephalosaurs lived aquatic lifestyle due present dermosensory much known stanocephalosaurus diet carnivore like temnospondyls due evidence suggesting better adapted toward life water assumed diets shifted towards eating aquatic organisms well stanocephalosaurus large flat skulls characteristic many large temnospondyls likely lifted entire skulls order open mouths rather lowering due largely aquatic stanocephalosaurs might lain wait prey surface water lifted massive head open mouth wide suck food inside much like modern stanocephalosaurus likely used large muscles neck attached large pectoral girdles small teeth present across genus addition large surface area neck muscle attachment could suggest suction feeding opening mouths also proposed dry season sebkhas species inhabit become ponds adults may eat larval juvenile individuals pond indicated lack juvenile specimens within gypsum layers bones well though little certainty stanocephalosaurus breathed paleontologists suggest air pockets around stapes hypothesized act resonance chambers meaning inner ear bone could related underwater hearing trait possibly associated early tetrapod amenasensis show circumorbital canal runs along prefrontal postorbital jugal supraanarial canal runs along nasal anterior half prefrontal dermosensory grooves suggest aquatic discovery several distinct species throughout continents noted stanocephalosaurus relatively widespread throughout pangea triassic discovery amenasensis gypsum layer corresponds infilling salt lake suggests evolution alluvial plain strong seasonal climate species also occupied sebkhas seasonal shifts seemingly staying even sebkhas drained ponds amenasensis like many temnospondyls euryhaline due inhabiting various salt water bodies gypsum crust many fossils discovered acted powerful preservation tool protecting bones atmospheric degradation high level gypsum suggests relatively extreme hypersaline httpsenwikipediaorgwikistanocephalosaurus
