executer hypothesis would exist inhibitory influence exerted influenced cortical spinal centers standing walking one issues neurobiologists concerned related ability learning retaining motor skills controlled primary motor cortex literature found primary motor cortex neurons may control skill acquisition retention one abilities motor cortex allow control plasticity occurs due everyday experience movement repetition common substrate plasticity internal system connections located around regions creating motor vestibulospinal tracts importance involved control postural adjustments head movements well balance maintenance movement body detected vestibular sensory neurons sensory motor replies counteracting movements vestibulospinal tracts exerting action group muscles throughout body lateral vestibulospinal tract excites antigravity muscles order exert control postural changes necessary compensate tilts movements body medial vestibulospinal tract innervates neck muscles order stabilize head position one moves around reticulospinal tracts serves connector corticospinal system cortical neurons control motor function tracts regulate sensitivity flexor responses ensure noxious stimuli elicit responses reticular formation also contains circuitry many complex actions orienting stretching maintaining complex posture commands initiate locomotor circuits spinal cord also transmitted medullary reticulospinal tract thus reticulospinal tracts involved many aspects motor control including integration sensory input guide motor balance various interacting neuronal systems locomotion
