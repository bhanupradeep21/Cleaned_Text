detect predators afar would apply shortnecked nigersaurus pointed eyes nigersaurus placed towards top skull sauropods muzzle would give overlapping fields view visual field would close degrees hypersensitivity movement would important vulnerable argentinian palaeontologist lucio ibiricu colleagues examined postcranial skeletal pneumaticity skeletons rebbachisaurids suggested adaptation lowering density skeleton could decreased muscle energy needed move body well heat generated process since several rebbachisaurids inhabited latitudes would tropical subtropical middle cretaceous pneumaticity may helped animals cope high temperatures according ibiricu colleagues adaptation may reason rebbachisaurids group diplodocoids survived late study french palaeontologist rémi lefebvre colleagues examined microanatomical structure limb bones nigersaurus ctscans first study sauropod virtual sections limb bones sampled individuals different sizes explored determine range variation heavyweight bearing animals often often features associated condition affecting inner structure limb bones variation bones poorly known heavy animals examined rhinoceroses thick variable bone cortices cortex nigersaurus rather thin researchers suggested microanatomy sauropods affected drastic selective pressure caused bearing weight features columnar limbs seen elephants pneumaticity fleshy foot pads cartilage relaxed pressure bones also suggested sauropods may therefore lighter weight expected size supporting lowest body mass estimates nigersaurus suggested sereno colleagues groundlevel nonselective browser width muzzle lateral orientation tooth row show sauropod could gather much food crop close ground within ft supported facets labial externally facing side upper teeth similar dicraeosaurus diplodocus evidence food substrate wore animals teeth fed nigersaurus also bears signs lowangle toothtotooth wear inside maxillary crowns suggests jaw movement limited precise upanddown motions worn teeth lower jaw yet discovered expected show opposing toothtotooth wear ability raise heads well ground necessarily mean browsed items short neck nigersaurus would restricted browsing range compared adductor muscle jaw appears attached quadrate instead supratemporal fenestra mastication muscles likely weak nigersaurus estimated one weakest bites addition according whitlock colleagues small nearly parallel nature tooth scratches pits caused grit would obtained often highbrowsers indicate ate relatively soft herbaceous plants lowgrowing lateral orientation teeth probably

browsing unlike way sauropods restored heads held study british palaeontologist mike p taylor colleagues agreed nigersaurus able feed downturned head neck posture proposed study contested habitual posture animal study noted neutral head neck posture modern animals necessarily correspond habitual head posture argued orientation semicircular canals varies significantly within modern species therefore reliable determining head supported spanish palaeontologist jesús marugánlobón colleagues study suggested methods used serenos team imprecise nigersaurus habitually held head like french palaeontologist julien benoit colleagues tested lateral semicircular canal correlation head posture modern mammals found significant correlation reconstructed actual head postures plane semicircular canal held horizontally resting pose inferred authors therefore cautioned using semicircular canals proxy infer precise orientation skulls found diet correlated strongly semicircular canal orientation
