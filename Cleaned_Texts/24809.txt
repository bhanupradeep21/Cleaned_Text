understood area plant plant viruses genomes consist single stranded rna ssrna plant viruses ssrna meaning sense orientation messenger rna ssrna meaning must converted ssrna translated double stranded rna immediately translated ssrna viruses require reverse transcriptase enzyme convert rna dna plant viruses ssdna dsdna contrast quarter animal viruses dsdna threequarters bacteriophage viruses use plant ribosomes produce proteins encoded genome however since many proteins encoded single strand polycistronic mean ribosome either produce one protein terminate translation first stop codon polyprotein produced plant viruses evolve special techniques allow production viral proteins plant cells translation occur eukaryotic mrnas require cap structure means viruses must also one normally

cleaved virally encoded endonuclease resulting capped leader rna used prime transcription viral however plant viruses use cap yet translate efficiently due capindependent translation enhancers present untranslated regions viral viruses eg tobacco mosaic virus tmv rna sequences contain leaky stop codon tmv time host ribosome terminate synthesis polypeptide codon rest time continues past means proteins produced larger different others normally produced form translational regulation tmv extra sequence polypeptide rna polymerase replicates genome viruses use production subgenomic rnas ensure
