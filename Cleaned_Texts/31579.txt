muscles pull thighbones backwards however suggested robert thomas bakker stegosaurians could rear hind legs reach higher layers plants tail used third leg mobility tail increased reduction absence ossified tendons many ornithischia stiffen hip region huayangosaurus still possessed species short forelimbs relatively short torso towards front curved strongly downwards dorsal vertebrae typically high tall neural arches transverse processes pointing obliquely upwards almost level neural spine top stegosaurian back vertebrae easily identified unique configuration tall neural arches often house deep neural canals enlarged canals sacral vertebrae given rise incorrect notion second brain despite downwards curvature rump neck base low head held considerable distance ground neck flexible

scapula ossified sternal plates never found stegosauria perhaps sternum completely absent stegosaurian pelvis originally moderately large shown huayangosaurus later species however convergent ankylosauria developed broad pelves iliac bones formed wide horizontal plates flaring front blades allow enormous bellygut ilia attached sacral vertebrae via sacral yoke formed fused sacral ribs huayangosaurus still rather long obliquely oriented ischia pubic bones derived species became horizontal shorter rear front prepubic process lengthened like thyreophora stegosaurians protected bony scutes part skeleton proper skin ossifications instead socalled osteoderms huayangosaurus several types neck back tail two rows paired small vertical plates spikes tail end bore small club flank row
