xenobiology xb subfield synthetic biology study synthesizing manipulating biological devices name xenobiology derives greek word xenos means stranger alien xenobiology form biology yet familiar science found practice describes novel biological systems biochemistries differ canonical amino acid system see central dogma molecular biology example instead dna rna xb explores nucleic acid analogues termed xeno nucleic acid xna information also focuses expanded genetic incorporation nonproteinogenic amino acids xeno amino acids astro means star exo means outside exo astrobiology deal search naturally evolved life universe mostly planets circumstellar habitable zone also occasionally referred whereas astrobiologists concerned detection analysis life elsewhere universe xenobiology attempts design forms life different biochemistry different genetic code planet xenobiology aim design construct biological systems differ natural counterparts one fundamental levels ideally newtonature organisms would different every possible biochemical aspect exhibiting different genetic longterm goal construct cell would store genetic information dna alternative informational polymer consisting xeno nucleic acids xna different base pairs using noncanonical amino acids altered genetic code far cells constructed incorporate one two features originally research alternative forms dna driven question life evolved earth rna dna selected chemical evolution possible nucleic acid two hypotheses selection rna dna lifes backbone either favored life earths conditions coincidentally present prelife chemistry continue used systematic experimental studies aiming diversification chemical structure nucleic acids resulted completely novel informational biopolymers far number xnas new chemical backbones leaving group dna eg hexose nucleic acid hna threose nucleic acid glycol nucleic acid gna cyclohexenyl nucleic acid incorporation xna plasmid involving hna codons accomplished already xna used vivo e coli template dna synthesis study using binary gt genetic cassette two nondna bases hxu extended cena gna seems alien moment natural biological system used template dna extended bases using natural dna backbone could likewise transliterated natural dna although limited aside used extensions template dna strands xna activity tested use genetic catalysts although proteins common components cellular enzymatic activity nucleic acids also used cell catalyze reactions study found several different kinds xna notably fana nucleic acids well hna cena ana arabino nucleic acids could used cleave rna posttranscriptional rna processing acting xna enzymes hence name xnazymes fana xnazymes also showed ability ligate dna rna xna although xnazyme studies still preliminary study step direction searching synthetic circuit components efficient containing dna rna counterparts regulate dna rna xna substrates xnas modified backbones experiments target replacement

oligonucleotide containing third type base pinheiro et al demonstrated method polymerase evolution design successfully led storage recovery genetic information less length six alternative genetic polymers based simple nucleic acid architectures found nature xeno nucleic one goals xenobiology rewrite genetic code promising approach change code reassignment seldom used even unused ideal scenario genetic code expanded one codon thus liberated old function fully reassigned noncanonical amino acid ncaa code expansion methods laborious implement short cuts applied code engineering example bacteria auxotrophic specific amino acids point experiment fed isostructural analogues instead canonical amino acids auxotrophic situation canonical amino acid residues native proteins substituted ncaas even insertion multiple different ncaas protein finally repertoire canonical amino acids expanded also reduced reassigning transfer rna trnaaminoacyltrna synthetase pairs codon specificity changed cells endowed aminoacyltrna synthetases thus able read mrna sequences make sense existing gene expression altering codon trna synthetases pairs may lead vivo incorporation noncanonical amino acids past reassigning codons mainly done limited scale however farren isaacs george church harvard university reported replacement tag stop codons present genome e coli synonymous taa codons thereby demonstrating massive substitutions combined higherorder strains without lethal following success genome wide codon replacement authors continued achieved reprogramming codons throughout genome directly affecting essential even radical change genetic code change triplet codon quadruplet even quintuplet codon pioneered sisido cellfree schultz finally nonnatural base pairs used introduce novel amino acid goal substituting dna xna may also reached another route namely engineering environment instead genetic modules approach successfully demonstrated marli√®re mutzel production e coli strain whose dna composed standard c g nucleotides synthetic thymine analogue instead thymine corresponding positions sequence cells dependent externally supplied growth otherwise look behave normal e coli cells however currently yet fully auxotrophic xenobase since still growing thymine supplied xenobiological systems designed convey orthogonality natural biological systems still hypothetical organism uses different base pairs polymerases altered genetic code hardly able interact natural forms life genetic level thus xenobiological organisms represent genetic enclave exchange information natural altering genetic machinery cell leads semantic containment analogy information processing safety concept termed genetic firewall concept genetic firewall seems overcome number limitations previous safety first experimental evidence theoretical concept genetic firewall achieved construction genomically recoded organism gro gro known uag stop codons ecoli replaced uaa codons allowed deletion release factor reassignment uag translation function gro exhibited increased resistance bacteriophage thus showing alternative genetic codes reduce genetic gro however still similar natural parent regarded genetic firewall possibility reassigning function large number triplets opens perspective strains combine xna novel base pairs new genetic codes etc exchange information natural biological world regardless changes leading semantic containment mechanism new organisms novel biochemical systems still undergo toxicological screening xna novel proteins etc might represent novel toxins allergic potential needs xenobiology might challenge regulatory framework currently laws directives deal genetically modified organisms directly mention chemically genomically modified organisms
