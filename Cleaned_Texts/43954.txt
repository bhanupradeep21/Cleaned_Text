canada national institute nanotechnology located university alberta campus wisharts research interests span number diverse areas including structural biology computational biology bioinformatics nanobiology metabolomics nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy mass spectrometry common theme research career development techniques technology cores protocols data resources computer programs make science simpler faster cheaper easier work led number important discoveries fundamentally transformed fields biomolecular nmr metabolomics computational wishart began research career field protein nmr early focusing using nmr spectroscopy characterize protein structure protein denaturation time protein structural analysis nmr required hundreds hours manual data analysis data tabulation effort accelerate process wishart discovered interesting trend regard nmr chemical shifts amino acid residues changed systematically regard secondary structure proceeded develop technique called chemical shift index also known csi used set simple rules simple chemical shift tables allowed scientists directly use protein chemical shift assignments rapidly determine type location protein secondary structures proteins subsequently wishart showed nmr chemical shifts could used easily rapidly measure protein flexibility via random coil index later showed possible use chemical shifts determine protein backbone torsion angles program called wishart also determined chemical shifts could used measure residue accessible surface identify super secondary structure extend work wishart developed innovative methods determine structure proteins using technique called chemical shift threading programs genmr help compare assess existing protein nmr structures wishart also developed methods accurately predict protein chemical shifts coordinates using programs shiftx time also developed methods rereference incorrectly assigned protein chemical shifts using programs shiftcor programs used help create protein nmr databases refdb contain rereferenced chemical wisharts papers describing nmr methods cited times consideredby foundational techniques much modern protein nmr early wishart turned attention looking big molecules proteins looking small molecules metabolites developed patented nmrbased techniques leading spinoff company permitted rapid identification quantification metabolites nmr conceived human metabolome project hmp metabolomic equivalent human genome project wishart succeeded raising million funding genome canada launched multiinstitutional pancanadian program systematically identify metabolites drugs xenobiotics clinically important human biofluids goal hmp provide scientific community easily accessible reference data human metabolites thereby making metabolomic data analysis comprehensive much simpler hmp still ongoing led identification human metabolites drugs drug metabolites food constituents toxins information along many tools facilitate metabolite identification interpretation archived several publicly available databases created wishart lab include human metabolome database hmdb contains data human metabolites structures
