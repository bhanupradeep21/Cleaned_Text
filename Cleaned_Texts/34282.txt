rift valley fever rvf viral disease humans livestock cause mild severe symptoms mild symptoms may include fever muscle pains headaches often last week severe symptoms may include loss sight beginning three weeks infection infections brain causing severe headaches confusion bleeding together liver problems may occur within first days bleeding chance death high disease caused rvf virus spread either touching infected animal blood breathing air around infected animal butchered drinking raw milk infected animal bite infected mosquitoes animals cows sheep goats camels may affected animals spread mostly appear one person infect another person disease diagnosed finding antibodies virus virus prevention disease humans accomplished vaccinating animals disease must done outbreak occurs done outbreak may worsen situation stopping movement animals outbreak may also useful may decreasing mosquito numbers avoiding bites human vaccine however widely available specific treatment medical efforts outbreaks disease occurred africa arabia outbreaks usually occur periods increased rain increase number disease first reported among livestock rift valley kenya early virus first isolated humans virus cause several syndromes usually either symptoms mild illness fever headache muscle pains liver abnormalities small percentage cases illness progress hemorrhagic fever syndrome meningoencephalitis inflammation brain tissues lining brain affect eye patients become ill usually experience fever generalised weakness back pain dizziness weight loss onset illness typically people recover within two seven days onset people disease die livestock fatality level significantly higher pregnant livestock infected rvf abort virtually foetuses epizootic animal disease epidemic rvf
