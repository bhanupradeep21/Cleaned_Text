rodenticides chemicals made sold purpose killing rodents commonly referred rat poison rodenticides also used kill mice squirrels woodchucks chipmunks porcupines nutria despite crucial roles rodents play nature times need rodenticides lethal one exposure others require one rodents disinclined gorge unknown food perhaps reflecting adaptation inability preferring sample wait observe whether makes rats phenomenon poison shyness rationale poisons kill multiple doses besides directly toxic mammals ingest including dogs cats humans many rodenticides present secondary poisoning risk animals hunt scavenge dead corpses anticoagulants defined chronic death occurs one two weeks ingestion lethal dose rarely sooner singledose second generation multipledose first generation rodenticides acting effective blocking vitamink cycle resulting inability produce essential bloodclotting coagulation factors ii prothrombin vii addition specific metabolic disruption massive toxic doses anticoagulants cause damage tiny blood vessels capillaries increasing permeability causing internal bleeding effects gradual developing several days final phase intoxication exhausted rodent collapses due hemorrhagic shock severe anemia dies question whether use rodenticides considered humane main benefit anticoagulants poisons time taken poison induce death means rats associate damage feeding habits harder group generation according sources indandiones considered second however according us environmental protection agency examples first generation agents include chlorophacinone vitamin suggested successfully used antidote pets humans accidentally intentionally exposed anticoagulant poisons poisons act inhibiting liver functions advanced stages poisoning several bloodclotting factors absent volume circulating blood diminished blood transfusion optionally clotting factors present save person poisoned advantage older poisons unique enzyme produced liver enables body recycle vitamin k produce blood clotting factors prevent excessive bleeding body needs vitamin k anticoagulants hinder enzymes ability function internal bleeding could start bodys reserve anticoagulant runs exposure enough bind closely enzyme produces blood clotting agents singledose anticoagulants hazardous may also obstruct several stages recycling vitamin k singledose secondgeneration anticoagulants stored liver quickly eliminated metal phosphides used means killing rodents considered singledose fast acting rodenticides death occurs commonly within days single bait ingestion bait consisting food phosphide usually zinc phosphide left rodents eat acid digestive system rodent reacts phosphide generate toxic phosphine gas method vermin control possible use places rodents resistant anticoagulants particularly control house field mice zinc phosphide baits also cheaper secondgeneration anticoagulants sometimes case large infestation rodents population initially reduced copious amounts zinc phosphide bait applied rest population survived initial fastacting poison eradicated prolonged feeding anticoagulant bait inversely individual rodents survived anticoagulant bait poisoning rest population eradicated prebaiting nontoxic bait week two important overcome bait shyness get rodents used feeding specific areas specific food especially eradicating rats subsequently applying poisoned bait sort used prebaiting consumption bait ceases usually within days methods alternating rodenticides different modes action gives actual almost eradications rodent population area acceptancepalatability baits good ie rodents feed readily zinc phosphide typically added rodent baits concentration baits strong pungent garliclike odor due phosphine liberated hydrolysis odor attracts least repel rodents repulsive effect mammals birds notably wild turkeys sensitive smell might feed bait thus fall victim poisoncitation needed tablets pellets usually aluminium calcium magnesium phosphide fumigationgassing may also contain chemicals evolve ammonia helps reduce potential spontaneous combustion explosion phosphine gascitation needed metal phosphides accumulate tissues poisoned animals risk secondary poisoning low advent anticoagulants phosphides favored kind rat poison world war ii came use united states shortage strychnine due japanese occupation territories strychnine tree grown phosphides rather fastacting rat poisons resulting rats dying usually open areas instead affected buildings phosphides used rodenticides include cholecalciferol vitamin ergocalciferol vitamin used rodenticides toxic rodents reason important humans affect calcium phosphate homeostasis body vitamins essential minute quantities ius per kilogram body weight daily fraction milligram like fat soluble vitamins toxic larger doses causing hypervitaminosis poisoning severe enough dose toxin high enough leads death rodents consume rodenticidal bait causes hypercalcemia raising calcium level mainly increasing calcium absorption food mobilising bonematrixfixed calcium ionised form mainly monohydrogencarbonate calcium cation partially bound plasma proteins circulates dissolved blood plasma ingestion lethal dose free calcium levels raised sufficiently blood vessels kidneys stomach wall lungs mineralisedcalcificated formation calcificates crystals calcium saltscomplexes tissues damaging leading heart problems myocardial tissue sensitive variations free calcium levels affecting myocardial contractibility action potential propagation atria ventricles bleeding due capillary damage possibly kidney failure considered singledose cumulative depending concentration used common bait concentration lethal rodents single intake larger portions bait subchronic death occurring usually within days one week ingestion bait applied concentrations cholecalciferol ergocalciferol iug used alone kill rodent rat important feature calciferols toxicology synergistic anticoagulant toxicant words mixtures anticoagulants calciferols bait toxic sum toxicities anticoagulant calciferol bait massive hypercalcemic effect achieved substantially lower calciferol content bait vice versa pronounced anticoagulanthemorrhagic effects observed calciferol present synergism mostly used calciferol low concentration baits effective concentrations calciferols expensive effective concentrations first application calciferol rodenticidal bait sorex product sorexa different formula todays sorexa back early contained warfarin ergocalciferol today sorexa cd contains difenacoum cholecalciferol combination numerous brand products containing either calciferols eg quintox alone alongside anticoagulant merck veterinary manual states following although rodenticide cholecalciferol introduced claims less toxic nontarget species rodents clinical experience shown rodenticides containing cholecalciferol significant health threat dogs cats cholecalciferol produces hypercalcemia results systemic calcification soft tissue leading kidney failure cardiac abnormalities hypertension cns depression gi upset signs generally develop within hours ingestion include depression anorexia polyuria polydipsia serum calcium concentrations increase clinical signs become severe gi smooth muscle excitability decreases manifest anorexia vomiting constipation loss renal concentrating ability direct result hypercalcemia hypercalcemia persists mineralization kidneys results progressive renal additional anticoagulant renders bait toxic pets well humans upon single ingestion solely calciferolbased baits considered generally safer birds second generation anticoagulants acute toxicants treatment pets mostly supportive intravenous fluids
