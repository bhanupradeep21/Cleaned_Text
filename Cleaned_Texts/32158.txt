developing diabetic retinopathy year united states diabetic retinopathy accounts new cases blindness also leading cause blindness people aged nearly people diabetes develop degree retina damage retinopathy several decades disease many damage detected retinal exam noticeable effect time progressive retinal damage may appear retinal exam first small bulges retinal blood vessels called microaneurysms larger abnormalities retinal vessels cotton wool spots hemorrhages lipid deposits called hard exudates intraretinal microvascular abnormalities abnormallooking retinal eventually many progress stage new blood vessels grow throughout retina new blood vessels often break bleed minor bleeding cause dark floating spots obstructing vision major bleeding completely block around half people diabetic retinopathy develop swelling macula called macular edema begin swelling occurs near center macula cause vision disruptions ranging mildly blurred vision severe loss center affected persons visual left untreated around swelling experience vision disruption next macular edema common cause vision loss people diabetic repeated processes blood vessel growth swelling scarring eventually cause retinal detachment manifests sudden appearance dark floating spots flashes light blurred diabetic retinopathy typically diagnosed retinal exam observations using american academy ophthalmology divides diabetic retinopathy five categories progressive severity first category apparent retinopathy describes healthy retinal next three categories mild moderate severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy npdr describe increasing levels damage retina people mild npdr microaneurysms retina damage severe npdr retinal hemorrhages quadrant retina distinctive pattern

children rarely experience sightthreatening retinopathy however puberty accelerate retinopathy pregnancy also accelerate progression diabetic retinopathy although women gestational diabetes chronically high blood sugar measured high highly variable blood sugar associated developing diabetic several minor risk factors also exacerbate diabetic retinopathy namely kidney disease abnormal blood lipids high body mass index genetic predisposition diabetic retinopathy type diabetes consists many genetic variants across genome collectively associated diabetic retinopathy polygenic risk

panretinal laser photocoagulation current treatment regimens prevent severe vision although treatments successful slowing stopping vision loss cure diabetic retinopathy caution exercised treatment laser surgery since causes loss retinal tissue often prudent inject triamcinolone antivegf drugs patients results marked increase vision especially edema addition standard treatment diabetic retinopathy includes improving control blood sugar blood pressure blood cholesterol reduce diabetic retinopathy mild moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy american academy ophthalmology recommends frequent retinal six twelve people increased risk developing proliferative retinopathy macular injection antivegf drugs steroids reduce diabetic retinopathy progression around half eyes treated however whether results improved vision long term yet highest risk vision loss edema near center macula benefit eye injections antivegf therapies aflibercept bevacizumab widely accepted dosing schedule though people typically receive frequent injections first year treatment less frequent injections subsequent years sufficient maintain whose eyes dont improve antivegf therapy may instead receive laser photocoagulation typically form short laser macular edema vision loss benefit treatment american academy opthalmology recommends deferring treatment visual acuity falls least laser photocoagulation used two scenarios treatment diabetic retinopathy firstly treat macular secondly treating whole retina panretinal photocoagulation controlling neovascularization widely used early stages proliferative retinopathy different types lasers evidence available benefits treat proliferative diabetic proliferative severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy vision loss prevented treatment panretinal laser goal create burns retina hope reducing retinas oxygen demand hence possibility ischemia done multiple sittings treating advanced diabetic retinopathy burns used destroy abnormal new blood vessels form retina shown reduce risk severe vision loss eyes risk using laser ophthalmologist dilates pupil applies anaesthetic drops numb eye cases doctor also may numb area behind eye reduce discomfort patient sits facing laser machine doctor holds special lens eye physician use single spot laser pattern scan laser two dimensional patterns squares rings arcs navigated

still dilated vision likely remain blurry rest day though much pain eye icecream headache like pain may last hours afterwards patients lose peripheral vision surgery although may barely noticeable patient procedure however save center patients sight laser surgery may also slightly reduce colour night vision person proliferative retinopathy always risk new bleeding well glaucoma complication new blood vessels means multiple treatments may required protect vision triamcinolone long acting steroid preparation treating people dme intravitreal injections triamcinolone may lead degree improvement visual acuity compared eyes treated placebo injected vitreous cavity steroid decreases macular edema thickening retina macula caused due diabetic maculopathy may result increase visual acuity effect triamcinolone permnanent may last three months necessitates repeated injections maintaining beneficial effect best results intravitreal triamcinolone found eyes already undergone cataract surgery complications intravitreal injection triamcinolone may include cataract steroidinduced glaucoma aflibercept may advantages improving visual outcomes bevacizumab ranibizumab one cases vitreous hemorrhage however antivegf injections proved less effective restoring visual acuity vitrectomy combined panretinal instead laser surgery people require vitrectomy restore vision vitrectomy performed lot blood vitreous involves removing cloudy vitreous replacing saline solution studies show people vitrectomy soon large hemorrhage likely protect vision someone waits operation early vitrectomy especially effective people insulindependent diabetes may greater risk blindness hemorrhage eye vitrectomy may done general local anesthesia doctor makes tiny incision sclera white eye next small
