teeth found association fossils ornithopod dinosaur tenontosaurus quite common cloverly formation two quarries discovered preserve fairly complete deinonychus fossils near tenontosaurus fossils first yale quarry cloverly montana includes numerous teeth four adult deinonychus one juvenile deinonychus association number deinonychus skeletons single quarry suggests deinonychus may fed animal perhaps hunted ostrom maxwell even used information speculate deinonychus might lived hunted second quarry antlers formation oklahoma site contains six partial skeletons tenontosaurus various sizes along one partial skeleton many teeth deinonychus one tenontosaur humerus even bears might deinonychus tooth marks brinkman et al point deinonychus adult mass kg lb whereas adult tenontosaurs metric tons solitary deinonychus could kill adult tenontosaur suggesting pack hunting study roach brinkman called question cooperative pack hunting behavior deinonychus based known modern carnivore hunting taphonomy tenontosaur sites modern archosaurs birds crocodiles komodo dragons typically display little cooperative hunting instead usually either solitary hunters drawn previously killed carcasses much conflict occurs individuals species example situations groups komodo dragons eating together largest individuals eat first attack smaller komodos attempt feed smaller animal killed cannibalized information applied tenontosaur sites appears found consistent deinonychus komodo crocodilelike feeding strategy deinonychus skeletal remains found sites subadults missing parts consistent eaten hand paper li et al describes track sites similar foot spacing parallel trackways implying gregarious packing behavior instead uncoordinated feeding contrary claim crocodilians hunt cooperatively actually observed hunt meaning notion infighting competition food cannibalism ruling cooperative feeding may actually false dichotomy manning colleagues interpreted dromaeosaur claw tips functioning puncture

model known raptor prey restraint rpr model predation proposes deinonychus killed prey manner similar extant accipitrid birds prey leaping onto quarry pinning body weight gripping tightly large sickleshaped claws like accipitrids dromaeosaur would begin feed animal still alive eventually died blood loss organ failure proposal based primarily comparisons morphology proportions feet legs dromaeosaurs several groups extant birds prey known predatory behaviors fowler found feet legs dromaeosaurs closely resemble eagles hawks especially terms enlarged second claw similar range grasping motion however short metatarsus foot strength would similar owls rpr method predation would consistent aspects deinonychuss anatomy unusual jaw arm morphology arms likely covered long feathers may used flapping stabilizers balance atop struggling prey along stiff counterbalancing tail jaws thought comparatively weak bite might used saw motion bites like modern komodo dragon also weak bite force finish prey kicks powerful bite force estimates deinonychus first produced based reconstructed jaw musculature study concluded deinonychus likely maximum bite force modern american study paul gignac colleagues attempted estimate bite force based directly newly discovered deinonychus tooth puncture marks bones tenontosaurus puncture marks came large individual provided first evidence large deinonychus could bite bone using tooth marks gignacs team able determine bite force deinonychus significantly higher earlier studies estimated biomechanical studies alone found bite force deinonychus newtons greater living carnivorous mammals including hyena equivalent similarlysized however estimate come question based bite marks rather deinonychus skull recent study used deinonychus skull estimate calculated gignac colleagues also noted however bone puncture marks deinonychus relatively rare unlike larger theropods many known puncture marks like tyrannosaurus deinonychus probably frequently bite eat bone instead probably used strong bite force defense capture prey rather despite distinctive feature deinonychus shape curvature sickle claw varies specimens type specimen described ostrom strongly curved sickle claw newer specimen described claw much weaker curvature similar profile normal claws remaining ostrom suggested difference size shape sickle claws could due individual sexual agerelated variation admitted could sure evidence talon held ground dinosaur walked third fourth toes ostrom suggested deinonychus could kick sickle claw cut slash researchers even suggested talon used disembowel large ceratopsian studies suggested sickle claws used slash rather deliver small stabs manning colleagues ran tests robotic replica precisely matched anatomy deinonychus velociraptor used hydraulic rams make robot strike pig carcass tests talons made shallow punctures could cut slash authors suggested talons would effective climbing dealing killing manning colleagues undertook additional analysis dromaeosaur claw function using numerical modelling approach generate finite element stress strain map velociraptor hand went quantitatively evaluate mechanical behavior dromaeosaur claws function state dromaeosaur claws welladapted climbing resistant forces acting single longitudinal plane due gravity ostrom compared deinonychus ostrich cassowary noted bird species inflict serious injury large claw second cassowary claws mm ostrom cited gilliard saying sever arm disembowel kofron studied documented cassowary attacks found one human two dogs killed evidence cassowaries disembowel dismember cassowaries use claws defend attack threatening animals agonistic displays bowed threat seriema also enlarged second toe claw uses tear apart small prey items study suggested sickle claw would likely used pin prey biting rather slashing biomechanical studies ken carpenter confirmed likely function forelimbs predation grasping great lengths would permitted longer reach theropods rather large elongated coracoid indicating powerful muscles forelimbs strengthened carpenters biomechanical studies using bone casts also showed deinonychus could fold arms body like bird avian folding contrary inferred earlier descriptions jacques gregory paul studies phil senter indicated deinonychus forelimbs could used grasping also clutching objects towards chest deinonychus feathered fingers wings feathers would limited range motion forelimbs degree example deinonychus extended arm forward palm hand automatically rotated upwardfacing position would caused one wing block forelimbs extended time leading senter conclude clutching objects chest would accomplished one arm time function fingers would also limited feathers example third digit hand could employed activities probing crevices small prey items position perpendicular main alan gishlick study deinonychus forelimb mechanics found even large wing feathers present grasping ability hand would significantly hindered rather grasping would accomplished perpendicular wing objects likely would held hands simultaneously bear hug fashion findings supported later forelimb studies carpenter

juvenile subadult specimens deinonychus display morphological differences adults instance arms younger specimens proportionally longer adults possible indication difference behavior young another example could function pedal claws parsons parsons suggested claw curvature ostrom already shown different maybe greater juvenile deinonychus could help climb trees claws became straighter animal became older started live solely based hypothesis small dromaeosaurids used pedal claws paper reported analysis immature fossils open mobile nature shoulder joint might meant young deinonychus capable form dromaeosaurids especially deinonychus often depicted unusually fastrunning animals popular media ostrom speculated deinonychus fleetfooted original however first described complete leg deinonychus found ostroms speculation length femur upper leg bone later proved overestimate later study ostrom noted ratio femur tibia lower leg bone important determining speed relative length foot lower leg modern fleetfooted birds like ostrich foottibia ratio unusually fastrunning dinosaurs like struthiomimus ratio deinonychus ratio ostrom stated reasonable conclusion deinonychus far slowmoving particularly fast compared dinosaurs certainly fast modern flightless low foot lower leg ratio deinonychus due partly unusually short metatarsus upper foot bones ratio actually larger smaller individuals larger ones ostrom suggested short metatarsus may related function sickle claw used fact appears get shorter individuals aged support interpreted short second toe enlarged claw short metatarsus support use hind leg offensive weapon sickle claw would strike downwards backwards leg pulled back time slashing tearing prey ostrom suggested short metatarsus reduced overall stress leg bones attack interpreted unusual arrangement muscle attachments deinonychus leg support idea different set muscles used predatory stroke walking running therefore ostrom concluded legs deinonychus represented balance running adaptations needed agile predator stressreducing features compensate unique foot study canadian dinosaur footprints richard kool produced rough walking speed estimates
