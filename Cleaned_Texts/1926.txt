shoulder replacement surgical procedure part glenohumeral joint replaced prosthetic implant joint replacement surgery generally conducted relieve arthritis pain fix severe physical joint shoulder replacement surgery option treatment severe arthritis shoulder joint arthritis condition affects cartilage joints cartilage lining wears away protective lining bones lost happens painful boneonbone arthritis develops severe shoulder arthritis quite painful cause restriction motion may tolerated medications lifestyle adjustments may come time surgical treatment necessary shoulder replacements last longer years global study found patients expect large longlasting improvements pain strength range movement ability complete everyday major approaches access shoulder joint first deltopectoral approach saves deltoid requires subscapularis second transdeltoid approach provides straight approach glenoid however approach deltoid put risk potential shoulder replacement also known shoulder arthroplasty glenohumeral arthroplasty pioneered french surgeon jules emile p√©an procedure consisted physically smoothing shoulder joint implanting platinum rubber materials next notable case evolution shoulder replacement procedures charles neer conducted first hemiarthroplasty essentially replacing humeral head leaving natural shoulder socket glenoid procedure grew exponentially popularity time progressed however patients often developed cartilage loss glenoid surface well leading pain glenoid erosion prompted development procedure replace humeral component glenoid component throughout development procedures became well accepted rotator cuff muscles essential producing best outcomes terms strength range motion decrease pain addition finding physical constraints normal ballandsocket anatomy shoulder limited developments one way another example heavily constrained system limited range motion inherent anatomy glenoid proved difficult cement prosthetics fixate components without fracturing challenges high rates failure led development reverse total shoulder arthroplasty overcome limitations imposed natural shoulder anatomycitation needed saw exponential increase surgical approaches using methodology number variation surgical techniques many however paul grammont emerged superior technique basis reverse shoulder replacement procedures however note reverse shoulder replacement primarily indicated cases patient weak torn rotator cuff muscles others conventional shoulder replacement may indicated although grammont continued develop refine new technique address minor complications arose relied basic concepts included inherent stability shape implant well placement implant relative natural glenohumeral progression shoulder replacement usually begins development pain movement shoulder stiffness conservatively managed activity modification physical therapy nonsteroidal antiinflammatory nsaid additionally intraarticular corticosteroid injections injection joint space another popular conservative nonsurgical conservative treatment options fail pain affecting quality life shoulder replacement likely indicated various studies shoulder replacements confirmed indication noting specifically severe glenohumeral arthritis reverse total shoulder arthroplasty rtsa developed treatment rotator cuff tear arthropathy elderly demonstrated excellent clinical outcomes thus become wellestablished treatment choice cuff tear arthropathy national joint registries reported survivorship diagnosis rotator cuff arthropathy increasing surgeon experience reverse prosthesis seen decrease complications change indications surgery early expanded indication primary osteoarthritis loss rotator cuff function massive irreparable rotator cuff tear without osteoarthritis also accepted indication number years given numerous studies reported good functional outcomes last years indications rtsa seen huge expansion include posterior glenoid deficiency intact cuff fracture tumour revision traditional total shoulder arthroplasty approach begins separating deltoid muscle pectoral muscles facilitating access shoulder glenohumeral joint relatively nerve free passageway shoulder joint initially covered rotator cuff muscles subscapularis supraspinatus infraspinatus teres minor joint capsule glenohumeral ligaments typically single rotator cuff muscle identified cut allow direct access shoulder joint point surgeon remove arthritic portions joint secure ball socket prostheses within development safer effective techniques led increased use reverse total shoulder reverse total shoulder arthroplasties typically indicated rotator cuff muscles severely major approaches reverse total shoulder arthroplasties first deltopectoral approach approach described traditional total shoulder arthroplasty approach saves deltoid requires supraspinatus second transdeltoid approach provides straight approach glenoid however approach deltoid put risk potential techniques used depending surgeons preferences latest systematic reviews suggests low quality evidence total shoulder arthroplasty provide important benefits hemiarthroplasty glenohumeral osteoarthritis rotator cuff highlighted current lack highquality evidence need randomized controlled trialscitation needed various materials used make prostheses however majority consist metal ball rotates within polyethylene plastic socket metal ball takes place patients humeral head anchored via stem inserted shaft humerus plastic socket placed patients glenoid typically secured surrounding bone via recent advances technology led development short stem stemless well cementless humeral replacement components used operating glenoid implant technology also seen led reduction rocking horse effect glenoid implant addition increasing popularity reverse total shoulder arthroplasty led availability new prostheses non surgery options preferred treatment variety reasons besides wanting risk usual risks surgery infection shoulder replacement lead variety complications including rotator cuff tear glenohumeral instability however despite risks shoulder replacement shows promise low rate complication depending type surgery close regional general anesthesia two methods utilized performing shoulder replacement one example commonly used regional anesthetic interscalene brachial plexus block used number shoulder procedures including instability repairs proximal humeral prosthetic replacements total shoulder arthroplasties anterior acromioplasties rotator cuff repairs operative treatment humeral benefits utilizing regional anesthesia general anesthesia include less intraoperative bleeding muscle relaxation shorter recovery room hospital stays decreased use opioids avoiding side effects general addition regional anesthesia may costeffective reduces operating room turnover time procedure time due patients waking sooner surgerycitation needed success rate placing interscalene brachial plexus block ranges according case major complications seizures cardiac arrests horners syndrome hoarseness inadvertent spinalepidural anesthesia could occur therefore patients carefully monitored insertion block end currently data combined usage general anesthesia interscalene blocks limited indications combined anesthesia include difficult airway management longer surgical mixture short longacting local anesthetics used prolong duration well reduce onset nerve block lidocaine appropriate shortacting local anesthetic drugs levobupivacaine ropivacaine appropriate longacting local amount drugs needed patient shoulder replacement range ml calculated based patients characteristics well specific anesthetic technique shoulder replacement cause severe severe pain especially shoulder mobilization therefore postoperative pain management extremely important recovery joint tissues well innervated nociceptive input therefore surgical procedure joint region would produce continuous deep somatic pain well muscle following anesthetics methods commonly used assist postoperative shoulder replacement pain management three types single shot interscalenic analgesia preferably used minor arthroscopic surgery short duration overall still useful alternative continuous interscalenic analgesia interscalenic analgesia suited continuous infusion approach shoulder replacement causes severe postoperative pain anatomic proximity interscalenic catheter shoulder joint provides quick interscalenic catheter used three five days depending type surgerycitation needed since suprascapular nerve provides sensory information joint capsule blocking nerve help postoperative shoulder pain nerve stimulator ultrasound device needle insertion cm midpoint scapular spine quickly block suprascapular furthermore blocking axillary nerve together suprascapular nerve anesthetize shoulder joint benefit suprascapular nerve block avoids blocking motor function parts upper limb innervated inferior roots brachial plexus thus prevents phrenic nerve disadvantages suprascapular nerve block include using two separate needlings blocking nerves shoulder joint short duration action side effects procedure include pneumothorax intravascular injection nerve although technique provides pain control compared placebo technique still inferior interscalene blockcitation needed httpsenwikipediaorgwikishoulderreplacement
