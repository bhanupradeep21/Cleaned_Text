psychology reasoning also known cognitive science study people reason often broadly defined process drawing conclusions inform people solve problems make overlaps psychology philosophy linguistics cognitive science artificial intelligence logic probability theory psychological experiments humans animals reason carried years enduring question whether people capacity rational current research area addresses various questions reasoning rationality judgments intelligence relationships emotion reasoning development one obvious areas people employ reasoning sentences everyday language experimentation deduction carried hypothetical thought particular examining people reason conditionals eg participants experiments make modus ponens inference given indicative conditional b given premise conclude b however given indicative conditional minor premise modus tollens inference notb half participants experiments conclude nota remainder concludes nothing ease people make conditional inferences affected context demonstrated wellknown selection task developed peter wason participants better able test conditional ecologically relevant context eg envelope sealed must cent stamp compared one contains symbolic content eg letter vowel number background knowledge also lead suppression even simple modus ponens inference participants given conditional lisa essay write studies late library premise lisa essay write make modus ponens inference studies late library inference suppressed also given second conditional library stays open studies late library interpretations suppression effect investigations propositional inference examine people think disjunctive alternatives eg else b reason negation eg case b many experiments carried examine people make relational inferences including comparisons eg better b investigations also concern spatial inferences eg front b temporal inferences eg occurs common tasks include categorical syllogisms used examine people reason quantifiers eg several alternative theories cognitive processes human reasoning based one view people rely mental logic consisting formal abstract syntactic inference rules similar developed logicians propositional another view people rely domainspecific contentsensitive rules third view people rely mental models mental representations correspond imagined fourth view people compute one controversial theoretical issue identification appropriate competence model standard compare human reasoning initially classical logic chosen competence subsequently researchers opted nonmonotonic bayesian research mental models reasoning led suggestion people rational principle err connectionist approaches towards reasoning also despite ongoing debate cognitive processes involved human reasoning recent research shown multiple approaches useful modeling human thinking instance studies found peoples reasoning often influenced prior beliefs modeled using bayesian probability additionally research mental models shown people tend reason problems constructing multiple mental representations situation help identify relevant features make inferences based understanding problem moreover connectionist approaches reasoning also gained attention focus neural network models learn data generalize new situations active question psychology ability reason develops infancy jean piagets theory cognitive posited general mechanisms stages development reasoning infancy adulthood according neopiagetian theories cognitive development changes reasoning development come increasing working memory capacity increasing speed processing enhanced executive functions control increasing selfawareness also important book enigma reason cognitive scientists hugo mercier dan sperber put forward argumentative theory reasoning claiming humans evolved reason primarily justify beliefs actions convince others social key evidence theory includes errors reasoning solitary individuals prone arguments criticized logical fallacies groups become much better performing cognitive reasoning tasks communicate one another evaluate others arguments sperber mercier offer one attempt resolve apparent paradox confirmation bias strong despite function reasoning naively appearing come veridical conclusions world study development reasoning abilities ongoing area research psychology multiple factors proposed explain reasoning develops infancy adulthood recent research suggested early experiences social interactions play critical role development reasoning example studies shown infants young six months old engage basic logical reasoning reasoning relationship objects properties furthermore research highlighted importance parental interaction cognitive stimulation development childrens reasoning abilities additionally studies suggested cultural factors educational practices emphasis critical thinking also influence development reasoning skills across different populations philip johnsonlaird trying taxonomize thought distinguished goaldirected thinking thinking without goal noting association involved unrelated reading argues goal directed reasoning classified based problem space involved solution citing allen newell herbert inductive reasoning makes broad generalizations specific cases observations process reasoning general assertions made based past specific pieces evidence kind reasoning allows conclusion false even original statement example one observes college athlete one makes predictions assumptions college athletes based one observation scientists use inductive reasoning create theories philip johnsonlaird distinguished inductive deductive reasoning former creates semantic information later opposition deductive reasoning basic form valid reasoning process person starts known claim general belief asks follows foundations premises influence words deduction starts hypothesis examines possibilities reach deduction helps people understand predictions wrong indicates prior knowledge beliefs track example deduction seen scientific method testing hypotheses theories although conclusion usually corresponds therefore proves hypothesis cases conclusion logical generalization example argument young girls wear skirts julie young girl therefore julie wears skirts valid logically sound first premise isnt true syllogism form deductive reasoning two statements reach logical conclusion reasoning one statement could every b another could c two statements could lead conclusion c b types syllogisms used test deductive reasoning ensure valid syllogistic reasoning task created study performed morsanyi kinga handley simon examined intuitive contributions reasoning used test assess syllogistic reasoning performance based interplay conscious effortful evaluation logicality intuitive appreciation believability another form reasoning called abductive reasoning type based creating testing hypotheses using best information available abductive reasoning produces kind daily decisionmaking works best information present often incomplete could involve making educated guesses observed unexplainable phenomena type reasoning seen world doctors make decisions diagnoses set results jurors use relevant evidence make decisions apart aforementioned types reasoning also analogical reasoning involves comparing reasoning two different situations concepts draw conclusions third used make predictions solve problems finding similarities two domains transferring knowledge one example problemsolving approach works one domain may applied new similar problem different domain analogical reasoning particularly useful scientific discovery problemsolving tasks help generate hypotheses create new theories develop innovative however also lead errors similarities domains superficial analogy based false assumptions judgment reasoning involve thinking options making judgment conclusion finally making decision making judgments involves heuristics efficient strategies usually lead one right common heuristics used attribute substitution availability heuristic representativeness heuristic anchoring heuristic aid quick reasoning work situations heuristics allow errors price paid gain errors judgment therefore affecting reasoning include errors judgment covariation relationship two variables presence magnitude one predict presence magnitude one cause covariation confirmation bias tendency responsive evidence confirms ones beliefs assessing covariation pulled track neglecting baserate information frequently something occurs however people often ignore base rates tend use information presented sophisticated judgment strategies result fewer errors people often reason based availability sometimes look accurate information make suggests two ways thinking known dualprocess first system fast automatic uses heuristics intuition second system ii slower effortful likely correct inferences people draw related factors linguistic pragmatics decision making often influenced emotion regret presence risk people presented options tend select one think regret decisions involve large amount risk people tend ask much dread would experience worstcase scenario occur eg nuclear accident use dread indicator level antonio damasio suggests somatic markers certain memories cause strong bodily reaction act way guide decision making well example person remembering scary movie becomes tense palms might begin sweat damasio argues making decision people rely gut feelings assess various options makes decide go decision positive stay away also argues orbitofrontal cortex located base frontal lobe eyes crucial use somatic markers part brain allows people interpret emotion emotion shapes decisions influence usually based predictions future people ask would react making inferences future researchers suggest affective forecasting ability predict ones emotions poor people tend overestimate much regret another factor influence decision making linguistic pragmatics refers use language social contexts language used convey different levels politeness power intention affect people interpret respond messages example boss asks employee complete task using commanding tone employee may feel pressured complete task quickly compared boss asked polite tone similarly someone uses sarcasm irony difficult listener discern true meaning leading misinterpretation potentially poor decision addition linguistic pragmatics cultural social factors also play role decision making different cultures may different norms values influence people approach decisions example collectivistic cultures decisions may made based best group whereas individualistic cultures decisions may prioritize individual needs desires overall decision making complex process involves many factors including emotion risk pragmatics cultural background understanding factors individuals make informed decisions better navigate complexities world around studying reasoning neuroscientifically involves determining neural correlates reasoning often investigated using eventrelated potentials functional magnetic resonance
