ventilationperfusion coupling relationship ventilation perfusion processes take place respiratory cardiovascular ventilation movement gas breathing perfusion process pulmonary blood circulation delivers oxygen body anatomically lung structure alveolar organization alveolar capillaries contribute physiological mechanism ventilation ventilationperfusion coupling maintains constant ratio near average regional variation exists within lungs due gravity ratio gets considered abnormal ventilationperfusion coupling also known ventilationperfusion lung diseases cardiac shunts smoking cause ventilationperfusion mismatch results significant symptoms diseases treated treatments like bronchodilators oxygen therapy ventilationperfusion coupling involves organs respiratory system cardiovascular system respiratory system major airways participating ventilation include nostril nasal cavity mouth pharynx larynx trachea bronchus lungs within lungs ventilation process specifically involves organs like respiratory bronchioles alveolar ducts alveolar sacs alveoli perfusion process circulatory organs cardiovascular system heart pulmonary arteries pulmonary veins alveolar

ventilation process ventilationperfusion coupling relationship ventilation perfusion represented ventilationperfusion ratiovq ventilation rate v total gas volume enters leaves alveoli given amount time commonly measured per minute calculate ventilation rate tidal volume inhaled exhaled gas volume normal breath multiplied frequency breaths per minute represented formula ventilation rate tidal volume l x breath per minute breathmin perfusion rate q total blood volume enters alveolar capillaries per unit time minute gas exchange therefore ventilationperfusion ratio represents volume gas

achievement ventilation perfusion matching essential ensures continuous supply oxygen withdrawal waste products body thus strict regulation ventilation perfusion needed efficient gas exchange average liters oxygen v liters blood q enter alveoli minute thus normal vq ratio considered abnormal ratio greater smaller referred ventilationperfusion mismatchvq mismatch information vq mismatch found clinical significance section ideal vq ratio ratio normal lungs healthy individual approximately meaning ventilation perfusion equal perfectly due gravity lower lungs relatively greater amount blood upper lungsapex relatively greater amount air thus blood lower lungsbase fully oxygenated oxygen air upper fully extracted decreasing vq compared lungs apex ventilation rate greater base vq ratio apex roughly base indicates perfusion greater ventilation towards base ventilation rate greater perfusion towards towards base lungs fluid volume pleural cavity increases due gravity resulting greater intrapleural pressure result alveoli expand less become compliant base improving ventilation perfusion also increases gravity pulls blood towards base overall ventilation perfusion rate enhanced towards lungs base however perfusion rate rises resulting decreased vq ratio towards apex lungs hydrostatic pressure reduced due gravity lowers blood flow thus decreasing perfusion since ventilation exceeds perfusion vq ratio increased apex ventilationperfusion ratio abnormally higher lower normal range called ventilationperfusion mismatch may cause significant impact health two types vq mismatch firstly dead space occurs ventilation exceeds perfusion due deficient perfusion dead space refers volume taking part gas alveolar dead space insufficient perfusion result vq ratio decreased fresh oxygen might caused blood clotting heart failure pulmonary emphysema damage alveolar secondly pulmonary shunt caused zero low vq ratio due insufficient ventilation excess perfusion improper ventilation lowers blood oxygenation oxygen supply body tissues although oxygen inspired pulmonary shunt prevents oxygen delivered alveoli blood capillaries likely results hypoxemia low oxygen level
