combined dna index system codis united states national dna database created maintained federal bureau investigation codis consists three levels information local dna index systems ldis dna profiles originate state dna index systems sdis allows laboratories within states share information national dna index system ndis allows states compare dna information one another codis software contains multiple different databases depending type information searched examples databases include missing persons convicted offenders forensic samples collected crime scenes state federal system different laws collection upload analysis information contained within database however privacy reasons codis database contain personal identifying information name associated dna profile uploading agency notified hits samples tasked dissemination personal information pursuant laws creation national dna database within us first mentioned technical working group dna analysis methods twgdam fbis strategic goal maximize voluntary participation states avoid happened several years early eight western states frustrated progress creating national automated fingerprint identification system afis network formed western identification network fbis strategy discourage states creating systems competed codis develop dna databasing software provide free charge state local crime laboratoriesthis strategic decisionto provide software free charge purpose gaining market sharewas innovative time predated browser wars fbi began pilot dna databasing program state local congress passed dna identification act authorized fbi create national dna database convicted offenders well separate databases missing persons forensic samples collected crime scenes bureau believed act required establish national dna database fbis criminal justice information services division already using similar authorities provide datasharing solutions federal state local tribal law enforcement agencies dna identification act also required laboratories participating codis program maintain accreditation independent nonprofit organization actively involved forensic fields scientists processing dna samples submission codis maintain proficiency routinely tested ensure quality profiles uploaded national level codis ndis implemented october today states district columbia federal law enforcement army laboratory puerto rico participate national sharing dna codis database contains several different indexes storage dna profile information assistance criminal investigations three indexes exist offender index contains dna profiles convicted crimes arrestee index contains profiles arrested crimes pursuant laws particular state forensic index contains profiles collected crime additional indexes unidentified human remain index missing persons index biological relatives missing persons index used assist identifying missing specialty indexes also exist specimens fall categories indexes include staff index profiles employees work samples multiallelic offender index singlesource samples three alleles two codis generally used linking crimes crimes potentially suspects noncriminal portions database missing person indexes national missing person dna database also known codismp maintained fbi ndis level codis allowing states share information one another created using existing codis infrastructure section database designed help identify human remains collecting storing dna information missing relatives missing unidentified remains processed dna university north texas center human identification funded national institute nuclear ystr males mitochondrial analysis performed unknown remains known relatives order maximize chance identifying september ndis contained million offender profiles four million arrestee profiles one million forensic effectiveness codis measured number investigations aided database hits september codis aided thousand investigations produced thousand state sdis database state set inclusionary standards less strict national level reason number profiles present state level databases national database routinely searched across state bulk identifications using codis rely short tandem repeats strs scattered throughout human genome statistics used calculate rarity specific profile strs type copynumber variation comprise sequence nucleotide base pairs repeated location tested dna analysis also known locus plural loci person two sets repeats one father one mother set measured number repeat copies strands inherited parents contain number repeats locus person said homozygous locus repeat numbers differ said heterozygous every possible difference locus repeat determination performed across number loci repeat values dna profile uploaded codis january requirements upload national level known offender profiles alternatively codis allows upload mitochondrial dna mtdna information missing persons indexes since mtdna passed mother offspring used link remains still living relatives prior january national level codis required known offender profiles set loci called codis core since requirement expanded include seven additional loci partial profiles also allowed codis separate indexes common crime scene samples degraded mixtures multiple individuals upload profiles national level codis requires least eight core loci present well profile rarity million calculated using population loci fall within gene named gene example tpox named human thyroid peroxidase loci fall within genes given standard naming scheme uniformity loci named chromosome locus order location chromosome described example third chromosome location codis core listed loci asterisks new core added list january loci used codis chosen regions noncoding dna sections code proteins sections able tell investigators additional information person hair eye color however new advancements understanding genetic markers ancestry indicated codis loci may contain phenotypic us database directly connected country underlying codis software used agencies around world april codis software used international laboratories international police agencies want search us database submit request fbi review request reasonable profile searched would meet inclusionary standards us profile number loci request searched national level forwarded states reasonable suspicion exists may present level collection upon conviction collection felony arrests collection felony arrests original purpose codis database build upon sex offender registry dna collection convicted sex time expanded currently states collect dna convicted felonies number states also collect samples juveniles well arrested yet convicted note even states limit collection dna retained state database convicted crime local databases forensic laboratory operated new york citys office chief medical examiner may collect dna samples arrestees convicted collection arrestee samples raised constitutional issues specifically fourth amendment prohibiting unreasonable search seizure argued collection dna convicted crime without explicit order collect considered warrantless search therefore united states supreme court ruled maryland v king collection dna arrested crime yet convicted part police booking procedure reasonable collection used identification inheritance pattern dna means close relatives share higher percentage alleles random members allows searching close matches within codis exact match found focusing close matches investigators potentially find close relative whose profile codis narrowing search one specific family familial searching led several convictions exhaustion leads including grim sleeper serial practice also raised fourth amendment challenges individual ends charged crime implicated someone elses dna codis april twelve states approved use familial searching httpsenwikipediaorgwikicombineddnaindexsystem
