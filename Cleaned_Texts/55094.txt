psychological behaviorism form behaviorism major theory within psychology holds generally human behaviors learned proposed arthur w staats theory constructed advance basic animal learning principles deal types human behavior including personality culture human evolution behaviorism first developed john b watson coined term behaviorism b f skinner developed known radical behaviorism watson skinner rejected idea psychological data could obtained introspection attempt describe consciousness psychological data view derived observation outward behavior strategy behaviorists animal learning principles used explain human behavior thus behaviorisms based upon research animals staats program takes animal learning principles form presents basic also basis study human behaviors adds human learning principles principles unique evident holth also critically reviews psychological behaviorism path grand reunification psychology behavior preceding behaviorisms ivan p pavlov edward l thorndike john b watson b f skinner clark l hull studied basic principles conditioning animals behaviorists animal researchers basic approach basic animal principles applied explanation human behavior programs study human behavior broadly deeply staats first research human subjects study ranged research basic principles research theory analysis wide variety human behaviors real life human behaviors warren tryon suggested staats change name approach psychological behaviorism staats behaviorism based upon human research unifies aspects traditional study behaviorism includes study basic principles example original behaviorists treated two types conditioning different ways generally used way b f skinner constructively considered classical conditioning operant conditioning separate independent principles classical conditioning piece food provided dog shortly buzzer sounded number times buzzer come elicit salivation part emotional response operant conditioning piece food presented dog dog makes particular motor response dog come make motor response frequently staats two types conditioning separate interact piece food elicits emotional response piece food presented dog made motor response effect strengthening motor response occurs frequently future staats sees piece food two functions one function eliciting emotional response function strengthening motor behavior precedes presenting food classical conditioning operant conditioning much related positive emotion stimuli serve positive reinforcers negative emotion stimuli serve punishers consequence humans inevitable learning positive emotion stimuli serve positive discriminative stimuli incentives negative emotion stimuli serve negative discriminative stimuli disincentives emotion stimuli also reinforcing value discriminative stimulus value unlike skinners basic principles emotion classical conditioning central causes behavior unlike behaviorisms staats considers human learning principles states humans learn complex repertoires behavior like language values athletic skills cognitive emotional sensory motor repertoires repertoire learned change individuals learning ability child learned language basic repertoire learn read person learned value system system beliefs human freedom learn value different forms government individual learned track athlete learn move quickly football player introduces basic principle psychological behaviorism human behavior learned cumulatively learning one repertoire enables individual learn repertoires enable individual learn additional repertoires cumulative learning unique human characteristic taken humans chipping hand axes flying moon learned repertoires enable learning new repertoires enable learning new repertoires endless fashion achievement theory development enables psychological behaviorism deal types human behavior reach radical behaviorism example personality preceding behaviorists ivan p pavlov edward l thorndike john b watson b f skinner clark l hull author arthur w staats major works complex human learning language child learning intelligence behavior social psychologys crisis disunity marvelous learning staats proposes radical behaviorism insufficient view psychology needs unify traditional knowledge human behavior behaviorism called behaviorizing psychology way enables psychological behaviorism deal topics usually dealt behaviorism according theory personality consists three huge complex behavioral infant begins life without basic behavioral repertoires acquired complex learning occurs child becomes able respond appropriately various whereas beginning learning involves basic conditioning repertories acquired childs learning improves aided repertoires already functional way person experiences world depends hisher repertoires individuals environment present results learning basic behavioral repertoire bbr individuals behavior function life situation individuals bbr bbrs dependent independent variable result learning cause behavior constituting individuals personality according theory biological conditions learning essential biology provides mechanisms learning performance behavior example severely braindamaged child learn bbrs normal manner according staats biological organism mechanism environment produces learning results basic behavioral repertoires constitute personality turn repertoires acquired modifying brains biology creation new neural connections organic conditions affect behavior affecting learning basic repertoires sensory processes effect environment behavior proximal hereandnow distal memory thus biology provides mechanism learning environment provide content behavior personality creative behavior explained novel combinations behaviors elicited new complex environmental situations self individuals perception hisher behavior situation organism personality situation interaction three main forces explaining behavior world acts upon person person also acts world himherself methodology psychological behavioral theory contains techniques assessment therapy specially designed three behavioral repertoires watson named approach behaviorism form revolution prevalent use introspection study mind introspection subjective variable source objective evidence mind consisted inferred entity could never observed insisted psychology based objective observation behavior objective observation environmental events cause behavior skinner radical behaviorism also established systematic relationship traditional psychology knowledge psychological bolstering watsons rejection inferring existence internal entities mind personality maturation stages free important knowledge produced nonbehavioral psychology objectified analysis learningbehavioral terms one example concept intelligence inferred observed thus intelligence intelligence tests considered systematically behaviorism however pb considers iq tests measure important behaviors predict later school performance intelligence composed learned repertoires behaviors joining knowledge behaviorism intelligence testing yields concepts research concerning intelligence behaviorally causes intelligence well intelligence thus behaviorism systematically incorporates explains behaviorally empirical parts psychology different behaviourisms also differ respect basic principles skinner contributed greatly separating pavlovs classical conditioning emotion responses operant conditioning motor behaviors staats however notes food used pavlov elicit positive emotional response classical conditioning thorndike edward thorndike used food reward reinforcer strengthened motor response came called operant conditioning thus emotioneliciting stimuli also reinforcing watson although father behaviorism develop research basic theory principles conditioning behaviorists whose work centered development treated differently relationship two types conditioning skinners basic theory advanced recognizing two different types conditioning didnt recognize interrelatedness importance classical conditioning central explaining human behavior human nature staats basic theory specifies two types conditioning principles relationship since pavlov used food stimulus elicit emotional response thorndike used food reward reinforcer strengthen particular motor response whenever food used types conditioning thus take means food elicits positive emotion food serve positive reinforcer reward also means stimulus paired food come two functions psychological behaviorism skinners behaviorism consider operant conditioning central explanation human behavior pb additionally concerns emotion classical conditioning difference two behaviorisms seen clearly theories language staats extending prior theory indicates large number words elicit either positive negative emotional response prior classical conditioning transfer emotional response anything paired pb provides evidence pbs basic learning theory also states emotional words two additional functions serve rewards punishments learning also serve elicit either approach avoidance thus hearing people ethnic group dishonest condition negative emotion name group well members group complimenting saying positive emotional words person performance increase likelihood person perform action later seeing sign restaurant elicit positive emotion hungry driver thus instigate turning restaurants parking lot case depends upon words eliciting emotional response pb treats various aspects language original development children role intelligence abnormal backs basic applied study theory paper journal behavior therapy helped introduce cognitive language behavior therapy behavioral field much research pb based concerned childrens learning example series studies first learning reading preschoolers also series studying training dyslexic adolescent psychological behaviorism pb position became norms child ages important behaviors due learning biological maturation staats began studies analyze cases important human behaviors basic applied ways analyzed dyslexia introduced token reinforcer system later called token economy along teaching method materials treating disorder daughter jenny born began study produce language emotional sensorymotor development year half old began teaching number concepts reading six months later using token reinforcer system recorded audiotape films made staats interviewed conception variations childrens home learning variously prepared school first three arthur staats youtube videos following second staats youtube video records beginning teaching threeyearold son reading learning counting method developed daughter film also shows graduate assistant working culturally deprived fouryearold learning reading writing numbers counting participating voluntarily staats youtube video number additional cases usually delayed children voluntarily learning much ahead time cognitive repertoires prepare school group children gained average points iq advanced significantly child development measure also learned like learning situation staats published first study series describes later studies general conception book research included work children birth basis staats books specifying importance parents early training child language cognitive repertoires shows foundations intelligent well entering school new studies showing parents talk children children advanced language development school success intelligence measures statistical studies joined staats work individual children shows specifics learning involved best produce two together show powerfully importance early child learning staats also applied approach fathering children employed findings constructing conception human behavior human deals many aspects child development babbling walking discipline timeout considers parents one last books summarizes theory child development position children young human species body make infinity different behaviors human species also nervous system brain billion neurons learn marvelous complexity childs development consists learning repertoires extraordinarily complex like languagecognitive repertoire emotionalmotivational repertoire sensorymotor repertoire including subrepertoires various kinds childs behavior various life situations encountered depend upon repertoires learned childs ability learn variety situations encountered also depends repertoires learned conception makes parenting central childs development supported many studies behavior analysis offers knowledge parents raising children staats describes humans great variability behavior across different people individual differences consistent different life situations typify people differences also tend run families phenomena led concept personality internal trait inherited strongly determines individuals characteristic ways behaving personality conceived way remains inference based people behave evidence personality successful measurement personality tests intelligence example internal organ intelligence found genes either intelligence tests constructed predict helpfully perfectly performance children school children behaviors measured tests display better learning behaviors classroom although tests widely applied radical behaviorism invested study personality personality testing psychological behaviorism however considers important study personality personality determines behavior causes personality well personality tests measure tests including intelligence tests considered measure different repertoires behavior individuals learned individual life situations also displays behaviors learned personality tests predict people behave means also tests used identify important human behaviors learning produces behaviors studied gaining knowledge make possible develop environmental experiences produce prevent types personality developing study example learning write letters alphabet children learn repertoires make intelligent psychological behaviorisms theory abnormal personality rejects concept mental illness rather behavior disorders composed learned repertoires abnormal behavior behavior disorders also involve learned basic repertoires needed adjusting lifes demands severe autism involve learned language repertoire well learned tantrums abnormal pbs theories various behavior disorders employ diagnostic statistical manual mental disorders dsm descriptions abnormal repertoires absence normal repertoires psychological behaviorism provides framework approach clinical treatment behavior disorders shown field behavior pb theory also indicates behavior disorders prevented preventing abnormal learning conditions produce pb theory child development besides physical growth consists learning repertoires basic sense provide behaviors many life situations also determine well individual learn theory states humans unique building type learning cumulative learning basic repertoires enable child learn repertoires enable learning repertoires learning language example enables child learn various repertoires like reading number concepts grammar repertoires provide bases learning repertoires example reading ability opens possibilities individual things learn things nonreader theory empirical methodology pb applies education example theory reading explains childrens differences dyslexia advanced reading pb also suggests treat dyslexic children learning disabilities psychological behaviorisms approach supported advanced field behavior human origin generally explained darwins natural however darwin gathered imposing evidence showing evolution physical characteristics species view behavioral characteristics human intelligence also evolved pure assumption evidentiary support pb presents different theory cumulative learning prehuman hominins drove human evolution explains consistent increase brain size course human evolution occurred members evolving hominin species continually learning new language emotionmotivation sensorymotor repertoires meant new generations learn ever complex repertoires cumulative learning consistently created selection device members generations larger brains better learners theory makes learning ability central human origin selecting would survive reproduce advent homo sapiens individuals except damaged full brains full learning psychological behaviorism set forth overarching theory constructed multiple theories various areas staats considers unified theory areas related principles consistent advanced consistently composing levels basic increasingly advanced basic level calls systematic study biology learning organs evolutionary development species like amoeba learning ability humans basic learning principles constitute another level theory human learning principles specify cumulative learning principles areas like child development personality abnormal personality clinical treatment education human additional levels staats sees overarching theory pb basic additional levels compose social sciences sociology linguistics political science anthrology paleoanthropology criticizes disunification sciences study human behavior human nature disconnected build related simpler understandable conception scientific endeavor example biological sciences philosophy science unification one staats attempt construct unified psychological behaviorism psychological behaviorisms works project new basic applied science various theory levels basic principles level one example needs study systematically relationship classical conditioning emotional responses operant conditioning motor responses another projection field child development focus study learning basic repertoires one essential systematic detailed study learning experiences children home birth says research could accomplished installing cameras homes volunteering remunerated families research also done discover learning produces normal abnormal personality development another example pb also calls educational research school learning could advanced using methods theories
