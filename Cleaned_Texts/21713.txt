sound environment may fully appreciated unless one adopts organismal perspective sound perception way soundscape ecology also informed sensory sensory ecology focuses understanding sensory systems organisms biological function information obtained systems many cases humans must acknowledge sensory modalities information used organisms may obvious anthropocentric viewpoint perspective already highlighted many instances organisms rely heavily sound cues generated within natural environments perform important biological functions example broad range crustaceans known respond biophony generated around coral reefs species must settle reefs complete developmental cycle attracted reef noise pelagic nocturnal crustaceans repelled acoustic signal presumably mechanism avoid predation

promising areas future work birds used study organisms much research concerning wildlife responses anthropogenic noise resulting literature documents many effects relevant taxa affected anthropophony birds may particularly sensitive noise pollution given rely heavily acoustic signals intraspecific communication indeed wide range studies demonstrate birds use altered songs noisy research great tits urban environment revealed male birds inhabiting noisy territories tended use higher frequency sounds presumably higherpitched songs allow male birds heard anthropogenic noise tends high energy lower frequency range thereby masking sounds spectra followup study multiple populations confirmed great tits urban areas sing increased minimum frequency relative forestdwelling addition study suggests noisy urban habitats host birds use shorter songs repeat rapidly contrast frequency modulations birds may simply increase amplitude loudness songs decrease masking environments elevated experimental work field observations show song alterations may result behavioral plasticity rather evolutionary adaptations noise ie birds actively change song repertoire depending acoustic conditions fact avian vocal adjustments anthropogenic noise unlikely products evolutionary change simply high noise levels relatively recent selection however bird species adjust songs improve communication noisy environments may limit ability occupy habitats subject anthropogenic species individual birds establish relatively rigid vocal repertoire young sorts developmental constraints may limit ability make vocal adjustments later thus species modify songs may particularly sensitive habitat degradation result noise even among birds able alter songs better heard environments inundated anthropophony behavioral changes may important fitness consequences great tit example tradeoff signal strength signal detection depends song male birds include low frequency sounds song repertoire experience better sexual fidelity mates results increased reproductive success however low frequency sounds tend masked anthropogenic noise present high frequency songs effective eliciting female responses conditions birds may therefore experience competing selective pressures habitats high levels anthropogenic noise pressure call lower frequencies order improve signal strength secure good mates versus opposing pressure sing higher frequencies order ensure calls detected background anthrophony addition use certain vocalizations including high amplitude sounds reduce masking noisy environments may impose energetic costs reduce reproductive tradeoffs stresses impose birds noisy habitats may represent ecological traps habitats individuals reduced fitness yet colonized rates greater equal anthropophony may ultimately population communitylevel impacts avian fauna one study focusing community composition found habitats exposed anthropophony hosted fewer bird species regions without noise areas similar numbers fact nests noisy habitats higher survival laid control habitats presumably noisy environments hosted fewer western scrub jays major nest predators birds thus anthropophony negative effects local species diversity species capable coping noise disturbance may actually benefit exclusion negative species interactions areas experiments suggest noise pollution potential affect avian mating systems altering strength pair bonds exposed high amplitude environmental noise laboratory setting zebra finches monogamous species show decreased preference mated similarly male reed buntings quiet
