developmental dysfluency normal dysfluency lack language fluency occurs early childhood development commonly observed children ages years old typically occurs begin learn language communication developmental dysfluency refers speech continually interrupted rather flowing naturally developmental dysfluency commonly expressed inconsistencies speech stuttering repetition lengthening sounds syllables mistiming poor speech complicated skill involving series cognitive linguistic processes sensorimotor auditory children grow language vocabulary grow exponentially dysfluencies early speech typical speech skills develop common form dysfluency children younger three years repetition onesyllable words parts words words syllables often repeated beginning sentences try process form rest
