armadillosuchus extinct genus sphagesaurid crocodylomorph described february late campanian early maastrichtian adamantina formation bauru basin brazil dating approximately armadillosuchus among larger robust sphagesaurids total length approximately metres ft like sphagesaurids armadillosuchus heterodont teeth likely capable chewing based dentition size believed omnivore feeding invertebrates plants possibly scavenging occasion furthermore well developed forelimbs may made animal capable burrower could helped armadillosuchus regulate body temperature recognizable feature armadillosuchus body armor makes one best armored notosuchians preserved elements show presence rigid shield hexagonal osteoderms behind head followed series mobile bands similar armadillos give animal name armor

jo√£o tadeu arruda numerous contributions paleontology fossil specimen armadillosuchus complete thanks protective armour plating much reasonably well preserved skull robust slightly flatted tho maintaining overall oreinirostral form typical notosuchians snout relatively longer wider compared adamantinasuchus sphagesaurus still rather short like sphagesaurids teeth show wide variety morphologies different uniform homodont dentition crocodyliforms tooth morphologies include curved caniniforms protruding front teeth resembled incisors conical molariform teeth shearing edges filling remainder premaxilla contained two three second pair aforementioned caniniforms greatly exceed first pair size back upper jaw teeth distinctly asymmetrical outer edge relatively smooth side facing inward marked ridge covered series tubercles lower jaw notably narrower upper first pair dentary teeth directed forward like adamantinasuchus mariliasuchus fourth tooth lower jaw shows flattened sides keel directed towards front back jaw dentition closely matches posterior upper jaw however key difference tuberclelined keel faces outwards rather ribs armadillosuchus show signs undergone pachyostosis meaning thickened limbs elongated like notosuchians still relatively short compared sphagesaurids humerus much robust caipirasuchus armadillosuchus widest point humerus measures half bones maximum length shoulder blade also stout height width roughly equal one among sphagesaurids armadillosuchus classed among largebodied forms skull length around mm nearly twice smaller members family yacarerani armadillosuchus may reached total body length ft like crocodylomorphs armadillosuchus prominent body armor formed small bony plates known osteoderms directly behind animals skull protecting neck osteoderms fused together create rigid shield hexagonal plates known cervical nuchal ornamented parallel horizontal ridges although element rigid way connected body meant could articulated independently head rather locking loosely linked seven bands osteoderms form mobile thoracic armor superficially resembles modern armadillos central portion armor formed series overlapping osteoderms rectangular shape ornamented circular pits similar seen neosuchians first five bands armadillosuchus thoracic armor composed four parallel osteoderms sixth seventh show two due resemblance final two bands posterior osteoderms modern crocodiles marinho carvalho suggest armor behind preserved section may lacked mobile bands much simpler consisting single however armor back body known isolated material thus difficult reconstruct based fragmentary remains described cunha colleagues osteoderms tail ranged rectangular shape subtriangular generally wider long like torso variety accessory osteoderms also armadillosuchus alongside simosuchus among heavily armored notosuchian study suggests osteoderms may visible life way appear modern crocodilians paper specifically covers sharpeys fibers collagen structure anchoring osteoderms underlying layer skin known stratum compactum modern crocodilians fibers help keep bottom osteoderms connected skin study shows many notosuchians including armadillosuchus sharpeys fibers also run perpendicular outer surface similar condition seen todays leatherback softshell turtles leading authors suggest osteoderms armadillosuchus deeply embedded skin animal covered leathery dermis may advantage increased recent phylogenetic analysis consistently show armadillosuchus derived member sphagesauridae family notosuchians endemic south america known heterodont research found sphagesaurids generally divided shortsnouted smallbodied generally gracile taxa adamantinasuchus much larger robust better armored

chimaerasuchus comahuesuchus baurusuchidae sebecidae research conducted determine resting metabolic rate well estimated dimensions red blood cells indicate armadillosuchus ectothermic animal like modern crocodilians however despite armadillosuchus terrestrial notosuchians may regulated internal temperature manner similar modern monitor lizards possible would basked sunlight raise body temperature stuck sunlit areas foraging retreated burrows threat overheating basking osteoderms may helped absorb retain heat extended periods time helping animal maintain high levels activity even without direct teeth armadillosuchus give several clues ecology morphology way arranged give animal powerful scissorlike jaws wear facets seen teeth suggests animal performed back forward movement

additional evidence habits found robust anatomy shoulder girdle long claws forelimbs robust neck forelimbs particular may used either create burrows dig foraging former matching inferred thermoregulatory behavior one hypothesis dietary preferences animal proposes armadillosuchus omnivore feeding variety animals plants including molluscs arthropods roots pines although remains molluscs
