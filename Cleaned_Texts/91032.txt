nutcracker syndrome ncs results commonly compression left renal vein lrv abdominal aorta aa superior mesenteric artery sma although variants name derives fact sagittal plane andor transverse plane sma

phenomenon appeared condition confused superior mesenteric artery syndrome compression third portion duodenum sma aa signs symptoms ncs derived outflow obstruction left renal vein compression causes renal vein hypertension leading hematuria lead abdominal pain classically left flank pelvic abdominal pain may improve worsen depending patients may also orthostatic proteinuria presence protein urine depending sit since left gonadal vein drains via left renal vein also result left testicular men left lower quadrant pain women especially intercourse occasionally gonadal vein swelling may lead ovarian vein syndrome women nausea vomiting result due compression splanchnic unusual manifestation ncs includes varicocele formation varicose veins lower another clinical study shown nutcracker syndrome frequent finding varicoceleaffected patients possibly nutcracker syndrome routinely excluded possible cause varicocele pelvic women hypertension left gonadal vein also cause increased pain

sma aa lrv nutcracker syndrome diagnosed imaging doppler ultrasound dus computed tomography ct magnetic resonance imaging mri selection imaging modality stepwise process dus initial choice clinical suspicion based symptoms ct mri used follow afterwards confirmation necessary venography used although ability detect renal vein compression dependent patient positioned imaging dus recommended initial screening tool high sensitivity specificity dus measures anteroposterior diameter peak systolic velocity least four times fast uncompressed vein indicative ct mri used afterward confirm compression aa sma comprehensive measurements abdominal vasculature beak sign often seen ct scans due lrv compression however ct mri demonstrate flow within compressed vein two modalities used confirm evidence ncs backup blood flow ovarian confirmation necessary venography used gold standard test diagnosing nutcracker syndrome renocaval pullback mean gradient mmhg considered diagnostic although method continues gold standard values unaffected individuals may vary considerably leading measurements ncs patients similar normal may partly due compensatory mechanisms vasculature result increased blood pressure invasive nature procedure another consideration comparison dus ctmri imaging treatment depends severity symptoms addition conservative measures invasive therapies include endovascular

flank pain anemia managed surgical conservative management advised children growth may lead increase tissue fork sma aa providing room lrv pass blood without treatment case involves weight gain build adipose tissue decreasing compression venous blood may also directed towards veins formed result higher blood pressure may contribute symptomatic relief individuals adolescent patients found symptoms resolved two years medications decrease blood pressure ace inhibitors also used reduce several different procedures available manage ncs include lrv transposition common procedure done followed renal autotransplantation lrv bypass cases open procedures data limited long term followup respect lrv transposition patients stated improvement symptoms months following laparoscopic procedures involve laparoscopic splenorenal venous bypass laparoscopic lrvivc uncommon comparison open procedures outcomes procedures similar open although robotic surgery possible data robotic procedures limited concerning outcomes endovascular interventions involve use stents improve blood flow area lrv following catheterization venography done visualize vasculature provide confirmatory diagnosis ncs prior following stenting patients improvement symptoms sixth months following procedure long term followup showed recurrence symptoms months although less invasive risks involved include incorrect placement
