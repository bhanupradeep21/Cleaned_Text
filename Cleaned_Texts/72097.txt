sensory design aims establish overall diagnosis sensory perceptions product define appropriate means design redesign basis involves observation diverse varying situations given product object used order measure users overall opinion product positive negative aspects terms tactility appearance sound sensory assessment aims quantify describe systematic manner human perceptions confronted product object contrary traditional laboratory analysis sensory analysis product either carried panel trained testers specialized test equipment designed mimic perception humans result allows researchers establish list specifications set precise quantified requirement applied materials objects using various criteria transportation sphere sensory analysis sometimes translated minor enhancements design vehicle interior information system station environment smooth rougher edges travel example specialized air purifying equipment used design pleasant odor train sensory design plays critical role modern food beverage food beverage industry attempts maintain specific sensory experiences addition smell flavor color eg ripe texture food eg potato chips also important even environment important color affects appetite essence taste food multisensorial experience five senses vision touch sound smell taste come together create strong food marketing goal marketers design products food beverage would stimulate many senses customers restaurants many sensorial aspects interior design vision texture chairs tables touch background music noise level sound openness kitchen cooking scene smell vision course food taste come together customer decides likes experience would want multisensory experiences subjected categories past modern day spectrum expanded acknowledge importance sensory design food used considered strictly experience taste multisensorial trait food known marketers food products restaurants focus providing services extend beyond sense taste recent research role vestibular sense system contributes sense balance space highlighted relation food often referred sixth sense researches show vestibular senses exhibited peoples postures eating shape perceptions food general people tend rate food bettertasting consume sitting compared standing researches conclude perception food vestibular system result different stress levels caused according postures similar food used regarded merely experience taste architecture past used subjected sense vision much architectural products relied visual forms photographs television contrast architecture become

type design architecture field called responsive architecture design interacts kind architecture could promote occupants lifestyle sensory design properly applied instance responsive architecture helping occupant goal exercise sensory design arrange environmental stimuli time along occupant path like space may serve feed occupants senses inspire teach exercise right time right comes experience

experts advances sensors computation allowed objective quantified measurements sensory information acquired quantified communicated leading improved design communication translation prototype production quality assurance sensory areas objectively quantified include vision touch smell vision light color considered sensory design early light meters called extinction meters relied human eye gauge quantify amount light subsequently analog digital light meters popularized photography work lawrence herbert lead systematic combination lighting color samples required quantify colors human eye
