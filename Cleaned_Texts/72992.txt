chronic stress physiological psychological response induced longterm internal external stressor either physically present recollected produce effect trigger chronic stress wide range chronic stressors entail relatively prolonged problems conflicts threats people encounter daily several chronic stressors including neighbourhood environment financial strain interpersonal stress work stress caregiving identified associated disease stress responses fight flight response fundamental complexity environment means constantly changing navigate surroundings therefore need system capable responding perceived threatening harmful stress response system thus role adaptive process restore homeostasis body actively making instance body involve endocrine system response corticosteroids released process known allostasis first proposed sterling eyer research provided considerable evidence illustrate stress response shortterm adaptive immediate effects stress hormones beneficial particular shortterm situation system arguably protective defense usually pose health however problem arises persistent threat firsttime exposure stressor trigger acute stress response body however repeated continuous exposure causes stressor become mcewen stellar argued hidden cost chronic stress body long time often known allostatic load chronic stress cause allostasis system overstimulate response persistent overstimulation lead adverse impact illustrate longterm exposure stress creates high level hormones may lead high blood pressure subsequently heart disease damage muscle tissue inhibition damage mental health chronic stress also relates directly functionality structure nervous system thereby influencing affective physiological responses subsequently result damage body hans selye known father credited first studying identifying stress studied stress effects subjecting lab mice various physical antigenic environmental stressors including excessive exercise starvation extreme temperatures determined regardless type stress mice exhibited similar physical effects including thymus gland deterioration development selye developed theory general adaptive syndrome gas known today stress response concluded humans exposed prolonged stress could also experience hormonal system breakdown subsequently develop conditions heart disease elevated blood selye considered conditions

scientific study stress require better accurate measurement stress process however complexity stress added difficulties establish consistent thorough chronic stress measures primarily comprise epidemiological studies look current experiences within specific life domains despite significance cumulative stress exposure past experiences often compromised due practical difficulties limitations

addition interactions different stressors lead cumulative stress exposure together contribute differential stress subjective differences thus may pose challenges researchers owing complexity measuring stress processes lifespan many researchers decided measuring assessable aspects stress includes historic exposure current exposure responses across different time many cases chronic stress measured
