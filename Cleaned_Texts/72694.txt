primate erythroparvovirus generally referred virus parvovirus sometimes erythrovirus first known human virus family parvoviridae genus erythroparvovirus measures nm name derived latin parvum meaning small reflecting fact ranks among smallest dna viruses virus known causing disease pediatric population however also affect adults classic cause childhood rash called fifth disease erythema infectiosum slapped cheek virus discovered chance australian virologist yvonne gained name discovered well large series microtiter erythroviruses belong parvoviridae family small dna human parvovirus nonenveloped icosahedral virus contains singlestranded linear dna genome approximately base pairs infectious particles may contain either positive negative strands dna icosahedral capsid consists capsomeres consisting two structural proteins kda kda identical except amino acids aminoterminal socalled region major capsid protein comprises approximately total virus particle incorporated capsid structure nonstoichiometrical relation based antibodybinding analysis xray structural analysis region assumed exposed surface virus end dna molecule palindromic sequences form hairpin loops hairpin end serves primer dna classified erythrovirus capability invade red blood cell precursors bone marrow three genotypes subtypes genome human parvovirus encodes four proteins addition notable large nonstructural protein commonly referred sequencespecifically binds cleaves dna via restriction endonuclease activity responsible regulation certain cellular promoters including thought regulate virus kda protein encoded viral genome implicated viral dna nucleotide substitution rate total coding dna estimated x rate similar singlestranded dna viruses codons found purifying selection contrast codons unique part gene found diversifying selection diversifying selection consistent persistent infection part protein contains epitopes recognised immune systemcitation needed like nonenveloped dna viruses pathogenicity parvovirus involves binding host cell receptors internalization translocation genome host nucleus dna replication rna transcription assembly capsids packaging genome finally cell lysis release mature humans p antigen also known globoside cellular receptor parvovirus virus causes erythema infectiosum fifth disease children infection sometimes complicated severe aplastic anemia caused lysis early erythroid precursorscitation needed recent common ancestor extant strains dated years three recognised recombination types gave rise genotype years agocitation needed virus primarily spread infected respiratory droplets bloodborne transmission however secondary attack risk exposed household persons half classroom symptoms begin six days exposure days average last week infected patients normal immune systems contagious becoming symptomatic probably individuals igg antibodies generally considered immune recurrent infection reinfection possible minority half adults due past infectioncitation needed significant increase number cases seen every three four years last epidemic year outbreaks arise especially nurseries schools parvovirus causes infection humans cat dog parvoviruses infect humans vaccine available human parvovirus though attempts made develop fifth disease erythema infectiosum one several expressions parvovirus associated bright red rash cheeks gives nickname slapped cheek age may affected although common children aged six ten years named fifth common cause pinkred infection associated rash described physicians many others measles rubella rare infected patients usually develop illness incubation period four fourteen days disease commences high fever malaise virus abundant bloodstream patients usually longer infectious characteristic rash disease following symptoms characteristic teenagers young adults may develop socalled papular purpuric gloves socks syndrome cutaneous condition characterized pruritus edema erythema hands association parvovirus described virus demonstrated skin biopsy subsequently corroborated numerous arthralgias arthritis commonly reported association parvovirus infection adults absence skin findings whereas erythema infectiosum main symptom observed children occurrence arthralgia coincides initial detection circulating igm iggantibodies viral structural proteins parvovirus infection may affect development adults perhaps children parvovirus lead seronegative arthritis usually easily controlled women approximately twice likely men experience arthritis parvovirus infection possibly new cases arthritis due parvovirus history recent contact patient positive serology generally confirms arthritis progress forms arthritis typically joint symptoms last weeks affected may last weeks danish study links polymyalgia although patients decrease erythropoiesis production red blood cells parvovirus infection dangerous patients preexisting bone marrow stress example sickle cell anemia hereditary therefore heavily dependent erythropoiesis due reduced lifespan red cells termed aplastic crisis also called reticulocytopenia treated blood transfusion parvovirus cause chronic anemia individuals immunodeficiency receiving immunosuppressive therapy hiv infection treatment intravenous immunoglobulin usually resolves anemia although relapse occur parvovirus infection may trigger inflammatory reaction aids patients begun antiretroviral parvovirus infection pregnant women associated hydrops fetalis due severe fetal anemia sometimes leading miscarriage due combination hemolysis red blood cells well virus directly negatively affecting red blood cell precursors bone marrow risk fetal loss infection occurs pregnancy week especially weeks minimal routine screening antenatal sample would enable pregnant mother determine risk infectioncitation needed knowledge status would allow mother avoid contact individuals suspected known ongoing infection however present time antenatal testing immunity recommended since good means prevent infection specific therapy vaccines available may increase maternal anxiety fear without proven benefit best approach would recommend pregnant women avoid contact children current symptoms infection described risk fetus reduced correct diagnosis anemia ultrasound scans treatment blood transfusions evidence intrauterine parvovirus infection leads developmental abnormalities moment treatments directly target parvovirus intravenous immunoglobulin therapy ivig therapy popular alternative doctors administer without stopping chemotherapy drugs like also treatments side effects rare patients complications acute kidney injury pulmonary edema even though patients organ transplants hiv large improvement administering rituximabcitation needed monoclonal antibody protein shown cause acute neutropenia via parvovirus even persistent parvovirus however important note ivig therapy perfect treated patients relapse approved human vaccine existed
