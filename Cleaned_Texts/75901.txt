human digestive system consists gastrointestinal tract plus accessory organs digestion tongue salivary glands pancreas liver gallbladder digestion involves breakdown food smaller smaller components absorbed assimilated body process digestion three stages cephalic phase gastric phase intestinal phase first stage cephalic phase digestion begins secretions gastric glands response sight smell food stage includes mechanical breakdown food chewing chemical breakdown digestive enzymes takes place mouth saliva contains digestive enzymes amylase lingual lipase secreted salivary serous glands tongue chewing food mixed saliva begins mechanical process digestion produces bolus swallowed esophagus enter stomach second stage gastric phase happens stomach food broken mixing gastric acid passes duodenum first part small intestine third stage intestinal phase begins duodenum partially digested food mixed number enzymes produced pancreas digestion helped chewing food carried muscles mastication tongue teeth also contractions peristalsis segmentation gastric acid production mucus stomach essential continuation digestion peristalsis rhythmic contraction muscles begins esophagus continues along wall stomach rest gastrointestinal tract initially results production chyme fully broken small intestine absorbed chyle lymphatic system digestion food takes place small intestine water minerals reabsorbed back blood colon large intestine waste products digestion feces defecated rectum via anus several organs components involved digestion food organs known accessory digestive organs liver gall bladder pancreas components include mouth salivary glands tongue teeth epiglottis largest structure digestive system gastrointestinal tract gi tract starts mouth ends anus covering

enterocytes microfold cells parts digestive system also part excretory system including large mouth first part upper gastrointestinal tract equipped several structures begin first processes include salivary glands teeth tongue mouth consists two regions vestibule oral cavity proper vestibule area teeth lips rest oral cavity proper oral cavity lined oral mucosa mucous membrane produces lubricating mucus small amount needed mucous membranes vary structure different regions body produce lubricating mucus either secreted surface cells usually underlying glands mucous membrane mouth continues thin mucosa lines bases teeth main component mucus glycoprotein called mucin type secreted varies according region involved mucin viscous clear clinging underlying mucous membrane mouth thin layer smooth muscle tissue loose connection membrane gives great covers cheeks inner surfaces lips floor mouth mucin produced highly protective tooth roof mouth termed palate separates oral cavity nasal cavity palate hard front mouth since overlying mucosa covering plate bone softer pliable back made muscle connective tissue move swallow food liquids soft palate ends surface hard palate allows pressure needed eating food leave nasal passage opening lips termed oral fissure opening throat called either side soft palate palatoglossus muscles also reach regions tongue muscles raise back tongue also close sides fauces enable food mucus helps mastication food ability soften collect food formation bolus three pairs main salivary glands minor salivary glands mainly serve digestive process also play important role maintenance dental health general mouth lubrication without speech would main glands exocrine glands secreting via ducts glands terminate mouth largest parotid secretion mainly serous next pair underneath jaw submandibular glands produce serous fluid mucus serous fluid produced serous glands salivary glands also produce lingual lipase produce oral cavity saliva third pair sublingual glands located underneath tongue secretion mainly mucous small percentage saliva within oral mucosa also tongue palates floor mouth minor salivary glands secretions mainly mucous innervated facial nerve glands also secrete amylase first stage breakdown food acting carbohydrate food transform starch content maltose serous glands surface tongue encircle taste buds back part tongue also produce lingual lipase lipase digestive enzyme catalyses hydrolysis lipids fats glands termed von ebners glands also shown another function secretion histatins offer early defense outside immune system microbes food makes contact glands tongue sensory information stimulate secretion saliva providing necessary fluid tongue work also ease swallowing food saliva moistens softens food along chewing action teeth transforms food smooth bolus bolus helped lubrication provided saliva passage mouth esophagus also importance presence saliva digestive enzymes amylase lipase amylase starts work starch carbohydrates breaking simple sugars maltose dextrose broken small intestine saliva mouth account initial starch digestion lipase starts work breaking fats lipase produced pancreas released continue digestion fats presence salivary lipase prime importance young babies whose pancreatic lipase yet well role supplying digestive enzymes saliva cleansing action teeth also immunological role supplying antibodies system immunoglobulin seen key preventing infections salivary glands importantly parotitis saliva also contains glycoprotein called haptocorrin binding protein vitamin binds vitamin order carry safely acidic content stomach reaches duodenum pancreatic enzymes break glycoprotein free vitamin binds intrinsic factor food enters mouth first stage digestive process takes place action tongue secretion saliva tongue fleshy muscular sensory organ first sensory information received via taste buds papillae surface taste agreeable tongue go action manipulating food mouth stimulates secretion saliva salivary glands liquid quality saliva help softening food enzyme content start break food whilst still mouth first part food broken starch carbohydrates enzyme amylase saliva tongue attached floor mouth ligamentous band called gives great mobility manipulation food speech range manipulation optimally controlled action several muscles limited external range stretch frenum tongues two sets muscles four intrinsic muscles originate tongue involved shaping four extrinsic muscles originating bone involved movement taste form chemoreception takes place specialised taste receptors contained structures called taste buds mouth taste buds mainly upper surface dorsum tongue function taste perception vital help prevent harmful rotten foods consumed also taste buds epiglottis upper part esophagus taste buds innervated branch facial nerve chorda tympani glossopharyngeal nerve taste messages sent via cranial nerves brain brain distinguish chemical qualities food five basic tastes referred saltiness sourness bitterness sweetness umami detection saltiness sourness enables control salt acid balance detection bitterness warns plants defences poisonous compounds bitter sweetness guides foods supply energy initial breakdown energygiving carbohydrates salivary amylase creates taste sweetness since simple sugars first result taste umami thought signal proteinrich food sour tastes acidic often found bad food brain decide quickly whether food eaten findings describing first olfactory receptors helped prompt research taste olfactory receptors located cell surfaces nose bind chemicals enabling detection smells assumed signals taste receptors work together nose form idea complex food teeth complex structures made materials specific made bonelike material called dentin covered hardest tissue teeth different shapes deal different aspects mastication employed tearing chewing pieces food smaller smaller pieces results much larger surface area action digestive enzymes teeth named particular roles process used cutting biting pieces food canines used tearing premolars molars used chewing grinding mastication food help saliva mucus results formation soft bolus swallowed make way upper gastrointestinal tract digestive enzymes saliva also help keeping teeth clean breaking lodged food epiglottis flap elastic cartilage attached entrance larynx covered mucous membrane taste buds lingual surface faces laryngeal surface faces larynx epiglottis functions guard entrance glottis opening vocal folds normally pointed upward breathing
