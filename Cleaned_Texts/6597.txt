functional behavior assessment fba ongoing process collecting information goal identifying environmental variables control problem target behavior purpose assessment prove aid effectiveness interventions treatments used help eliminate problem behavior functional behavior assessments learned complex patterns peoples seemingly unproductive behaviors important pay attention consequences follow behavior also antecedent evokes behavior work needs done future functional assessment including balancing precision efficiency specific variables involved smooth transition assessment functional behavior assessment fba method developed applied behavior analysis aba identify variables maintain problem behavior behavior lawful whether desirable undesirable behavior controlled environmental variables behavior function antecedent consequences make threeterm contingency functional assessment process gathering information antecedent stimuli consequences functional problem behavior attempts provide explanation problem behavior may occurring information antecedent stimuli may include time place presence others frequency information collected helps identify antecedent consequences maintaining behavior information collected functional assessment also help develop appropriate treatments target behavior stimulus may found reinforcing original behavior could transferred reinforce appropriate purpose conducting functional assessment identify function target behavior four main classes functions problem social positive reinforcement another person delivers positive reinforcement problem behavior occurs include giving attention fun activities goods services provided person example social positive reinforcement would maxs mother social dropping provide attention positive reinforcement son engages head banging wall problem social negative reinforcement another person delivers negative reinforcement problem behavior occurs person may terminate aversive stimuli interaction task activity behavior likely maintained example social negative reinforcement would max complains problem behavior parents social asked chores result parents allows escape task negative automatic positive reinforcement positive reinforcement occurs automatically mediated another person behavior strengthened automatic reinforcing consequence example automatic positive reinforcement would autistic child waving hands front face problem behavior sensory stimulation automatic positive reinforcement produced reinforcing automatic negative reinforcement negative reinforcement occurs automatically reducing eliminating aversive stimulus reinforcing consequence behavior popular example automatic negative reinforcement would binge eating binge eating problem behavior found temporarily reduce unpleasant emotions person may experiencing binge automatic negative various different methods used conduct functional assessment falls three distinct indirect functional assessment methods use behavior interviews surveys gather information person exhibiting behavior others know person well main advantage indirect methods easy cheap conduct take much time main disadvantage indirect methods people involved relying memories thus information may lost convenience indirect methods used commonly essential assessment clear objective produce accurate answers without interpretation goal indirect assessment method generate information antecedent behavior consequence help generate hypothesis variables maintains behavior indirect methods help develop correlation hypothesis functional relationship direct observation methods involve present observe record problem behavior occurs goal direct observation record immediate antecedent consequences functions problem behavior within natural environment main advantage direct observation antecedents consequences recorded happens instead recollection memory therefore information recorded generally accurate main disadvantage direct observation requires considerable amount time effort implement another thing direct observation like indirect methods demonstrate correlation functional observer direct observation method present natural environment problem behavior likely occur observer also trained record problem behavior functional antecedent consequences immediately correctly objectively direct observation also abc observation together indirect methods direct indirect assessments categorized descriptive assessment antecedent consequences described memory events information collected aids development hypothesis demonstrate functional relationship one must use experimental experimental methods involve manipulating either antecedent consequent variables determine influence problem behavior method demonstrate functional relationship antecedent stimulus reinforcing consequence problem behavior main advantage experimental method demonstration functional relationship main disadvantage experimental method extensive use time effort create experimental methods also called experimental analysis functional analysis information please visit functional analysis functional assessment always conducted treating problem behavior develop appropriate treatment one must correct information antecedents consequences controlling behavior treatment involves manipulating environmental events evoke change problem behavior proper procedure correctly implement functional functional behavior assessment conducted information collected used develop treatments interventions interventions designed manipulate antecedent orand consequence problem behavior decrease occurrence rate increase rate occurrence functional replacement functional interventions include extinction differential reinforcement antecedent manipulations intervention functional deal environmental events functional problem behavior also nonaversive punishment aversive interventions used latter resort previous nonaversive intervention tried shown ineffective punishment timeout response cost considered negative punishment although still controversial widely accepted positive punishment overcorrection contingent exercise guided compliance physical restraint mentioned punishment used last resort methods already considered lot research done functional assessment deals self injurious behaviors mentally challenged children adults autistic carr newsom binkoff conducted experimental method functional assessment two boys intellectual disabilities exhibiting aggressive behaviors hypothesized aggressive behaviors maintained escape academic tasks test hypothesis set two different experimental conditions academic demands put boys academic demands put children hypothesis true problem behavior occur much often first condition second results show hypothesis indeed true aggressive behavior occurred much higher frequency first condition researchers concluded boys problem behavior indeed maintained antecedent academic demands consequence escape demands another functional assessment research done brian iwata worked children developmental disabilities showing self injurious behaviors research could conclude maintaining behavior believed either adult attention escape demands sensory stimulation injuries hypotheses created condition would fit category adult attention hypothesis created environment adult room child pays attention himher behavior occurs escape demands hypothesis adult make normal demand towards child terminate self injurious behavior occurs sensory stimulation hypothesis child left alone without presence anyone stimulating activities iwata compared levels self injurious behaviors across three conditions demonstrated function problem behavior child different wanted attention others escaped maintained automatic reinforcement shown important conduct functional assessment determine exactly maintaining behavior function
