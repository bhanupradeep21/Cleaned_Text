see text komagataella methylotrophic yeast within order saccharomycetales found pichia pastoris feature using methanol source carbon p pastoris reassigned sole representative genus komagataella becoming komagataella later studies distinguished new species genus resulting total recognized uncommon see old name still use less formal use yeast may confusingly referred pichia years study komagataella widely used biochemical research biotech industries strong potential expression system protein production well model organism genetic study komagataella phaffii become important biological research biotech according nature komagataella found trees chestnut heterotrophs use several carbon sources living like glucose glycerol however use lactose komagataella undergo asexual reproduction sexual reproduction budding case two types cells komagataella exist haploid diploid cells asexual life cycle haploid cells undergo mitosis reproduction sexual life cycle diploid cells undergo sporulation growth rate colonies vary large range near doubling time one hour suitable industrial last years komagataella investigated identified good model organism several advantages first komagataella grown used easily lab like widely used yeast models relatively short life span fast regeneration time moreover inexpensive culture media designed komagataella grow quickly high cell whole genome sequencing komagataella performed k phaffii genome sequenced flanders institute biotechnology ghent university published nature genome sequence gene annotation browsed orcae system complete genomic data allows scientists identify homologous proteins evolutionary relationships yeast species komagataella addition seven species sequenced furthermore komagataella single eukaryotic cells means researchers could investigate proteins inside komagataella homologous comparison complicated eukaryotic species processed obtain functions another advantage komagataella similarity wellstudied yeast model saccharomyces cerevisiae model organism biology cerevisiae well studied decades used researchers various purposes throughout history two yeast genera pichia sensu lato saccharomyces similar growth conditions tolerances thus culture komagataella adopted labs without many moreover unlike cerevisiae komagataella ability functionally process proteins large molecular weight useful translational considering advantages komagataella usefully employed genetic experimental model organism genetic model organism komagataella used genetic analysis largescale genetic crossing complete genome data ability carry complex eukaryotic genetic processing relatively small genome functional genes peroxisome assembly investigated comparing wildtype mutant strains experimental model organism komagataella mainly used host system transformation due abilities recombination foreign dna processing large proteins much research carried investigate possibility producing new proteins function artificially designed proteins using komagataella transformation last decade komagataella engineered build expression system platforms typical application standard experimental model organism described komagataella frequently used expression system production heterologous proteins several properties make komagataella suited task currently several strains komagataella used biotechnical purposes significant differences among growth protein common variants possess mutation gene leading selection cells transformed successfully expression vectors technology vector integration komagataella genome similar saccharomyces proteins require chaperonin proper folding komagataella unable produce number proteins since contain appropriate chaperones technologies introducing genes mammalian chaperonins yeast genome overexpressing existing chaperonins still require standard molecular biology research bacterium escherichia coli frequently used organism expression system produce heterologous proteins due features fast growth rate high protein production rate well undemanding growth conditions protein production e coli usually faster komagataella reasons competent e coli cells stored frozen thawed use whereas komagataella cells produced immediately use expression yields komagataella vary different clones large number clones screened protein production find best producer biggest advantage komagataella e coli komagataella capable forming disulfide bonds glycosylations proteins e coli e coli might produce misfolded protein disulfides included final product leading inactive insoluble forms wellstudied saccharomyces cerevisiae also used expression system similar advantages e coli komagataella however komagataella two main advantages cerevisiae laboratory industrial settings comparing expression systems drosophila melanogaster chinese hamster ovary cells komagataella usually gives much better yields generally cell lines multicellular organisms require complex expensive types media including amino acids vitamins well growth factors types media significantly increase cost producing heterologous proteins additionally komagataella grow media containing one carbon source one nitrogen source suitable isotopic labelling applications like protein komagataella used several kinds biotech industries pharmaceutical industry applications based feature expressing proteins last years komagataella used production types biotherapeutics ifnÎ³ beginning one drawback protein expression system overglycosylation high density mannose structure potential cause research group managed create new strain called strain express erythropoietin normal glycosylation form exchanging enzymes responsible fungal type glycosylation mammalian homologs thus altered glycosylation pattern allowed protein fully food industries like brewery bake house komagataella used produce different kinds enzymes processing aids food additives many functions example enzymes produced genetically modified komagataella keep bread soft meanwhile beer enzymes could used lower alcohol recombinant phospholipase c degum highphosphorus oils breaking animal feed k phaffiproduced phytase used break phytic acid httpsenwikipediaorgwikipichiapastoris
