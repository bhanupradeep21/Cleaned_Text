reciprocal altruism humans refers individual behavior gives benefit conditionally upon receiving returned benefit draws economic concept human reciprocal altruism would include following behaviors limited helping patients wounded others crisis sharing food implement term firstly coined french philosopher auguste comte century derived french word comte believed altruism moral doctrine opposite egoism emphasizing noble morality sacrificing benefiting others human beings selfish altruistic motivations altruism used restrain egoistical comtes altruism describes nature human ethical significance completely different altruism biological sciences evolutionary biology altruism individual behavior benefits another individuals fitness reduces fitness concept biology arose debate problem natural charles darwin suggested animals behave ways increase survival reproductive chances competing others however altruistic behavior act helping others even accompanies personal cost common animal kingdom like vampire various therefore charles darwin regarded problem potential fatal challenge concept natural selection descent darwin ready sacrifice life many savage rather betray comrades would often leave offspring inherit noble nature william hamilton developed mathematical model put forward theory theory theory reveals altruistic gene evolved natural gene shared relatives reduces individuals fitness boots fitness relatives offsprings way behavior increases proportion altruistic gene population hamiltons rule provides mathematical inequality state altruistic gene spread natural selection following condition satisfied r b c c cost individual performing altruistic act b benefit gained recipients altruistic act r genetic relatedness individual recipients hamiltons theory expands darwinian definition continues darwinian framework allows spread selfish genes also altruistic nevertheless hamiltons theory support appropriate explanation unrelated members species order solve problem robert trivers developed original theory reciprocal altruism attempt explain altruism behaviors among unrelated idea reciprocal altruism straightforward altruistic behavior probably selected return would obtained future similar titfortat strategy game theory reciprocal altruism humanity based biological characteristics human beings realistic society explicates interdependence cooperation people well rationality also demonstrates original motivations internal mechanisms human cooperation revealing inevitability social significance ranging kin altruism unrelative altruism human population result subjective guess emotion human cooperation refined theory gradually become one popular explanations variety social behaviors addition cooperation deepseated foundation formation existence human society therefore proposition reciprocal altruism undoubtedly great theoretical advance human cognition history human reciprocal altruism seems huge magnetic field interweave different disciplines closely new exploration made disciplines different levels different points generally core human reciprocal altruism located puzzle overcome shortterm selfinterest achieve cooperation ultimately reveals altruistic individuals competitive selfish individuals either improving individual fitness resolving conflicts compatibility complementarity different theoretical perspectives lay basis human reciprocal altruism help exploring human different viewpoints human reciprocal altruism debate human reciprocal altruism focus biology sociology economics

trivers supported foundation reciprocal altruism axelrod hamilton applied game theory study mechanism reciprocal altruism attempted answer key question altruism spreads cheating allwin strategy used members population paper axelrod hamilton revealed reciprocating assistance another individual stable evolution long enough altruists population also demonstrate population altruists initially emerge inclusive fitness helping receiving help among genetically related individuals subsequent work indicates altruists initially needed emergence reciprocation heterogeneous evolutionary biologists like richard dawkins wholly endorse axelrod hamiltons work individual selection describing genes selfish states organisms act altruistically individual interests order help copies bodies replicate essentially reciprocal altruism individual behavior behind selfish motivations bird prime example narrative altruistic birds sacrifice interests reproducing late less hard times would able pass altruistic genes future generations dominated selfish genes birds take advantage situation using others food supply reproduce offspring nevertheless scholars k lorenz w edwards strongly opposed individual selection contrast spearhead campaign group selection debate whether individualsgene groupspecies basic levelunit selection occurred since major idea group selection individuals may sacrifice reproductive interests benefit survival group belong w builds argument mainly birth related behaviors birds points many bird species small clutches prolonged periods reaching reproductive maturity long breeding seasons sometimes excess one year group selection supporters also argue behaviors must social altruistic example food supply abundant clutches bigger food supply scarce birds thus regulate population densities starvation levels social conventions characteristics run contrary idea fitness defined individual organisms attempting selfishly reproduce however soon became clear

direct reciprocity immediate collaborative exchange benefits everyone direct reciprocity introduced robert mechanism evolution cooperation direct reciprocal typically oneforone incur cost today benefit incur cost point later benefit little negotiation exchange simple strategy prisoners common direct reciprocity prisoners dilemma requires immediate obvious benefit direct reciprocity relatively little need trust future cheating critical question may happen time context indirect reciprocity two players randomly selected population one donor recipient player play many times never

benefits individual forgive defection cooperative societies always unstable mutants inclined defect may lose addition indirect reciprocity typifies two forms description direct indirect reciprocity nowak sigmund provided explicit identifications upstream reciprocity based recent positive experience person receiving end donation may feel motivated donate turn individual b received help goes help c downstream reciprocity built reputation individual helped b therefore receives help c mathematical investigations indirect reciprocity shown natural selection favor strategies help others based reputation upstream reciprocity harder understand observed economic experiments cases decision help interpreted misdirected act gratitude one case recipients thanked another case thanked someone
