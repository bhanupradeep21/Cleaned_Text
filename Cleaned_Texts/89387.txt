frequently occurring geological processes chemical composition presence volcanic ash specific acidity spikes greenland ice cores shows evidence result volcanic instead impact also largest acidity spikes found antarctica ice cores dated bp significantly older hypothetical holocene formation modern salt lakes salt flats explained concentration salts evaporite minerals evaporation water streamfed lakes lacking external outlets called endorheic lakes commonly occur arid climates hemispheres earth composition salts evaporite minerals found lakes consistent precipitation dissolved material continually carried lakes rivers streams subsequent concentration evaporation instead evaporation whether lake becomes salty depends whether lake lacks outlet relative balance inflow outflow lake
