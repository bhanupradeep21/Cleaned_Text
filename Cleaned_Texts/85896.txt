heparininduced thrombocytopenia hit development thrombocytopenia low platelet count due administration various forms heparin anticoagulant hit predisposes thrombosis abnormal formation blood clots inside blood vessel thrombosis identified condition called heparininduced thrombocytopenia thrombosis hitt hit caused formation abnormal antibodies activate platelets release microparticles activate thrombin leading thrombosis someone receiving heparin develops new worsening thrombosis platelet count falls hit confirmed specific blood treatment hit requires stopping heparin treatment protection thrombosis choice agent reduce platelet count several alternatives available purpose mainly used danaparoid fondaparinux argatroban heparin discovered hit reported heparin may used prevention treatment thrombosis exists two main forms unfractionated form injected skin subcutaneously intravenous infusion low molecular weight form generally given subcutaneously commonly used low molecular weight heparins enoxaparin dalteparin nadroparin hit platelet count blood falls normal range condition called thrombocytopenia however generally low enough lead increased risk bleeding people hit therefore experience symptoms typically platelet count falls days heparin first given someone received heparin previous three months fall platelet count may occur sooner sometimes within common symptom hit enlargement extension previously diagnosed blood clot development new blood clot elsewhere body may take form clots either arteries veins causing arterial venous thrombosis respectively examples arterial thrombosis stroke myocardial infarction heart attack acute leg ischemia venous thrombosis may occur leg arm form deep vein thrombosis dvt lung form pulmonary embolism pe latter usually originates leg migrates receiving heparin intravenous infusion complex symptoms systemic reaction may occur infusion started include fever chills high blood pressure fast heart rate shortness breath chest pain happens quarter people hit others may develop skin rash consisting red administration heparin cause development hit antibodies suggesting heparin may act hapten thus may targeted immune system hit immune system forms antibodies heparin bound protein called platelet factor antibodies usually igg class development usually takes five days however exposed heparin last months may still circulating igg iggtype antibodies generally continue produced even precipitant removed similar immunity certain microorganisms difference hit antibody persist three hit antibodies found individuals thrombocytopenia thrombosis prior exposure heparin majority found people receiving igg antibodies form complex heparin bloodstream tail antibody binds fcÎ³iia receptor protein surface platelet results platelet activation formation platelet microparticles initiate formation blood clots platelet count falls result leading addition reticuloendothelial system mostly spleen removes antibodycoated platelets contributing thrombocytopenia formation antibodies common people receiving heparin proportion develop thrombocytopenia referred iceberg hit may suspected blood tests show falling platelet count someone receiving heparin even heparin already discontinued professional guidelines recommend people receiving heparin complete blood count includes platelet count regular basis receiving however people falling platelet count receiving heparin turn hit timing severity thrombocytopenia occurrence new thrombosis presence alternative explanations determine likelihood hit present commonly used score predict likelihood hit ts score introduced score points generated score hit unlikely score indicates intermediate probability score makes highly likely high score may need treated alternative drug sensitive specific tests hit performed low score safely continue receiving heparin likelihood hit extremely analysis reliability score low score negative predictive value intermediate score positive predictive value high score positive predictive value intermediate high scores therefore warrant first screening test someone suspected hit aimed detecting antibodies complexes may laboratory test enzymelinked immunosorbent assay type elisa test however detects circulating antibodies bind complexes may also falsely identify antibodies cause hit therefore positive elisa tested functional assay test uses platelets serum patient platelets washed mixed serum heparin sample tested release serotonin marker platelet activation serotonin release assay sra shows high serotonin release diagnosis hit confirmed sra test difficult perform usually done regional someone diagnosed hit recommend routine doppler sonography leg veins identify deep vein thromboses common given fact hit predisposes strongly new episodes thrombosis simply discontinuing heparin administration insufficient generally alternative anticoagulant needed suppress thrombotic tendency generation antibodies stops platelet count recovers make matters complicated commonly used anticoagulant warfarin used hit platelet count least high risk warfarin necrosis exists people hit low platelet counts warfarin necrosis development skin gangrene receiving warfarin similar vitamin k inhibitor patient receiving warfarin time hit diagnosed activity warfarin reversed vitamin transfusing platelets discouraged theoretical risk indicates may worsen risk thrombosis platelet count rarely low enough principal cause significant various nonheparin agents used alternatives heparin therapy provide anticoagulation strongly suspected proven hit danaparoid fondaparinux bivalirudin agents available countries approved specific use instance argatroban recently licensed united kingdom danaparoid available united fondaparinux factor xa inhibitor commonly used label hit treatment united statescitation needed according systematic review people hit treated lepirudin showed relative risk reduction clinical outcome death amputation etc compared patient controls addition people treated argatroban hit showed relative risk reduction clinical outcomes lepirudin production stopped may patients receiving heparin risk develop hit antibodies heparin progress develop hit thrombocytopenia subsequently onethird may develop arterial venous vascular surgery patients receiving heparin developed hit antibodies without clinical exact number cases hit general population unknown known women receiving heparin recent surgical procedure particularly cardiothoracic surgery higher risk risk low women giving birth studies shown hit less common receiving low molecular weight heparin introduced clinical use late new thrombosis people treated heparin described vascular surgeons reported fact phenomenon occurred together thrombocytopenia reported prior time platelet counts routinely report established hit diagnosis well suggesting features result immune initially various theories existed exact cause low platelets hit gradually evidence accumulated exact underlying john g kelton colleagues mcmaster university medical school developed laboratory tests could used confirm exclude heparininduced treatment initially limited aspirin warfarin saw introduction number agents could provide anticoagulation without risk recurrent older terminology distinguishes two forms heparininduced thrombocytopenia type mild nonimmune mediated selflimiting fall platelet count type form described currently term hit used without modifier describe immunemediated severe condition resembling hit without heparin exposure
