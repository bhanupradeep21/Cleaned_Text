parochial altruism concept fields social psychology evolutionary biology anthropology describes altruism towards ingroup often accompanied hostility towards combination altruism defined behavior done benefit others without direct effect self parochialism refers limited viewpoint together concepts create parochial altruism altruism limited scope ones ingroup parochial altruism closely related concepts ingroup favoritism outgroup research suggested parochial altruism may evolved humans promote high levels ingroup cooperation advantageous group parochial altruism often evoked explain social behaviors within groups people cooperative within social groups may aggressive towards social groups concept parochial altruism first suggested charles darwin book descent man darwin observed competition groups cooperation within groups important evolutionary traits influenced human darwin first described general concept parochial altruism coin term following darwins initial theories modern researchers fields evolutionary biology social psychology began investigating evolution group dynamics altruism evolutionary biologists samuel bowles herbert gintis particularly influential work proposing coevolution warfare ingroup addition work evolution set influential studies conducted indigenous groups papua new guinea important contributions study parochial altruism studies demonstrated social norms behaviors surrounding cooperation often shaped parochialism specifically altruistic behaviors found limited ones ethnic racial language group work revealed individuals likely protect members ingroup even required aggression outgroup parochial altruism refers form altruistic behavior exhibited preferentially towards members ones group often accompanied hostility towards outside group phenomenon characterized combination ingroup love outgroup preference towards ones ingroup often manifests cooperation sacrifice members social ethnic cultural group contrast hostility towards outgroup often manifests aggression discrimination towards members different social groups parochial altruism distinct general altruism characterized behavior done benefit another individual benefit self balance preferential treatment towards ingroup hostility towards outgroup important understanding intergroup dynamics broadly altruism manifest different forms ranging small acts kindness like helping stranger friend need significant sacrifices donating organ save anothers life evolutionary biologists ethologists psychologists investigated roots altruism suggesting may evolved means enhancing survival ones kin kin selection strategy receive reciprocal benefit another individual norm cultural societal norms significantly influence altruistic behavior evidenced diversity altruistic norms expressions across different human altruism often contrasted ethical egoism view individuals act selfinterest complexity human motivation makes distinction altruism selfinterest difficult identify ongoing debate within psychology philosophy kin selection theory evolutionary biology may offer foundational framework help explain mechanisms underlying parochial altruism evolutionary biologist william donald hamilton proposed theory mathematical formula commonly referred hamiltons rule rule posits evolutionary processes may favor altruistic behaviors benefit close genetic relatives thereby indirectly promoting transmission shared genes hamiltons rule described formula c r b c represents cost altruist r genetic relatedness altruist receiver b benefit receiver essence kin selection suggests individuals likely perform altruistic acts cost outweighed benefit context parochial altruism kin selection provides compelling explanation preference ingroup favoritism suggests individuals may evolutionary predisposed exhibit altruistic behaviors towards members group especially group members close genetic norm reciprocity states people tend respond others way treated example kind altruistic behavior responded kind altruistic behavior unkind aggressive behavior responded unkind aggressive principle central theory reciprocal altruism introduced robert trivers suggests altruistic behaviors within group reciprocated thereby reinforcing group cohesion mutual idea applied group cooperation suggests reciprocity evolutionary advantageous particularly context reciprocal altruism extends beyond kin selection benefits individuals based previous actions genetic relatedness reciprocity observed wide range species indicating evolutionary advantage fostering cooperation among nonkin group context parochial altruism expectation reciprocity fosters social connection sense mutual obligation preferential evolutionary theorists suggested human capacity altruism may coevolved warfare theory argues ingroup altruism core component parochial altruism would increased chances success warfare groups willing sacrifice would cohesive cooperative thus conferring advantages warfare ultimately greater success warfare would lead greater genetic conversely pressures demands warfare may intensified need ingroup altruism exacerbated parochialism process may led bidirectional relationship warfare parochial altruism element reinforcing idea war altruism intricately interconnected may also help explain high frequency intergroup conflicts observed ancient human idea parochial altruism may seem counterintuitive individual selection theory given parochialism often dangerous individual explain theorists often reference group selection theory suggests natural selection operates group level among individuals specifically behavior beneficial group even costly individual may selected increases overall survival chances genetic success group selection theory suggests individual behaviors decisions may shaped needs group example individual may choose sacrifice attacking outgroup perceive benefit ingroup theory faced considerable criticism universally accepted third party punishment phenomenon occurs individual directly affected transgression punishes transgressor form punishment influential maintaining social order reinforcing group norms even incurs personal cost third party punishment integral component enforcing social norms among research parochial altruism often employs thirdparty punishment experiments whereby individuals likely protect norm violators ingroups punish bias third party punishment basis parochial altruism experiments often use economic games dictator game prisoners dilemma measure furthermore researchers identified neural mechanisms social cognition seem specifically modulate thirdparty norm enforcement study illustrated participants determining punishment outgroup members transgressed show greater activity connectivity network brain regions modulate sanctionrelated decisions participants determining punishment ingroup members transgressed show greater activity connectivity brain regions modulate like many psychological phenomenon parochial altruism may manifest uniquely across different cultural contexts research revealed cultures vary intensity expression ingroup favoritism outgroup hostility differences likely result norms societal structures historical factors vary among cultures joseph henrich colleagues conducted largescale research study examining crosscultural variations economic dictator games smallscale societies studies revealed economic social environments influence altruistic behavior towards ingroup members example found societies higher level market integration adherence religion showed fairness economic games suggests moral component altruism influenced culture distinct ingroup outgroup model parochial additionally theories coevolution parochial altruism war suggest social structures organization may play role shaping parochial altruism societies strong clan tribal affiliations particularly frequent conflict tend exhibit pronounced parochial altruism reinforcing cooperation unity within social historical ecological factors may also influence extent parochial altruism within societies regions history intergroup conflict scare resources must fought groups may exhibit stronger ingroup loyalty outgroup aggression adaptive response parochial altruism influences individual psychology broader societal dynamics parochial altruism influences individual impact social identity perception social identity theory suggests individuals derive sense self group parochial altruism reinforce social identity individuals behave altruistically onegroup similarly ingroup favoritism outgroup hostility central parochial altruism shape individuals perceive interact others individuals likely view ingroup members trustworthy likable view outgroup members suspicious thus parochial altruism example group membership shapes individual attitudes interpersonal parochial altruism influences withingroup relations fostering sense unity cooperation among group members achieved ingroup favoritism characteristic parochial altruism whereby individuals selectively behave altruistically towards members group research social identity illustrates ingroup biases reinforce sense shared identity collective social identity theory posits enhanced group cooperation increase group morale selfesteem strengthening social bonds among group contrary withingroup relations parochial altruism influences intergroup relations increased tension conflict ingroups outgroups driven outgroup hostility component parochial altruism individuals likely punish outgroup members treat aggression compared ingroup research illustrates outgroup biases characteristic parochial altruism lead prejudice discrimination intergroup parochial altruism strengthens group cohesion within ones ingroup also fosters conflict outgroups study parochial altruism extends beyond human societies various animal models providing insight evolutionary origins mechanisms behavior animal kingdom parochial altruism observed within context territorial defense resource allocation within social groups example chimpanzees observed exhibit behaviors mirror human parochial altruism defending groups territory outsiders favoring group members food sharing grooming behaviors directed towards enhancing survival ingroup members similar ingroup favoritism outgroup hostility characteristic human parochial altruism similar behavior observed vampire bats demonstrate reciprocal altruism within social groups sharing meals kin nonkin group members concept parochial altruism influential explaining social behaviors like ingroup altruism outgroup hostility also received criticism evolutionary explanations parochial altruism often center group selection theory posits natural selection occur individual level also group level critics argued enough evidence support idea much likely human evolution driven genelevel empirical studies also failed find convincing evidence implications group selection theory parochial altruism namely unconditional nature intragroup additionally critics argued coevolution war altruism oversimplification fails explain peaceful interactions groups defensive strategies emerging research seeks investigate bases parochial altruism using modern technologies neuroimaging neurobiological one research study found evidence oxytocin neuropeptide seemed regulate parochial altruism studies illustrated testosterone associated parochial altruism humans may modulate neural systems associated studies show promising evidence neural
