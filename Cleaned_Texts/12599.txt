icebreaker life mars lander mission concept proposed nasas discovery mission involves stationary lander would near copy successful phoenix insight spacecraft would carry astrobiology scientific payload including drill sample icecemented ground northern plains conduct search biosignatures current past life science goals icebreaker life focus sampling icecemented ground potential preserve protect biomolecules icebreaker life selected discovery program competitions icebreaker life mission designed based successful phoenix lander terms platform northern landing site icebreaker life also solarpowered able accommodate drill rest payload minor modifications original lander selected discovery program mission lander would launched later december lander would arrive northern plains mars operations surface would last sols command control data relay patterned phoenix mission relay mars orbiters direct earth backup christopher mckay principal investigator icebreaker science payload proposed baseline science payload developing joint nasaspacex nowcanceled mission called red mars icebreaker life mission focuses following science goals current understanding habitability ice northern plains conduct direct search organics mars icebreaker life mission focuses following science goals duplicate samples could cached target possible return mars sample return samples shown contain organic biosignatures interest returning earth would high results previous missions phoenix mission particular indicate icecemented ground north polar plains likely recently habitable place currently known mars nearsurface ice likely provided adequate water activity aw periods high obliquity million years ago mars orbital tilt compared present value ground ice may melted enough preserve organic molecules including organic biosignatures two viking landers conducted first far search current life mars biology experiments sought detect living organisms based hypothesis microbial life would widely present soils earth would respond nutrients added liquid water viking biology experiments operated successfully landers instrument showing signs active bacterial metabolism occur duplicate heattreated instruments yielded negative results respect presence organic compounds results viking mission concerning life considered general expert community best scientists deducted ambiguous results may caused oxidant organic analysis instrument phoenix tega also defeated presence oxidant soil lander able identify sam instrument sample analysis mars currently use board mars science laboratorys curiosity rover three capabilities allow detect organics despite interference perchlorate null result would establish earthlike life likely present ground ice arguably habitable environment currently known mars implying earthlike life absent mars generally would lower risk biohazards human exploration sample return however would rule life earthlike biomarkers one key goals icebreaker life mission test hypothesis icerich ground polar regions significant concentrations organics due protection ice oxidants nonbiological organics infalling meteorites could detectable polar icerich ground significant concentrations could used indicators ice actually protect preserve organic molecules whether biological nonbiological organics found north polar regions would compelling targets future astrobiology missions especially potential recent habitability million years ago ice target biomolecules aminoacids proteins polysaccharides nucleic acids eg dna rna derivatives nad involved redox reactions camp intracellular signals polymeric compounds humic acids polyglutamic acid bacterial fermentation ionizing radiation photochemical oxidants damaging dry regolith therefore may necessary reach ft deep organic molecules may shielded ice surface conditions optimal deposition rate landing site would ft drill sample million years sediment perchlorate oxidized form element chlorine reactive ambient conditions mars however heated perchlorate decomposes releases reactive chlorine oxygen thus viking phoenix thermal processing soils would destroyed organics attempting detect thus lack detection organics viking detection chlorinated organic species may reflect presence perchlorates rather absence organics particular relevance microorganisms earth grow anaerobic reductive dissimilation perchlorate one specific enzymes used perchlorate reductase present known examples microorganisms also perchlorates toxic humans understanding chemistry distribution perchlorate mars might become important prerequisite first human mission mars sunlight powerful energy source life unlikely biologically useful present mars requires life surface exposed extremely lethal radiation dry team estimates icecemented ground landing site fact raised million years ago temperatures warmer resultant water activity may allowed microbial activity thin films unfrozen water form protected boundary beneath soil ice temperatures icebreaker life would study concentration distribution ferrous iron nitrate perchlorate biologically useful redox couple energy source ground ice mckay argues subsurface chemoautotrophy valid energy alternative martian life suggests perchlorate nitrate could form oxidizing partner redox couple suitable reduced material available carbon nitrogen arguably important element needed life thus measurements nitrate range required address question occurrence distribution nitrogen atmosphere low levels adequate support nitrogen fixation biological incorporation nitrogen form nitrate present could resource human exploration nutrient plant growth use chemical processes earth nitrates correlate perchlorates desert environments may also true mars nitrate expected stable mars formed shock electrical processes currently data availability icebreaker life would carry rotarypercussive drill proposed scientific instruments already tested relevant
