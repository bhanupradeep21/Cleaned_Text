azoospermia medical condition man whose semen contains associated male infertility many forms amenable medical treatment humans azoospermia affects male may seen male infertility situations nonpathological context azoospermia also intended result successful azoospermia classified three major types many conditions listed may also cause various degrees oligospermia rather azoospermia pretesticular testicular azoospermia known nonobstructive azoospermia whereas posttesticular azoospermia considered obstructive pretesticular azoospermia characterized inadequate stimulation otherwise normal testicles genital tract typically folliclestimulating hormone fsh levels low hypogonadotropic commensurate inadequate stimulation testes produce sperm examples include hypopituitarism various causes hyperprolactinemia exogenous fsh suppression testosterone chemotherapy may suppress pretesticular azoospermia seen pretesticular azoospermia kind nonobstructive azoospermia testicular azoospermia means testes abnormal atrophic absent sperm production severely disturbed absent fsh levels tend elevated hypergonadotropic feedback loop interrupted lack feedback inhibition fsh condition

eg klinefelter syndrome cases cryptorchidism sertoli cellonly syndrome well acquired conditions infection orchitis surgery trauma cancer causes mast cells releasing inflammatory mediators appear directly suppress sperm motility potentially reversible manner may common pathophysiological mechanism many causes leading testicular azoospermia kind nonobstructive azoospermia generally men unexplained hypergonadotropic azoospermia need undergo chromosomal evaluation posttesticular azoospermia sperm produced ejaculated condition affects azoospermic main cause physical obstruction
