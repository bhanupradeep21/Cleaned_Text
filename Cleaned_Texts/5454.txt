metereddose inhaler mdi device delivers specific amount medication lungs form short burst aerosolized medicine usually selfadministered patient via inhalation commonly used delivery system treating asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd respiratory diseases medication metered dose inhaler commonly bronchodilator corticosteroid combination treatment asthma copd medications less commonly used also administered mdi mast cell stabilizers cromoglicate nedocromil metereddose inhaler consists three major components canister produced aluminium stainless steel means deep drawing formulation resides metering valve allows metered quantity formulation dispensed actuation actuator mouthpiece allows patient operate device directs aerosol patients formulation made drug liquefied gas propellant many cases stabilising excipients actuator contains mating discharge nozzle generally includes dust cap prevent contamination use inhaler patient presses top canister thumb supporting

evaporation droplets results generation aerosol consisting micrometersized medication particles metereddose inhalers one type inhaler commonly used type replacement chlorofluorocarbons propellants hydrofluoroalkanes hfa resulted redesign metereddose inhalers one variety beclomethasone inhaler redesign resulted considerably smaller aerosol particles produced led increase potency factor invention mdi asthma medication delivered using squeeze bulb nebulizer fragile relatively crude nature devices also meant particles generated relatively large large effective drug delivery nonetheless nebulizers paved way inhalation drug delivery providing inspiration mdi mdis first developed riker laboratories subsidiary time mdis represented convergence two relatively new technologies cfc propellant meshburg metering valve originally designed dispensing initial design riker used glass canister coated vinyl plastic improve riker developed two mdi based products medihalerept containing epinephrine medihaleriso containing products agonists provide short term relief asthma symptoms largely replaced asthma treatment salbutamol selective metereddose inhalers sometimes used addon devices referred holding chambers spacers tubes attached inhaler act reservoir holding chamber reduce speed aerosol enters mouth serve hold medication sprayed inhaler makes easier use inhaler helps ensure medication gets lungs instead mouth air proper use spacer make inhaler somewhat effective delivering spacers especially helpful adults children find regular metered dose inhaler hard use people use corticosteroid inhalers use spacer prevent getting medicine mouth oral yeast infections dysphonia deposition content drug formulation canister surface result shorter shelf life mdi inhaler applying suitable surface coating components helps extend shelf life years range coating processes developed applied canister valve protect contents deposition degradation gas plasma processing industrial technique carried vacuum coat entire mdi inhaler involves constant pulsed excitation gas either radio frequency rf microwave field produce energetic plasma coating ensures drug formulation stick interior wall md inhaler results patient receiving prescribed dose medication whilst also extending products shelflife metered dose inhaler contains enough medication certain number actuations puffs printed canister even though inhaler may continue work beyond number uses amount medication delivered may correct important keep track number times inhaler used replaced recommended number uses reason several regulatory authorities requested manufacturers add dose counter dose indicator actuator several inhalation products sold dose counteractuator depending manufacturer product inhalers sold complete unit individual canister refill prescription mdis commonly used treatment lungbased disorders use requires dexterity complete required sequential steps achieve application devices incorrect completion one steps use mdi substantially reduce delivery administered medication consequently effectiveness safety numerous studies demonstrated patients use inhaler devices correctly patients often unaware using inhaled medication incorrect inhaler technique associated poorer incorrect maintenance cleaning metered dose inhalers also issue identified many users highlighting need clear guidance
