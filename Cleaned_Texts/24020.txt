hand feel hand fabric hand fabric feel property fabrics related touch expresses sensory comfort refers way fabrics feel skin hand conveys information cloths softness smoothness hand feel estimated subjective property different fabrics nowadays hand feel could measured assessed terminology commonly used relation wool referred wool term broader textile industry describe discussing wool term encompasses characteristics contribute quality including softness fineness length traits typically perceived evaluating quality woven fabrics attribute handle also term refers qualities like hardness severity softness smoothness also assessed touch contribute overall quality daily life experiences profoundly influenced sense touch touch first sense develop beginning first trimester pregnancy next months womb babys entire body develops touch receptors around weeks pregnancy touch first sense develop therefore hand feel important characteristic clothing provides sensory comfort hand feel also called handle one basic characteristics necessary sensory comfort related tactile related friction clothes body associated smoothness roughness softness stiffness clothing material degree tactile discomfort may vary individuals terms describe tactile sensations clingy sticky scratchy prickly soft stiff heavy light different terms use describing softness textile materials wool trade term handle good handling opposing term poor handling suggests materials poor harsh hand fabrics manufacturing becomes harsh undesirable hence made soft end users useful input materials subsequent hand feel matters selecting fabrics particular category line instance softer clothes preferred children ladies clothes designed lighter softer mens softening finishes aimed make materials soft stiffening finishes intended make materials stiff order prevent sagging stiffening adds crispiness light sheer fabrics stiffening involves application thermoplastic resins polymers parchmentising kind finish stiffens treated cellulosic materials imparting objectives hand feel drape draping fabric drape property different textile materials fold fall hang along threedimensional body draping depends upon fiber characteristics flexibility looseness softness materialdrape finishes also alter draping properties draping clothes embrace feminine hand feel adds compression resiliency soft fabrics tend spring back original soft fabrics compatible sewing softness improves sewability handfeel helps selling goods comfort also aid sewing avoids stitching hand feel may vary composition various yarn parameters hairiness twist yarn count gsm fabric weight fabric undesired acid alkaline temperature treatments make certain fabrics judgement fabrics scale soft harsh affected following parameters staple length diameter constituting fibers affect softness materials considerable fiber length needs less twisting loosely twisted yarns tend softer hand feel examples egyptian pima cotton softer cotton shorter fibers silk synthetic fibers infinite length concept texture pertains characteristics fabrics surface discerned visual tactile perceptions texture fabric may either smooth rough natural fibers characterized inherent variations tend imbue fabrics greater texture compared synthetic manufactured counterparts texture fabric also greatly influenced factors yarn type finishing techniques fabric surface contour fiber characterizes outer surface along shaft may rough smooth scaly serrated convoluted striated contribute friction softness texture property important texture hand feel fabric fabric construction thickness cloth present harsh soft handfeel usually fine lightweight structures loose weave knit constructions delicate twisted textured yarns used hand heavy thicker fabrics could soft harsh depending upon treatments varied yarn feel fabrics like silk satin fine muslins mulmul rayon modal lyocell nylon microfibers fabrics naturally soft still large manipulated different processes finishing techniques fabric softeners certain surface finishes napping help improve hand feel fabric softeners substances aid softening durability drape fabrics softeners also help providing body fabrics facilitate finishing processes wrinkle resistance finish fabrics become stiffened due finish silicone compounds substituted ammonium compounds fats wax emulsions oils commonly used softening surface finishes treatments alter surface feel textiles include several mechanical chemical applications napping raising produces soft fibrous surface mechanical finish machine equipped metallic wires breaks yarns creates fibrous surface surface sueding similar finish napping delicate finish arrangements machine bristles shearing improves appearance feel fabric cutting loops raised surface uniform even mercerizing improves characteristics cellulosic materials improves feel aesthetics treated fabrics deweighting weight reduction treatment polyester make like silk treatment peels surface reduces fiber weight strength making softer finer additionally treatment enhances absorbency treated bio polishing enzyme wash applicable cellulosic fibers cellulase enzyme treatment helps cut protruding fibers produce clean lustrous softer functional finishes add value handfeel moisture wicking example functional finish enhances wearers comfort far hand feel subjectively judged parameter
