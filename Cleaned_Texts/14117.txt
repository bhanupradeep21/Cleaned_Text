deinonychus often discovered associated tenontosaurus tilletti remains tenontosaurus specimens found sites also contain deinonychus remains according one study six sites containing deinonychus fossils contain trace tenontosaurus deinonychus remains rarely found associated potential prey like tenontosaurus fossils found close proximity deinonychus several scientists suggested implies deinonychus major predator tenontosaurus adult deinonychus however much smaller adult tenontosaurus unlikely single deinonychus would capable attacking fully grown tenontosaurus scientists suggested deinonychus must therefore pack hunter view challenged based supposed lack evidence coordinated hunting rather mobbing behavior modern birds reptiles though crocodilians documented hunt cooperatively well evidence deinonychus may cannibalizing well tenontosaurus feeding likely deinonychus favored juvenile tenontosaurus tenontosaurus reached certain size passed range food source small theropods though
