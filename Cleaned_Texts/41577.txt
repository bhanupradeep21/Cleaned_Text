pelanomodon extinct genus dicynodont therapsids lived late permian period fossil evidence genus principally found karoo basin south africa dicynodon assemblage lack fossil record late permian epoch suggests pelanomodon fell victim permiantriassic extinction event name pelanomodon broken three parts pelos meaning mud anomo meaning irregular odon meaning tooth together suggests pelanomodon mud dwelling anomodont group therapsids characterized lack karoo basin period characterized extensive flood hypothesize mud based habitat genus far fetched pelanomodon family geikiidae along aulacephalodon geikia aulacephalodon believed lived alongside pelanomodon karoo basin records geikia discovered scotland tanzania pelanomodon primarily characterized distinguished aulacephalodon lack crananial features used paleontologists establish two species pelanomodon p moschops p rubidgei however recent analysis points conclusion may fact fossil record pelanomodon principally made complete partial skulls reason morphology skull used distinguish pelanomodon genus geikiines family absence tusks significant feature used differentiate pelanomodon aulacephalodon addition bosses post orbital bar twisting pelanomodon distinguished geikia due longer temporal fenestra snout lesser developed oesophageal crest flush pineal addition distinctions pelanomodons skull many characteristic features one apparent features skull wider tall resulting triangular shape viewed connection temporal fenestra angle compared dicynodonts external naris retracted located relatively high likewise orbits also placed higher typically seen accordance anomodonts pelanomodon cheek teeth lack molar addition like therapsids premaxilla extends ventral side order form secondary pelanomodon first discovered robert broom karoo basin south africa classification based nearly complete skull missing lower species originally named dicynodon moschops however analysis done w keyser reclassified specimen pelanomodon another species pelanomodon rubidgei classified broom established complete skull found region h years broom described five different pelanomodon species based differences observed many partial complete however since time several paleontologists reevaluated morphology skulls reclassified either pelanomodon rubidgei pelanomodon since fossil records never provide complete understanding past classifications still debated among paleontologists new analysis suggested morphological features used distinguish pelanomodon moschops pelanomodon rubidgei actually result sexual dimorphism within analysis claims propelanomodon another tuskless dicynodont genus first described broom fact juvenile form pelanomodon authors analysis would classify species pelanomodon moschops basis conclusions discussed past skull features also used distinguish possible pelanomodon species one however recent analysis suggests disparities specimens may suggest one species rather sexual dimorphism within two species previously classified pelanomodon moschops p moschops identified skull longer cm length relatively small cranial bosses pelanomodon rubidgei p rubidgei identified skull longer cm relatively large cranial p moschops p rubidgei hypothesized species several paleontologists due fact structural differences exist skulls two species prominent distinction two skull types presence size cranial p moschops lacks supraorbital ridge postorbital bosses seen p rubidgei although maintains nasal prefrontal bosses much seemingly superficial features species share cranial features reason hypothesized differences result sexual dimorphism within one species p moschops propelanomodon tylorhinus another dicynodont species recently hypothesized juvenile form p shorter skull typically shorter centimetres long several key cranial features differ within species compared p moschops skulls leaves debate among paleontologists relationship pelanomodon example temporal fenestra propelanomodon point anterposteriorly rather angled slightly result skull distinct triangular shape pelanomodon addition propelanomodon snout relatively shorter orbits relatively larger cranial bosses distinct pelanomodon also absent except nasal bosses supporters hypothesis claim unusual see large cranial changes vertebrae like dicynodonts pelanomodon believed herbivore lack canine teeth would inhibit carnivorous addition pelanomodon described similar overall skull aulacephalodon keyser describes tip snout supported ridges along palatal snouts external surface restricts chewing motion tip combined cranial features described placement nares orbit suggests animal may consumed plants shallow fossil record pelanomodon thus far restricted karoo basin southern region chronicles constant sediment
