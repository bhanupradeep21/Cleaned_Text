number species belonging genus aulacephalodon existed since first specimens discovered majority specimens found fragments making proper diagnosis difficult many specimens owen first described members genus dicynodon bainii five species dicynodont discovered subsequent years seeley divided dicynodon two subgenera created subgenus aulacephalodon suggesting dicynodonts short snout wide skull included subgenus two additional dicynodont species discovered broom broom also proposed new subgenus dicynodon bainia describe tusked members dicynodon broom finally recognized seeleys subgenus aulacephalodon valid genus however spelling altered aulacocephalodon incorrect genus aulacocephalodon used many years correct spelling pointed keyser least species described members aulacephalodon however noted many features used distinguish different species sizedependent highly susceptible distortion resulted aulacephalodon bainii recognized type species genus previous species described synonymous members species various stages aulacephalodon peavoti first described cranium one specimen compared aulacephalodon bainii determine peavoti accurately described aulacephalodon distinct difference bainii peavoti specimens peavoti found possess tusks notable feature bainii aulacephalodon peavoti also found wider upright scapula blade compared bainii deeper fossa proximal end scapula species share similar postcranial features numerous differences shapes various girdle forelimb elements prevents paleontologists definitively recognizing peavoti member aulacephalodon skulls show transverse

suggests nasal bosses skulls collected aulacephalodon specimens provide compelling evidence sexual dimorphism aulacephalodon morphological studies found sizes nasal bosses collected specimens categorized three different size ranges specimens possessing largest sized nasal bosses assumed mature female aulacephalodon found specimens weakly developed nasal specimens thought represent mature males also larger craniums thicker squamosal border zygomatic female specimens showed thickening zygomatic canine tusks also appear longer apart male tollman et al suggests sexual dimorphism existed aulacephalodon means sexual selection display important limitations analysis specimen showed entirely male female characters many specimens used characterized immature possible explanations observation nondimorphic characters present crania effectively mask sexual dimorphism characters sexual dimorphic characters present fossils due lack measurable aulacephalodon specimens found cistecephalus zone sediments south africa terrain cistecephalus zone thought lowland composed vast floodplains many traversing streams crossed climate beaufort group late permian semiarid seasonal overall climate cistecephalus zone suitable diverse environments zone height genetic diversity aulacephalodon occupied rich localities cistecephalus zone suggesting habitat time extremely suitable recent biostratigraphy beaufort group marked lower boundary cistecephalus assemblage zone first appearance aulacephalodon first appearance specific boundary result refined biozonation map new technology allows accurate geographic information data paleontologists suggest endpermian tetrapod extinctions including aulacephalodon may caused lowered atmospheric oxygen concentrations resulting environmental organismal hypoxia increase size internal nares secondary palate would decrease respiratory efficiency large anomodont therapsids aulacephalodon comparison triassic latepermian
