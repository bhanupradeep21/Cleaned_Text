survival form successive generations leave copies herbert spencer first used phrase reading charles darwins origin species principles biology drew parallels economic theories darwins biological ones survival fittest sought express mechanical terms mr darwin called natural selection preservation favoured races struggle darwin responded positively alfred russel wallaces suggestion using spencers new phrase survival fittest alternative natural selection adopted phrase variation animals plants domestication published origin species introduced phrase fifth edition published intending mean better designed immediate local account herbert spencer described concept similar survival fittest theory first used phrase reading charles darwins origin species principles biology drew parallels economic theories darwins biological evolutionary ones writing survival fittest sought express mechanical terms mr darwin called natural selection preservation favored races struggle july alfred russel wallace wrote darwin readers thinking phrase natural selection personified nature selecting said misconception could avoided adopting spencers term survival fittest darwin promptly replied wallaces letter clear daylight fully agree say advantages h spencers excellent expression survival fittest however occurred till reading letter however great objection term used substantive governing verb received letter two months earlier would worked phrase fourth edition origin printed would use next book domestic animals darwin wrote page variation animals plants domestication published preservation battle life varieties possess advantage structure constitution instinct called natural selection mr herbert spencer well expressed idea survival fittest term natural selection respects bad one seems imply conscious choice disregarded little familiarity defended analogy similar language used chemistry astronomers depicting attraction gravity ruling movements planets way agriculturists speak man making domestic races power selection often personified word nature found difficult avoid ambiguity mean nature aggregate action product many natural laws ascertained sequence first four editions origin species darwin used phrase natural chapter edition origin published darwin implies synonym natural selection survival fittest darwin meant better adapted immediate local environment common modern meaning best physical shape think puzzle piece introduction gave full credit spencer writing called principle slight variation useful preserved term natural selection order mark relation mans power selection expression often used mr herbert spencer survival fittest accurate sometimes equally man versus state spencer used phrase postscript justify plausible explanation theories would adopted societies militant type uses term context societies war form reference suggests applying general thus survival fittest militant type society becomes characterized profound confidence governing power joined loyalty causing submission matters though spencers conception organic evolution commonly interpreted form lamarckisma herbert spencer sometimes credited inaugurating social darwinism evolutionary biologists criticise manner term used nonscientists connotations grown around term popular culture phrase also help conveying complex nature natural selection modern biologists prefer almost exclusively use term natural selection biological concept fitness refers reproductive success fecundity selection well survival viability selection prescriptive specific ways organisms fit phenotypic characteristics enhance survival reproduction meaning spencer phrase survival fittest often used mean natural selection avoided modern biologists phrase misleading example survival one aspect selection always important another problem word fit frequently confused state physical fitness evolutionary meaning fitness rate reproductive output among class genetic phrase also interpreted express theory hypothesis fit opposed unfit individuals species sense fit survive test nevertheless extended individuals conceptual mistake phrase reference transgenerational survival heritable attributes particular individuals quite irrelevant becomes clearer referring viral quasispecies survival flattest makes clear survive makes reference question even alive rather functional capacity proteins carry work interpretations phrase expressing theory danger tautological meaning roughly propensity survive propensity survive content theory must use concept fitness independent interpreted theory species survival theory fittest species survive undermined evidence direct competition observed individuals populations species little evidence competition driving force evolution large groups

competition ability survive dramatic changes environmental conditions meteor impact energetic enough greatly change environment globally sahney et al argued little evidence intrinsic biological factors competition driving force evolution large groups instead cited extrinsic abiotic factors expansion driving factor large evolutionary scale rise dominant groups amphibians reptiles mammals birds occurred opportunistic expansion empty ecological niches extinction groups happened due large shifts abiotic use term social darwinism critique capitalist ideologies introduced richard hofstadters social darwinism american thought published russian zoologist anarchist peter kropotkin viewed concept survival fittest supporting cooperation rather competition book mutual aid factor evolution set analysis leading conclusion fittest necessarily best competing individually often community made best working together concluded animal world seen vast majority species live societies find association best arms struggle life understood wide darwinian sense struggle sheer means existence struggle natural conditions unfavourable species animal species individual struggle reduced narrowest limits practice mutual aid attained greatest development invariably numerous prosperous open applying concept human society kropotkin presented mutual aid one dominant factors evolution selfassertion concluded practice mutual aid retrace earliest beginnings evolution thus find positive undoubted origin ethical conceptions affirm ethical progress man mutual support mutual struggle leading part wide extension even present time also see best guarantee still loftier evolution survival fittest sometimes claimed reasoning one takes term fit mean endowed phenotypic characteristics improve chances survival reproduction roughly spencer understood survival fittest simply rewritten survival better equipped surviving furthermore expression become tautology one uses widely accepted definition fitness modern biology namely reproductive success rather set characters conducive reproductive success reasoning sometimes used claim darwins entire theory evolution natural selection fundamentally tautological therefore devoid explanatory however expression survival fittest taken context gives incomplete account mechanism natural selection reason mention key requirement natural selection namely requirement heritability true phrase survival fittest tautology fitness defined survival reproduction natural selection portion variation reproductive success caused heritable characters see article natural certain heritable characters increase decrease chances survival reproduction bearers follows mechanically definition heritable characters improve survival reproduction increase frequency generations precisely called evolution natural selection hand characters lead differential reproductive success heritable meaningful evolution occur survival fittest improvement reproductive success caused traits heritable reason traits increase frequency generations words natural selection simply state survivors survive reproducers reproduce rather states survivors survive reproduce therefore propagate heritable characters affected survival reproductive success statement tautological hinges testable hypothesis fitnessimpacting heritable variations actually exist hypothesis amply momme von sydow suggested definitions survival fittest may yield testable meaning biology also areas darwinian processes influential however much care would needed disentangle tautological testable aspects moreover implicit shifting testable untestable interpretation illicit tactic immunize natural selection conveying impression one concerned testable skeptic society founder skeptic magazine publisher michael shermer addresses tautology problem book people believe weird things points although tautologies sometimes beginning science never end scientific principles like natural selection testable falsifiable virtue predictive power shermer points example population genetics accurately demonstrate natural selection effect change population shermer hypothesizes
