le fort lefort fractures pattern midface fractures originally described french surgeon rené le fort early described three distinct fracture patterns although always applicable modernday facial fractures le fort type fracture classification still utilized today medical providers aid describing facial trauma communication documentation surgical several surgical techniques established facial reconstruction following le fort fractures including maxillomandibular fixation mmf open reduction internal fixation orif main goal surgical intervention reestablish occlusion alignment upper lower teeth ensure patient able complications following le fort fractures rely anatomical structures affected inciding injury discussing anatomy face often divided thirds lower third extends chin approximately level upper teeth middle third continues teeth brow line finally upper third stretches brow middle third face midface anatomical location le fort fractures occur comprises maxillary bone palatine bones zygomas zygomatic processes temporal bone ethmoid bone vomer nasal concha nasal bones pterygoid processes sphenoid maxillary bone contains important anatomical structures prone injury trauma maxillary sinuses housed within maxillary bone traumatic injury sinuses may cause sinus infections changes eye placement infraorbital nerve terminal branch courses maxillary bone provides sensation central face additionally maxillary bone contains upper row teeth maxillary dentition occlusion alignment upper lower teeth vital following midface trauma ensure patient able eat facial biomechanics study forces facial bones plays important role midface reconstruction following trauma although biomechanics face fully understood due complex nature several vertical horizontal buttresses pillars established buttresses dissipate powerful forces skull endures biting le fort fractures pattern midface fractures originally described french surgeon rené le fort early le fort studied effect facial trauma dropping cadavers various heights recording different fracture patterns today evolution highspeed motor vehicle accidents advancements medical imaging surgical techniques lowspeed fracture patterns originally described le fort always modern midface fractures typically neatly fit one le fort classifications often occur combination craniofacial nevertheless le fort type fracture classification still used today starting point describing midface fractures communication documentation treatment traditionally le fort described three types fractures three fractures involve nasal septum pterygoid every trauma patient presenting hospital first evaluated according advanced trauma life support atls protocol follows abcs airway breathing circulation trauma includes ensuring

diagnosis computed tomography ct face skull imaging choice diagnosing le fort ct imaging greatly replaced use plain xray cts significantly likely show fracture present compared additionally ct imaging far useful visualizing skeletal injuries le fort fractures magnetic resonance imaging however mris may useful extensive soft tissue surgical treatment le fort fractures almost always necessary especially fractures displaced impact facial functions like eating fractures repaired maxillomandibular fixation mmf andor open reduction internal fixation orif lifethreatening injuries addressed primary goal intervention ensure patient able eat speak done reestablishing occlusion alignment upper lower teeth stabilizing facial biomechanics via vertical horizontal facial buttresses discussed previously support goals intervention include restoring cosmetic deformities trauma never prioritized reestablishing maxillomandibular fixation mmf also known intermaxiallary fixation imf surgical procedure reestablish occlusion fixating upper lower teeth correct position used isolation combination open reduction internal fixation orif treating le fort several surgical techniques exist establishing mmf selection relying individual patient injury surgeon mmf involves fixation upper lower teeth weeks limits patients ability speak eat breathe mouth maintain adequate oral mmf patients provided wire cutters scissors emergency patient mmf placed liquidonly diet entirety treatment may result weight mmf affect patients ability breathe mouth place patients history pulmonary disease rely mouth breathing may qualify additionally patients psychological seizure disorders may good mmf open reduction internal fixation orif surgical term refers open surgical repair broken bones required correction complex le fort fractures affecting facial function involving neurological complications visual changes csf orif especially important repairing unstable facial buttresses order allow patient tolerate chewing plates screws often permanently fixated facial bones stabilize lateral medial vertical buttresses bone grafts may also required stabilize orif used isolation combination maxillomandibular fixation mmf treating le fort following surgery patients may require six weeks rest able return demands daily patients heal slightly differently orif may result lessthanideal correction facial bones resulting poor occlusion facial asymmetries furthermore surgery orif comes risk scarring nerve injury role antibiotics midface trauma complex highly patientdependent topic facial trauma patients lacerations wounds inner lining mucosa mouth nose traditionally started antibiotics soon enter hospital remained antibiotics minimum hours however preliminary studies preoperative antibiotic use suggest may necessary prevent bacterial infections though based small patient populations strong enough studies set specific recommendations regarding preoperative antibiotic therefore patients still often placed antibiotics surgery especially increased risk developing infection including limited patients elderly tobacco users diabetic andor patient begun antibiotics difficult determine long remain antibiotics although multiple studies performed examining postoperative antibiotic use come contradicting recent studies suggested antibiotics may advantage preventing postoperative bacterial however studies acknowledge results based predominantly young healthy male patients nonspecific facial trauma make majority studies participants may applicable everyone experiencing midface limited studies specifically midface trauma standards postoperative antibiotic use determined use postoperative antibiotics relies surgeons clinical recommendations individual patient risk longterm outcomes le fort fractures depend severity location fracture common complication le fort fractures include imperfect fracture reduction resulting poor dental longterm effects le fort fractures include various nerve injuries either inciting injury surgical correction resulting facial movement sensory one maxillary sinuses injured trauma result chronic sinus
