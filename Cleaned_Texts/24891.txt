research contemporary cognitive psychology devoted mental activity mediated conscious awareness research unconscious processes done academic tradition information processing paradigm cognitive tradition research unconscious processes rely clinical observations theoretical bases psychoanalytic tradition instead mostly data driven cognitive research reveals individuals automatically register acquire information consciously aware consciously remember much research focused differences conscious unconscious perception evidence whether something consciously perceived depends incoming stimulus bottom topdown mechanisms like recent research indicates unconsciously perceived information become consciously accessible cumulative similarly content would normally conscious become unconscious inattention eg attentional blink distracting stimuli like visual masking extensive line research conducted hasher demonstrated individuals register information frequency events automatically outside conscious awareness without engaging conscious information processing resources moreover perceivers unintentionally truly automatically regardless instructions receive regardless information processing goals ability unconsciously relatively accurately tally frequency events appears little relation individuals education intelligence personality thus may represent one fundamental building
