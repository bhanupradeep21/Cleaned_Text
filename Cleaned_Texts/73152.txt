humans required lifecycle agent vertebrate reservoir amplify important step eradication polio interruption endemic transmission poliovirus stopping polio transmission pursued combination routine immunization supplementary immunization campaigns surveillance possible outbreaks several key strategies outlined stopping polio two distinct types polio vaccine oral polio vaccine opv sabin vaccine contains attenuated poliovirus attenuated poliovirus times less able wild poliovirus enter bloodstream cause opv delivered oral drops infused sugar cubes highly effective inexpensive per dose availability bolstered efforts eradicate polio study carried isolated inuit village showed antibodies produced subclinical wild virus infection persisted least immune response oral polio vaccine similar natural polio infection expected oral polio vaccination provides similar lifelong immunity route administration induces immunization intestinal mucosa protects subsequent infection though multiple doses necessary achieve effective also produce contact immunity attenuated poliovirus derived oral polio vaccine excreted infecting indirectly inducing immunity unvaccinated individuals thus amplifying effects doses oral administration require special medical equipment training taken together advantages made favored vaccine many countries long preferred global eradication primary disadvantage opv derives inherent nature attenuated active virus induce vaccineassociated paralytic poliomyelitis vapp approximately one individual per every million doses likewise mutation course persistent circulation undervaccinated populations lead vaccinederived poliovirus strains cvdpv induce polio much higher rates original recent times trivalent opv containing three virus strains used eradication wild poliovirus type phased replaced bivalent vaccine containing types supplemented monovalent type opv regions documented novel vaccine genetically modified reduce likelihood diseasecausing activating mutations introduced march limited basis later year recommended expanded use full rollout expected inactivated polio vaccine ipv salk contains trivalent fully inactivated virus administered injection vaccine induce vapp cvdpv strains arise likewise induce contact immunity thus must administered every individual added greater logistical challenges though single dose sufficient protection administration requires medically trained vaccinators armed singleuse needles syringes taken together factors result substantially higher delivery original protocols involved intramuscular injection arm leg recently subcutaneous injection using lower dose socalled fractionaldose ipv fipv found effective lowering costs also allowing convenient costeffective delivery use ipv results serum immunity intestinal immunity arises consequence vaccinated individuals protected contracting polio intestinal mucosa may still infected serve reservoir excretion live virus reason ipv ineffective halting ongoing outbreaks wpv cvdpv become vaccine choice industrialized poliofree ipv induce mucosal immunity shown boost mucosal immunity favors combined protocol recommended vulnerable
