tonsil stones also known tonsilloliths mineralizations debris within crevices mineralized presence debris known chronic caseous tonsillitis symptoms may include bad foreign body sensation sore throat pain discomfort swallowing generally pain though may feeling something presence tonsil stones may otherwise undetectable however people reported seeing white material rear throat risk factors may include recurrent throat tonsil stones contain biofilm composed number different bacteria calcium salts either alone combination mineral commonly occur palatine tonsils may also occur adenoids lingual tonsils tubal tonsil stones recorded weighing g typically small size however occasional reports large tonsilloliths often discovered medical imaging reasons recently due impact influence social media platforms tiktok medical professionals experienced increase patient concern tonsillolith usually benign tonsil stones bother patient treatment however rare cases tonsilloliths presented patients complications necessitating surgical extraction tonsilloliths exceed average size typically seen older individuals likelihood developing tonsil stones linear otherwise gargling salt water manual removal may chlorhexidine cetylpyridinium chloride may also surgical treatment may include partial complete tonsil people tonsil biological sex influence chance tonsil older people commonly many people opt extract tonsil stones manually developments dental hygiene products water flossers become common mechanism extract tonsilloliths alleviate discomfort complications exacerbate tonsil stones become dislodged eating drinking gargling etc tonsil stones may produce symptoms may associated bad fact many dental professionals argue tonsil stones leading cause bad breath patients smell may rotting tonsil stones tend happen often people longterm inflammation occasionally may pain even large tonsil stones discovered incidentally xrays cat scans symptoms include metallic taste throat closing tightening coughing fits itchy throat choking larger tonsil stones may cause recurrent bad breath frequently accompanies tonsil infection sore throat white debris bad taste back throat difficulty swallowing ear ache tonsil medical study conducted found association tonsilloliths bad breath patients certain type recurrent tonsillitis among bad breath subjects tonsilloliths subjects normal halitometry values normal breath tonsilloliths foreign body sensation may also exist back throat condition may also asymptomatic condition detection upon palpating hard intratonsillar

gargling saltwater manual removal may chlorhexidine cetylpyridinium chloride may also surgical treatment may include partial complete tonsil people able remove tonsil stones using cotton swab oral irrigators also effective electric oral irrigators unsuitable tonsil stone removal powerful likely cause discomfort rupture tonsils could result complications infection irrigators connect directly sink tap via threaded attachment otherwise suitable tonsil stone removal everyday washing tonsils jet water lowpressure levels user adjust simply manipulating sink tap allowing continuous range pressures suit users also manually pressurized tonsil stone removers available manual pumptype tonsil stone remover adjust water pressure depending number pumps effectively removing tonsil stones simply still gargling warm salty water may help alleviate discomfort tonsillitis often accompanies tonsil stones vigorous gargling morning also keep tonsil crypts clear persistent larger tonsil stones may require removal curettage scooping otherwise although thorough irrigation still required afterward effectively wash smaller pieces larger lesions may require local excision although treatments may completely help bad breath issues often associated condition another option decrease surface area crypts crevices etc tonsils via laser resurfacing procedure called laser cryptolysis performed using local anesthetic scanned carbon dioxide laser selectively vaporizes smooths surface tonsils technique flattens edges crypts crevices collect debris preventing trapped material forming stones
