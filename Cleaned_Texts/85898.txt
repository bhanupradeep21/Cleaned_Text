fetal hemoglobin foetal haemoglobin also hemoglobin f hbf main oxygen carrier protein human fetus hemoglobin f found fetal red blood cells involved transporting oxygen mothers bloodstream organs tissues fetus produced around weeks pregnancy levels remain high birth baby roughly months hemoglobin f different composition adult forms hemoglobin allowing bind attach oxygen strongly turn enables developing fetus retrieve oxygen mothers bloodstream occurs placenta found mothers newborn levels hemoglobin f gradually decrease reach adult levels less total hemoglobin usually within first year adult forms hemoglobin begin diseases beta thalassemias affect components adult hemoglobin delay process cause hemoglobin f levels higher sickle cell anemia increasing production hemoglobin f used treatment relieve hemoglobin f like adult hemoglobin hemoglobin hemoglobin four subunits chains subunit contains heme group iron element key allowing binding unbinding oxygen hemoglobin f adopt two states oxyhemoglobin bound oxygen deoxyhemoglobin without oxygen hemoglobin f heme groups bind four oxygen composed two α alpha subunits two γ gamma subunits whereas hemoglobin total hemoglobin adults composed two α two β beta subunits humans α subunit encoded chromosome γ subunit encoded chromosome two similar genes code α subunit protein produce identical differ gene regulatory regions determine much protein produced leads contributing respectively total α subunits produced consequence mutations gene expected stronger effect mutations also two similar copies gene coding γ subunit protein produced slightly different one protein unit codes protein form alanine position whereas codes glycine see archived wayback machine major repressor proteins hemoglobin f production binding gene coding γ subunit promoter happens naturally newborn baby starts switch producing hemoglobin f producing hemoglobin genetic diseases take place due mutations genes coding components hemoglobin f mutations genes cause mutations promoter regions cause hemoglobin f still produced switch hemoglobin occurred called hereditary persistence fetal first months pregnancy main form hemoglobin embryofetus embryonic hemoglobin variants depending types subunits contains production hemoglobin f starts week months onwards becomes main type found fetal red blood switch produce adult forms hemoglobin essentially hemoglobin starts around weeks gestation close expected time birth hemoglobin f accounts infants hemoglobin around months birth hemoglobin becomes predominant type time baby one year old proportions different types hemoglobin expected approximate adult levels hemoglobin f reduced low small proportion red blood cells containing hemoglobin f called fcells also contain types hemoglobin healthy adults composition hemoglobin hemoglobin hemoglobin hemoglobin f certain genetic abnormalities cause switch adult hemoglobin synthesis fail resulting condition known hereditary persistence fetal hemoglobin four hemes oxygenbinding parts hemoglobin similar hemoglobin f types hemoglobin including hemoglobin thus key feature allows hemoglobin f bind strongly oxygen γ subunits instead β example fact naturally existing molecules body bind hemoglobin change binding affinity oxygen one molecules enhances hemoglobins ability release interacts much hemoglobin hemoglobin f adult β subunit positive charges fetal γ subunit attract negative charges due preference hemoglobin hemoglobin f binds oxygen affinity hemoglobin barts abnormal form hemoglobin produced hemoglobin barts syndrome alphathalassemia major severe form alphathalassemia alphathalassemia genetic blood disorder one common hemoglobinrelated diseases affecting production α subunits depending many genes coding α subunit impacted one four patients disease reduced production α subunit hemoglobin consequence less hemoglobin available affects oxygen supply tissues hemoglobin barts syndrome manifests four genes coding α subunit deleted often fatal fetus carrying disorder absence α subunits form hemoglobin four γ subunits hemoglobin barts produced form hemoglobin isnt fit oxygen exchange precisely due high affinity oxygen hemoglobin barts efficient binding oxygen doesnt release oxygen organs disease fatal fetus newborn unless early diagnosis intervention carried pregnancy child dependent lifelong blood transfusions quantify strongly certain type hemoglobin binds oxygen affinity oxygen parameter called often used given situation understood partial pressure oxygen hb example hemoglobin f lower hemoglobin means amount hemoglobin f hemoglobin blood add oxygen half hemoglobin f bind oxygen half hemoglobin manages therefore lower means stronger binding higher affinity oxygen reference fetal hemoglobin roughly mmhg measure pressure whereas adult hemoglobin approximately mmhg see blood gas pregnancy mothers circulatory system delivers oxygen nutrients fetus carries away nutrientdepleted blood enriched carbon dioxide maternal fetal blood circulations separate exchange molecules occurs placenta region called intervillous space located maternal fetal blood focusing oxygen exchange three important aspects allow oxygen pass maternal circulation fetal circulation firstly presence hemoglobin f fetus allows stronger binding oxygen maternal hemoglobin see factors affecting oxygen affinity secondly mothers bloodstream richer oxygen fetus oxygen naturally flows towards fetal circulation final factor related effects ph maternal fetal hemoglobin maternal blood acquires carbon dioxide becomes acidic favors release oxygen maternal hemoglobin time decrease carbon dioxide fetal blood makes alkaline favors uptake oxygen called bohr effect haldane effect also happens air exchange three factors present simultaneously cooperate improve fetus access oxygen mother fcells subpopulation red blood cells contain hemoglobin f amongst types hemoglobin common fetuses normal adults around red blood cells contain hemoglobin low percentage fcells adults owes two factors low levels hemoglobin f present tendency produced subset cells rather evenly distributed amongst red blood cells fact positive correlation levels hemoglobin f number fcells patients higher percentages hemoglobin f also higher proportion despite correlations hemoglobin f levels fcell numbers usually determined direct measurements amount hemoglobin f calculated using cell lysates fluids contents cells broken open fcell numbers done counting intact red blood due correlation amount hemoglobin f fcells fcell numbers higher inherited hemoglobin disorders including betathalassemia sickle cell anemia hereditary persistence fetal hemoglobin additionally acquired conditions also higher fcell numbers acute erythropoietic stress response poor oxygenation includes rapid synthesis new red blood cells fcells similar mass haemoglobin per cell compared red blood cells without haemoglobin f measured mean cell haemoglobin values significant increase hemoglobin f levels early pregnancy however clear whether levels stable decrease pregnancy goes different sources reported different increase hemoglobin f induces fold increase number fcells pregnant women observed week however reason increase hemoglobin f levels pregnant women doesnt seem conclusive evidence early study suggested maternal red blood cells switch hemoglobin f production recent literature suggested increase haemoglobin f could least part due fetal red blood cells transferred maternal presence high levels hemoglobin f pregnant women impact growth fetus fetal red blood cells struggle compete oxygen mothers circulation instead competing hemoglobin weaker association oxygen hemoglobin f becomes competition fetal maternal hemoglobin

hemoglobin f persists twelve months life adulthood result hemoglobin f present higher number adult red blood cells doesnt present symptoms usually discovered screening bloodrelated diseases condition genes coding γ subunit suppressed shortly birth happen mutation occurs promoter region preventing binding proteins proteins would normally bind suppress production γ subunits cant bind due mutation γ subunits continue two types patients hpfh either one normal copy gene one disease form two disease copies whereas normal adults less hemoglobin f patients one disease gene patients two disease copies hemoglobin f red blood diseases sickle cell disease could also cause higher level hemoglobin f present sometimes delta betathalassemia rare genetic blood disorder production δ β subunits reduced absent cases production γ subunit increases compensate loss δ β subunits resulting higher amount hemoglobin f present blood normally people two sets genes producing δ β subunits people one set working genes dont get symptoms rarely reported cases sets genes affected patients experienced mild discovery hemoglobin f alleviated symptoms sickle cell disease occurred janet watson observed red blood cells infants disease took longer sickle deform much compared mothers cells carried disease trait later noted patients sickle cell trait well hereditary persistence hemoglobin f hpfh didnt additionally sickle cell patients fcells found long living nonf cells contain hemoglobin f fetal hemoglobin production switched birth normal children begin producing adult hemoglobin hba children sicklecell disease begin producing defective form hemoglobin called hemoglobin instead form chains cause red blood cells change shape round defective red blood cells much shorter life span normal red blood cells days compared also greater tendency clump together block small blood vessels preventing blood supply tissues organs leads socalled vasoocclusive crisis hallmark fetal hemoglobin remains relatively high birth number painful episodes decreases patients sicklecell disease better fetal hemoglobins role reducing disease severity comes ability disrupt formation hemoglobin chains within red
