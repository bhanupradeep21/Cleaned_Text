see next section according limerence theory posited psychologist dorothy tennov certain percentage couples may go called limerent reaction one pair may experience state passion mixed continuous intrusive thinking fear rejection hope hence human romantic relationships one three varieties bonds may form defined set duration time relation experience nonexperience limerence constitution bonds may vary course relationship ways may either increase decrease intensity limerence characteristic delineation made tennov based research interviews people human bonded relationships divided three varieties defined amount limerence nonlimerence partner contributes relationship british developmental psychologist john bowlby published paper nature childs tie mother precursory concepts attachment theory developed included development concept affectional bond based universal tendency humans attach ie seek closeness another person feel secure person present attachment theory origins observation experiments animals also based observations children missed typical experiences adult care much early research attachment humans done john bowlby associates bowlby proposed babies inbuilt need birth make emotional attachments ie bonds increases chances survival ensuring receive care bowlby describe mutuality attachment stated attachment mother pathological inversion described behaviors infant many developmental specialists elaborated bowlbys ethological observations however neither bowlbys proximity seeking possible human infants prior walking subsequent descriptions mutuality emotional availability synchrony emotional modulation include enduring motivation attachment adult life enduring motivation desire control pleasantly surprising transformation route belief effectiveness humanscitation needed motivation accounts curiosity intellectual growth language mathematics logic emotional base human bonds maternal bond relationship one strongest maternal bond begins develop pregnancy following pregnancy production oxytocin lactation increases parasympathetic activity thus reducing anxiety theoretically fostering bonding generally understood maternal oxytocin circulation predispose mammals show caregiving behavior response young species breastfeeding reported foster early postpartum maternal bond via touch response mutual extensive claims effect breastfeeding made margaret ribble champion infant challenged claimed effect universal bottlefeeding mothers generally appropriately concerned babies difficult determine extent causality due number confounding variables varied reasons families choose different feeding methods many believe early bonding ideally increases response sensitivity childs needs bolstering quality many exceptions found highly successful bonds even though early breastfeeding occur premature infants may lack necessary sucking strength successfully breastfed research following bowlbys observations created concern whether adoptive parents missed crucial period childs development however research regarding mental social life babies suggested parentinfant system rather bond biologically related individuals evolved fit innate behavior patterns human infants equally evolved responses human adults infant behaviors thus nature ensures initial flexibility respect particular adults take parental contrast maternal bond paternal bonds tend vary span childs development terms strength stability fact many children grow fatherless households experience paternal bond general paternal bonding dominant later childs life language develops fathers may influential play interactions opposed nurturance interactions bonds also tend develop respect topics political views money whereas bonds tend develop relation topics religious views general outlooks researcher northwestern university illinois found progesterone hormone usually associated pregnancy maternal bonding may also control way men react towards children specifically found lack progesterone reduced aggressive behavior male mice stimulated act fatherly way towards bond occur people domestic wild animals cat pet birds outside ones window phrase humananimal bond also known

department defense based humananimal bonding determined improvement enrichment life animals closely involved study tested blood levels noticed rise oxytocin humans animals participated oxytocin ability lower stress heart rate fear levels humans historically animals domesticated functional use example dogs herding tracking cats killing mice rats today western societies function primarily bonding example current studies show dogs sleep owners night bedroom either moreover past majority cats kept outside barn cats whereas today cats kept indoors housecats considered part family currently us example billion animals kept pets primarily bonding addition research institutions looking potential benefits evidence variety species hormones oxytocin vasopressin involved bonding process forms prosocial reproductive behavior chemicals facilitate pair bonding maternal behavior experiments laboratory animals humans evidence oxytocin vasopressin released labor breastfeeding events associated maternal bonding according one model social isolation leads stress associated activity hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis release cortisol positive social interaction associated increased oxytocin leads bonding also associated higher levels oxytocin vasopressin reduced stress stressrelated oxytocin associated higher levels trust laboratory studies humans called cuddle chemical role facilitating trust reward centers limbic system neurotransmitter dopamine may interact oxytocin increase likelihood bonding one team researchers argued oxytocin plays secondary role affiliation endogenous opiates play central role according model affiliation function brain systems underlying reward memory vast majority research done majority findings must taken caution applied humans one studies looked influence hormones human bonding compared control group participants recently fallen love differences hormones measured including lh estradiol progesterone dheas androstenedione testosterone fsh lower men recently fallen love also difference blood cortisol sexes higher levels group love differences disappeared months may reflect temporary stress arousal new prolactin peptide hormone primarily produced anterior pituitary prolactin affects reproduction lactation humans nonhuman mammals also thought mediate formation social bonds mothers infants much like hormone addition prolactins role formation social bonds thought involved romantic attachment especially early stages prolactin may also act mediate wellbeing positive effects close relationships ones health alters individuals neuroendocrine system increase probability forming strong social bond without requiring long gestation periods may enable bonding mother child cases prolactin also influence maternal paternal behavior administration prolactin female rats initiates maternal behavior bird fish fathers increase paternal behavior whereas antagonists prolactin decrease paternal human studies fathers higher prolactin concentrations alert nurturing towards infants different study fathers infants observed sixmonths period child born researchers found fathers higher prolactin levels likely facilitate play infant moreover following birth child prolactin promotes bonding father newborn prolactin levels also increase socially stressful situations humans seen administering trier social stress test tsst measuring blood serum prolactin concentrations tsst widely accepted stress test research subject undergoes mock job interview mental arithmetic task front threeperson committee test proven simulate social psychological administration test significantly higher prolactin levels observed serum large variation amount prolactin levels increase different individuals however effect
