species concept framework differentiating different species least recognized species concepts difficulty reconciling various definitions collectively called species species concept works well sexually reproducing organisms birds may useless species reproduce asexually bacteria scientific study species problem called one common sometimes difficult question best decide species organism belongs reproductively isolated groups may readily recognizable cryptic species may present continuum reproductive isolation interbreeding panmixis unlimited interbreeding populations move forward backwards along continuum point meeting criteria one another species concept failing others many debates species touch philosophical issues nominalism realism issues language cognition current meaning phrase species problem quite different charles darwin others meant early darwin species problem question new species arose darwin however one first people question welldefined species given constantly change much struck entirely vague arbitrary distinction species varieties idea organism reproduces giving birth similar organism producing seeds grow similar organism goes back earliest days farming people tended think relatively stable process many thought change possible term species used term sort kind organism john ray introduced biological concept species distinguished always producing species fixed permanent though considerable variation possible within carolus linnaeus formalized taxonomic rank species devised two part naming system binomial nomenclature use today however prevent disagreements best way identify species history definitions term needed reveals seeds modern species debate alive growing long darwin example linnaeus saw species eternally fixed first publication years later stated hybridization way speciation could charles darwins famous book origin species offered explanation species evolve given enough time although darwin provide details species split two viewed speciation gradual process darwin correct new incipient species forming must period time yet distinct enough recognized species darwins theory suggested often going objective fact matter whether one two species darwins book triggered crisis uncertainty biologists objectivity species came wonder whether individual species could objectively real ie existence independent human mendels theory inheritance darwins theory evolution natural selection joined called modern synthesis conjunction theories also large impact biologists think species edward poulton anticipated many ideas species today well accepted later fully developed theodosius dobzhansky ernst mayr two architects modern dobzhanskys articulated genetic processes occur incipient species beginning diverge particular dobzhansky described critical role formation new species evolution reproductive isolation ernst mayrs book turning point species wrote different investigators approach species identification characterized approaches species concepts argued came called biological species concept bsc species consists populations organisms reproduce one another reproductively isolated populations though first define species basis reproductive example mayr discusses buffon proposed kind definition species theodosius dobzhansky contemporary mayr author classic book evolutionary origins reproductive barriers species published years many biologists credit dobzhansky mayr jointly emphasizing reproductive mayrs book two dozen species concepts introduced phylogenetic species concept psc designed useful bsc describing species many authors professed solve dissolve species argued species problem multidimensional solved one since others argued concepts intended help describe species helped resolve species although mayr promoted bsc use systematics systematists criticized others bsc preferred definition species many geneticists work speciation prefer bsc emphasizes role reproductive argued bsc natural consequence effect sexual reproduction dynamics natural realism context species problem philosophical position species real mindindependent entities natural kinds mayr proponent realism attempted demonstrate species exist natural extramental categories showed example new guinean tribesman classify species birds western ornithologists came independently recognize always thought devastating refutation nominalistic claims mentioned fact primitive natives new guinea stone age culture recognize species exactly entities nature western taxonomists species something purely arbitrary would totally improbable representatives two drastically different cultures arrive identical species mayrs argument however criticized fact independently observing humans see much species nature show species real rather nominal categories shows human brains wired similar perceptual cluster statistic ridley view humans might wired differently different species might wired differently us one wiring said true another position realism natural kinds demarcated world unique property shared members species none outside group words natural kind possesses essential intrinsic feature essence selfindividuating nonarbitrary notion heavily criticized essentialist modern realists argued biological natural kinds essences need fixed prone change according mayr reproductive isolation interbreeding supplies objective yardstick completely nonarbitrary criterion describing presence absence relationship makes species concept bsc defines species groups actually potentially interbreeding natural populations reproductively isolated perspective species based property reproductive isolation shared organisms species objectively distinguishes philosophical variants nominalism propose species names people assigned groups creatures lines species get drawn reflect fundamental underlying biological cutoff point view kinds things people given names reflect underlying reality follows species exist outside mind species named abstractions species real would sensible talk origin species evolution species recently least authors adopted view wrote species counterpoint nominalist views regard species raised michael ghiselin argued individual species type rather actual individual actual idea comes thinking species evolving dynamic population viewed entity species would exist regardless whether people observed whether given name popular alternative view pragmatism espoused philosophers philip kitcher john dupr√© states species exist sense natural kinds conceptually real exist convenience practical example regardless definition species one uses one still quantitatively compare species diversity across regions decades long definition held constant within study practical importance advancing biodiversity science environmental science nominalist critique view kinds things exist raises consideration role humans play species problem example haldane suggested species mental several authors noted similarity species word ambiguous meaning points made wittgenstein family resemblance concepts indeterminacy jody hey described species problem result two conflicting motivations first view species appear us typical natural kinds biologists turn understand species evolutionarily revealed changeable without sharp boundaries hey argued unrealistic expect one definition species going serve need categorization still reflect changeable realities evolving species many approaches species problem attempted develop one single common conception species identified thought monistic description species could developed agreed upon species problem would solved contrast authors botanist brent mishler argued pluralism claiming biologists one shared concept species accept multiple seemingly incompatible ideas david hull however argued pluralist proposals unlikely actually solve species httpsenwikipediaorgwikispeciesconcept
