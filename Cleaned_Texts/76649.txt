neuronal sprouting process neurite growth occurs typically modifications neuron outgrowths establish connections growth new branches extensions existing neurons response injury disease process form neuroplasticity allows brain rewire adapt changes environment neural sprouting thought play important role recovery brain injury brain compensates lost function forming new connections neurons neural sprouting new branches formed existing neurons extend towards areas injury disease new branches form new connections neurons allowing brain redirect inputs undamaged areas compensate loss function damaged neural sprouting beneficial process recovery brain injury also negative effects cases example certain neurodegenerative conditions alzheimers disease abnormal sprouting neurons may contribute spread disease neuronal death therefore neural sprouting important form neuroplasticity complex process positive negative effects depending specific circumstances nature injury disease httpsenwikipediaorgwikineuronalsprouting
