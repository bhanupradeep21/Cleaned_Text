burning mouth syndrome bms burning tingling scalding sensation mouth lasting least four six months underlying known dental medical related signs disease found people burning mouth syndrome may also subjective xerostomia dry mouth sensation cause found reduced salivary flow paraesthesia altered sensation tingling mouth altered sense taste burning sensation mouth symptom another disease local systemic factors found implicated considered burning mouth syndrome medically unexplained international association study pain defines burning mouth syndrome distinctive nosological entity characterized unremitting oral burning similar pain absence detectable mucosal burning pain tongue oral mucous international headache society defines intraoral burning sensation medical dental cause ensure correct diagnosis burning mouth syndrome research diagnostic criteria rdcbms insufficient evidence leaves unclear effective treatments definition bms signs sometimes affected persons attribute symptoms sores mouth fact normal anatomic structures eg lingual papillae symptoms bms variable typical clinical picture given considered according socrates pain assessment method see table clinical signs visible another explanation burning sensation may present erythema redness edema swelling papillae tip tongue may sign tongue habitually pressed teeth number size filiform papillae may reduced tongue red smooth likely local systemic cause eg erythematous candidiasis cases burning mouth sensation identifiable cause cases termed primary several theories causes bms proposed supported varying degrees evidence none people bms postmenopausal women one theory cause bms estrogen progesterone deficit strong statistical correlation another theory bms related autoimmunity abnormal antinuclear antibody rheumatoid factor found serum persons bms levels may also seen elderly people symptoms whilst salivary flow rates normal clinical signs dry mouth explain complaint dry mouth levels salivary proteins phosphate may elevated salivary ph buffering capacity may depression anxiety strongly associated known depression cause result bms depression may develop setting constant unrelieved irritation pain sleep estimated bms cases involve psychogenic consider bms psychosomatic caused concern sexually transmitted chronic lowgrade trauma due parafunctional habits eg rubbing tongue teeth pressing palate may bms common persons parkinsons disease suggested disorder reduced pain threshold increased sensitivity often people bms unusually raised taste sensitivity termed hypergeusia super dysgeusia usually bitter metallic taste present people bms factor led concept defect sensory peripheral neural changes oral environment changes composition saliva may induce neuropathy interruption nerve onset bms often spontaneous although may gradual sometimes correlation major life event stressful period women onset bms likely three twelve years following metals plastics several local systemic factors give burning sensation mouth without clinical signs therefore may misdiagnosed bms sources state identifiable cause burning sensation termed secondary bms distinguish primary however accepted definitions bms hold identifiable causes identifiable causes term bms causes burning mouth sensation may accompanied clinical signs mouth elsewhere body example burning mouth pain may symptom allergic contact stomatitis contact sensitivity type iv hypersensitivity reaction oral tissues common substances sodium lauryl sulfate cinnamaldehyde dental however allergic contact stomatitis accompanied visible lesions gives positive response patch testing acute short term exposure allergen substance triggering allergic response causes nonspecific inflammation possibly mucosal ulceration chronic long term exposure allergen may appear chronic inflammatory lichenoid lesions resembling oral lichen planus plasma cell gingivitis may accompanied glossitis apart bms full list causes oral burning sensation given bms diagnosis exclusion ie explanations symptoms ruled diagnosis clinically useful investigations would help support diagnosis definition tests would normal blood tests urinalysis may useful rule anemia deficiency states hypothyroidism diabetes investigation dry mouth symptom may involve sialometry objectively determines reduction salivary flow rate hyposalivation oral candidiasis tested use swabs smears oral rinse saliva suggested allergy testing eg patch test inappropriate absence clear history clinical signs people burning sensation diagnosis people burning symptom may also involve psychologic screening eg depression second edition international classification headache disorders lists diagnostic criteria glossodynia sore mouth burning sensation mouth may primary ie burning mouth syndrome secondary systemic local sources refer secondary bms similar definition ie burning sensation caused local systemic oral burning explained clinical however contradicts accepted definition bms specifies cause identified secondary bms could therefore considered misnomer bms example dysesthesia distortion consider bms variant atypical facial recently bms described one recognizable symptom complexes chronic facial pain along atypical facial pain temporomandibular joint dysfunction atypical bms subdivided three general types type two common type three least types one two unremitting symptoms whereas type three may show remitting sometimes terms specific tongue eg glossodynia reserved burning sensation located cause identified burning sensation mouth treatment underlying factor recommended symptom persist despite treatment diagnosis bms bms traditionally treated reassurance antidepressants anxiolytics anticonvulsants cochrane review treatment burning mouth syndrome concluded strong evidence effective treatment however systematic review found use antidepressants alphalipoic acids gave promising treatments used include atypical antipsychotics histamine receptor antagonists dopamine supplementation vitamin complexes cognitive behavioral therapy may helpful management burning mouth bms benign importantly symptom oral cancer cause chronic pain poorly controlled detriment quality life may become fixation ignored thus interfering work daily two thirds people bms spontaneous partial recovery six seven years initial onset others condition recovery often preceded change character symptom constant clinical factors predicting recovery identifiable cause burning sensation psychologic dysfunctions anxiety depression often disappear symptom successfully bms fairly uncommon worldwide affecting five individuals per general people bms likely middle aged elderly females three seven times likely bms report female male ratio much bms reported
