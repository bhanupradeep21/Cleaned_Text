status podokesaurus due specimen lost retained name podokesauridae paleontologists timothy rowe jacques gauthier considered podokesauridae taxonomic wastebasket wherein taxa grouped based phenetic resemblance stratigraphic division therefore continuous revision instability considered possible podokesaurus natural cast specimen coelophysis found similarities shared exclusively ancestral features among theropods therefore agreed name podokesaurus restricted holotype natural cast considered theropoda incertae volume paleontologist david b norman agreed assessment stated features used unite podokesaurus coelophysis merely confirm dinosaurs rather establish specific relation paleontologist thomas r holtz agreed family name podokesauridae replaced coelophysidae time idea small theropods
