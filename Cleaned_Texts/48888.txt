applications main ideas evolution may summarised follows century natural history collections museums popular european expansion naval expeditions employed naturalists curators grand museums showcased preserved live specimens varieties life charles darwin english graduate educated trained disciplines natural history natural historians would collect catalogue describe study vast collections specimens stored managed curators museums darwin served ships naturalist board hms beagle assigned fiveyear research expedition around world voyage observed collected abundance organisms interested diverse forms life along coasts south america neighbouring gal√°pagos darwin gained extensive experience collected studied natural history life forms distant places studies formulated idea species developed ancestors similar features described process called natural selection would make size population depends much many resources able support population remain size year year must equilibrium balance population size available resources since organisms produce offspring environment support individuals survive generation must competitive struggle resources aid survival result darwin realised chance alone determined survival instead survival organism depends differences individual organism traits aid hinder survival reproduction welladapted individuals likely leave offspring less welladapted competitors traits hinder survival reproduction would disappear generations traits help organism survive reproduce would accumulate generations darwin realised unequal ability individuals survive reproduce could cause gradual changes population used term natural selection describe observations variations animals plants formed basis theory natural selection example darwin observed orchids insects close relationship allows pollination plants noted orchids variety structures attract insects pollen flowers gets stuck insects bodies way insects transport pollen male female orchid spite elaborate appearance orchids specialised parts made basic structures make flowers book fertilisation orchids darwin proposed orchid flowers adapted preexisting parts natural darwin still researching experimenting ideas natural selection received letter alfred russel wallace describing theory similar led immediate joint publication theories wallace darwin saw history life like family tree fork trees limbs common ancestor tips limbs represented modern species branches represented common ancestors shared amongst many different species explain relationships darwin said living things related meant life must descended forms even single common ancestor called process descent darwin published theory evolution natural selection origin species theory means life including humanity product continuing natural processes implication life earth common ancestor met objections religious groups objections contrast level support theory percent within scientific community natural selection commonly equated survival fittest expression originated herbert spencers principles biology five years charles darwin published original works survival fittest describes process natural selection incorrectly natural selection survival always fittest darwins theory natural selection laid groundwork modern evolutionary theory experiments observations showed organisms populations varied variations inherited differences could acted natural selection however could explain source variations like many predecessors darwin mistakenly thought heritable traits product use disuse features acquired organisms lifetime could passed offspring looked examples large ground feeding birds getting stronger legs exercise weaker wings flying like ostrich could fly misunderstanding called inheritance acquired characters part theory transmutation species put forward jeanbaptiste lamarck late century theory became known lamarckism darwin produced unsuccessful theory called pangenesis try explain acquired characteristics could inherited august weismanns experiments indicated changes use disuse could inherited lamarckism gradually fell missing information needed help explain new features could pass parent offspring provided pioneering genetics work gregor mendel mendels experiments several generations pea plants demonstrated inheritance works separating reshuffling hereditary information formation sex cells recombining information fertilisation like mixing different hands playing cards organism getting random mix half cards one parent half cards mendel called information factors however later became known genes genes basic units heredity living organisms contain information directs physical development behaviour organisms genes made dna dna long molecule made individual molecules called nucleotides genetic information encoded sequence nucleotides make dna sequence letters words carries information page genes like short instructions built letters dna alphabet put together entire set genes gives enough information serve instruction manual build run organism instructions spelled dna alphabet changed however mutations may alter instructions carried within genes within cell genes carried chromosomes packages carrying dna reshuffling chromosomes results unique combinations genes offspring since genes interact one another development organism novel combinations genes produced sexual reproduction increase genetic variability population even without new genetic variability population also increase members population interbreed individuals different population causing gene flow populations introduce genes population present evolution random process although mutations dna random natural selection process chance environment determines

life example fleas wingless parasites descended winged ancestral scorpionfly snakes lizards longer require pythons still grow tiny structures remains ancestors hind organisms merely outcome variations succeed fail dependent upon environmental conditions time rapid environmental changes typically cause species existed earth percent since life began earth five major mass extinctions led large sudden drops variety species recent extinction event occurred million years genetic drift cause allelic frequency change within populations species alleles different variations specific genes determine things like hair colour skin tone eye colour blood type words genetic traits vary individuals genetic drift introduce new alleles population reduce variation within population removing allele gene pool genetic drift caused random sampling alleles truly random sample sample outside forces affect selected like pulling marbles size weight different colours brown paper bag offspring alleles present samples previous generations alleles chance plays role whether individual survives reproduce pass sample generation onward next allelic frequency population ratio copies one specific allele share form compared number forms allele present genetic drift affects smaller populations affects larger principle states certain idealised conditions including absence selection pressures large population change frequency alleles generations population satisfies conditions said equilibrium particular hardy weinberg showed dominant recessive alleles automatically tend become less frequent respectively thought previously conditions hardyweinberg equilibrium include must mutations immigration emigration directly change allelic frequencies additionally mating must totally random males females cases equally desirable mates ensures true random mixing population equilibrium analogous deck cards matter many times deck shuffled new cards added old ones taken away cards deck represent alleles populations gene pool practice population perfect hardyweinberg equilibrium populations finite size combined natural selection many effects cause allelic frequencies change time population bottleneck occurs population species reduced drastically short period time due external true population bottleneck reduction favour combination alleles totally random chance individuals survive bottleneck reduce eliminate genetic variation population drift events bottleneck event also reduce populations genetic diversity lack diversity created make population risk selective common example population bottleneck northern elephant seal due excessive hunting throughout century population northern elephant seal reduced individuals less made full recovery total number individuals around growing effects bottleneck visible however seals likely serious problems disease genetic disorders almost diversity founder effect occurs small group one population splits forms new population often geographic isolation new populations allelic frequency probably different original populations change common certain alleles populations founders population determine genetic makeup potentially survival new population one example founder effect found amish migration pennsylvania two founders colony pennsylvania carried recessive allele creveld syndrome amish tend religious isolates interbreed generations practice frequency creveld syndrome amish people much higher frequency general modern evolutionary synthesis based concept populations organisms significant genetic variation caused mutation

life closely related groups done comparing structure adult organisms different species comparing patterns cells grow divide even migrate organisms development taxonomy branch biology names classifies living things scientists use morphological genetic similarities assist categorising life forms based ancestral relationships example orangutans gorillas chimpanzees humans belong taxonomic grouping referred case family called hominidae animals grouped together similarities morphology come common ancestry called strong evidence evolution comes analysis homologous structures structures different species longer perform task share similar case forelimbs mammals forelimbs human cat whale bat strikingly similar bone structures however four species forelimbs performs different task bones construct bats wings used flight also construct whales flippers used swimming design makes little sense unrelated uniquely constructed particular tasks theory evolution explains homologous structures four animals shared common ancestor undergone change many generations changes structure produced forelimbs adapted different however anatomical comparisons misleading anatomical similarities indicate close relationship organisms share similar environments often develop similar physical features process known convergent evolution sharks dolphins similar body forms yet distantly fish dolphins mammals similarities result populations exposed selective pressures within groups changes aid swimming favoured thus time developed similar appearances morphology even though closely cases anatomical

biogeography especially biogeography oceanic islands played key role convincing darwin alfred russel wallace species evolved branching pattern common islands often contain endemic species species

wide acceptance among biologists apply organisms bacteria reproduce asexually speciation lineagesplitting event results two separate species forming single common ancestral widely accepted method speciation called allopatric speciation allopatric speciation begins population becomes geographically geological processes emergence mountain ranges formation canyons flooding land bridges changes
