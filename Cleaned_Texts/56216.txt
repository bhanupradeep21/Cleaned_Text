medical treatment involves replacing absent involves taking synthetic corticosteroid hydrocortisone medications usually taken lifelong continuous steroid replacement therapy required regular followup treatment monitoring health highsalt diet may also useful symptoms worsen injection corticosteroid recommended people need carry dose often large amounts intravenous fluids sugar dextrose also appropriate treatment longterm outcomes typically people able lead reasonably normal without treatment adrenal crisis result addisons disease affects per people developed occurs frequently middleaged

diagnosis male adrenal insufficiency diagnosis made blood test detect longchain fatty treatment addisons disease involves replacing missing cortisol sometimes form hydrocortisone tablets prednisone tablets dosing regimen mimics physiological concentrations cortisol alternatively onequarter much prednisolone may used equal glucocorticoid effect hydrocortisone treatment usually lifelong addition many people require fludrocortisone replacement missing people addisons often advised carry information eg form medicalert bracelet information card attention emergency medical services personnel might need attend needle syringe injectable form cortisol also recommended carried people addisons disease advised increase medication periods illness undergoing surgery dental immediate medical attention needed severe infections vomiting diarrhea occur conditions precipitate addisonian crisis person vomiting may require injections hydrocortisone low aldosterone levels may also benefit highsodium diet may also beneficial people addisons disease increase dietary intake calcium vitamin high dosages corticosteroids linked osteoporosis may necessary bone sources calcium include dairy products leafy greens fortified flours among many others vitamin obtained sun oily fish red meat egg yolks among many others though many sources obtain vitamin diet supplements also optioncitation needed standard therapy involves intravenous injections glucocorticoids large volumes intravenous saline solution dextrose glucose treatment usually brings rapid improvement intravenous access immediately available intramuscular injection glucocorticoids used person take fluids medications mouth amount glucocorticoids decreased maintenance dose reached aldosterone deficient maintenance therapy also includes oral doses fludrocortisone outcomes typically good treated people expect live relatively normal lives someone disease observant symptoms addisons crisis body strained rigorous
