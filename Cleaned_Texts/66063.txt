behavioral economics proposes search heuristics aid evaluating options motivated fact costly gain information options aims maximise utility searching information heuristic wholistic explanation search process alone combination heuristics may used decisionmaking process three primary search heuristics satisficing satisficing idea minimum requirement search met stop searching satisficing person may optimal option ie one highest utility would good enough one heuristic may problematic aspiration level set level products exist could meet requirements directed cognition directed cognition search heuristic person treats opportunity research information last rather contingent plan indicates done based results search directed cognition considers one search conducted alternative researched elimination aspects whereas satisficing directed cognition compare choices elimination aspects compares certain qualities person using elimination aspects heuristic first chooses quality value searching sets aspiration level may repeated refine search ie identify second valued quality set aspiration level using heuristic options eliminated fail meet minimum requirements chosen besides searching behavioral economists psychologists identified heuristics cognitive effects affect peoples decision making include mental accounting mental accounting refers propensity allocate resources specific purposes mental accounting behavioral bias causes one separate money different categories known mental accounts either based source intention anchoring anchoring describes people mental reference point compare results example person anticipates weather particular day would raining finds day actually clear blue skies would gain utility pleasant weather anticipated would herd behavior relatively simple bias reflects tendency people mimic everyone else follow general consensus framing effects people tend choose differently depending options presented people tend little control susceptibility framing effect often choicemaking process based heuristics tactics mental shortcuts aid decisionmaking process people also affected number biases fallacies behavioral economics identifies number biases negatively affect decision making present bias present bias reflects human tendency want rewards sooner describes people likely forego greater payoff future favour receiving smaller benefit sooner example smoker trying quit although know future suffer health consequences immediate gain nicotine hit favourable person affected present bias present bias commonly split people aware present bias sophisticated gamblers fallacy gamblers fallacy stems law small belief event occurred often past less likely occur future despite probability remaining constant example coin flipped three times turned heads every single time person influenced gamblers fallacy would predict next one ought tails abnormal number heads flipped past even though probability heads occurring still hot hand fallacy hot hand fallacy opposite gamblers fallacy belief event occurred often past likely occur future streak continue fallacy particularly common within sport example football team consistently last games participated often said form thus expected football team maintain winning narrative fallacy narrative fallacy refers people use narratives connect dots random events make sense arbitrary information term stems nassim talebs book black swan impact highly improbable narrative fallacy problematic lead individuals making false causeeffect relationships example startup may get funding investors swayed narrative sounds plausible rather reasoned analysis available loss aversion loss aversion refers tendency place greater weight losses compared equivalent gains words means individual receives loss cause utility decline samesized means far likely try assign higher priority avoiding losses making investment gains result investors might want higher payout compensate losses high payout likely might try avoid losses altogether even investments risk acceptable rational recency bias recency bias belief particular outcome probably simply occurred example previous one two flips heads person affected recency bias would continue predict heads would confirmation bias confirmation bias tendency prefer information consistent ones beliefs discount evidence inconsistent familiarity bias familiarity bias simply describes tendency people return know comfortable familiarity bias discourages affected people exploring new options may limit ability find optimal status quo bias status
