deception certainly intentional even involve methods camouflage physically parallel camouflage methods used animals mitchell lists four levels deception four levels found biological world including

deception mimicry similarity one species another protects one similarity appearance behaviour sound scent location mimics found similar places models many forms mimicry individual example may fall one recognised categories defensive protective mimicry takes place organisms able avoid encounters would harmful deceiving enemies appearing something example mantis shrimp typically spread front limbs known smashers threaten rivals behaviour called meral newly moulted mantis shrimps frequently deceive potential competitors spreading front limbs even though stillsoft exoskeletons meant could use smashers without damaging batesian mimicry form mimicry typified situation harmless species evolved imitate warning signals harmful species directed common predator harmful species model might spines stingers toxic chemistry apparent double defence resembling unpalatable species protection mimic predators afforded resemblance unpalatable species predator associates certain appearance bad examples batesian mimicry several species butterflies mimic toxic heliconid butterflies another butterfly mimic nontoxic great mormon indonesia female butterfly regardless coloration produce one different female forms mimic five species foultasting butterflies batesian mimicry also found harmless milk snake mimics venomous coral snakes snakes marked alternating yellow red black bands causing potential predators avoid snakes often distinguished using old saying red yellow kill fellow red black friend jack deadly coral snake bands order red yellow black innocuous species pattern red black yellow although deception batesian mimicry need visual may involve senses example moths use highly effective defence bats response hearing ultrasound emitted hunting bats produce loud ultrasonic clicks mimic unpalatable tiger moth case auditory batesian m端llerian mimicry occurs two genuinely unprofitable species come mimic others warning signals unlike case batesian mimicry deception involved typically species share one common predators though may may closely example viceroy butterfly appears similar noxioustasting monarch butterfly although long time thought example batesian mimicry viceroy recently discovered unpalatable monarch making case m端llerian poison dart frogs south america mantella frogs madagascar examples m端llerian mimicry similar conspicuous warning coloration bright colours black markings toxic composition since geographic reasons possibility potential predators encounter species m端llerian mimicry may also use senses example many snakes share auditory warning signals aggressive mimicry mimicking predators parasites harmless species allowing predator approach sometimes attract anglerfish named characteristic method predation anglerfish typically least one long filament illicium sprouting middle head protruding fishs eyes terminating irregular growth flesh esca tip filament filament move directions esca wiggled resemble prey animal thus acting bait lure predators close enough anglerfish devour deepsea anglerfishes bathypelagic zone emit light escas attract prey bioluminescence result symbiosis several turtle species frogmouth catfish tongue extensions lure prey position become easy sal luring predator uses tail movements attract prey form mimicry used several snake speciessuch spidertailed horned viper tail deceits spider thus attracting birds tasselled wobbegong shark well example another example aggressive mimicry males lured toward seems sexually receptive female eaten example fireflies genus photuris emit light signals females genus photinus emit mating signal male fireflies several different genera attracted femmes fatales predatory females identify males species emit signal used female males aggressive mimicry need involve sense vision example assassin bug preys spiders entering web plucking silk threads produces vibrations match pattern vibrations made typical prey caught web causing spider automimicry refers instances one body part animal mimics another may help animal survive attack help predators appear innocuous examples include many moth butterfly fish species eyespots large dark markings help prey escape causing predators attack false target example gray hairstreak strymon melinus shows false head rear better chance surviving attack part attack head another example twoheaded snake central africa tail resembles head snake even moves tail way snakes move adaptation functions deceive prey source attack camouflage use combination materials coloration behaviour helps conceal animal making hard see crypsis disguising something else mimesis several methods achieving crypsis include resemblance surroundings disruptive coloration eliminating shadow selfdecoration cryptic behaviour motion camouflage changeable skin appearance countershading counterillumination transparency silvering reflect environment many species cryptically colored resemble surroundings example uroplatus geckos almost completely invisible even nearby observer similarly katydids group grasshopperlike insects found worldwide nocturnal use cryptic coloration remain unnoticed day remain perfectly still often position increases effectiveness camouflage animals coloration makes highly conspicuous outside normal environment highly cryptic example blue morpho forest butterfly iridescent blue upper wings cm wingspan however underwings dark morpho flies flickering light forest even daylight seems disappear forest species especially mammals use disruptive coloration spotted striped pelage helps break animals outline shade created trees foliage even large mammals leopards jaguars ocelots okapi difficult see disruptive coloration underwater animals adopt wide range methods camouflage including transparency reflection counterillumination countershading selfdecoration fish light bottom dark top blend background viewed top bottom forms camouflage less effective camouflaged animal moves motion easily seen observing predator however insects dragonflies use motion camouflage hoverflies approach possible mates dragonflies approach rivals defending motion camouflage achieved moving stay straight line target fixed point landscape pursuer thus deceives target animal appearing move loom larger targets field katydids evolved wide range camouflage adaptations body colouring shape match

dangerous animals lionfish sea snakes wellresearched form deception feigning death often referred nonspecialists playing dead playing possum although specialists use terms tonic immobility thanatosis wide range animals eg lizards birds rodents sharks behave dead antipredator adaptation predators usually take live beetles artificial selection experiments shown heritable variation length deathfeigning selected longer deathfeigning durations selective advantage shorter durations predator birds often feign death escape predation example tonic immobility quail reduces probability attacks death feigning may also play role reproduction example nursery web spider male sometimes feigns death avoid getting eaten females cases death feigning used predator example predatory cichlid haplochromis livingstoni lies side bottom sediments approached scavengers attracted appears dead fish whereupon h livingstoni abandons pretence rights attacks death feigning behaviour deliberately

cuttlefish might called tactical deception fish sometimes present entirely different displays two different observers male cuttlefish courts female presence males displays male pattern facing female courtship female pattern facing away deceive domestic pigs setting behavior trained animal could reveal source food another animal trained animal spent longer food source pigs anecdotal account reported female marsh harrier courted male obtain access food stored took food fed chicks fathered another male extensive studies focused possibly deceitful behaviour pied flycatcher species males may possess one territory females gain mating male mates males may try deceive females mating status mated unmated females frequently visit male always alone territory probably unmated thus repeated sampling male behaviour females usually able avoid mating previously mated groupforaging common ravens hoard food number places also raid caches made others cachers withdraw conspecifics hiding food usually place caches behind structures sight potential observers raiders remain inconspicuous keeping distance cachers near cache sites within sight response cachers often interrupt caching change cache sites empty caches behaviours suggest ravens withhold information intentions may qualify tactical similarly eurasian jay garrulus glandarius watched another jay tends cache food behind opaque
