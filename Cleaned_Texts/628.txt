general accepted explanations possible causes phenomenon attributed ramón menéndez pidal pointed initiated change substratum summarised theory arguing basques cantabri presumably also iberians whose languages lacked sound f replaced aspiration h acoustically closest sound consistent fact first written traces change appeared northern castile bordered basquespeaking areas even side pyrenees gascony also originally inhabited peoples spoke basque similar language antiquity although change took place regions latin europe castilian gascon languages change consolidated generalized two areas ancient presence basqueaquitanian peoples proven times prior roman conquests theory outlined previous section seems quite reasonable first glance however objections first according knowledge available today known whether aspirated sound h existed medieval basque view uncertainty question may arise whether h really would replaced f according menéndez pidal definitely labiodental bilabial articulation hand certain basque speakers able pronounce labiodental f taking account certain dialects basque previously fricative bilabial evolved labiodental f intervocalic position basque philologist koldo mitxelena basques seem encountered many difficulties pronouncing fairly ancient date another argument basque substrate romance navarre area large number basque speakers initial f preserved therefore presence large basque population important factor one might well consider effect romance navarrese dialect others approached problem general approaches since change f h also appears neolatin language regions related specific basque substratum researchers consider phenomenon explained internal structural causes language would necessary look additional reasons thus according malmberg start fact phenomenon consists loss articulatory feature namely labiality certain areas isolated western romance dialects must necessarily causes initiate change addition theories mentioned professionals analyzed problem abstract aspects example spanish philologist gregorio salvador presented geological hypothesis according main cause phenomenon primitive spanishspeakers lost teeth absence fluorine waters castile león regarding hypothesis several hydrological analyses even carried castile aragon however results revealed significant differences composition waters two regions terms low fluoride content josé ramón maruri university navarra reacted sarcastically gregorio salvadors theory drawing following evident teeth primitive castilians resist destructive action waters fate befall teeth alto aragonese

followers substratist hypotheses opponents tried explain change single simple cause sometimes single factor responsible linguistic change process complex put phenomenon relation basque substratum neither explained detail could act examined circumstances course use expression substratum fortunate case since supposes evolution already took place roman times latin conquerors settled iberian peninsula however available documents sound change must clearly occurred centuries would perhaps accurate speak influence adstratumnot meanwhile opponents substrate theories dismissed possibility bilingualism basqueromance played role change tried explain phenomenon general arguments also appears elsewhere latin europe taken account phonetic evolution caused different reasons different places short said one satisfactorily analyzed complexity phenomenon basqueromanic bilingualism internal structural causes language could intervened realization change another unfortunate problem although new research done since recently results ignored even recent linguistic publications conclusion worth mentioning f appearing current spanish words reintroduced language means learned semilearned forms
