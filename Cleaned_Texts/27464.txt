sauropodomorpha sorəpodəmorfə greek meaning lizardfooted forms extinct clade longnecked herbivorous saurischian dinosaurs includes sauropods ancestral relatives sauropods generally grew large sizes long necks tails quadrupedal became largest animals ever walk earth prosauropods preceded sauropods smaller often able walk two legs sauropodomorphs dominant terrestrial herbivores throughout much mesozoic era origins late triassic approximately decline extinction end cretaceous sauropodomorphs adapted browsing higher contemporary herbivore giving access high tree foliage feeding strategy supported many defining characteristics light tiny skull end long neck ten elongated cervical vertebrae counterbalancing long tail one three extra sacral vertebrae teeth weak shaped like leaves spoons lanceolate spatulate instead grinding teeth stomach stones gastroliths similar gizzard stones montul birds crocodiles help digest tough plant fibers front upper mouth bends may beak one earliest known

hallorum patagotitan argentinosaurus reached metres ft length kilograms us short tons mass initially bipedal size increased evolved fourlegged graviportal gait adapted walking slowly land like elephants early sauropodomorphs likely omnivores shared common ancestor saurischian lineage theropods carnivore therefore evolution herbivory went hand hand increasing size neck length also large
