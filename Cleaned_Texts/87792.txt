historically caused american crow considered nuisance however suspected harm crops offset service american crow provides eating insect american crows socially monogamous cooperative breeding birds mated pairs form large families individuals several breeding seasons remain together many offspring previous nesting season usually remain family assist rearing new nestlings american crows reach breeding age least two leave nest breed four five nesting season starts early birds incubating eggs early american crows build bulky stick nests nearly always trees sometimes also large bushes rarely ground nest wide variety trees including large conifers although oaks often used three six eggs laid incubated days young usually fledged days hatching predation primarily occurs nest site eggs nestlings frequently eaten snakes raccoons ravens domestic cats adults less frequently predated face potential attack great horned owls redtailed hawks peregrine falcons eagles may attacked predators
