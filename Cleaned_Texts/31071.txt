educate people behaviour puts risk becoming highest risk contracting disease cat behaviors include licked sharing food sharing kitchen utensils kissing sleeping young elderly immunocompromised increase risk becoming infected sleeping cats dogs cdc recommends cat owners allow cat lick face result disease transmission someone licked face mucous membranes open wound risk infection reduced area
