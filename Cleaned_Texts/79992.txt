outbreak salmonella took place places worldwide strains identified general united states alone experiences million cases salmonellosis per europe although around incidents salmonellosis reported annually steady decrease cases past four exact number infected impossible know cases reported reported cases classified foodborne disease outbreaks centers disease control prevention cdc two people get illness contaminated food zoonotic outbreaks two people get illness pet various strains serotypes salmonella bacteria related outbreaks united states infected people killed europe european centre disease prevention control ecdc reported cases salmonella infection cases related cases salmonella bacteria found almost product animal exposed fecal exposures occur crops grown wastebased fertilizers food items handled infected salmonellosis intestinal disease meaning bacteria must ingested processed intestines order infection thus salmonellosis commonly spread humans ingestion contaminated food also spread contact reptiles birds usually person handles animal environment without handwashing immediately touches mouth food infected usually develop symptoms anywhere hours first contact salmonella bacteria require serious medical salmonellosis displays humans fever abdominal pain nausea commonly diarrhea period requiring hospitalization usually dehydrated extreme diarrhea turn deadly especially salmonella bacteria reaches elderly young children weakened immune systems risk developing salmonellosis severe common serotypes salmonella united states europe enteritidis outbreak one

united cdc classify outbreak verified number people infected source animals main transporters salmonella crops become infected generally occurs use manurebased fertilizers farms animals appear sick especially infected poultry however carry salmonella intestines defecate bacteria spreads sometimes sick animals manifest illness ways similar humans similar consequences may diarrhea fever die death animals raised become infected contact therefore infected manure used fertilizer crops crops contain trace amounts infectious salmonella bacteria spread humans crops poultry become infected living close together hatcheries multiple animals defecating poultry hatched sold domestically others hatched production consumed later live poultry infected sold domestically infect animals may around domestic situation eg poultry show symptoms infections usually obvious humans animals contact poultry become east coast tomatoes tend higher rates salmonella infection west coast seems due microbiome east coast united states far less soil bacteria destroy salmonella versus microbiome west coast bacteria antisalmonella bacteria limiting spread fewer people west coast report cases additionally streetsold natural tomatoes consistently tied outbreaks salmonella streetsold unregulated items independently produced sold consumers include fresh produce markets strong links salmonellosis due part lack food drug administration fda oversight unregistered vendors another cause salmonella bacteria growth may due contact contaminated irrigation tomatoes plant much likely become infected soil roots located contaminated actual blossom two entry points lead likely scenarios healthy tomato plant may become infected serotype various outbreaks salmonella serotypes us abroad began different points either late early however cases concluded end infected either persisted symptoms expired salmonellas destruction immune specific point origin outbreak recall product helped decrease possible exposure none people infected showed symptoms maintained symptoms biotic disturbance major impact society increased awareness ease bacteria spread among organisms helped prompt researchers look ways prevent crops becoming contaminated field importantly disturbance occurring increasing frequency seems counterintuitive salmonellosis easily preventable disease simple food safety steps taken unnecessary hospitalizations deaths could eliminated order prevent serious outbreaks similar one future precautions must taken handling food one must careful crosscontaminate raw poultry products meats anyone handling food also sure wash hands persons wash hands using restroom bacteria survive long periods time outside body bacteria spread unwashed hands possible food items anything may enter mouth cooking one take care heat foods least minimum ten minutes ensure entire product evenly heat ultraviolet radiation good neutralizers salmonella recent outbreaks occurred although infections eliminated hindered either coating crops salmonellafighting human precautions
