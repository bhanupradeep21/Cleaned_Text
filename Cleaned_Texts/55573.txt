restriction digest procedure used molecular biology prepare dna analysis processing sometimes termed dna fragmentation though term used procedures well restriction digest dna molecules cleaved specific restriction sites nucleotides length use restriction enzymes recognize sequences resulting digested dna often selectively amplified using polymerase chain reaction pcr making suitable analytical techniques agarose gel electrophoresis chromatography used genetic fingerprinting plasmid subcloning rflp analysis given restriction enzyme cuts dna segments within specific nucleotide sequence called restriction site recognition sequences typically four six eight ten twelve nucleotides long generally palindromic ie nucleotide sequence direction many ways arrange four nucleotides compose dna adenine thymine guanine cytosine four twelvenucleotide sequence recognition sequences tend occur chance long sequence restriction enzymes specific hundreds distinct sequences identified synthesized sale laboratories result several potential restriction sites appear almost gene locus interest chromosome furthermore almost artificial plasmids include often entirely synthetic polylinker also called multiple cloning site contains dozens restriction enzyme recognition sequences within short segment dna allows insertion almost specific fragment dna plasmid vectors efficiently cloned insertion replicating bacterial cells restriction digest dna analysed using agarose gel electrophoresis gel electrophoresis sample dna first loaded onto slab agarose gel literally pipetted small wells one end slab gel subjected electric field draws negatively charged dna across molecules travel different rates therefore end different distances depending net charge highly charged particles travel size smaller particles travel since none four nucleotide bases carry charge net charge becomes insignificant size main factor affecting rate diffusion gel net charge dna produced sugarphosphate backbone contrast proteins backbone net charge generated different combinations numbers charged amino acids restriction digest commonly used part process molecular cloning dna fragment vector cloning vector expression vector vector typically contains multiple cloning site many restriction site may found foreign piece dna may inserted vector first cutting restriction sites vector well dna fragment followed ligation dna fragment vector restriction digests also necessary performing following analytical techniques numerous types restriction enzymes cut dna differently commonly used restriction enzymes type ii restriction endonuclease see article restriction enzymes examples cut three base pair sequence others cut four six even eight enzyme distinct properties determine efficiently cut conditions manufacturers produce enzymes often provide specific buffer solution contains unique mix cations components aid enzyme cutting efficiently possible different restriction enzymes may also different optimal temperatures function note efficient digest dna restriction site located end dna fragment restriction enzymes may require minimum number base pairs restriction site end dna enzyme work number may vary enzymes commonly used restriction enzymes around base pair sufficient httpsenwikipediaorgwikirestrictiondigest
