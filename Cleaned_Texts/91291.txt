ecological facilitation probiosis describes species interactions benefit least one participants cause harm facilitations categorized mutualisms species benefit commensalisms one species benefits article addresses mechanisms facilitation increasing information available concerning impacts facilitation community ecology two basic categories facilitative interactions strict categorization however possible complex species interactions example seed germination survival harsh environments often higher socalled nurse plants open nurse plant one established canopy beneath germination survival likely due increased shade soil moisture nutrients thus relationship seedlings nurse plants commensal however seedlings grow established plants likely compete former benefactors beneficial effects species one another realized various ways including refuge physical stress predation competition improved resource availability transport facilitation may act reducing negative impacts stressful described nurse plants facilitate seed germination survival alleviating stressful environmental conditions similar interaction occurs red alga chondrus crispus canopyforming seaweed fucus intertidal sites southern new england alga survives higher intertidal temperature desiccation stresses seaweed present canopy seaweed offers protection stresses previous examples describe facilitation individuals single species also instances single facilitator species mediating communitywide stress disturbance example wholecommunity facilitation substrate stabilization cobble beach plant communities rhode island us smooth cordgrass spartina large beds cordgrass buffer wave action thus allowing establishment persistence community less disturbancetolerant annual perennial plants highwater mark general facilitation likely occur physically stressful environments favorable environments competition may important interaction among also occur single habitat containing gradient low high stress example along new england us salt marsh tidal gradient presence black needle rush juncus gerardii increased fitness marsh elder iva annua shrubs lower elevations soil salinity rush shaded soil decreased evapotranspiration turn decreased soil salinity however higher elevations soil salinity lower marsh elder fitness decreased presence rush due increased competition resources thus nature species interactions may shift environmental conditions facilitation greater effect plant interactions environmental stress another mechanism facilitation reduced risk eaten nurse plants example reduce abiotic stress may also physically impede herbivory seedlings growing terrestrial marine environments herbivory palatable species reduced occur unpalatable associational refuges may occur unpalatable species physically shield palatable species herbivores confused inhibitory cues unpalatable herbivory also reduce predation herbivore case redridged clinging crab mithrax forceps along north carolina us crab species takes refuge branches compact ivory bush coral oculina arbuscula feeds seaweed vicinity coral reduced competition seaweed enhances coral growth turn provides refuge crab similar case interaction swollenthorn acacia trees acacia spp certain ants pseudomyrmex spp central acacia provides nourishment protection inside hollow thorns ant return defense herbivores contrast different type facilitation ants sapfeeding insects may increase plant consuming sap plant pests aphids produce sugarrich waste product called honeydew consumed ants exchange protection sapfeeders predation another potential benefit facilitation insulation competitive interactions like familiar example nurse plants harsh environments nurse logs forest sites increased seed germination seedling

similarly herbivory sea urchins strongylocentrotus droebachiensis kelps laminaria spp protect mussels modiolus modiolus overgrowth kelps competing space subtidal zone gulf maine cases facilitation competition inversely studies suggest facilitation events nature rare compared competition events thus competition greater driver ecological facilitation increase access limiting resources light water nutrients interacting species example epiphytic plants often receive direct sunlight canopies host plants would also nurse plants increase amount water available seedlings dry habitats reduced evapotranspiration beneath shade nurse plant special case concerns human facilitation sapfeeding birds three african bird species village weaver ploceus cucullatus common bulbul pycnonotus barbatus sunbird anthreptes gabonicus regularly feed sap flowing holes made local wine tappers trees elaies guineensis bijag√≥s archipelago however familiar examples increased access resources facilitation mutualistic transfers nutrients symbiotic organisms symbiosis prolonged close association organisms examples mutualistic symbioses include movement animals items involved plant reproduction usually mutualistic association pollinators may increase plant reproductive success reducing pollen waste increasing dispersal pollen increasing probability sexual reproduction low population return pollinator receives nourishment form nectar animals may also disperse seed fruit plants either eating case receive benefit nourishment passive transport seeds sticking fur although facilitation often studied level individual species interactions effects facilitation often observable scale community including impacts spatial structure diversity invasibility many facilitative interactions directly affect distribution species discussed transport plant propagules animal dispersers increase colonization rates distant sites may impact distribution population dynamics plant facilitation often affects distribution simply making possible species occur site environmental stress would otherwise prohibit growth species apparent wholecommunity facilitation foundation species sediment stabilization cobble beach plant communities smooth facilitating species may also help drive progression one ecosystem type another mesquite apparently grasslands rio grande nitrogenfixing tree mesquite establishes readily species nutrientpoor soils following establishment mesquite acts nurse plant seedlings thus mesquite facilitates dynamic spatial shift grassland savanna woodland across facilitation affects community diversity defined context number species community altering competitive interactions example intertidal mussels increase total community species diversity displacing competitive large sessile species seaweed although mussels decrease diversity primary space holders ie large sessile species larger number invertebrate species associated mussel beds primary space holders total species diversity higher mussels effect facilitation diversity could also reversed facilitation creates competitive dominance excludes species facilitation certain cases evolutionary outcomes increasing diversity mechanisms resource partitioning sampling effect act tandem facilitation increase biodiversity observable evidence plant facilitation nonnative species either native species nonnative species may increase invasibility community ease nonnative species become established community examination published studies introduced species interactions studied introduced species studies worth noting examined interactions relationships single planteating insect reported single study may overemphasized importance negative interactions introduced plants also facilitated native pollinators dispersers thus positive interactions must considered attempt understand invasibility community httpsenwikipediaorgwikiecologicalfacilitation
