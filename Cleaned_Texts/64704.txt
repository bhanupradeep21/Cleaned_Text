visual search type perceptual task requiring attention typically involves active scan visual environment particular object feature target among objects features visual search take place without eye movements ability consciously locate object target amongst complex array stimuli extensively studied past years practical examples using visual search seen everyday life one picking product supermarket shelf animals searching food among piles leaves trying find friend large crowd people simply playing visual search games wheres wally much previous literature visual search used reaction time order measure time takes detect target amongst distractors example could green square target amongst set red circles distractors however reaction time measurements always distinguish role attention factors long reaction time might result difficulty directing attention target slowed decisionmaking processes slowed motor responses attention already directed target target already detected many visual search paradigms therefore used eye movement means measure degree attention given however eyes move independently attention therefore eye movement measures completely capture role feature

unique bottomup processing processing information depends input explains one utilizes feature detectors process characteristics stimuli differentiate target draw visual attention towards target due bottomup processes known lastly parallel processing mechanism allows ones feature detectors work simultaneously identifying conjunction search also known inefficient serial visual search process focuses identifying previously requested target surrounded distractors possessing distinct features target example conjunction search task person identify red x target amongst distractors composed black xs shape red os unlike feature search conjunction search involves distractors groups distractors may differ exhibit least one common feature efficiency conjunction search regards reaction time rt accuracy dependent number distractors distractors represent differing individual features target equally amongst distractorratio effect reaction timert increases accuracy number distractors present increases reaction time rt increases accuracy however practice original reaction time rt restraints conjunction search tend show early stages processing conjunction search utilizes bottomup processes identify prespecified features amongst processes overtaken serial process consciously evaluating indicated features order properly allocate ones focal spatial attention towards stimulus accurately represents many cases topdown processing affects conjunction search eliminating stimuli incongruent ones previous knowledge targetdescription end allows efficient identification example effect topdown

stimuli matched real world one must use prior knowledge everyday order accurately efficiently locate objects phones keys etc among much complex array despite complexity visual search complex objects search categories objects phone based prior knowledge appears rely active scanning processes conjunction search less complex contrived laboratory although global statistical information available realworld scenes also help people locate target bottomup processes may come play identifying objects familiar person overall topdown processing highly influences visual searches occur everyday familiarity play especially critical roles parts objects visible objects partly hidden view behind objects visual information hidden parts recalled longterm memory used facilitate search familiar also possible measure role attention within visual search experiments calculating slope reaction time number distractors generally high levels attention required looking complex array stimuli conjunction search slope increases reaction times increase simple visual search tasks feature search slope decreases due reaction times fast requiring less however use reaction time slope measure attention controversial nonattentional factors also affect reaction time one obvious way select visual information turn towards also known visual orienting may movement head andor eyes towards visual stimulus called saccade process called foveation eyes fixate object interest making image visual stimulus fall fovea eye central part retina sharpest visual acuity two types orienting visual search relies primarily endogenous orienting participants goal detect presence absence specific target object array distracting objects early research suggested attention could covertly without eye movement shifted peripheral later studies found small saccades microsaccades occur tasks eye movements frequently directed towards attended locations whether visible findings indicate attention plays critical role understanding visual search subsequently competing theories attention come dominate visual search environment contains vast amount information limited amount information able process one time therefore necessary mechanisms extraneous stimuli filtered relevant information attended study attention psychologists distinguish preattentive attentional preattentive processes evenly distributed across input signals forming kind lowlevel attention attentional processes selective applied specific preattentive input large part current debate visual search theory centres selective attention visual system capable achieving without focal popular explanation different reaction times feature conjunction searches feature integration theory fit introduced treisman gelade theory proposes certain visual features registered early automatically coded rapidly parallel across visual field using preattentive experiments show features include luminance colour orientation motion direction velocity well simple aspects example red x quickly found among number black xs os red x discriminative feature colour pop contrast theory also suggests order integrate two visual features belonging object later process involving integration information different brain areas needed coded serially using focal attention example locating orange square among blue squares orange triangles neither colour feature orange shape feature square sufficient locate search target instead one must integrate information colour shape locate target evidence attention thus later visual processing needed integrate two features object shown occurrence illusory conjunctions features combine correctly example display green x red flashed screen briefly later visual process serial search focal attention occur observer may report seeing red x green fit dichotomy distinction two stages preattentive attentive preattentive processes performed first stage fit model simplest features object analyzed color size arrangement second attentive stage model incorporates crossdimensional actual identification object done information target object put together theory always today disagreements problems proposals allowed theory amended altered time criticism revision allowed become accurate description visual disagreements whether clear distinction feature detection searches use master map accounting multiple dimensions order search object psychologists support idea feature integration completely separate type master map search whereas many others decided feature integration incorporates use
