oxford university began studies phd oxford two months followed major professor jeremy r knowles harvard university earned phd biochemistry took postdoctoral fellowships molecular biology university edinburgh university halls phd enzymology blactamase led first paper published nature used strains e coli mutated blactamase antibiotic resistance enzyme assayed activity presence benzylpenicillin cephalosporin c direct selection mutants allowed catalytic properties blactamase identified allowed structurefunction relationships enzyme went work institute cancer research london stayed years work collaboration colleague close friend christopher marshall made seminal contributions understanding cell signalling animal cells particular role rho ras small gtpases regulating variety cellular functions proliferation morphology migration hall helped identify transforming sequences human sarcoma cells lines institute cancer research london dna rhabdomyosarcoma cell line fibrosarcoma cell line transformed mouse fibroblast cell line injection mice tumors started form little days next transforming activities rhabdomyosarcoma fibrosarcoma cell lines measured digested array endonucleases dna testing showed transforming sequences two cancer cell lines gene later characterised nras member ras gene hall helped uncover properties human protein encoded nras gtpase activity different mutant

became director program alan hall discerned role gaq rho signalling pathways prior publication conflicting reports role gaq cell signalling via rho said able induce rho activation said could using immunoblotting techniques hall showed activation endogenous gaq via g proteincoupled receptors gcprs could fact induce activation rho similar results directly expressing activated gaq already known ga proteins could induce rho activation ie activates rho gef turn activates rho also known gaq activate rho gef therefore must act via alternate unknown two years later moved memorial sloan kettering cancer center chair cell biology abundance activators targets rho pathway identified yet little investigation way specificity pathway maintained known point several identified rho targets structurally similar scaffold proteins shown past mediate interaction specificity pathways hall used immunoprecipitation assays show scaffold proteinlike target rho interacts two rhospecific gefs two kinases jnk

epithelial hbe cells downregulation rhoa hbe cell lines using sirnas showed lack apical junction formation contrast controls sirnas targeted rhoa effect members rho family analysis showed direct target rho required formation apical junctions mutational variants used discover although initial formation preapical junctions isnt blocked maturation process true apical junctions halls research
