brandy salamander brandy first brought attention article published slovenian magazine mladina describing hallucinogenic intensely aphrodisiac effects ogorevc author article writes firsthand experience obtaining experimenting salamander brandy excerpt ogorevc describes intoxication salamander brandy unnaturally colorfully glittering around treetops trees weirdly hysterically rushing depths totally unburdened biology extraterrestrial beings planet watched everything grass insects grazing cow absolutely everything seemed new strange wished fuck something anything almost full absence chose beech tree horribly erotic finally crashed wet leaves maybe even slept damn salamanders walked nearby said mysterious voices look look salamander ogorevc also reported methods observed making salamander brandy one adding live black yellow spotted salamanders barrel fermenting fruit one salamander every ten liters mixture left couple months salamander secretes toxins supposedly samandarines avoid ethanol absorption eventual death another method describes hang salamander hind legs stream brandy distillation process salamander excrete poisons defend brandy continues wash away secretions third technique kill dry salamanders hang pot cooking fruit steam rises extract poisonous compounds salamander distilled collected vessel publication ogorevcs account brought much public attention curiosity enigmatic drink yet credibility existence salamander brandy described ogorevc brought question anthropologist miha kozorog university ljubljana decided investigate ogorevcs claims although colleagues traveled region ogorevc supposedly bought salamander brandy kozorog unable obtain samples however many discussions locals region learned salamander brandy psychedelic drink exclaimed ogorevc media rather derogatory term bad fake brandy locals explain brandy distillers make salamander brandy swindlers consume salamander brandy accidentally result experience paralysis legs one symptoms samandarin poisoning kozorog quotes fair good brandy distillers cook pure good brandy also swindle brandy whose brandy fake one sometimes kozorog also learned folktale surrounding salamander brandy story tells tale woman lived farm often cooked special brandy added live salamander drank brandy driven mad poison whenever devil came drink locals could hear terrible rumbling throughout village devil ran around intoxicated concoction research kozorog unable find hard evidence hallucinogenic properties ogorevc described salamander brandy considering methods described preparing salamander brandy likely samandarine toxins play role effects drink however brandy rather stigmatized among locals adulterated brandy kozorog claims excitement surrounding psychedelic properties salamander brandy engendered mainly ogorevcs humorous writing style grandiose media coverage samandarin extremely toxic µgkg µgkg little known precise mechanism action samandarin mainly affects central nervous system specifically
