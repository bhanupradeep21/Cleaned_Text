selfpollination form pollination pollen plant arrives stigma flower flowering plants ovule gymnosperms two types selfpollination autogamy pollen transferred stigma flower geitonogamy pollen transferred anther one flower stigma another flower flowering plant microsporangium ovule within single monoecious gymnosperm plants mechanisms ensure autogamy flowers open cleistogamy stamens move come contact stigma term selfing often used synonym limited selfpollination also applies type selffertilization plants selfpollinate without aid pollen vectors wind insects mechanism seen often legumes peanuts another legume soybeans flowers open remain receptive insect cross pollination day accomplished flowers selfpollinate closing among plants selfpollinate many kinds orchids peas sunflowers tridax selfpollinating plants small relatively inconspicuous flowers shed pollen directly onto stigma sometimes even bud opens selfpollinated plants expend less energy production pollinator attractants grow areas kinds insects animals might visit absent arctic high elevations selfpollination limits variety progeny may depress plant vigor however selfpollination advantageous allowing plants spread beyond range suitable pollinators produce offspring areas pollinator populations greatly reduced naturally pollination also accomplished crosspollination crosspollination transfer pollen

dependent pollinating agents allows selfpollination occur bees wind nowhere found selfpollination cross pollination advantage number flowers small widely spaced selfpollination pollen grains transmitted one flower another result less wastage pollen also selfpollinating plants depend external carriers also make changes characters features species maintained purity selfpollination also helps preserve parental characters gametes flower evolved necessary flowers produce nectar scent colourful order attract pollinators disadvantages selfpollination come lack variation allows adaptation
