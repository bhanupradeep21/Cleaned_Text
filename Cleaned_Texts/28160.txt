methods used studies determine presence bacteria vary significantly primitive methods simple culturing highly sophisticated methods independent research groups utilizing staining techniques fluorescence situ hybridization able visualize bacteria ongoing infection well associated inflammatory cells studies carried real time therefore demonstrated ongoing bacterial results studies
