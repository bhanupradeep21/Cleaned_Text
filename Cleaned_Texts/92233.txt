medicine pulse represents tactile arterial palpation cardiac cycle heartbeat trained fingertips pulse may palpated place allows artery compressed near surface body neck carotid artery wrist radial artery groin femoral artery behind knee popliteal artery near ankle joint posterior tibial artery foot dorsalis pedis artery pulse count arterial pulse per minute equivalent measuring heart rate heart rate also measured listening heart beat auscultation traditionally using stethoscope counting minute radial pulse commonly measured using three fingers reason finger closest heart used occlude pulse pressure middle finger used get crude estimate blood pressure finger distal heart usually ring finger used nullify effect ulnar pulse two arteries connected via palmar arches superficial deep study pulse known sphygmology claudius galen perhaps first physiologist describe pulse expedient tactile method determination systolic blood pressure trained observer diastolic blood pressure nonpalpable unobservable tactile methods occurring heartbeats pressure waves generated heart systole move arterial walls forward movement blood occurs boundaries pliable compliant properties form enough create palpable pressure wave heart rate may pulse velocity pulse deficits much physiologic data readily simplistically visualized use one arterial catheters connected transducer oscilloscope invasive technique commonly used intensive care since rate pulse observed measured tactile visual means outside artery recorded beats per minute bpm pulse may indirectly observed light absorbances varying wavelengths assigned inexpensively reproduced mathematical ratios applied capture variances light signal blood component hemoglobin oxygenated vs deoxygenated conditions allows technology pulse oximetry normal pulse rates rest beats per minute pulse rate used check overall heart health fitness level generally lower better bradycardias dangerous symptoms dangerously slow heartbeat include weakness loss energy normal pulse regular rhythm force irregular pulse may due sinus arrhythmia ectopic beats atrial fibrillation paroxysmal atrial tachycardia atrial flutter partial heart block etc intermittent dropping beats pulse called intermittent pulse examples regular intermittent regularly irregular pulse include pulsus bigeminus seconddegree atrioventricular block example irregular intermittent irregularly irregular pulse atrial fibrillation degree expansion displayed artery diastolic systolic state called volume also known amplitude expansion size pulse weak pulse signifies narrow pulse pressure may due low cardiac output seen shock congestive cardiac failure hypovolemia valvular heart disease aortic outflow tract obstruction mitral stenosis aortic arch syndrome etc bounding pulse signifies high pulse pressure may due low peripheral resistance seen fever anemia thyrotoxicosis hyperkinetic heart syndrome de av fistula pagets disease beriberi liver cirrhosis increased cardiac output increased stroke volume seen anxiety exercise complete heart block aortic regurgitation decreased distensibility arterial system seen atherosclerosis hypertension coarctation aorta strength pulse also also known compressibility pulse rough measure systolic blood pressure corresponds diastolic blood pressure low tension pulse pulsus mollis vessel soft impalpable beats high tension pulse pulsus durus vessels feel rigid even pulse beats form contour pulse palpatory estimation arteriogram quickly rising quickly falling pulse pulsus celer seen aortic regurgitation slow rising slowly falling pulse pulsus tardus seen aortic stenosis comparing pulses different places gives valuable clinical information discrepant unequal pulse left right radial artery observed anomalous aberrant course artery coarctation aorta aortitis dissecting aneurysm peripheral embolism etc unequal pulse upper lower extremities seen coarctation aorta aortitis block bifurcation aorta dissection aorta iatrogenic trauma arteriosclerotic obstruction normal artery palpable flattening digital pressure thick radial artery palpable cm forearm suggestive arteriosclerosis coarctation aorta femoral pulse may significantly delayed compared radial pulse unless coexisting aortic regurgitation delay also observed supravalvar aortic stenosis several pulse patterns clinically significance include sites divided peripheral pulses central pulses central pulses include carotid femoral brachial although pulse felt multiple places head people normally hear heartbeats within head called pulsatile tinnitus indicate several medical disorders pulse rate first measured ancient greek physicians scientists first person measure heart beat herophilus alexandria egypt c bc designed water clock time rumi mentioned poem wise physician measured patients pulse became aware condition shows practice common rumis era first person accurately measure pulse rate santorio santorii invented pulsilogium form pendulum later studied galileo century later another physician de lacroix used pulsilogium test cardiac function httpsenwikipediaorgwikipulse
