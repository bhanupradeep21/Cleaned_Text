gynecologic cancer disparities united states refer differences incidence prevalence mortality gynecologic cancers population groups five main types gynecologic cancer include cervical cancer ovarian cancer endometrial cancer vaginal cancer vulvar patients gynecologic malignancies within united states disparities across care continuum socioeconomic status racialethnic background previously identified causes behind disparities multifaceted complex interplay systemic differences health well individual patient factors cultural educational economic since development papanicolou smear pap

within us new cases invasive cervical cancer diagnosed women die cervical cancer end despite overall decline incidence mortality rates cervical cancer women across united states significant disparities documented amongst racial ethnic minorities socioeconomically marginalized within united states hispanic women highest incidence cervical cancer african americans highest disparities amongst different minority groups attributed different pap smear screening african americans american indians nonwhite hispanics found diagnosed later stages white women suggested potential contributing reason worse survival one study california found asian women least likely ethnicracial group ever pap study also described varied trends existing within different asian american subpopulations identifying vietnamese women lowest screening rates filipino women highest screening rates also discovered foreignborn women us lower screening rates born exist disparity screening also exists postscreening disparities followup adherence followup abnormal pap tests varies across minority national breast cervical cancer early detection program national initiative focused increasing
