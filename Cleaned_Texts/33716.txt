phoratoxins group peptide toxins belong family thionins subdivision small plant toxins kd phoratoxins proteins present leaves branches phoradendron commonly known american variant mistletoe plant commonly used decoration festive season berries mistletoe contain phoratoxins making less toxic compared parts plant toxicity mistletoe dependent host tree since mistletoe known semiparasite host tree provides fixed inorganic nitrogen compounds necessary mistletoe synthesize viscotoxins similar plant thionins produced leaves stems european mistletoe viscum history phoratoxin filled myths legends magical stories mistletoe semiparasitic plant occasionally using oak trees host historic peoples gauls druids oak trees sacred led beliefs mistletoe containing viscotoxin cure drug illnesses stories lived many years spread americas european settlers came united states mistook american mistletoe phoradendron toxic european mistletoe viscum album made sure mysterious past belonging viscotoxin shared folding motif overall topology phoratoxins identical crambin phoratoxin proteins fold two antiparallel amphipathic helices perpendicular double stranded beta sheet cterminal coil region general configuration protein resembles shape greek capital letter phoratoxin contains three disulfide phoratoxin expresses different features typical membrane active proteins compact contains many basic amino acid residues contains one weakly polar flat likely phoratoxins multiple aggregation states either exist monomer dimer tetramer consisting dimer dimers state aggregation depends presence inorganic phosphate phospholipids aggregates hydrophobic hydrophilic dimers joined intermolecular interaction bridging hydrophilic dimer possible inorganic phosphate ion present making inorganic phosphate ion presence necessary lattice formation inorganic phosphate ion increases toxin stability neutralizing positively charged basic amino acids monomers creating possibilities van der waals phoratoxin amphipathic molecule feature frequently found membrane binding phoratoxin positive membrane binding site bind negatively charged phospholipids phospholipid binding site located alpha helix beta sheet phosphate fits binding pocket near glycerol part well two termini bound phospholipid move towards random coil region residue six forms phoratoxin known exist five six forms amino acids long phoratoxin amino acids long differences six forms mainly centered random coil region protein residue phoratoxin f mutated leucine alanine phenylalanine leucine hydrophobic however phenylalanine large aromatic strandpreferring leucine medium size prefers helix glycine alanine small amino acids glycine prefers turns alanine prefers helices glycine extremely flexible intermediate alanine hydrophobic assuming phoratoxin folds exact manner residues alpha mutation makes helix phoratoxin f stable helix phoratoxin forms second difference various forms phoratoxin second alphahelix coding fact valine isoleucine beta branched beta sheet secondary structure preference since amino acids also hydrophobic mutation thought little interference folding stability protein last differentiation amino acid configuration mutation region coding specific secondary protein asparagine aspartic acid hydrophilic threonine intermediate hydrophilicity asparagine aspartic acid larger threonine asparagine aspartic acid like turn threonine prefers beta strand aspartic acid asparagine carry formal charge charge however negative aspartic acid positive asparagine phoratoxin synthesized lab yet however extracted phoradendron phoratoxin located leaves berries plant isolated plant means chromatography extracted acid thereafter purified lot available information mechanism action phoratoxin however known phoratoxin high affinity therefore able disrupt cell membranes metabolic activity protein already expresses toxic trait stays intact way synthesized phoradendron phoratoxin many different effects depending dose symptoms vary mild severe effects even death mild symptoms diarrhea abdominal pain nausea blurred severe symptoms reflex bradycardia reduction blood pressure due decrease cardiac output via increase heart rate negative inotropic effects heart muscle weakens force muscle contractions high doses narrowing skin skeletal muscle blood however average healthy adult withstand toxin plant without symptoms dangerous lethal small kids animals even upsides plant comes therapeutic uses used europe treat high blood pressure epilepsy infertility phoratoxin hemolytic causes cell leakage cell lysis interacting used study cancer treatment phoratoxin lyses cancer cells killing supposedly helps chemotherapy radiation well little research done subject countries also used illegal abortions tea brewed leaves mistletoe phoratoxin toxin present american mistletoe phoradendron leucarpum cases led toxicity phoratoxin due accidental ingestion mistletoe christmas season related accidental intake berries children limited data concerning accidental exposure american one study shows symptoms exposures cases major symptoms small percentage moderate symptoms cases present people minor effects symptoms minimally bothersome patient majority people exposed mistletoe symptoms cases investigated study fatalities outcome associated without morbidity another shows human cases exposed american mistletoe symptomatic cases related exposure phoratoxin symptoms included six gastrointestinal upset cases two mild drowsiness cases one eye irritation case one ataxia case months one case seizure months amount ingested mistletoe ranged one berry leaf berries leaves american mistletoe also associated nausea vomiting abdominal cramps diarrhea development symptoms rare even though limited data present american mistletoe toxic people think majority patients receive studies turned phoratoxin depolarize membrane frog skeletal muscle phoratoxin increases resting membrane conductance conductance sensitive external calcium relationship indicate interaction toxin molecule membrane level dependence depolarizing effect toxin suggests phoratoxin b alter structural integrity membrane phospholipid layer indicated phoratoxin behaves detergent phoratoxin hemolytic therefore depolarize cell membranes cardiac skeletal muscles phoratoxin appears cytotoxic cancer cells reason mistletoe increasingly used natural holistic treatment cancer however completely new letter lancet british officer indian army medical corps written mistletoe mixtures used purge away black bile mucous humours drawing gross humours depths body antiserum available phoratoxin ingestion yet however steps treating phoratoxin poisoning first important wipe mouth remove remaining pieces activated carbon administered prevent toxins absorbed body also fluids administered via drips line necessary case high dose phoratoxin ingestion gastrointestinal decontamination prevention phoratoxin poisoning done avoiding eating wild berries plants wild washing hands hiking camping wild eating also use artificial decorations christmas instead hanging real httpsenwikipediaorgwikiviscotoxins
