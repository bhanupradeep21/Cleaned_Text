psychology cognitive neuroscience pattern recognition describes cognitive process matches information stimulus information retrieved pattern recognition occurs information environment received entered shortterm memory causing automatic activation specific content longterm memory early example learning alphabet order carer repeats b c multiple times child utilizing pattern recognition child says c hear b order recognizing patterns allows us predict expect coming process pattern recognition involves matching information received information already stored brain making connection memories information perceived step pattern recognition called identification pattern recognition requires repetition experience semantic memory used implicitly subconsciously main type memory involved pattern recognition crucial humans animals well even koalas possess lessdeveloped thinking abilities use pattern recognition find consume eucalyptus leaves human brain developed holds similarities brains birds lower mammals development neural networks outer layer brain humans allowed better processing visual auditory patterns spatial positioning environment remembering findings detecting hazards resources increase chances survival examples application pattern recognition humans six main theories pattern recognition template matching prototypematching feature analysis recognitionbycomponents theory bottomup topdown processing fourier analysis application theories everyday life mutually exclusive pattern recognition allows us read words understand language recognize friends even appreciate music theories applies various activities domains pattern recognition observed facial music language recognition seriation domains facial recognition seriation occur encoding visual patterns music language recognition use encoding auditory patterns template matching theory describes basic approach human pattern recognition theory assumes every perceived object stored template longterm incoming information compared templates find exact words sensory input compared multiple representations object form one single conceptual understanding theory defines perception fundamentally recognitionbased process assumes everything see understand past exposure informs future perception external example recognized letter b viewpoint limited however explaining new experiences understood without compared internal memory templatecitation needed unlike exact onetoone template matching theory prototype matching instead compares incoming sensory input one average prototypecitation needed theory proposes exposure series related stimuli leads creation typical prototype based shared reduces number stored templates standardizing single prototype supports perceptual flexibility unlike template matching allows variability recognition novel stimulicitation needed instance child never seen lawn chair would still able recognize chair understanding essential characteristics four legs seat idea however limits conceptualization objects necessarily averaged one like types canines instance even though dogs wolves foxes typically furry fourlegged moderately sized animals ears tail thus strictly perceived respect prototype matching theory template feature analysis approaches recognition objects situations merged reconciled overtaken multiple discrimination theory states amounts test stimulus salient feature template recognized perceptual judgment distance universal unit discrimination objective performance jndclarification amount feature similar feature detection theory recognition components rbc focuses bottomup features stimuli processed first proposed irving biederman theory states humans recognize objects breaking basic geometric shapes called geons ie cylinders cubes cones etc example break common item like coffee cup recognize hollow cylinder holds liquid curved handle side allows us hold even though every coffee cup exactly basic components helps us recognize consistency across examples pattern rbc suggests fewer unique geons combined form virtually unlimited number objects parse dissect object rbc proposes attend two specific features edges concavities edges enable observer maintain consistent representation object regardless viewing angle lighting conditions concavities two edges meet enable observer perceive one geon ends another begins rbc principles visual object recognition applied auditory language recognition well place geons language researchers propose spoken language broken basic components called phonemes example phonemes english language topdown processing refers use background information pattern always begins person previous knowledge makes predictions due already acquired psychologist richard gregory estimated information lost time takes go eye brain brain must guess person sees based past experiences words construct perception reality perceptions hypotheses propositions based past experiences stored information formation incorrect propositions lead errors perception visual given paragraph written difficult handwriting easier understand writer wants convey one reads whole paragraph rather reading words separate terms brain may able perceive understand gist paragraph due context supplied surrounding bottomup processing also known datadriven processing originates stimulation sensory psychologist james gibson opposed topdown model argued perception direct subject hypothesis testing gregory proposed stated sensation perception need extra interpretation enough information environment make sense world direct way theory sometimes known ecological theory claim perception explained solely terms environment example bottom upprocessing involves presenting flower center persons field sight flower information stimulus carried retina visual cortex brain signal travels one psychologist jean piagets theory cognitive development third stage called concrete operational state stage abstract principle thinking called seriation naturally developed seriation ability arrange items logical order along quantitative dimension length weight age general cognitive skill fully mastered nursery years seriate means understand objects ordered along effectively child needs able answer question comes seriation skills also help develop problemsolving skills useful recognizing completing patterning tasks piaget studied development seriation along szeminska experiment used rods varying lengths test childrens found three distinct stages development skill first stage children around age could arrange first ten rods order could make smaller groups could put elements together second stage children years age could succeed seriation task first ten rods process trial error could insert set rods order trial error third stage children could arrange rods order without much trial error children used systematic method first looking smallest rod first smallest among develop skill seriation helps advance problemsolving skills children provided opportunities arrange things order using appropriate language big bigger working size relationships also given chance arrange objects order based texture sound flavor along specific tasks seriation children given chance compare different materials toys use play activities like true understanding characteristics objects develop aid young age differences objects lastly complicated task arranging two different sets objects seeing relationship two different sets also provided common example children attempt fit saucepan lids saucepans different sizes fitting together different sizes nuts help build math skills children teachers parents help learn seriation patterning young children understand seriation put numbers order lowest highest eventually come understand higher higher similarly children copy patterns create patterns like abab patterns great way help recognize order prepare later math skills multiplication child care providers begin exposing children patterns young age make groups count total number recognizing faces one common forms pattern recognition humans extremely effective remembering faces ease automaticity belies challenging faces physically similar faces two eyes one mouth one nose predictable locations yet humans recognize face several different angles various lighting neuroscientists posit recognizing faces takes place three phases first phase starts visually focusing physical features facial recognition system needs reconstruct identity person previous experiences provides us signal might person know final phase recognition completes face elicits name although humans great recognizing faces normal viewing angles upsidedown faces tremendously difficult recognize demonstrates challenges facial recognition also humans specialized procedures capacities recognizing faces normal upright viewing scientists agree certain area brain specifically devoted processing faces structure called fusiform gyrus brain imaging studies shown becomes highly active subject viewing several case studies reported patients lesions tissue damage localized area tremendous difficulty recognizing faces even although research circumstantial study stanford university provided conclusive evidence fusiform gyrus role facial recognition unique case study researchers able send direct signals patients fusiform gyrus patient reported faces doctors nurses changed morphed front electrical stimulation researchers agree demonstrates convincing causal link neural structure human ability recognize although adults facial recognition fast automatic children reach adult levels performance laboratory tasks two general theories put forth explain facial recognition normally develops first general cognitive development theory proposes perceptual ability encode faces fully developed early childhood continued improvement facial recognition adulthood attributed general factors general factors include improved attentional focus deliberate task strategies metacognition research supports argument general factors improve dramatically facespecific perceptual development theory argues improved facial recognition children adults due precise development facial perception cause continuing development proposed ongoing experience faces several developmental issues manifest decreased capacity facial recognition using known role fusiform gyrus research shown impaired social development along autism spectrum accompanied behavioral marker individuals tend look away faces neurological marker characterized decreased neural activity fusiform gyrus similarly developmental prosopagnosia dp struggle facial recognition extent often unable identify even faces many studies report around world population developmental prosopagnosia individuals dp family history individuals dp behaviorally indistinguishable physical damage lesions fusiform gyrus implicating importance facial recognition despite dp neurological damage remains large variability facial recognition ability total unknown accounts differences facial recognition ability whether biological environmental disposition recent research analyzing identical fraternal twins showed facial recognition significantly higher correlated identical twins suggesting strong genetic component individual differences facial recognition recentwhen research reveals infant language acquisition linked cognitive pattern unlike classical nativist behavioral theories language scientists believe language learned studies hebrew university university sydney show strong correlation ability identify visual patterns learn new children high shape recognition showed better grammar knowledge even controlling effects intelligence memory supported theory language learning based statistical process infants perceive common combinations sounds words language use inform future speech production first step infant language acquisition decipher basic sound units native language includes every consonant every short long vowel sound additional letter combinations like th ph english units called phonemes detected exposure pattern recognition infants use innate feature detector capabilities distinguish sounds split phonemes mechanism categorical perception extract statistical information recognizing combinations sounds likely occur like qu h plus vowel way ability learn words based directly accuracy earlier phonetic patterning transition phonemic differentiation higherorder word first step hierarchical acquisition language pattern recognition furthermore utilized detection prosody cues stress intonation patterns among applied sentence structure understanding typical clause entire process reflected reading well first child recognizes patterns individual letters words groups words together paragraphs finally entire chapters learning read learning speak language based stepwise refinement perceptual pattern
