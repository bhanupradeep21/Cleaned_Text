service afs international scholarship afs student attended joseph craig high school janesville wisconsin received highschool diploma israel hanukoglu received undergraduate degree cum laude double majors biology psychology minor political science hebrew university jerusalem went university graduate studies received msc degree interdisciplinary endocrinologyreproductive physiology program joint supervision prof harry j karavolas dept physiological chemistry prof robert w goy dept psychology phd thesis research mechanism electron transport cytochrome adrenal cortex mitochondrial steroid monooxygenase systems carried supervision prof colin r jefcoate received phd diploma august prof hanukoglus scientific work concentrated three different areas outlined hanukoglus career molecular biology started department biochemistry university chicago elaine fuchs cloned sequenced cdnas coding cytoskeletal proteins alpha elucidated first structures cytoskeletal keratin families predicted long helical domains proteins computerized analysis amino acid sequences predicted central rod domain intermediate filament proteins composed four helical segments separated three short linker sequences later crystallographic studies confirmed general model intermediate filament protein phd thesis research israel isolated mitochondrial enzymes catalyze first step synthesis steroid hormones steroidogenic tissues including adrenal cortex reproductive first step steroidogenesis dependent transfer electrons nadph type enzyme via electrontransfer chain includes two additional proteins located inner mitochondrial israel reconstituted system using proteins purified characterized process electron transfer proteins built kinetic model simulated precisely dynamic behavior complex first academic position department biology technionisrael institute technology first determined molar stoichiometry mitochondrial system proteins using specific antibodies set clone cdnas genes code enzymes lab first clone cdnas gene coding adrenodoxin reductase first enzyme electron transfer chain mitochondrial sequence structural analyses adrenodoxin reductase israel identified binding sites electron donor acceptor coenzymes nadph sequence analyses large oxidoreductase type enzyme families noted fadbinding site classical rossmann fold nadph binding site different consensus sequence could responsible nad vs nadp coenzyme specificity importance motifs identified confirmed reengineering coenzyme specificities different elucidation crystal structure adrenodoxin reductase verified israels identification coenzyme binding analysis phylogeny enzyme eukaryotes showed nadp binding site sequence strictly steroidogenic tissues high levels antioxidants israel suspected systems may leak electrons producing oxygen radicals examined issue showed indeed electrons leak action mitochondrial systems generate reactive oxygen studies also showed bovine ovary levels antioxidants coordinately regulated work field includes elucidation mechanism action corticotropin acth regulating steroid hormone synthesis adrenal regulation adrenal steroidogenic capacity disease cloning elucidation structure acth field israel organized first international symposium molecular steroidogenesis jerusalem served cornerstone continuing series international symposia scientists specialize clinical work endocrinologist israels older brother prof aaron hanukoglu tel aviv university sackler medical school e wolfson medical center identified hereditary disease named pseudohypoaldosteronism pha type encompasses two independent following discovery two brothers continued collaboration understand molecular basis severe form pha collaborative work also included additional labs hanukoglu brothers discovered severe forms pseudohypoaldosteronism type result mutations three genes encode protein subunits epithelial sodium na channel studies also helped establish enac principal channel involved blood volume blood pressure regulation following studies hanukoglu brothers directed attention understand structure function enac assembled normal mutated subunits analyses showed phenotypic variations severity pseudohypoaldosteronism associated types genetic work structure enac subunits led identification charged residues regions responsible transport protein membrane regulation extracellular na extensive review studies asic enac prof hanukoglu summarized major similarities asic enac type define sites localization enac tissues within cells hanukoglus laboratory generated polyclonal antibodies extracellular enac subunits antibodies first time permitted visualization intracellular localization enac high resolution led discovery cells motile cilia enac located studies establish enac important regulator fluid level luminal side cells motile cilia female reproductive respiratory recently showed sodium channels also located seminiferous tubules testis tail head region systemic pseudohypoaldosteronism patients mutated enac subunits may lose significant amount salt sweat especially hot identify sites salt loss hanukoglu brothers examined localization enac human comprehensive study examining layers skin epidermal appendages found widespread distribution enac keratinocytes epidermal layers yet eccrine sweat glands enac localized apical cell membrane exposed duct sweat glands based additional observations concluded enac located eccrine gland sweat ducts responsible uptake na ions sweat secretions recycling na reduces concentration salt perspiration prevents loss salt hot climates via addition personal prizes research presentations laboratory prof hanukoglu received four awards national international meetings besides scientific career hanukoglu maintained active academic civic leadership role hanukoglu founded israels first bsc degree program molecular biology ariel university served chairman molecular biology department hanukoglu editorial board memberassociate editor five journals including biochemistry molecular biology education bmc biotechnology cells frontiers renal epithelial physiology received publons peer review award placing top reviewers molecular biology genetics global rank hanukoglu elected chairman professors strong israel selfdescribed nonpartisan organization academics united shared concern security jewish
