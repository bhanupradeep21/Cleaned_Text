shift work sleep disorder swsd circadian rhythm sleep disorder characterized insomnia excessive sleepiness affecting people whose work hours overlap typical sleep period insomnia difficulty fall asleep wake individual slept working population participates shift work swsd commonly goes undiagnosed estimated shift workers excessive sleepiness appears individual productive awake symptoms
