fertility factors determinants number children individual likely fertility factors mostly positive negative correlations without certain causations factors generally associated increased fertility include intention advanced societies high gender intergenerational transmission source needed source needed support rural pro family government low increased food factors generally associated decreased fertility include rising value attitude female labor population partner reluctance low level gender predictive power intentions continues debated research argues intentions good predictor actual results tends draw ideas theory planned behavior tpb according tpb intentions stem three factors attitudes regarding children including cost raising versus perceived benefits subjective norms example influence others perceived control behavior much control individual fertility intentions tend boil quantum intentions many children bear tempo intentions meaning quantum intention poor predictor tends change result ups downs typical life tempo intention somewhat better predictor still weak way predict actual intention children generally increases probability children relation well evidenced advanced societies birth control default comparison survey birth registers norway found parents likely realize fertility intentions childless also suggested childless individuals may underestimate effort hand parents may better understand ability manage another individuals intending children immediately likely achieve within two whereas contrast fertility rate found higher among intending children long term four stability fertility intentions improves chance realize stability increased belief child improve life satisfaction partner chances realizing fertility intentions lower postsoviet states western european many determinants intention children including advanced societies birth control default option equal division household tasks tends improve chances second equally increases employment equity tend lead equal division household labor thus improve chances second preference theory suggests womans attitudes towards children shaped early life furthermore attitudes tend hold across life course boil three main types careeroriented familyoriented combination work family research shows familyoriented women children workoriented women least none although causality remains preferences also apply sex children born therefore influence decisions children instance couples preference least one boy one girl first two children born boys significantly high likelihood couple opt another survey taken place united states found women reported religion important everyday lives higher fertility reporting somewhat important many religions religiosity directly associated increase intention appears main means religion increases example catholic couples generally intentions children jewish couples turn tended children protestant among catholics increased religiosity associated intention children hand increased religiousness among protestants associated intention fewer also suggested religions generally encourage lifestyles fertility factors turn increase example religious views birth control many religions restrictive secular views religious restrictions associated increased religion sometimes modifies fertility effects education income catholic education university level secondary school level associated higher fertility even accounting confounding effect higher religiosity leads higher probability attending religiously affiliated higher income also associated slightly increased fertility among catholic couples however associated slightly decreased fertility among protestant parents religiosity positively associated childrens fertility therefore religious parents tend increase study found relation religiosity fertility driven lower aggregate fertility secular individuals religiosity prevent low fertility levels highly religious countries low fertility rates secularism prevent high fertility highly secular country high fertility rates societal level secularism also better predictor religious individuals fertility secular individuals largely due effects cultural values reproduction gender personal transmission values parents offspring nurture core area fertility research assumption parents transmit family values preferences attitudes religiosity children longterm effects analogous genetics researchers tried find causal relationship example number parents siblings number children born parents children quantum effect age first birth parents generation age first birth children tempo studies concerning tempo focus teenage mothers show young mother increases likelihood child young highincome countries number children person strongly correlates number children children eventually source danish data nonidentical twins growing environment compared identical twins indicated genetic influences largely override previously shared environmental birth order seem effect studies however show effect balanced childs attitudes result personal experiences religiosity education etc although mothers preference family size may influence children early childs attitudes take influence fertility effect cohabitation fertility varies across us cohabitation generally associated lower however another study found cohabiting couples france equal fertility married russians also shown higher fertility within survey data romania showed marriage equalized total fertility rate among highly educated limitededucation people approximately among cohabiting hand lower level education increased fertility rate higher level education decreased another study found romanian women little education equal fertility marital cohabiting study united states multiple countries europe found women continue cohabit giving birth significantly lower probability second child married women countries except eastern data generations gender survey showed women living mothers earlier first births mothers death early daughters life correlated higher probability childlessness hand survival fathers effect either outcome coresidence parents delayed first births resulted lower total fertility higher probability childlessness effect even stronger poor social support extended family friends help couple decide child another one studies mainly excommunist eastern european countries associated increased fertility increased social capital form personal relationships goods information money work capacity influence power personal help research us shows extended family willing provide support becomes safety net particularly important single mothers situations involving partnership total fertility rates higher among women rural areas among women urban areas evidenced highincome field researchers found fertility rates high remain relatively stable among rural populations little evidence exists suggest highfertility parents appear economically disadvantaged strengthening fact total fertility rates tend higher among women rural hand studies suggested higher population density associated decreased fertility shown studies fertility rates differ regions ways reflect opportunity costs child rearing region high population density women restrain many children due costs living therefore lowering fertility within urban areas people suburbs consistently found higher research indicates population density may explain variance fertility rates although effect population density fertility moderated factors environmental conditions religiosity social many studies attempted determine causal link government policies fertility however article suggests many factors potentially affect decisions children many separating factors effects particular government policy difficult making even difficult time lag government policy initiation purpose programs reduce opportunity cost children either increasing family income reducing cost one study found positive effect number children life due family policy programs make easier women combine family employment idea reduce opportunity cost children positive results found germany sweden canada however empirical studies show programs expensive impact tends small currently broad consensus effectiveness raising factors associated increase fertility include fertility declining advanced societies couples fewer children none delaying childbirth beyond womans fertile years factors lead trend complex probably vary country increased income human development generally associated decreased fertility economic theories declining fertility postulate people earning higher opportunity cost focus childbirth parenting rather continuing women economically sustain less incentive become higher income parents value quality quantity spend resources fewer hand evidence rising economic development fertility rates drop first begin rise level social economic development increases still remaining replacement researchers cite economic factors main driver fertility decline sociocultural theories focus changes values attitudes toward children primarily responsible example second demographic transition reflects changes personal goals religious preferences relationships perhaps important family also preference theory attempts explain womens choices regarding work versus family changed expansion options freedom choose option seems best keys recent declines comparative study europe found familyoriented women children workoriented women fewer children among factors preferences play major role deciding remain another example found europe postsoviet states values increased autonomy independence associated decreased results research attempts find causality education fertility one theory holds higher educated women likely become career women also higher educated women higher opportunity cost bearing children would lead higher educated women postpone marriage however studies suggest although higher educated women may postpone marriage births recuperate later age impact higher education united states large survey found women bachelors degree higher average children high school diploma equivalent average men levels education number children source needed europe hand women educated eventually many children less educated education results children older likewise study norway found bettereducated males decreased probability remaining childless although generally became fathers older catholic education university level lesser degree secondary school level associated higher fertility even accounting confounding effect higher religiosity among catholics leads higher probability attending religiously affiliated level countrys development often determines level womens education required affect fertility countries lower levels development gender equivalence likely find higher level womens education greater secondary level required affect fertility studies suggest many subsaharan african countries fertility decline linked female said fertility undeveloped countries still significantly reduced absence improvement general level formal education example period years fertility bangladesh fell almost per cent despite fact literacy rates especially women increase significantly reduction attributed countrys family planning program could called form informal china india oldest largest human population control programs china onechild policy introduced began formally phased favor twochild fertility rate china fell births per woman however efficacy onechild policy clear since already sharp reduction five births per woman early introduction onechild thereby suggested decline fertility rate would continued even without strict antinatalist china ended decade long one child police allowing couples two children result china large dependency ratio ageing population working extensive efforts put family planning india fertility rate dropped still indias family planning program regarded partially successful controlling fertility increased participation women workforce associated decreased fertility multicountry panel study found effect strongest among women aged less strong persistent effect among older women source neededbetter source needed international united nations data suggests women work economic necessity higher fertility work want however countries oecd area increased female labor participation associated increased causality analyses indicate fertility rate influences female labor participation way women work nurturing professions teaching health generally children earlier theorized women often selfselect jobs favorable balance order pursue motherhood regarding age female fertility fertility starts onset menses typically around age women become subfertile early early women become regarding age male fertility men decreased pregnancy rates increased time pregnancy increased infertility age although correlation substantial controlling age female partner comparisons men men found relative decreases pregnancy rates indian study found couples woman less one year younger man total mean number children compared woman years younger contraceptive revolution played crucial role reducing number children quantum postponing childbearing periods decreased use contraceptive pills due fears side effects linked increased fertility united introductions laws increase access contraceptives associated decreased fertility united however shortterm decreases fertility may reflect tempo effect later childbearing individuals using contraceptives catching later life review longterm fertility europe find fertility rates directly affected availability decision bear child advanced societies generally requires agreement partners disagreement partners may mean desire children one partner last several decades also seen changes partnership dynamics led tendency toward later marriages rise unmarried cohabitation linked postponement parenthood tempo thus reduced effects differed across study comparing gender equality netherlands italy found unequal division household work significantly reduce womans interest another study focused quality life women canada found women felt overburdened home tended fewer another study found ushaped relationship gender equity within couple fertility higher probability second child families either low high gender percent infertility cases due male infertility due female infertility due combined cases cause common
