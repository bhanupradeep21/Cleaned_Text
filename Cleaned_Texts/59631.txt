natural scene perception refers process agent human visually takes interprets scenes typically encounters natural modes operation eg busy streets meadows living process modeled several different ways guided different concepts one major dividing line theories explain natural scene perception role attention theories maintain need focused attention others claim focused attention involved focused attention played partial role early models natural scene perception models involved two stages visual according models first stage attention free registers low level features brightness gradients motion orientation parallel manner meanwhile second stage requires focused attention registers highlevel object descriptions limited capacity operates serially models empirically informed studies demonstrating change blindness inattentional blindness attentional blink studies show ones visual focused attention engaged task significant changes ones environment directly pertinent task escape awareness generally thought natural scene perception similarly susceptible change blindness inattentional blindness attentional blink psychological phenomena occurred engaging task diverts attentional resources would otherwise used natural scene perception attentionfree hypothesis soon emerged challenge early models initial basis attentionfree hypothesis finding visual search basic visual features objects immediately automatically pop person visual experiments seemed support potter cited evans treisman showed highorder representations accessed rapidly natural scenes presented rates per second additionally thorpe fize marlot cited evans treisman discovered humans primates categorize natural images ie animals everyday indoor outdoor scenes rapidly accurately even brief basic idea studies exposure individual scene brief attentional processes occur yet human beings able interpret categorize scenes weaker versions attentionfree hypothesis also targeted specific components natural scene perception process instead process whole kihara takeda limit claim saying integration spatial frequencybased information natural scenes subprocess natural scene perception attention claim based study used attentiondemanding tasks examine participants abilities accurately categorize images filtered wide range spatial frequencies logic behind experiment integration visual information across spatial frequencies measured categorization task preattentive attentiondemanding tasks affect performance categorization task indeed found case recent study cohen alvarez nakayama calls question validity evidence supporting attentionfree hypothesis found participants display inattentional blindness certain kinds multipleobject tracking mot rapid serial visual presentation rsvp furthermore cohen et al found participants natural scene perception impaired dualtask conditions dualtask impairment happened participants primary task sufficiently demanding authors concluded previous studies showing absence need focused attention use tasks demanding enough fully engage attention cohen et al study mot task involved viewing eight black moving discs presented changing background consisted randomly colored checkerboard masks four discs picked participants instructed track four discs rsvp task involved viewing stream letters digits presented series changing checkerboards counting number times digit presented experiments critical trial involved natural scene suddenly replacing second last checkerboard participants immediately afterwards asked whether noticed anything different well presented six questions determine whether categorized scene dualtask condition simply involved participants performing mot task mentioned sceneclassification task simultaneously authors varied difficulty task ie demanding task increasing decreasing speed moving discs models proposed purpose explaining natural scene perception evans treisman proposed hypothesis humans rapidly detect disjunctive sets unbound features target categories parallel manner use features discriminate scenes contain target without necessarily fully identifying example feature would outstretched wings used tell whether bird picture even system identified object bird evans treisman propose natural scene perception involves first pass visual processing hierarchy nodes visual identification network optional revisiting earlier levels detailed analysis first pass stage system forms global representation natural scene includes layout global boundaries potential objects revisiting stage focused attention employed select local objects interest serial manner bind features representations hypothesis consistent results study participants instructed detect animal targets rsvp sequences report identities locations participants able detect targets trials often subsequently unable identify localize furthermore two targets presented quick succession participants displayed significant attentional blink required identify targets attentional blink mostly eliminated among participants required detect evans treisman explain results hypothesis attentional blink occurs identification stage requires attentional resources detection stage ultrarapid visual categorization model proposing automatic feedforward mechanism forms highlevel object representations parallel without focused attention model mechanism sped training evidence feedforward mechanism found studies shown many neurons already highly selective beginning visual response thus suggesting feedback mechanisms required response selectivity furthermore recent fmri erp studies shown masked visual stimuli participants consciously perceive significantly modulate activity motor system thus suggesting somewhat sophisticated visual vanrullen ran simulations showing feedforward propagation one wave spikes highlevel neurons generated response stimulus could enough crude recognition categorization occurs ms xu
