breeding recommended prior second domesticated species domestication selectively bred higher libido earlier frequent breeding cycles dogs average length reproductive cycle females weeks females reach sexual maturity puberty months age tremendous variability maturation age breeds even within breed proestrus eggs ovaries begin mature estrogen levels begin rise first stage reproductive cycle stage females though nonreceptive attract males initial changes include swelling vulva lips become pliable small amounts bloody vaginal discharge frequent urination signs restlessness proestrus generally lasts nine estrus follows estrogen levels high mature eggs released ovaries females become receptive physically mentally copulation estrus copulation result pregnancy proestrus estrus females may
