nicotinic receptors get name nicotine stimulate muscarinic acetylcholine receptors selectively binds nicotinic receptors muscarinic acetylcholine receptor likewise gets name chemical selectively attaches receptor acetylcholine binds muscarinic nicotinic acetylcholine ionotropic receptors nachrs directly linked ion channels new evidence suggests receptors also use second messengers metabotropic receptors nicotinic acetylcholine receptors beststudied ionotropic since nicotinic receptors help transmit outgoing signals sympathetic parasympathetic systems nicotinic receptor

stabilizes open desensitized states normal physiological conditions receptor needs exactly two molecules ach opening channel allows positively charged ions move across particular sodium enters cell potassium exits net flow positively charged ions inward nachr nonselective cation channel meaning several different positively charged ions cross permeable na k subunit combinations also permeable amount sodium potassium channels allow pores conductance varies ps conductance depending specific subunit composition well permeant many neuronal nachrs affect release channel usually opens rapidly tends remain open agonist diffuses away usually takes achrs spontaneously open ligands bound spontaneously close ligands bound mutations channel shift likelihood either therefore ach binding changes
