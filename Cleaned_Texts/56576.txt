allergic conjunctivitis ac inflammation conjunctiva membrane covering white part eye due although allergens differ among patients common cause hay fever symptoms consist redness mainly due vasodilation peripheral small blood vessels edema swelling conjunctiva itching increased lacrimation production tears combined rhinitis condition termed allergic rhinoconjunctivitis arc symptoms due
