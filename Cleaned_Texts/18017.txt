pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction ppid equine cushings disease endocrine disease affecting pituitary gland horses commonly seen older classically associated formation long wavy coat hirsutism chronic laminitis unlike human canine forms cushings disease commonly affect pars distalis region pituitary gland equine cushings disease result hyperplasia adenoma formation pars adenoma secretes excessive amounts normal products leading clinical signs pituitary gland consists three parts pars nervosa pars intermedia pars distalis critical structure ppid pars intermedia regulated hypothalamus neurons hypothalamus innervate cells known melanotropes within pars intermedia releasing dopamine binds dopamine receptors melanotropes activation dopamine receptors leads inhibition proopiomelanocortin pomc production ppidaffected horses dopamine produced neurons leading dopamine levels level normally found pars thought due neurodegeneration neurons secondary free radical formation oxidative without regulation dopamine pars intermedia develops hyperplasia adenoma formation leading gross enlargement excessive production pomc adenomas also potential compress hypothalamus optic pomc produced melanotropes pars intermedia cleaved adrenocorticotropic hormone acth βlipotropin βlph majority cleaved αmsh corticotropinlike intermediate peptide clip clip thought influence subsequent insulin resistance seen ppid acth also produced corticotropes pars distalis equine pituitary normal horse accounts majority acth production acth produced pars distalis subject negative feedback normal horse high cortisol levels reduce acth production pituitary subsequently reducing cortisol levels horse ppid acth levels high result pars intermedia production subject negative feedback regulation despite high levels acth cortisol levels vary sometimes lower normal additionally hyperplasia adrenal cortex role acth therefore still poorly understood ppid diagnosed horses young years although horses first diagnosed ages estimated horses older years breeds may develop ppid pony breeds morgans seem commonly many signs associated ppid subset displayed single horse horses may present chronic laminitis without overt signs complete blood counts serum chemistry profiles may normal affected persistent hyperglycemia glucosuria commonly hyperlipidemia may present especially abnormalities associated disease include mild anemia neurophilia lymphopenia eosinopenia increased liver ppid shares similarities equine metabolic syndrome ems also causes regional adiposity laminitis insulin resistance treatment management may differ two endocrinopathies making differentiation important importantly though horses ems may develop ppid diseases may occur test may also referred resting acth endogenous acth basal acth majority acth produced normal horses comes corticotrope cells pars distalis thought come melanotropes pars intermedia horses ppid melanotropes produce abnormally high concentrations basal plasma acth concentrations measure blood levels circulating acth therefore useful diagnosing acth levels naturally fluctuate healthy horses significant rise occurring autumn august october north american horses horses ppid similar much significant rise autumn therefore seasonally adjusted reference range must used correlates time year sample failure use seasonally adjusted reference range may lead falsepositive results normal horses sampled autumnal testing thought sensitive specific testing times year however concept recently basal plasma acth levels may increase horse severely ill great stress pain laminitis however events must fairly significant confound additionally acth levels may significantly increased early disease leading false thyrotropinreleasing hormone trh receptors present melanotropes pars intermedia corticotropes pars distalis administration exogenous trh causes increase acth αmsh plasma normal horses ppid cases plasma acth peaks minutes administration slowly dropping normal levels course hour ppid horses however show much greater peak normal horses especially test relatively simple involving one blood sample taken trh administration one minutes minutes following trh currently licensed use horses cause various side effects including yawning flehmen muscle trembling test thought greater sensitivity tests drawbacks including cost trh availability limited repeatability lack defined seasonal reference due lack seasonal references recommended use december dexamethasone suppression test involves administering dexamethasone synthetic glucocorticoid horse measuring serum cortisol levels hours injection normal horse dexamethasone administration results negative feedback pituitary resulting decreased acth production pars distalis therefore decreased synthesis cortisol level adrenal gland horse ppid overactive pars intermedia regulated glucocorticoid levels suppress acth production therefore cortisol levels remain high false negatives occur early additionally dexamethasone administration may increase risk laminitis horses already prone reasons dexamethasone suppression test currently recommended ppid testing although corticoidtocreatinine ratios generally higher horses ppid numerous false positives false negatives occur test resting plasma cortisol may slightly elevated affected horses commonly within normal limits normal additionally elevations may occur secondary stress concurrent disease due individual variation therefore resting cortisol levels alone adequate diagnose rule presence horses suspected ppid undergo testing disease insulin dysfunction see horses showing obvious signs ppid likely positive endogenous acth test horses early disease may produce falsenegative result horses thyrotropinreleasing hormone stimulation test either used initial screening test confirm false resting insulin dysregulation commonly seen horses ppid equine metabolic syndrome interest primarily link laminitis horses id increased insulin response given oral sugars cause subsequent rise blood insulin levels hyperinsulinemia hyperinsulinemia results decreased tissue sensitivity insulin insulin resistance especially skeletal muscle liver adipose tissue tissue insulin resistance causes increased insulin secretion perpetuates trigger insulin resistance fully understood genetics likely impact risk postprandial hyperinsulinemia obesity pregnancy ppid inflammatory states may contribute tissue insulin resistance ppid thought result increased insulin secretion due higher levels clip produced melanotrophs cause insulin resistance secondary due strong link ppid insulin resistance testing recommended horses suspected confirmed suffering ppid two tests commonly used insulin resistance oral sugar test fasting insulin blood fasting insulin concentration involves giving horse single flake hay pm night testing blood drawn following morning insulin glucose blood levels measured hyperinsulinemia suggests insulin resistance normal low fasting insulin rule ppid test easy perform less sensitive oral sugar best used cases risks laminitis make oral sugar test potentially oral sugar test also requires giving horse single flake hay night test following morning karo corn syrup given orally glucose insulin levels measured minutes administration normal excessively high insulin levels diagnostic however equivocal test results require retesting later date performing different similar test available outside us areas cornsyrup products less readily available horses given morning meal chaff dextrose powder blood insulin levels measured hours main methods management involve exercise diet change addition treatment ppid primary goal reduction weight obese animal diet changes include limiting pasture access reducing eliminating grain obese animals often best maintained diet consisting ration balancer hay fed body weight decreased feed selected based low nonstructural carbohydrate nsc levels hay nsc levels may reduced soaking cold water exercise increased nonlaminitic horses animals resistant weight loss despite diet exercise changes placed levothyroxine increase metabolism metformin also used reduce glucose absorption intestinal primary treatment ppid pergolide dopamine agonist provides suppression pars intermedia place dysfunctional hypothalamus horses reassessed days following start treatment evaluation clinical signs baseline diagnostic testing ensure appropriate dose prescribed results test dictate changes dose horses responding treatment retested every months including test autumn seasonal increase acth occurs ensure acth levels appropriately suppressed time drug side effects include transient decrease appetite reduced slowly increasing dose therapeutic levels breaking daily dose twicedaily attitude activity levels hyperglycemia increased drinking urination usually improved within days initiating treatment clinical signs hirsutism potbellied appearance muscle wasting laminitic episodes increased predisposition infection usually take days year cyproheptadine may added treatment regimen horses
