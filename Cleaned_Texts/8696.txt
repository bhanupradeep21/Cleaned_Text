generic formulations drug available intravenous flumazenil primarily used treat benzodiazepine overdoses help reverse anesthesia administration flumazenil sublingual lozenge topical cream also flumazenil benefits patients become excessively drowsy use benzodiazepines either diagnostic therapeutic drug used antidote treatment benzodiazepine reverses effects benzodiazepines competitive inhibition benzodiazepine bz recognition site gababenzodiazepine receptor complex many complications must taken consideration used acute care include lowered seizure threshold agitation anxiousness flumazenils short halflife requires multiple doses potential risks withdrawal symptoms drugs short halflife patients must carefully monitored prevent recurrence overdose symptoms adverse side effects flumazenil also sometimes used surgery reverse sedative effects benzodiazepines similar naloxones application reverse effect opiates opioids following surgery administration drug requires careful monitoring anesthesiologist due potential side effects serious risks associated overadministeration likewise postsurgical monitoring also necessary flumazenil mask apparent metabolization wearing drug

daytime sleepiness improving vigilance primary hypersomnias idiopathic drug also used hepatic encephalopathy may beneficial effects people cirrhosis evidence longterm onset action rapid effects usually seen within one two minutes peak effect seen six ten minutes recommended dose adults μg every minutes effect seen maximum mg per hour available clear colourless solution intravenous injection containing μg mlcitation needed additional doses may needed within min evidence oversedation many benzodiazepines including midazolam longer halflives flumazenil therefore cases overdose repeated
