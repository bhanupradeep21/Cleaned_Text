tolerance ability plants mitigate negative fitness effects caused herbivory one general plant defense strategies herbivores resistance ability plants prevent damage strauss agrawal plant defense strategies play important roles survival plants fed upon many different types herbivores especially insects may impose negative fitness effects strauss zangerl damage occur almost part plants including roots stems leaves flowers seeds strauss zergerl response herbivory plants evolved wide variety defense mechanisms although relatively less studied resistance strategies tolerance traits play major role plant defense strauss zergerl rosenthal kotanen traits confer tolerance controlled genetically therefore heritable traits selection strauss agrawal many factors intrinsic plants growth rate storage capacity photosynthetic rates nutrient allocation uptake affect extent plants tolerate damage rosenthal kotanen extrinsic factors soil nutrition carbon dioxide levels light levels water availability competition also effect tolerance rosenthal kotanen studies tolerance herbivory historically focus agricultural scientists painter bardner fletcher tolerance actually initially classified form resistance painter agricultural studies tolerance however mainly concerned compensatory effect plants yield fitness since economical interest reduce crop losses due herbivory pests trumble bardner fletcher one surprising discovery made plant tolerance plants overcompensate damaged caused herbivory causing controversy whether herbivores plants actually form mutualistic relationship belsky soon recognized many factors involved plants tolerance photosynthetic rates nutrient allocation also traits intrinsic plant growth resource availability may play important role hilbert et al maschinski whitham growth rate model proposed hilbert et al predicts plants higher tolerance environments allow grow maximum capacity compensatory continuum hypothesis maschinski whitham predicts higher tolerance resource rich environments although latter received higher acceptance years later limiting resource model proposed explain lack agreement empirical data existing models wise

ipomopsis aggregata increased flower production flower larceny reproductive structures present resources allocated tissues leaves shoots seen juvenile plantago lanceolata trumble et al barton utilizing stored reserves may important tolerance mechanism plants abundant time collect store resources perennial plants tiffin erb et al resources often stored leaves specialized storage organs tubers roots studies shown evidence resources allocated regrowth following herbivory trumble et al tiffin erb et al however importance mechanism tolerance well studied unknown much contributes tolerance since stored reserves mostly consist carbon resources whereas tissue damage causes loss carbon nitrogen nutrients tiffin form tolerance relies constitutive mechanisms morphology time damage unlike induced mechanisms mentioned plant architecture includes roots shoots ratios stem number stem rigidity plant vasculature marquis tiffin high roots shoots ratio allow plants better absorb nutrients following herbivory rigid stems prevent collapse sustaining damage increasing plant tolerance tiffin since plants meristemic construction resources restricted among different regions plants referred sectoriality affect ability transfer resources undamaged areas damaged areas marquis although plant vasculature may play important roles tolerance well studied due difficulties identifying flow resources marquis increasing plants vasculature would seem advantageous since increases flow resources sites damage may also increase susceptibility herbivores phloem suckers marquis stowe et al tolerance operationally defined slope regression fitness level damage stinchcombe since individual plant sustain one level damage necessary measure fitness using group related individuals preferably

majority studies use simulated manipulated herbivory clipping leaves herbivore exclusions due difficulty controlling damage levels natural conditions tiffin inouye advantage using natural herbivory plants experience pattern damage selection favored tolerance may biases resulting unmeasured environmental variables may affect plant herbivores using simulated herbivory allows control environmental

plants herbivory often plastic varies according conditions experiencing wise abrahamson major resources affect plant growth also tolerance water light carbon dioxide soil nutrients water light levels generally assumed positively associated tolerance strauss agrawal however exceptions evidence decreased tolerance madia sativa increased water availability wise abrahamson gonzales et al many studies found levels decrease tolerance plants lau tiffin increased nutrient levels also commonly found negatively associated tolerance wise abrahamson currently three prominent models predict resource levels may alter plants tolerance herbivory grm proposes growth rate plant time damage important determining response hilbert et al plants growing stressful conditions low resource levels high competition growing maximum growth rate may higher capacity regrowth receiving damage hilbert et al contrast plants relatively benign conditions growing near maximum growth rate plants less able recover damage since already near innate maximum growth rate hilbert et al cch suggests continuum responses herbivory maschinski whitham predicts plants growing less stressful environment conditions high resource low competition better able tolerate herbivory since abundant resources replace lost tissues recover damage plants growing stressful environments predicted lower tolerance maschinski whitham recently proposed model takes account resource limiting plant fitness resource affected herbivory acquisition resources affected herbivory wise abrahamson unlike grm cch able incorporate type damage received since different modes herbivory may cause different resources affected herbivory lrm encompasses every possible outcome tolerance ie equal tolerance environments higher tolerance low stress

metaanalyses hawkes sullivan wise abrahamson found cch grm insufficient predicting diversity plant tolerance herbivory banta et al however suggested lrm represented set seven models instead one since individual part lrm requires different assumptions classically assumed tolerance traits impose selection herbivore fitness strauss agrawal contrast traits confer resistance likely affect herbivore
