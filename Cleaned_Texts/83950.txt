pseudohalogen carbon atom cyanogen bromide bonded bromine single bond nitrogen triple bond ie compound linear polar spontaneously ionize water dissolves water polar organic solvents cyanogen bromide prepared oxidation sodium cyanide bromine proceeds two steps via intermediate cyanogen refrigerated material extended shelflife like cyanogen compounds cyanogen bromide undergoes exothermic trimerisation cyanuric bromide reaction catalyzed traces bromine metal salts acids reason experimentalists avoid brownish cyanogen bromide hydrolyzed form hydrogen cyanate hydrobromic acid main uses cyanogen bromide immobilize proteins fragment proteins cleaving peptide bonds synthesize cyanamides molecules cyanogen bromide often used immobilize proteins coupling reagents agarose affinity simplicity mild ph conditions cyanogen bromide activation common method preparing affinity gels cyanogen bromide also often used reacts hydroxyl groups agarose form cyanate esters imidocarbonates groups reacted primary amines order couple protein onto agarose matrix shown figure cyanate esters reactive cyclic imidocarbonates amine react mostly ester yielding isourea derivatives partially less reactive imidocarbonate yielding substituted disadvantages approach include toxicity cyanogen bromide sensitivity oxidation also cyanogen bromide activation involves attachment ligand agarose isourea bond positively charged neutral ph thus unstable consequently isourea derivatives may act weak anion link cyanogen bromide hydrolyzes peptide bonds cterminus methionine residues reaction used reduce size polypeptide segments identification sequencing electron density cyanogen bromide shifted away carbon atom making unusually electrophilic towards electronegative bromine nitrogen leaves carbon particularly vulnerable attack nucleophile cleavage reaction begins nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction bromine ultimately replaced sulfur methionine attack followed formation fivemembered ring opposed sixmembered ring would entail formation double bond ring nitrogen carbon double bond would result rigid ring conformation thereby destabilizing molecule thus fivemembered ring formed double bond outside ring shown figure although nucleophilic sulfur methionine responsible attacking brcn sulfur cysteine behave similarly sulfur cysteine attacked cyanogen bromide bromide ion would deprotonate cyanide adduct leaving sulfur uncharged beta carbon cysteine electrophilic strongest electrophile would cyanide carbon attacked water would yield cyanic acid original cysteine cleaving proteins brcn requires using buffer hcl hydrochloric acid formic common buffers cleavage advantage hcl formic acid causes formation formyl esters complicates protein characterization however formic still often used dissolves proteins also oxidation methionine methionine sulfoxide inert brcn attack occurs readily hcl formic acid possibly formic acid reducing acid alternative buffers cleavage include guanidine urea hcl ability unfold proteins thereby making methionine accessible water required normal peptide bond cleavage iminolactone intermediate formic acid cleavage metser metthr bonds enhanced increased water concentration conditions favor addition water across imine rather reaction side chain hydroxyl imine lowered ph tends increase cleavage rates inhibiting methionine side chain methionine followed serine threonine side reactions occur destroy methionine without peptide bond cleavage normally iminolactone formed refer figure water acid react imine cleave peptide bond forming homoserine lactone new cterminal peptide however adjacent amino acid methionine hydroxyl sulfhydryl group group react imine form homoserine without peptide bond two cases shown figure cyanogen bromide

dialkylcyanamides react amines hydroxylamine yield guanidines hydroxyguanidines von braun reaction tertiary amines react brcn yield disubstituted cyanamides alkyl bromide cyanogen bromide used prepare
