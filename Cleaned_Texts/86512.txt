extrapair copulation epc mating behaviour monogamous species monogamy practice one sexual partner one time forming longterm bond combining efforts raise offspring together mating outside pairing extrapair across animal kingdom extrapair copulation common monogamous species pairbonded species thought exclusively sexually monogamous epc animal kingdom mostly studied birds possible benefits epc investigated within nonhuman species males number theories proposed explain extrapair copulations one hypothesis males maximise reproductive success copulating many females possible outside pair bond relationship parental investment lower meaning copulate leave female minimum risk females hand invest lot offspring extrapair copulations produce greater cost put resources mate offer risk copulating outside despite females seek extra pair risk debate evolutionary benefits females extrapair copulation men explained partly due parental research copulation poses risk future investment women potential becoming pregnant consequently require large parental investment gestation period rearing offspring contrastingly men able copulate abandon mate risk pregnancy meaning smaller risk parental investment possible suggested due low parental investment evolutionarily adaptive men copulate many women possible allow males spread genes little risk future investment come increased risk sexually transmitted various factors increase probability epc males firstly males low levels fluctuating asymmetry likely may due fact signals low fluctuating asymmetry suggest males good genes making females likely copulate enhance genes offspring even expect longterm commitment psychosocial stress early life including behaviours physical violence substance abuse predict epc later explained due life history theory argues individuals reared environments resources scarce life expectancy low likely engage reproductive behaviours earlier life order ensure proliferation individuals reared environments said short life histories respect life history theory finding explained suggesting males experienced psychosocial stress early life short life histories making likely try reproduce much possible engaging epc avoid gene however men may also choose epcs multiple reasons one reason may longterm monogamous relationships help form environments aid successful rearing offspring male present help raise leading increased probability males genes surviving next second reason epcs may avoided male costly epc may discovered leading dissolution longterm relationship partner cases lead partner assaulting even killing men may also avoid epcs minimize risk putting increased opportunity std transmission common epcs partners epc may promiscuous well leading higher statistical chance probability contracting venereal diseases would counter lower incidence std transmission among exclusively monogamous sexually active couples spousal homicide likely committed males rather females may make ramifications epc relevant evolutionary perspective females invest lot offspring males due prolonged pregnancy child rearing child better chance survival development two parents involved therefore extrapair copulations greater cost women put support resources mate offer risk copulating outside also increased risk sexually transmitted suggested possible evolutionary reason transition polygamous monogamous relationships despite females seek extrapair copulation research finding womens levels infidelity equal mens although evidence due increased risk confusion evolutionary benefits extrapair copulation females common theory women mate outside monogamous relationship acquire better genetic material offspring female relationship male poorer genetic quality may try enhance fitness children therefore continuation genes engaging extrapair copulation better quality second theory woman engage extrapair copulation seek additional resources based observations animal world females may copulate outside pairbond relationship neighbours gain extra protection food nesting materials finally evolutionary psychologists theorized extrapair copulation indirect result selection males alleles males promote extrapair copulation evolutionary strategy increase reproductive success shared sexes leading behaviour expressed also social factors involved extrapair copulation males females found engage sexual behaviour outside monogamous relationship experiencing sexual dissatisfaction although links evolutionary theory unclear surveys found cultural differences attitudes towards infidelity though relatively consistent female attitudes less favorable toward infidelity male well humans epc found many socially monogamous epc occurs animals show sustained femalemale social bonding lead extrapair paternity epp female reproduces extrapair male hence produces epo extrapair due obvious reproductive success benefits used thought males exclusively controlled however known females also seek epc extrapair copulation common example zebra finches although socially monogamous sexually monogamous hence engage extrapair courtship attempts laboratory study female zebra finches copulated several days many times one male another male results found significantly eggs fertilised extrapair male expected proportionally one copulation verses many copulations epc proportion varies different species example eastern bluebirds studies shown around offspring due highest levels epp found new zealand hihistitchbird notiomystis cincta offspring sired epc significant consequences parental care shown azurewinged magpie cyanopica socially polygynous birds epc half common socially monogamous birds ethologists consider finding support female choice hypothesis mating systems epc shown monogamous mammals whitehanded study one group found inpair copulation extrapair however much variability rates epc one study found disparity epc better predicted differing social structures different mammals rather differing types pair bonding example epc lower species live pairs compared live solitary family argue epc one way sexual selection operating genetic benefits extrapair males involved epc seem nonrandom evidence example swallows males longer tails involved epc shorter also female swallows shortertailed withinpair mates likely conduct epc whose mates longer similar pattern found blackcapped chickadees extrapair males higher rank withinpair argue genetic benefits offspring reason females participate metaanalysis genetic benefits epc bird species found extrapair offspring likely survive withinpair offspring also extrapair males show significantly better goodgenes traits withinpair males except slightly larger another potential explanation occurrence epc organisms females solicit epc alleles controlling behaviour intersexually pleiotropic hypothesis intersexual antagonistic pleiotropy benefit males get epc cancels negative effects epc females thus allele controls epc organisms
