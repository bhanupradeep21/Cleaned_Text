flynn effect substantial longsustained increase fluid crystallized intelligence test scores measured many parts world intelligence quotient iq tests initially standardized using sample testtakers convention average test results set standard deviation set iq points iq tests revised standardized using new sample testtakers usually born recently first average result set new test subjects take

suggested iq gains reflected changes modes thinking better reflected cognitive skills assessed iq tests rather raw intelligence duration average schooling increased steadily one problem explanation us comparing older recent subjects similar educational levels iq gains appear almost undiminished group considered many studies find children attend school score drastically lower tests regularly attending peers virginia counties closed public schools avoid racial integration compensatory private schooling available white children average scores africanamerican children received formal education period decreased rate six iq points per another explanation increased familiarity general population tests testing example children take iq test second time usually gain five six points however seems set upper limit effects test sophistication one problem explanation others related schooling us groups greater test familiarity show smaller iq early intervention programs shown mixed results preschool ages intervention programs like head start produce lasting changes iq although may confer benefitswhich abecedarian early intervention project allday program provided various forms environmental enrichment children infancy onward showed iq gains diminish time iq gains experimental group compared control group points gains persisted least age citing high correlation rising

presented model resolving several contradictory findings regarding iq argue measure heritability includes direct effect genotype iq also indirect effects genotype changes environment thereby affecting iq greater iq tend seek stimulating environments increase iq reciprocal effects result gene environment correlation direct effect could initially small feedback create large differences iq model environmental stimulus great effect iq even adults effect also decays time unless stimulus continues model could adapted include possible factors like nutrition early childhood may cause permanent effects flynn effect explained generally stimulating environment people authors suggest program designed increase iq may produce longterm iq gains program teaches children replicate types cognitively

environmental changes resulting intellectually demanding work greater use technology smaller meant much larger proportion people accustomed manipulating abstract concepts hypotheses categories century

head size increase average size argument thought suffer difficulty groups tend smaller overall body size eg women people asian ancestry lower average study presented data supporting nutrition hypothesis predicts gains occur predominantly low end iq distribution nutritional deprivation probably alternative interpretation skewed iq gains could improved education particularly important
