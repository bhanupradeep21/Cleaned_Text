eustachian tubes passages connect middle ear pharynx complex crocodilians unlike vertebrates tubes made several interconnected branches branching fully developed sebecus probably appeared much earlier jaw muscles sebecus likely similar living crocodilians distinctively deep skull sebecus indicates muscles longer sebecus shape skull jaws provides room adductor muscles muscles close jaws
