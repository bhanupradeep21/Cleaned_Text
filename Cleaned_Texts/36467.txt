fishless cycling form maturing aquarium process ammonia provided allow beneficial bacteria colonize fishless cycling reduce chance fish loss resulting insufficient populations bacteria fishless cycling takes place period several weeks aquarist provides ammonia source development nitrifying bacterial colony nitrifying bacteria aquarium grow surfaces particularly areas high water flow high surface area filter allowing ammonia converted nitrite less harmful nitrate minimizes stress injury aquarium nitrogen cycle may take several weeks complete may quicker certain conditions higher water temperatures greater dissolved oxygen bacterial seeding established tank may cut time required less significant advantage fishless cycling reduce fish loss due ammonia nitrite spikes fish loss discouraging beginners fish keeping indirectly fishless cycling also help beginners get good start cycling aquariums using feeder fish risky infects aquarium disease parasite happen fish raised feeders get degree care nonfeeders fishless cycling avoids potential problem fishless cycling also allows aquarium partially stocked moment cycled nitrogen cycle completed high concentration pure ammonia added daily means large aquariums fish must added several batches fishless cycling faster cycling fish also extremely useful fish keeper plan stock tank full territorial aggressive fish african cichlids later added fish disadvantage however care adding ammonia fishless cycling must used high ammonium concentration kill helpful bacteria problems ammonium hydroxide ammonium chloride used source ammonia httpsenwikipediaorgwikifishlesscycling
