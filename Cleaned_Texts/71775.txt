biology colony composed two conspecific individuals living close association connected one another association usually mutual benefit stronger defense ability attack bigger colonies form various shapes ways depending organism involved instance bacterial colony cluster identical cells clones colonies often form grow surface within solid medium usually derived single parent colonies context development may composed two unitary solitary organisms modular organisms unitary organisms determinate development set life stages zygote adult form individuals groups individuals colonies visually distinct modular indeterminate growth forms life stages set repeated iteration genetically identical modules individuals difficult distinguish colony whole modules latter case modules may specific functions within colony contrast solitary organisms associate colonies ones individuals live independently functions needed survive reproduce organisms primarily independent form facultative colonies reply environmental conditions others must live colony survive obligate example carpenter bees form colonies dominant hierarchy formed two nest facultative colony corals animals physically connected living tissue coenosarc contains shared gastrovascular cavity unicellular multicellular unitary organisms may aggregate form colonies example modular organisms genet genetic individual formed sexuallyproduced zygote asexually reproduces form genetically identical clones called clonal colony ramets genet live close proximity physically connected ramets may functions needed survive interdependent ramets example sea anemones go process pedal laceration genetically identical individual asexually produced tissue broken anemones pedal disc plants clonal colonies created propagation genetically identical trees stolons rhizomes colonial organisms clonal colonies composed many physically connected interdependent individuals subunits colonial organisms unicellular alga volvox coenobium multicellular phylum bryozoa colonial organisms may first step toward multicellular individuals within multicellular colonial organism may called ramets modules zooids structural functional variation polymorphism present designates ramet responsibilities feeding reproduction defense end physically connected allows colonial organism distribute nutrients energy obtained feeding zooids throughout colony hydrozoan portuguese man war classic example colonial organism one many taxonomic microbial colony defined visible cluster microorganisms growing surface within solid medium presumably cultured single colony clonal organisms descending single ancestor assuming contamination genetically identical except mutations occur low frequencies obtaining genetically identical organisms pure strains useful done spreading organisms culture plate starting new stock single resulting biofilm colony microorganisms often comprising several species properties capabilities greater aggregate capabilities individual organismscitation needed colony ontogeny refers developmental process progression colony describes various stages changes occur within colony initial formation mature exact duration dynamics colony ontogeny vary greatly depending species environmental factors resource availability competition environmental cues influence progression outcome colony developmentcitation needed colony ontogeny eusocial insects ants bees colony goes several distinct phases characterised specific behavioural patterns division labor structural modifications exact details vary depending species general progression typically involves number welldefined stages detailed initial stage single female individual small group female individuals often called foundresses queens kings termites primary reproductives establish new colony foundresses build basic nest structure begin lay eggs foundresses also perform nonreproductive tasks early stage nursing first eggs leaving nest gather resources also known ergonomic stage eggs laid foundresses develop give rise first generation workers workers assume various tasks foraging brood care nest maintenance initially worker population relatively small tasks specialised colony grows workers emerge division labor becomes pronounced individuals may specialise tasks like foraging defense tending brood others may take general tasks within specialised tasks change throughout life worker certain point colony ontogeny usually period growth maturation colony produces reproductives including new virgin queens princesses males individuals potential leave nest start new colonies ensuring transmission gene pool natal colony time colonies may go senescence phase reproductive output declines colonys overall vitality diminishes eventually colony may die replaced new generation reproductives death queen monogyne colony possible fates colony death include serial polygyny virgin queen colony replaces dead queen primary reproductive colony inheritance worker takes primary reproductivecitation needed individuals social colonies modular organisms receive benefit lifestyle example may easier seek food defend nesting site increase competitive ability species modular organisms ability reproduce asexually addition sexually allows unique benefits social colonies energy required sexual reproduction varies based frequency length reproductive activity number size offspring parental solitary individuals bear energy costs individuals social colonies share portion costscitation needed modular organisms save energy using asexual reproduction life energy reserved way allows put energy towards colony growth regenerating lost modules due predation cause death response environmental conditionscitation needed
