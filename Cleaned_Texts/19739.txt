stages hiv infection acute infection also known primary infection latency aids acute infection lasts several weeks may include symptoms fever swollen lymph nodes inflammation throat rash muscle pain malaise mouth esophageal sores latency stage involves symptoms last anywhere two weeks twenty years depending individual aids final stage hiv infection defined low cell counts fewer per μl various opportunistic infections cancers conditions acute hiv infection primary hiv infection acute seroconversion second stage hiv infection occurs incubation stage latency stage potential aids succeeding latency stage period usually days weeks postexposure fifty ninety percent infected individuals develop influenza mononucleosislike illness called acute hiv infection hiv common symptoms may include fever lymphadenopathy pharyngitis rash myalgia malaise mouth esophageal sores may also include less commonly headache nausea vomiting fatigue ulcers mouth genitals enlarged liverspleen weight loss thrush night sweats diarrhea neurological symptoms infected individuals may experience none duration symptoms varies averaging days usually lasts least nonspecific nature symptoms often recognized signs hiv infection even patients go doctors hospital often misdiagnosed one common infectious diseases symptoms consequence primary symptoms used diagnose hiv infection develop cases many caused common diseases however recognizing syndrome important patient much infectious strong immune defense reduces number viral particles bloodstream marking start secondary chronic hiv infection secondary stage hiv infection vary two weeks years secondary phase infection hiv active within lymph nodes typically become persistently swollen response large amounts virus become trapped follicular dendritic cells fdc surrounding tissues rich cells may also become infected viral particles accumulate infected cells free virus individuals phase still infectious time cells carry proviral small percentage infected individuals retain high levels tcells without antiretroviral therapy however detectable viral loads eventually progress aids without treatment individuals classified hiv controllers longterm nonprogressors ltnp people maintain cell counts also low clinically undetectable viral load without antiretroviral treatment known elite controllers elite suppressors symptoms aids primarily result

esophagitis inflammation lining lower end esophagus gullet swallowing tube leading stomach hivinfected individuals normally due fungal candidiasis viral herpes cytomegalovirus infections rare cases could due unexplained chronic diarrhea hiv infection due many possible causes including common bacterial salmonella shigella listeria campylobacter parasitic infections uncommon opportunistic infections cryptosporidiosis microsporidiosis mycobacterium avium complex mac astrovirus adenovirus rotavirus cytomegalovirus latter course colitis cases diarrhea may side effect several drugs used treat hiv may simply accompany hiv infection particularly primary hiv infection may also side effect antibiotics used treat bacterial causes diarrhea common clostridium difficile later stages hiv
