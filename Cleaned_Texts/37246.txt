hyperlexia hypermnesia study published examined reading math achievement profiles changes time within sample children ages diagnosed autism spectrum disorder found four distinct achievement profiles higherachieving hyperlexia hypercalculia lowerachieving previous study conducted estimated rate hypercalculia asd according wei christiano yu wagner spiker research asd achievement profile hypercalculia sometimes overlooked academic settings sometimes oversight result resources spent understanding capabilities children exhibit hyperlexia children asd shown various results testing hypercalulia varied results indicate average performance mathematical problem solving tasks average proficiency highachievers topping percentile standardized math achievement ongoing debate concerning cause hypercalculia along savant perceptions researchers theorize obsessive tendencies may trigger greater attention certain areas individuals autism sometimes focus lot time energy attention schedules routines calendar calculations numbers counting andor researchers speculate people savant tendencies may use different brain areas processing subjects higher abilities among debate arguments

manual mental disorders fourth edition dsmiv five different types disorders autism spectrum listed autistic disorder asperger disorder childhood disintegrative disorder rett disorder pervasive developmental disorder otherwise specified study behavior children autism spectrum exhibited intellectual abilities observed behavior children compared children normal intellectual status research shows children tended internalize problems investigation proffers suggestion internalization due social language impairments many children autism spectrum different savant perceptions hypercalculia hyperlexia semantic hypermnesia tended internalize problems children likely experience anxiety low selfesteem perfectionism struggles social life social issues stem withdrawal social circumstances unwillingness share lot children observed fell two types disorders spectrum ppd asperger disorder results show little difference behavior children considered highachieving intellectual abilities children intellectually towards end twentieth century recognition autistic children including autistic children savant abilities increased awareness educational main names savant children first category savants first discovered london dr j langdon coined term idiot savant term given individuals iq score individuals show average intelligence areas still show gifted expertise among areas music arithmetic reading writing art name idiot savant longer acceptable name categorization used much anymore mainly discontinued first century discovery almost individuals diagnosed savant aptitudes test iq second name often used children autistic savant like downs term autistic savant always appropriate savant cases half individuals savant syndrome autistic half savant population suffer central nervous system deficiencies caused injuries savant syndrome overarching accurate name identify children highercognition awareness savant syndrome increased limited number affected individuals complicated finding educational resources meet needs better diagnostic tools years helped identify children needs benefit students educators keep mind although children skilled certain areas may even take courses gifted may come across rude perhaps disrespectful behaviors might shown fellow classmates teachers students always adept communication social concepts consider educational system childs weaknesses strengths unique child examples children mathematical savant talents individual children exhibit human calculator abilities unable use skills every day functions sometimes disconnection
