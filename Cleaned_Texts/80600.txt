major result discovery large subsurface ocean may offer habitable aquatic earth life found essentially locations water present follows europa excellent candidate search life elsewhere solar subsurface water may warmed geological activity likely also enriched dissolved minerals organic various ecosystems exist earth without access sunlight relying instead hydrothermal vents sources chemicals suitable energy production see chemosynthesis measurements date indicate europa ocean approximately twice volume earths oceans water layer ice may contact moons interior allowing ready access hydrothermal energy surface mission take advantage relatively young active surface europa activity may allow deep subsurface materials regularly relocate july house space subcommittee held hearings

bill allocates million icy satellites surface technology future ocean worlds lander mission nasa requested million europa lander mission would three main science key phases flight launch cruise deorbit descent spacecraft would consist several modules would discarded different phases deorbiting landing sequence complete stack would propelled carrier stage also features solar orbit injection around jupiter spacecraft would spend two years adjusting orbit velocity attempting land preparation landing carrier stage would discarded leaving spacecraft stack configuration called deorbit vehicle dov would decelerate initiate descent engine module phase called deorbit stage dos would discarded burn leaving called powered descent vehicle pdv comprises lander sky crane system sky crane system would lower lander tether soft landing ft lander would feature robotic arm degrees freedom would enable dig several shallow subsurface samples maximum depth cm deliver onboard landed lander would operate days using chemical battery power rather radioisotope thermoelectric generator rtg solar concept proposes four batteries would provide three times needed energy safety margin surface baseline days complete surface mission additional days regardless power source one limiting factors lifetime mission may surviving radiation surface europa estimated experience rem per day whereas typical earth surface dose radiation damaged electronics galileo orbiter launcher would space launch system sls suggested launch sls proposed given spacecrafts mass metric tons including solid propellant place spacecraft orbit around jupiter sky crane landing one calculated trajectory would see launch aboard sls earth gravity assist jupitereuropa arrival would spend time orbiting around jupiter next year maneuver landing landing would performed two years orbit insertion around europa would land surface matching velocity essentially atmosphere entry descent planetary society noted nasa called ddl deorbit descent astronomers using hubble space telescope discovered europa tenuous exosphere composed compared earth atmosphere thin extreme pressure surface predicted Î¼pa times lander would communicate directly earth europa clipper still operational could function additional communications relay ensure communication suggestion include telecomm orbiter lander study published october suggests europas surface may covered closely spaced ice spikes called penitents tall meters although imaging available galileo orbiter resolution needed confirm radar thermal data consistent supports need first perform highdefinition reconnaissance esas jupiter icy moons explorer juice europa clipper launching respectively planning lander mission concept would require funding development launched

exposure vulnerable systems especially electronics orbiter nasa announced may scientific community think possible europa lander concept study reports made available june nasa selected potential instruments maturation instrument concepts europa exploration awarding approximately million two project would allow maturation novel instrument approaches meet science goals objectives mission planetary protection guidelines require inadvertent contamination europan ocean terrestrial organisms must avoided probability level less lander landing system components must assembled tested clean room parts would cleaned sterilized installed spacecraft delivering lander sky crane recommended fly away jupiter end mission lander might selfdestruct using incendiary system also triggered spacecraft loses contact europa clipper separately launched spacecraft would lay foundation europa lander previously nasa evaluated launching orbiter lander together strong congressional support led
