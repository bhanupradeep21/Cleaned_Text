data dredging also known data snooping misuse data analysis find patterns data presented statistically significant thus dramatically increasing understating risk false positives done performing many statistical tests data reporting come back significant process data dredging involves testing multiple hypotheses using single data set exhaustively combinations variables might show correlation perhaps groups cases observations show differences mean breakdown variable conventional tests statistical significance based probability particular result would arise chance alone work necessarily accept risk mistaken conclusions certain type mistaken rejections null hypothesis level risk called significance large numbers tests performed produce false results type hence randomly chosen hypotheses might erroneously reported statistically significant significance level might erroneously reported statistically significant significance level chance alone enough hypotheses tested virtually certain reported statistically significant even though misleading since almost every data set degree randomness likely contain example spurious correlations cautious researchers using data mining techniques easily misled results term phacking reference pvalues coined paper three researchers behind blog data colada focusing uncovering problems social sciences data dredging example disregarding multiple comparisons problem one form subgroups compared without alerting reader total number subgroup comparisons conventional statistical hypothesis testing procedure using frequentist probability formulate research hypothesis people higher social classes live longer collect relevant data lastly statistical significance test carried see likely results chance alone also called testing null hypothesis key point proper statistical analysis test hypothesis evidence data used constructing hypothesis critical every data set contains patterns due entirely chance hypothesis tested different data set statistical population impossible assess likelihood chance alone would produce patterns example flipping coin five times result heads tails might lead one hypothesize coin favors tails hypothesis tested existing data set confirmed confirmation meaningless proper procedure would form advance hypothesis tails probability throw coin various times see hypothesis rejected three tails two heads observed another hypothesis tails probability could formed could tested new set coin tosses important realize statistical significance incorrect procedure completely tests protect data dredging suppose study random sample people includes exactly two people birthday august mary john someone engaged data dredging might try find additional similarities mary john going hundreds thousands potential similarities two low probability true unusual similarity almost certainly found perhaps john mary two people study switched minors three times college hypothesis biased data dredging could people born august much higher chance switching minors twice college data taken context might seen strongly supporting correlation since one different birthday switched minors three times college however likely spurious hypothesis result likely reproducible attempt check others august birthday similar rate changing minors likely get contradictory results almost immediately bias systematic error analysis example doctors directed hiv patients high cardiovascular risk particular hiv treatment abacavir lowerrisk patients drugs preventing simple assessment abacavir compared treatments analysis correct bias unfairly penalized abacavir since patients highrisk heart problem severe example observational missing factors unmeasured confounders loss followup also lead selecting papers significant pvalues negative studies selected publication bias also known file drawer bias less significant pvalue results left file drawer never published another aspect conditioning statistical tests knowledge data seen using system machine analysis linear regression observe frequency dataclarify crucial step process decide covariates include relationship explaining one variables statistical see stepwise regression substantive considerations lead authors favor models others liberal use statistical tests however discard one variables explanatory relation basis data means one validly apply standard statistical procedures retained variables relation though nothing happened nature case retained variables pass kind preliminary test possibly imprecise intuitive one discarded variables failed selvin stuart compared variables retained model fish dont fall sense effects bound bigger fall net alter performance subsequent tests retained explanatory model may also introduce bias alter mean square error meteorology hypotheses often formulated using weather data present tested future weather data ensures even subconsciously future data could influence formulation hypothesis course discipline necessitates waiting new data come show formulated theorys predictive power versus null hypothesis process ensures one accuse researcher handtailoring predictive model data hand since upcoming weather yet available another example suppose observers note particular town appears cancer cluster lack firm hypothesis however access large amount demographic data town surrounding area containing measurements area hundreds thousands different variables mostly uncorrelated even variables independent cancer incidence rate highly likely least one variable correlates significantly cancer rate across area may suggest hypothesis testing using variables data different location needed confirm note pvalue suggests time result least extreme would obtained chance hundreds thousands hypotheses mutually relatively uncorrelated independent variables tested one likely obtain pvalue less many null hypotheses another way flatten pcurve control gender analysis simonsohn et al study bruns ioannidis demonstrates bruns ioannidis dropped gender control also dropped reported tvalue showing noncausal effect causal one previously recorded important finding tvalues inversely proportional pvalues meaning higher tvalues indicate lower pvalues controlling gender one artificially inflate tvalue thus artificially deflating pvalue well one example chocolate weight loss hoax study conducted journalist john bohannon explained publicly gizmodo article study deliberately conducted fraudulently social study widespread many media outlets around many people believing claim eating chocolate bar every day would cause lose weight better judgement study published institute diet health according bohannon reduce pvalue taking different variables consideration testing crucial looking patterns data legitimate applying statistical test significance hypothesis test data pattern emerges prone abuse one way construct hypotheses avoiding data dredging conduct randomized outofsample tests researcher collects data set randomly partitions two subsets b one subset examined creating hypotheses hypothesis formulated must tested subset b used construct hypothesis b also supports hypothesis reasonable believe hypothesis might valid simple type crossvalidation often termed trainingtest splithalf validation another remedy data dredging record number significance tests conducted study simply divide ones criterion significance alpha number bonferroni correction however conservative metric familywise alpha divided way account significance tests yields stringent perhypothesis alpha methods particularly useful analysis variance constructing simultaneous confidence bands regressions involving basis functions scheff√©s method researcher mind pairwise comparisons tukey method avoid extreme conservativeness bonferroni correction sophisticated selective inference methods common selective inference method use benjamini hochbergs false discovery rate controlling procedure less conservative approach become popular method control multiple hypothesis tests neither approach practical one make clear distinction data analyses confirmatory analyses exploratory statistical inference appropriate ultimately statistical significance test statistical confidence finding joint properties data method used examine data thus someone says certain event probability times means probability event estimated method used obtain estimate result probability claim statistical significance made looking without due regard method used assess data academic journals
