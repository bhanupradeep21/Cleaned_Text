lycopene organic compound classified tetraterpene lycopene neolatin lycopersicon tomato species bright red carotenoid hydrocarbon found tomatoes red fruits vegetables aside tomatoes found red carrots watermelons grapefruits papayas present strawberries vitamin plants algae photosynthetic organisms lycopene intermediate biosynthesis many carotenoids including betacarotene responsible yellow orange red pigmentation photosynthesis like carotenoids lycopene insoluble water eleven conjugated double bonds give lycopene deep red color owing strong color lycopene useful food coloring registered approved use australia new zealand registered european lycopene symmetrical tetraterpene consists entirely carbon hydrogen derived eight isoprene isolation procedures lycopene first reported structure molecule determined natural alltrans form molecule long somewhat flat constrained system conjugated double bonds extended conjugation responsible deep red plants photosynthetic bacteria produce alltrans exposed light heat lycopene undergo isomerization number cisisomers less linear shape isomers distinct stabilities highest stability alltrans human blood various cisisomers constitute total lycopene concentration biological effects individual isomers carotenoids like lycopene found photosynthetic pigmentprotein complexes plants photosynthetic bacteria fungi responsible bright colors fruits vegetables perform various functions photosynthesis protect photosynthetic organisms excessive light damage lycopene key intermediate biosynthesis carotenoids betacarotene dispersed lycopene molecules encapsulated carbon nanotubes enhancing optical efficient energy transfer occurs encapsulated dye absorbed dye without significant loss transferred nanotube encapsulation increases chemical thermal stability lycopene molecules also allows isolation individual unconditioned biosynthesis lycopene eukaryotic plants prokaryotic cyanobacteria similar enzymes synthesis begins mevalonic acid converted dimethylallyl pyrophosphate condensed three molecules isopentenyl pyrophosphate isomer dimethylallyl pyrophosphate give geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate two molecules product condensed tailtotail configuration give phytoene first committed step carotenoid biosynthesis several desaturation steps phytoene converted lycopene two terminal isoprene groups lycopene cyclized produce betacarotene transformed wide variety lycopene pigment tomato sauces turns plastic cookware orange insoluble plain water dissolved organic solvents oils nonpolarity lycopene food preparations stain sufficiently porous material including plastics remove staining plastics may soaked solution containing small amount chlorine bleach oxidizes lycopene thus allowing product dissolve absorption lycopene requires combined bile salts fat form intestinal absorption lycopene enhanced presence fat lycopene dietary supplements oil may efficiently absorbed lycopene lycopene essential nutrient humans commonly found diet mainly dishes prepared median percentile dietary lycopene intake estimated mgd fruits vegetables high lycopene include autumn olive gac tomatoes watermelon pink grapefruit pink guava papaya seabuckthorn wolfberry goji berry relative tomato ketchup common dietary source although gac momordica cochinchinensis spreng highest content lycopene known fruit vegetable multiple times tomatoes tomatobased sauces juices ketchup account dietary intake lycopene lycopene content tomatoes depends variety increases fruit unlike fruits vegetables nutritional content vitamin c diminished upon cooking processing tomatoes increases concentration bioavailable lycopene tomato paste four times bioavailable fresh processed tomato products pasteurized tomato juice soup sauce ketchup contain higher concentration bioavailable lycopene compared raw cooking crushing tomatoes canning process serving oilrich dishes spaghetti sauce pizza greatly increases assimilation digestive tract bloodstream lycopene fatsoluble oil said help absorption gac high lycopene content derived mainly seed cara cara navel citrus fruit pink grapefruit also contain foods appear red also contain lycopene eg asparagus contains μg lycopene per μgg dried parsley basil contain around μgg lycopene used food additive usually obtained lycopene nontoxic commonly found diet mainly tomato products cases intolerance allergic reaction dietary lycopene may cause diarrhea nausea stomach pain cramps gas loss lycopene may increase risk bleeding taken anticoagulant lycopene may cause low blood pressure interactions drugs affect blood pressure may occur lycopene may affect immune system nervous system sensitivity sunlight drugs used stomach lycopenemia orange discoloration skin observed high intakes discoloration expected fade discontinuing excessive lycopene review randomized controlled trials found conflicting evidence lycopene effect cardiovascular risk whereas review concluded tomato products lycopene supplementation reduced blood lipids blood review found dietary lycopene associated reduced risk prostate whereas metaanalysis found dietary lycopene affect prostate cancer reviews concluded research insufficient establish whether lycopene consumption affects human review literature lycopene potential benefit diet european food safety authority concluded insufficient evidence lycopene antioxidant effects humans particularly skin heart function vision protection ultraviolet although lycopene tomatoes tested humans cardiovascular diseases prostate cancer effect disease us food drug administration rejecting manufacturers requests allow qualified labeling lycopene reduction various cancer risks provided conclusion remains effect studies provided information whether lycopene intake may reduce risk specific forms cancer based fda concludes credible evidence supporting relationship lycopene consumption either food ingredient component food dietary supplement
