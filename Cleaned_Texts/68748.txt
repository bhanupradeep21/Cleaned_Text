biology altruism refers behaviour individual increases fitness another individual decreasing altruism sense different philosophical concept altruism action would called altruistic done conscious intention helping another behavioural sense requirement evaluated moral consequences action reproductive fitness determine whether action considered altruistic intentions action term altruism coined french philosopher auguste comte french altruisme antonym derived italian altrui turn derived latin alteri meaning people somebody altruistic behaviours appear obviously kin relationships parenting may also evident among wider social groups social insects allow individual increase success genes helping relatives share obligate altruism permanent loss direct fitness potential indirect fitness example honey bee workers may forage colony facultative altruism temporary loss direct fitness potential indirect fitness gain followed personal reproduction example florida scrub jay may help nest gain parental ethology study behavior generally study social evolution occasion animals behave ways reduce individual fitness increase fitness individuals population functional definition research evolutionary theory applied social behaviour including altruism cases animals helping individuals closely related explained kin selection considered true altruism beyond physical exertions species mothers species fathers undertake protect young extreme examples sacrifice may occur one example matriphagy consumption mother offspring spider stegodyphus another example male spider allowing female

altruistic behaviour reduces likelihood individual reproduce idea group selection might explain evolution altruism first broached darwin descent man selection relation sex concept group selection chequered controversial history evolutionary biology uncritical good species tradition came abrupt halt due largely work george c john maynard well richard evolutionary theorists pointed natural selection acts individual individuals fitness number offspring grandoffspring produced compared rest population drives evolution group advantage eg hunting pack disadvantageous individual might harmed hunt could avoid injury hanging back pack still share spoils evolve selfish individual leave average offspring join pack suffer injuries result selfishness hereditary ultimately result population consisting entirely selfish individuals however alternative group selection theory emerged kin selection theory due originally w kin selection instance inclusive fitness based notion individual shares half genes offspring also full sibling see footnotenb evolutionary genetic point view therefore advantageous help upbringing full sibs produce raise ones offspring two activities evolutionarily entirely equivalent cooperative breeding ie helping ones parents raise full sibs could thus evolve without need grouplevel selection quickly gained prominence among biologists interested evolution social robert introduced reciprocal altruism theory explain evolution helping nest unrelated breeding pair birds argued individual might act helper high probabilistic expectation helped recipients later date however recipients reciprocate possible altruistic interaction recipients would permanently terminated recipients cheat reciprocal altruism would continue indefinitely parties model

pdg define cooperative behaviour never individuals fitness interests cooperate even though mutual cooperation rewards two contestants together highly cooperation evolve circumstances however axelrod noted contestants pdg meet repeatedly socalled iterated prisoners dilemma game ipd titfortat foreshadowed robert trivers reciprocal altruism theory robust strategy promotes titfortat players opening

except cooperates small probability opponents last move outperformed least one strategies one players switch strategy result none evolutionarily stable prolonged series iterated prisoners dilemma game alternative strategies arise random gives rise chaotic sequence strategy changes never light iterated prisoners dilemma game failing provide full answer evolution cooperation altruism several alternative explanations proposed striking parallels altruistic acts exaggerated sexual ornaments displayed animals particularly certain bird species amongst others peacock costly fitness terms
