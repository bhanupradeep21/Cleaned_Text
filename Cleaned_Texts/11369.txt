population history genome evolution noncoding rnas threedimensional folding human genome genomewide association studies discover genes essential biological processes using crisprbased editing mathematician lander studied combinatorics applications representation theory coding theory enjoyed mathematics wish spend life monastic unsure next took job teaching managerial economics harvard business school suggestion brother developmental biologist arthur lander started look neurobiology saying time theres lot information understand mathematical neurobiology felt study cellular neurobiology turn led studying microbiology eventually genetics finally feel learned genetics get back problems im still trying get genetics right lander said lander later became acquainted david botstein geneticist massachusetts institute technology mit botstein working way unravel subtle differences complex genetic systems become disorders cancer diabetes schizophrenia even obesity two collaborated develop computer algorithm analyze maps lander joined whitehead institute became assistant professor mit awarded macarthur fellowship founded whitehead institutemit center genome research wicgr wicgr became one worlds leading centers genome research landers leadership made great progress developing new methods analyzing mammalian genomes also made important breakthroughs applying information study human genetic variation formed basis foundation broad transformation lander spearheaded two main groups attempted sequence human genome first human genome project loosely organized publicly funded effort intended publish information obtained freely without restrictions many research groups countries world involved effort second undertaken celera genomics intended patent information obtained charge subscriptions use sequence data established first human genome project moved slowly early phases department energys role unclear sequencing technology infancy officially human genome project eightyear head start celera entered race though discussions human genome project began fourteen years celera announced human genome project billion publicly funded consortia raced enter much human genome public domain quickly possible celera began work change strategy human genome project many scientists time wanted establish complete copy genome simply publish many fragments individually lander aggressively pressured human genome project scientists work longer faster publish genome fragments lander listed patents patent applications related february human genome project celera published drafts human genome scientific journals respectively human genome projects nature publication whitehead institute biomedical research center genome research listed first lander listed first named leveraging celeras sequencing analysis techniques whitehead institute also made contribution sequencing mouse important step fully understanding molecular biology mice often used model organisms studies everything human diseases embryonic development wicgr since sequenced genomes ciona savignyi sea filamentous fungus neurospora multiple relatives saccharomyces one studied yeasts

variation human genome led international effort assembled library million singlenucleotide polymorphisms snp act markers signposts genome allowing identification disease susceptibility genes hope construct map human genome using blocks snp called linkage disequilibrium ld map significant help medical genetics allowing researchers link given condition given gene set genes using ld marker allow improved diagnostic procedures lander colleagues hoping ld map allow test common diseasecommon variant hypothesis states many common diseases may caused small number common alleles example variance susceptibility alzheimers disease explained common allele landers group recently discovered important association accounts large proportion populations risk adultonset diabetes landers important may development molecular taxonomy cancers grouped according gene expression information response chemotherapy division cancers homogeneous subgroups increase understanding cancers molecular origins help devise effective therapies landers group also identified new type leukemia mll gene may serve target new drug several years lander cotaught mits required undergraduate introductory biology course
