membrane stabilizing effects involve inhibition total abolishing action potentials propagated across membrane phenomenon common nerve tissues carrier impulses periphery central nervous system membrane stabilization method local anesthetics work block propagation action potentials across nerve cells thereby producing nerve block betablockers also possess referred membrane stabilizing activity msa effect similar membrane stabilizing activity sodium channel blockers represent class antiarrhythmics msa agents produced betablockers reduce increase cardiac action potential also leading electrophysiological effects however msa occurs high concentrations clinical relevance except large doses msa article related medical imaging stub help wikipedia expanding biology article stub help wikipedia expanding httpsenwikipediaorgwikimembranestabilizingeffect
