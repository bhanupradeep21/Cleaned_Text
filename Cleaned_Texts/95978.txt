dimorphodon daɪˈmɔːrfədɒn genus mediumsized pterosaur europe early jurassic period million years named paleontologist richard owen dimorphodon means twoform tooth derived greek δι di meaning two μορφη morphe meaning shape οδων odon meaning tooth referring fact two distinct types teeth jaws comparatively rare among reptiles diet dimorphodon questioned among researchers earlier interpretations depicting insectivore piscivore recent studies suggested dimorphodon likely hunted small vertebrates though still would consumed soft invertebrates like insects body structure dimorphodon displays many primitive characteristics according owen small proportionally short first phalanx flight finger slightly longer lower neck short strong flexible may membranous pouch underside vertebrae pneumatic foramina openings air sacs could reach hollow interior dimorphodon adult body length metre ft long metre ft tail dimorphodon long consisted thirty vertebrae first five six short flexible remainder gradually increased length stiffened elongated vertebral terminal end tail may borne rhamphorhynchuslike tail vane although impressions yet found dimorphodon fossils confirm dimorphodon large bulky

suggested german paleontologist peter wellnhofer dimorphodon might descended earlier european pterosaur later exact cladistic analyses agreement according unwin dimorphodon related though probably descendant peteinosaurus forming clade dimorphodontidae basal group macronychoptera within sister group caelidracones would mean dimorphodontid species would basal pterosaurs known exception preondactylus according alexander kellner however dimorphodon far less basal close relative peteinosaurus cladogram recovered andres myers reproduced preondactylus buffarinii austriadactylus cristatus peteinosaurus zambellii eudimorphodontidae dimorphodon macronyx parapsicephalus purdoni novialoidea knowledge dimorphodon lived limited perhaps mainly inhabited coastal regions might varied diet buckland suggested ate insects later became common depict piscivore fish eater though biomechanical studies support bucklands original insectivore idea better inconsistent animals habits see flight dimorphodon advanced jaw musculature specialized snap hold method feeding jaw could close extremely quickly relatively little force tooth penetration along short high skull longer pointed front teeth suggest dimorphodon insectivore though may occasionally eaten small vertebrates carrion mark witton argued animal specialised carnivore large insectivorous diet though acknowledge still might ate large insects thus specialised hunt relatively small vertebrates relatively weak jaw musculature indicating probably ate proportionally small dental microwear examinations confirm status vertebrate predator opposed several insectivore piscivore early pterosaurs though study acknowledge possibility consuming relatively softer invertebrates excluded like many pterosaurs dimorphodon perceived soarer past correlating historical perceptions pterosaurs seabird analogues however recent studies show animal actually rather poor flyer wings proportionally short relation body skeleton rather robust offering little gliding potential life dimorphodon probably relied frantic short flights manner modern fowl tinamous woodpeckers unable fly long distances probably taking air last derived position amidst primitive pterosaurs implies ineptitude developed trait ancestral characteristic earlier pterosaurs like preondactylus capable aeronauts owen saw dimorphodon quadruped speculated fifth toe supported membrane tail legs animal therefore ungainly however rival harry govier seeley propagating view pterosaurs warmblooded active argued dimorphodon either agile quadruped even running biped due relatively well developed hindlimbs characteristics hypothesis revived kevin padian however fossilised track remains pterosaurs ichnites show quadrupedal gait ground traces attributed derived pterosaurs short fifth toe dimorphodons elongated clawless oriented david unwin therefore argued even dimorphodon quadruped view confirmed computer modelling sarah like nonpterodactyloid pterosaurs dimorphodon competent climber possessing proportionally large curved ungals low center gravity like modern squirrels probably moved saltatorial manner httpsenwikipediaorgwikidimorphodon
