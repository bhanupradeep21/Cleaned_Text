large hole pineal gland skull roof differed contact frontal parietal bones sclerocormus solely parietals cartorhynchus cartorhynchus also characteristically large hyoid initially motani colleagues inferred cartorhynchus toothless however microct scanning subsequently revealed presence rounded molarlike teeth projected inwards nearly perpendicularly long axis jaw therefore making invisible

ichthyosauromorpha notably close relation different groups recovered analyses regardless whether characteristics linked aquatic adaptations removed characteristics may developed homoplasiously convergent evolution among multiple lineages due similar lifestyles bias phylogenetic analyses reconstruct homologies derived shared ancestry persistence reconstructed relationships even removal

ecosystems recover full diversity million years following mass extinction marine reptiles recovered slowly extinction however discovery multiple diverse faunas marine reptiles occurring early triassic including cartorhynchus subsequently showed particular appears ichthyosauriforms first appeared spathian substage olenekian stage quickly attained high functional diversity first million years occupied variety niches despite relatively low species including demersal bottomdwelling species like hupehsuchians nasorostrans pelagic openwater species like many ichthyosauriforms early middle triassic molariform teeth shown phylogenetic tree including cartorhynchus teeth indicate diet least partially based hardshelled huang colleagues performed ancestral state reconstruction teeth among ichthyosauromorphs probabilistic methods suggested rounded flat teeth likely evolved independently five times methods based parsimony suggested evolved independently three five times huang colleagues observed development molariform teeth occurred independently many times aquatic animals including multiple lineages monitor lizards moray eels sparid cichlid fish thus frequency among ichthyosauriforms unusually high also observed early triassic ichthyosauriforms generally small rounded teeth teeth middle triassic ichthyosauriforms diverse size shape correlates increased invertebrate thus suggested diversification ichthyosauriforms partially driven evolution hardshelled however hupehsuchians nasorostrans ultimately went extinct boundary early middle triassic producing taxonomic bottleneck boundary sea level led poorly oxygenated oceans producing characteristic carbon isotope signature decaying organic material rock strata ichthyosauriforms recover diversity sauropterygia saurosphargidae driving second wave diversification lasting three five million motani colleagues hypothesized cartorhynchus suction feeder fed concentrating pressure narrow snout supported robustness hyoid hyobranchial element would anchored tongue incorrect observation similar inferences subsequently made shastasaurus shonisaurus previously interpreted suctionfeeding quantitative analysis triassic jurassic ichthyosaurs motani colleagues showed none sufficiently robust hyobranchial bones sufficiently narrow snouts enable suction discovery molariform teeth cartorhynchus led huang colleagues conclude cartorhynchus durophagous feeding hardshelled prey noted contradict suctionfeeding lifestyle sparid fish durophagous however suggested cartorhynchus would restricted feeding small prey horizontal orientation teeth observed wear surfaces indicated sides teeth occluded instead crowns however noted teeth structurally strongest tips sides high stresses crushing suggested jaw may twisted preservation soft tissues like collagen held teeth life may lost although conceded neither hypothesis would explain wear patterns finally noted lower teeth without corresponding upper teeth unusual show wear patterns evidence muscular mechanisms would allowed two jaws used therefore inferred teeth probably used cartorhynchus poorlyossified limbs spite wellossified skull vertebrae however motani colleagues suggested still adult many earlydiverging members marine reptile lineages poorlyossified limbs paedomorphosis retention immature traits adulthood although completely reject possibility juvenile due existence one case cartorhynchus motani colleagues proposed large flipperlike forelimbs would enabled move land thus making amphibious extensive cartilage wrist joint would allowed flipper bend without elbow juvenile sea turtles similarly cartilaginous flippers use move although flipper would particularly strong cartorhynchus relatively lightweight body mass flipper surface area ratio smaller chaohusaurus curved flippers would allowed kept close body thus increasing mechanical advantage motani colleagues suggested traits cartorhynchus would also aided amphibious lifestyle including short trunk snout thickened ribs would served ballast stabilizing animal nearshore study susana gutarra colleagues used computational simulations estimate energy cost swimming ichthyosauriforms earlydiverging ichthyosauriforms lizardshaped bodies elongate flukeless tails like cartorhynchus would employed anguilliform eellike swimming later ichthyosauriforms deeper fishlike bodies welldefined tail flukes would employed carangiform mackerellike swimming generally thought anguilliform swimming less efficient carangiform indeed gutarra colleagues found energetic cost swimming metre per second fts times higher cartorhynchus ichthyosaur ophthalmosaurus depending whether swimming mode accounted drag coefficient higher bottlenose dolphin however cartorhynchus would likely swam slower speeds requiring less efficiency advantages carangiform swimming later larger ichthyosauriforms also offset increased body bed
