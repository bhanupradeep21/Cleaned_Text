maryland called maryland within delmarva peninsula coastal ponds also called delmarva name carolina bay sometimes attributed writings english explorer john lawson explored north carolina south carolina georgia early century attribution however correct lawson described visiting swamp contained bay trees indication wanted name swamp word furthermore lawson said swamp steep margins could see mountains west vicinity swamp thus seems likely swamp interdune depression among carolina sandhills rather carolina bay nevertheless bay trees present carolina earliest scientific description carolina
