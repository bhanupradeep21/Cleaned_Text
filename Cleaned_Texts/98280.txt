history model organisms began idea certain organisms studied used gain knowledge organisms control ideal organisms species model organisms offer standards serve authorized basis comparison model organisms made standard limiting genetic variance creating hopefully broad applicability idea model organism first took root middle century work men like charles darwin gregor mendel respective work natural selection genetics heredity first model organisms introduced labs century early efforts identify standards measure organisms persisted beginning early drosophila entered research laboratories opened doors model organisms like tobacco mosaic virus e coli lab mice etc organisms led many advances past century first work would considered model organisms started gregor johann mendel felt views darwin insufficient describing formation new species began work pea plants famously known today experimentation find method darwins ideas could explained hybridized crossbred peas found could isolate phenotypic characteristics peas discoveries made lay dormant nearly forty years rediscovered mendels work correlated called chromosomes within nucleus cell mendel created practical guide breeding method successfully applied select first model organisms genus species guinea pigs drosophila fruit fly mice viruses like tobacco mosaic fruit fly drosophila melanogaster made jump nature laboratory animal harvard university charles w woodworth suggested william e castle drosophila might used genetical castle along students first brought fly labs experimental use william j moenkhaus brought drosophila back lab indiana university med school moenkhaus turn convinced entomologist frank e lutz would good organism work carnegie institutions station experimental evolution cold springs harbor long island experimental evolution sometime year drosophila adopted man would become well known work flies thomas hunt morgan man name jacques loeb also tried experimentation mutations drosophila independently morgans work first decade twentieth thomas hunt morgan considered one influential men experimental biology early twentieth century work drosophila extensive one first field realize potential mapping chromosomes drosophila melanogaster known mutants would later expand findings comparative study species careful painstaking observation drosophilists able control mutations cross breed new phenotypes many years work like standards flies become quite uniform still used research insects organisms entering laboratories test subjects bacteria also introduced invention electron microscope ernst ruska whole new field microbiology invention allowed microbiologists see objects far small seen light microscope thus viruses perplexed biologists many fields years came scientific wendell stanley began direct competition carl g vinson first completely isolate tobacco mosaic virus virus invisibly killing tobacco plants across stanley would accomplish task first changing ph acidic able conclude virus either protein closely related one thus benefiting experimental research important reasons new much smaller organisms tobacco mosaic virus e coli made way molecular biologists laboratories organisms like drosophila tribolium much large complex simple quantitative experiments men like wendell stanley wanted use simple organisms molecular biologist comparatively complex organisms work today viruses including bacteriophages used extensively genetics critical helping researchers produce dna within bacteria tobacco mosaic virus dna stacks distinctive way influential watson cricks development model helical structure bacteriophages viruses infect bacteria studied since experimental model organisms understanding numerous fundamental biological processes molecular level phage group initially informal network biologists centered max delbr√ºck contributed substantially bacterial genetics origins molecular biology studies bacteriophages led considerable insight numerous fundamental biologic problems thus understanding gained functions interactions proteins employed machinery dna replication dna repair recombination viruses assembled protein nucleic acid components molecular morphogenesis experiments bacteriophage led elucidation role chain terminating codons also contributed sequence hypothesis concept amino acid sequence protein specified nucleotide sequence gene determining protein community insects viruses good start history model organisms yet still players involved turn century much biomedical research done using animals especially mammalian bodies biologists understanding life processes around time american humane societies became involved preserving rights animal first time beginning gain public support endeavor time american biology also going internal reforms thirty medical schools forced close time unrest man named clarence cook little series luckily timed events became researcher harvard medical school worked mouse cancers began developing large mutant strain colonies mice charge dr william castle little helped expand animal breeding habits bussey laboratory harvard due freedom way castle allowed run laboratory financial backing university able create extensive program mammalian mice turned almost perfect solution test subjects mammalian genetic research fact bred rat fanciers hundreds years allowed diverse populations animal public held far less sentiment rodents dogs cats social allowance little able take new ideas pure genetic strains merging plant genetics well work drosophila run idea inbreeding achieve goal pure strain mice one may created negative response fertility mice thus discontinuing strain little achieved goal genetically pure strain mice published finding shortly thereafter would continue work mice used research demonstrate inbreeding effective way eliminate variation served preserve unique genetic variants around time well much work done mice cancer tumor throughout work continued mice model organisms research tumors genetics great depression field study would take biggest blow economy rock bottom labs forced selling many mice keep shutting necessity funds stopped continuation strains mice transition laboratories exporters massive quantities mice one rather easily made adequate facilities production site eventually market would return genetics laboratories around country resumed regular funding thus continued areas research started depression research continued production mice places like jackson laboratory facilities like able produce mice research facilities around world mice bred mendelian breeding technique little implemented standard practice around meant mice experimented within laboratory different laboratories around mouse remained important molecular genetics genomics progressed sequencing reference mouse genome completed broadly comparative genomics advanced understanding reinforced importance model organisms especially ones relatively small nonrepetitive genomes httpsenwikipediaorgwikihistoryofmodelorganisms
