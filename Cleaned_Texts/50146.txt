atlanticopristis meaning atlantic saw extinct genus sclerorhynchid sawfishlike chondrichthyan lived middle cretaceous cenomanian northeast region brazil million years ago fourteen fossil teeth atlanticopristis found alcântara formation referred closely related onchopristis redescription brazilian paleontologists manuel medeiros agostinha pereira assigned new genus containing one species atlanticopristis equatorialis like sawfish would long snout armed modified fish scales shaped teeth atlanticopristiss teeth barbs sides atlanticopristis inhabited fresh brackish water estuaries near large conifer forests lived time place many species bony fish cartilaginous fish lobe finned fish well crocodilians several dinosaurs many taxa present alcântara formation also known middle cretaceous kem kem beds morocco due past connection south america africa supercontinent gondwana fossils atlanticopristis discovered maranhão state northeastern brazil alcântara formation itapecuru group cajual island formation composed cretaceous sediments outcrops coastline são marcos bay documents separation south america africa presenting large quantity variety continental marine vertebrates fossils alcântara formation highly diverse plentiful yet often fourteen rostral teeth atlanticopriostis brought back falésia sismito exposure due fact sawfish made cartilage skeletons fossilize easily remains found consist teeth snouts specimens atlanticopristis currently housed centro de pesquisa de história natural e arqueologia maranhão archaeology natural history research center maranhão são holotype tooth cphnamavt designated complete well preserved specimen additionally several specimens assigned paratypes cphnamavt single tooth largest specimen cphnamavt two complete teeth cphnamavt cphnamavt two groups four incomplete teeth missing tip crown cphnamavt two partial specimens portuguese paleontologists manuel medeiros agostinha pereira described material genus contains one species atlanticopristis equatorialis generic name referring atlantic ocean sediments alcântara formation deposited pristis greek word saw specific name equatorialis chosen due discovery site close proximity teeth rostrum snout atlanticopristis varied number barbs front rear margins also laterally compressed sides displaying thin enamel ridges extending outward base tooth forming fan shape teeth also grooves running length sides peduncle base tooth enlarged covered irregular ridges bottom typically concave subrectangular ellipsoid specimens range size mm inches mm inches holotype cphnamavt mm inches length including peduncle mm inches wide mm inches long thickness mm inches barb number specimens ranges two four barbs front margin four five rear specimens like cphnamavt vestigial bumps could considered additional sawfish evolved long snouts armed rows teeth sides although spines represent true teeth highly modified fish scales dermal adaptation could related feeding habits sifting sandmud search food slash prey like extant sawsharks spines attached rostrum sclerorhynchids like atlanticopristis using ligaments compared modern sawfish teeth attached via alveoli tooth sockets longitudinal ribbing ridges enameloid seen sclerorhynchid teeth would aided attachment atlanticopristis belongs sclerorhynchidae possibly family cretaceous sawfishlike chondrichthyans dating early late epochs cretaceous period fossilized teeth atlanticopristis previously referred indeterminate species onchopristis pereira medeiros based shape peduncle presence multiple barbs enamel teeth assigned new genus based lack intermediate form atlanticopristis onchopristis well morphological differences distinguish sclerorhynchids pereira medeiros also stated atlanticopristis closely related onchopristis subjective interpretation could consider synonyms barb number spines atlanticopristis closely resembles onchopristis dunklei onchopristis numidus numidus usually single barb dunklei always one sclerorhynchid borodinopristis also multibarbed teeth distinct aspects suggest close formation multiple barbs sides teeth characteristic also seen extinct australian sawshark ikamauius general sclerorynchids developed dentition closer sawsharks modern sawfish closely related latter similarity considered case convergent evolution unrelated organisms evolve analogous atlanticopristis onchopristis exhibit similarities bolivian species sclerorhynchid pucapristis branisi enamel ribbing formation barb posterior margin however peduncles differ greatly french paleoichthyologist henri cappeta distinguished two groups inside sclerorhynchidae separating onchopristis atlanticopristis originates alcântara formation dated cenomanian stage middle cretaceous period sometime million years like modern inhabited estuarine environment fresh brackish water atlanticopristis likely came shallow marine regions southern atlantic ocean periodically entered estuarine waters area laje coringa locality would comprised tidal estuaries rivers lagoons alongside would large forests conifers horsetails ferns animal would shared habitat freshwater marine estuarine fish like closely related sclerorynchid onchopristis numidus mawsonia gigas large coelacanth myliobatis sp uncertain species ray well many species bony fishes rayfinned fishes lungfish marine invertebrates prominent region shown many mollusc genera discovered deposits atlanticopristis remains also found association landbased animals like crocodilians among two members spinosauridae family crocodilelike dinosaurs oxalaia quilombensis spinosaurus sp indeterminate carcharodontosaurus species known deposits along smalltomediumsized theropods mesoeucrocodylian coringasuchus paleoecological situation cenomanian brazil highly resembles middle cretaceous north africa particularly kem kem bahariya formations many biota found north africa northeastern brazil result gondwana supercontinent comprised africa south america
