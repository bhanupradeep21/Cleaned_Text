pediatric concussion also known pediatric mild traumatic brain injury mtbi head trauma impacts brain capacity concussion affect functional emotional cognitive physical factors occur people symptoms following concussion vary may include confusion disorientation lightheadedness nausea vomiting blurred vision loss consciousness loc environment sensitivity concussion symptoms may vary based type severity location head concussion symptoms infants children adolescents often appear immediately injury however symptoms may arise multiple days following injury leading majority pediatric patients recover symptoms within one month weeks following injury children adolescents higher risk delayed recovery experiencing concussion symptoms medical assessment physician nurse practitioner required concussion suspected infant child adolescent rule serious head injury diagnose treatment concussion includes short cognitive physical period rest followed gradual return activity school resting days recommended prescribed physical exercise may helpful recovery early hours injury however activities inherent risk another injury hitting head falling avoided completely medically cleared doctor clinical practice guidelines suggest missing week common causes pediatric concussion include falls motor vehicle accidents sportsrelated injuries blunt force approximately concussions consequently

observation required monitor returntoschool reinjury avoided prevent longterm consequences permanent brain immediately person hits head concussion suspected must removed activity require medical assessment returning initial rest hours activities gradually started activities involving contact collision risk another hit body head need completely avoided medical clearance brief days rest school activities absences week discouraged avoid deterioration manifestations recommended take active rehabilitation pharmacologic treatment present stage shown unable speed recovery pediatric concussion nevertheless medication prescribed alleviate signs symptoms sleep disturbances headaches cognitive emotional inflictions melatonin assist patients experiencing sleep medication utilized headaches like naproxen ibuprofen acetaminophen oxaprozin applied lessen symptoms short term though recent studies indicate patients improved ailment discontinuation however medication forms drugs advised administered unless prescribed doctor due potential detrimental implications majority pediatric patients recover completely concussion may experience prolonged around recover without difficulties one

provide assistance determine predictive outcome validated symptoms scales cognitive tests balance although tests incapable strong predictive tool outcomes able assess recovery pediatric tools display greater benefits towards older adolescents determining predictions pediatric patients risk persisting symptoms including factors premorbid history demographics injury characteristics health care professionals may closely monitor children refer interventions indications resolve within four six children suspected threat delayed recovery highly likely intervention assess prognostic risk factors
