tethered cord syndrome tcs refers group neurological disorders relate malformations spinal various forms include tight filum terminale lipomeningomyelocele split cord malformations diastematomyelia occult dermal sinus tracts dermoids forms involve pulling spinal cord base spinal canal literally tethered spinal cord normally hangs loose canal free move growth bending stretching tethered cord however held taut end point spinal canal children tethered cord force spinal cord stretch grow adults spinal cord stretches course normal activity usually leading progressive spinal cord damage tcs often associated closure spina bifida congenital tight filum terminale result injury later children symptoms may include tethered spinal cord syndrome may go undiagnosed adulthood sensory motor bowel

younger eight weeks age possibly utero tethered cord may observed using ultrasonography ultrasonography may still useful age limited circumstances mri imaging appears gold standard diagnosing tethered tethered cord often diagnosed low conus conus medullaris lower termination spinal cord normally terminates disk space first topmost lumbar vertebra months age conus disk space may indicate tethered

recommended symptoms begin children early surgery prevent neurological deterioration including limited chronic urinary incontinence adults surgery detether free spinal cord reduce size development cysts cord may restore function alleviate symptoms although detethering common surgical approach another surgical option adults spineshortening vertebral vertebral osteotomy aims indirectly relieve excess tension spinal cord removing portion spine shortening procedure offers unique benefit spinal cord remains fixated spine preventing retethering spinal cord injury possible surgical complications however complexity limited track record presently keeps vertebral osteotomies reserved option patients failed preventing retethering detethering treatment symptomatic supportive medications nsaids opiates synthetic opiates inhibitors offlabel applications tricyclic antidepressants combined antiseizure compounds yet prove value treatment afflictions pain manifestations anecdotal evidence tens

minimal symptoms somewhat controversial example website columbia university department neurosurgery says child reached adult height minimal symptoms neurosurgeons would advocate careful observation
