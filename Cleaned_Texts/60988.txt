hypogonadism means diminished functional activity testicles may result diminished production sex hormones low androgen eg testosterone levels referred hypoandrogenism low estrogen eg estradiol hypoestrogenism responsible observed signs symptoms males females hypogonadism commonly referred symptom low testosterone low also decrease hormones secreted gonads including progesterone dhea antim√ºllerian hormone activin inhibin sperm development spermatogenesis release egg ovaries ovulation may impaired hypogonadism depending degree severity may result partial complete infertility january american college physicians issued clinical guidelines testosterone treatment adult men agerelated low levels testosterone guidelines supported american academy family physicians guidelines include patient discussions regarding testosterone treatment sexual dysfunction annual patient evaluation regarding possible notable improvement none discontinue testosterone treatment physicians consider intramuscular treatments rather transdermal treatments due costs since effectiveness harm either method similar testosterone treatment reasons possible improvement sexual dysfunction may deficiency sex hormones result defective primary secondary sexual development withdrawal effects eg premature menopause adults defective egg sperm development results infertility term hypogonadism usually means permanent rather transient reversible defects usually implies deficiency reproductive hormones without fertility defects term less commonly used infertility without hormone deficiency many possible types hypogonadism several ways categorize hypogonadism also categorized endocrinologists level reproductive system defective physicians measure gonadotropins lh fsh distinguish primary secondary hypogonadism primary hypogonadism lh andor fsh usually elevated meaning problem testicles hypergonatropic hypogonadism whereas secondary hypogonadism normal low suggesting problem brain

menopause normal change hormone levels case lh fsh levels rise cases primary hypogonadism menopause low women secondary tertiary hypogonadism often discovered evaluation delayed puberty ordinary delay eventually results normal pubertal development wherein reproductive function termed constitutional delay may discovered infertility evaluation either men low testosterone identified simple blood test
