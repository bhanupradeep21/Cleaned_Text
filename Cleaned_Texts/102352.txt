foucault general assembly professors foucault duly elected april years old time relatively unknown beyond borders native france required appointment held series public lectures death excepting sabbatical year lectures advanced work summarised audio recordings edited michel senellart subsequently translated english edited graham burchell published posthumously st martins press important time foucault marks important switch methodology archaeology genealogy according foucault never abandoned archaeology method also period transition thought foucault dutch tvtelevised foucault noam chomsky human nature justice versus power debate november eindhoven university technology appears exact time period first inaugural lecture delivered collège de france entitled order discourse delivered december translated published english discourse language week later december first ever full inaugural lecture course delivered collège de france knowledge course foucault promised explore fragment fragment morphology knowledge alternating historical periods inquiries theoretical questioning lectures produced called lectures know within space year first phase foucaults thought characterized knowledge construction various types thread knowledge systems combine together produce series networks foucault uses term grille produce successful fully functional subject workable fully functional human society foucault uses terms epistemological indicators epistemological breaks show contrary popular opinion indicators breaks require skilled trained technical group specialists various knowledge fields trained rigorous professionalized regulatory body knowhow behalf use terms discourse formations speechdiscourse professional body make terms used stand rational scrutiny scientific knowledge foucault isnt advancement human progress often portrayed human sciences humanities social sciences much subtle method organizing producing firstly individual subject secondly fully functional society functioning selfreplicated control apparatus group free atomized individuals collective societal organised drilled unit terms industrial production labour power militarily organized unit guise armies beneficial production epistemological indicators breaks enabling society control rather external factors state example job inaugural lecture course know foucault goes detail natural order things century transpired fully organised human society includes governmentality apparatus complex machine governmentality foucault means state apparatus conceived scientific machine rational organizing principle first time contrary popular opinion rather late invention foucaults thought foucault started go greek dimensions thought would return later lectures towards end life first pointers made explicit certain points foucault mentions western notions money production trade greek society starting bce bce however nonwestern societies also problems automatically assumed historianswho entirely western inventions isnt entirely true china india example sophisticated trading monetary institutions century bce indeed concept corporation existed least bce lasted least importantly social security system india time foucault begins notions lectures notion truth knowledge challenge foucault asks question entire western philosophical political tradition namely knowledge least scientific knowledge close association truth entirely desirable politically philosophically natural neutral first foucault puts notions least political notions thorough test firstly foucault asks politically neutral question first appearance money became important economic symbol else became measure value unit account money established social process social reality one could say word extremely rocky precarious history first social reality actual social authority use money didnt develop standard practice knowledge use rather undisciplined kings emperors could squander large taxation revenues impunity regardless consequences could default repayments loans witnessed hundred years war anglofrench war else kings monarchs could take forced loans get otherstheir subjects pay forced loans add insult injury get pay interest loans extortionate rates interest charged loans advisers regarded income however whole societies dependent money particularly whole society use ready money took least years history get disciplined approach became sole prerogative fiscal responsibility state medieval order things entirely dismantled get right namely ruthlessness rigorous efficiency needed proper function wasnt century advent modern political economy analysis production labour trade get sense money particularly relationship capital complex relationship rest society conversion labour power money via essential route surplus value became much maligned misunderstood category hot potato foucault profound foucault asking modern western political economy together political philosophy political science came ask question concerning money utterly perplexed question particularly irritated irked karl marx throughout life money various association production labour government trade beyond doubt exact relationship rest society entirely missed economists yet still version events entirely accepted true foucault begins try go whole production truth philosophical political whole breaks discontinuity epistemological unconscious theoretical splitting episteme greek period starting bce foucault pursues path scientific political knowledge emergence conditions possibility philosophical knowledge ends problem political knowledge ie aristotelian notions political animal necessary order govern city put right divided work history systems thought three interrelated parts reexamination knowledge conditions knowledge knowing subject lectures published english foucault used first precursor discipline punish study foundations calls disciplinary institutions punitive power productive dimensions penalty lectures published english continued investigation power penal institutions begun foucault spent lot time period trying make intelligible internal external dynamics call prison questioned relations power made possible historical emergence something like prison correlated three terms firstly measure means establishing restoring order right order combat men elements also matrix mathematical physical knowledgetreated detail knowledge lectures secondly inquiry means establishing restoring facts events actions properties rights also matrix empirical knowledge natural sciencesfrom lectures theories punishment penal theories institutions thirdly examination treated permanent control individual like permanent test endpoint foucault links examination century political economy productive labourers wealth produce forces production influenced work georges canguilhem lectures first published english foucault explored power defined categories normality abnormality modern psychiatry series lectures forms trilogy security territory population birth biopolitics contains foucaults first discussion biopower also contains explanation term civil war form rigorous treatment working definition foucault goes great detail power foucault saw becomes battleground drifting civil war generalized pacification individual particularly systems individual relies upon gives loyalty according hypothesis role political power perpetually use sort silent war reinscribe relationship force reinscribe institutions economic inequalities language even bodies individuals foucault begins explain generalized form power rooted disciplinary institutions also concentrated political sovereignty military war turn spread evenly throughout modern society network domination foucault discusses lies behind academic chestnut could deciphered historical predecessors namely disjointed discontinuous movement history power biopower meant foucaults predecessors history concerned deeds monarchs full list accomplishments sovereign presented text things great added greatness deeds greatness sovereign accomplished sovereign without help monument building allegedly built monarch without help skilled trained professionals serves perfectly good example sovereign greatness however foucault case foucaults genealogy comes play foucault tries build bridge two theoretical notions disciplinary power disciplinary institutions biopower investigates constant shift throughout history two paradigms developmentsfrom two paradigms became new subjects previous historical dimensions often portrayed historians foucault argues sovereign history acts ceremonial tool sovereign power glorifies adds lustre power history performs function two modes genealogical mode understood simple sense term traces lineage sovereign time century development mercantilism statistics mathematical statistics political economy reaches vitriolic vicious form later called nation

historical works augustin thierry françois guizot john wade others order enlighten past history classes history revolutionary project revolutionary practice indissoluble counterhistory foucault challenges traditional notions racism explaining operation modern state foucault talks racism talking might traditionally understand ideology mutual hatred foucaults reckoning modern racism tied power making something far profound traditionally tracing genealogy racism foucault proposes race previously used describe division two opposing societal groups distinguished one another example religion language came conceived late century biological terms concept race war referred conflict legitimacy power established sovereign reformulated struggle existence driven concern biopolitical purity population single race could threatened within body foucault racism born point theme racial purity replaces race struggle p foucault racism expression schism within society provoked idea ongoing always incomplete cleaning social structures social fields action guides political practice realized state concerned biological purity conformity norm modern states racism defined action individuals rather vested state finds form structures operation state racism state racism serves two functions firstly makes possible divide population biological groups good bad superior inferior races fragmented subspecies population brought state control secondly facilitates dynamic relationship life one person death another foucault clear relationship one warlike confrontation rather biological one based individual rather life general inferior species die abnormal individuals eliminated fewer degenerates species whole species rather individual live stronger vigorous able proliferate effect race defined biological terms furnished ideological foundation identifying excluding combating even murdering others name improving life individual life general p important racism inscribed one modern

power emerged second half century foucault termed biopolitics biopowerfoucault uses terms synonymously technologies focused manasspecies concerned optimising state life taking control life intervening make live let importantly foucault argues technologies replace technologies sovereign power exclusive focus disciplining individual body productive punishing killing individuals embedded exploring new power life object could come include power kill foucault theorizes emergence state racism foucault argues modern state must point become involved racism order function since state functions biopolitical mode racism alone justify determined threat population state take action kill name keeping population safe thriving healthy pure racism allows right kill squared power seeks improve life state racism delivers actions appearing derive altruistic intentions veil murder following argument logical end never need state claim right kill let die state racism disappear since killing predicated racism follows murderous states also racist foucault refers way nazism state socialism soviet union dealt ethnic social groups political adversaries examples threats however change time

tracing history governmentality first centuries christian era emergence modern nation state lectures illustrate radical turning point foucaults work shift problematic government self others occurred foucaults challenge series lectures try decipher genealogical split power ancient medieval society late modern society split foucault means power force manipulation human body previous notions power

theory human ingenuity mans ability increase rationalisation primary motion behind social phenomena human subject change result increasing human reason human conscience ingenuity foucault denies

bodyor persona kingof territorial ruler became increasingly financial pressure cursory look medieval financial records tends show monarch could pay back debts due creditors monarch would easily readily default loans due creditors causing financial ruin creditors foucault notices time century several changes began take place like reorganization armies emerging industrial working population
