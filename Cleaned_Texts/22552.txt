nanuqsaurus teratophoneus daspletosaurus zhuchengtyrannus clade containing tarbosaurus tyrannosaurus authors suggested polytomy likely caused fragmentary nature holotype specimen dynamoterror authors also suggested area origin largebodied tyrannosaurine clade difficult determine due small amount tyrannosauroid specimens known campanian asia lack diagnostic early tyrannosaurid material northern however voris et al later assigned dynamoterror within clade containing teratophoneus lythronax authors suggested clade likely different feeding strategies tyrannosaurids belonging clade
