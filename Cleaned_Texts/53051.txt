microcirculation circulation blood smallest blood vessels microvessels microvasculature present within organ microvessels include terminal arterioles metarterioles capillaries venules arterioles carry oxygenated blood capillaries blood flows capillaries venules veinscitation needed addition blood vessels microcirculation also includes lymphatic capillaries collecting ducts main functions
