semantic dementia sd also known semantic variant primary progressive aphasia svppa progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized loss semantic memory verbal nonverbal domains however common presenting symptoms verbal domain loss word semantic dementia disorder semantic memory causes patients lose ability match words images however fairly rare patients semantic dementia develop category specific impairments though documented cases typically generalized semantic impairment results dimmed semantic representations sd one three canonical clinical syndromes associated frontotemporal lobar degeneration ftld two frontotemporal dementia progressive nonfluent aphasia sd clinically defined syndrome associated predominantly temporal lobe atrophy left greater right hence sometimes called
