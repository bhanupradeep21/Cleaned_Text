theory symplectic august mirzakhani honored fields medal prestigious award becoming first woman win prize well first award committee cited work dynamics geometry riemann surfaces moduli july mirzakhani died breast cancer age mirzakhani born may tehran child attended tehran farzanegan school part national organization development exceptional talents nodet junior senior years high school gold medal mathematics iranian national olympiad thus allowing bypass national college entrance mirzakhani became first iranian woman win gold medal international mathematical olympiad hong kong scoring following year toronto became first iranian achieve full score win two gold medals international mathematical later life collaborated friend colleague olympiad silver medalist roya beheshti zavareh persian رؤیا بهشتی زواره book elementary number theory challenging problems persian published mirzakhani zavareh together first women compete iranian national mathematical olympiad gold silver medals respectively march attending conference consisting gifted individuals former olympiad competitors mirzakhani zavareh along attendees boarded bus ahvaz en route tehran bus involved accident wherein fell cliff killing seven sharif university students incident widely considered national tragedy iran mirzakhani zavareh two obtained bachelor science mathematics sharif university technology time received recognition american mathematical society work developing simple proof theorem went united states graduate work earning phd harvard university worked supervision fields medalist curtis harvard said distinguished determination relentless questioning used take class notes native language mirzakhani research fellow clay mathematics institute professor princeton became professor stanford mirzakhani made several contributions theory moduli spaces riemann surfaces mirzakhanis early work solved problem counting simple closed geodesics hyperbolic riemann surfaces finding relationship volume calculations moduli space geodesics natural generalization idea straight line curved spaces slightly formally curve geodesic slight deformation make shorter closed geodesics geodesics also closed curves close loops closed geodesic simple cross previous result known prime number theorem geodesics established number closed geodesics length less l displaystyle l grows exponentially l displaystyle l asymptotic e l l displaystyle ell however analogous counting problem simple closed geodesics remained open despite key object unlocking structure geometry whole surface according university chicago topologist benson mirzakhanis phd thesis solved problem showing number simple closed geodesics length less l displaystyle l polynomial l displaystyle l explicitly asymptotic c l g displaystyle g displaystyle g genus roughly number holes c displaystyle c constant depending hyperbolic structure result seen generalization theorem three geodesics spherical mirzakhani solved counting problem relating problem computing volumes moduli space whose points correspond different complex structures surface genus g displaystyle g thesis mirzakhani found volume formula moduli space bordered riemann surfaces genus g displaystyle g n displaystyle n geodesic boundary components formula followed counting simple closed geodesics mentioned well number results led obtain new proof formula discovered edward witten maxim kontsevich intersection numbers tautological classes moduli subsequent work focused teichmüller dynamics moduli space particular able prove longstanding conjecture william thurstons earthquake flow teichmüller space one construct simple earthquake map cutting surface along finite number disjoint simple closed geodesics sliding edges cut past amount closing surface back one imagine surface cut strikeslip faults earthquake sort limit simple earthquakes one infinite number geodesics instead attaching positive real number geodesic one puts measure alex eskin input amir mohammadi mirzakhani proved complex geodesics closures moduli space surprisingly regular rather irregular closures complex geodesics algebraic objects defined terms polynomials therefore certain rigidity properties analogous celebrated result marina ratner arrived international mathematical union said press release astounding find rigidity homogeneous spaces echo inhomogeneous world moduli mirzakhani awarded fields medal outstanding contributions dynamics geometry riemann surfaces moduli award made seoul international congress mathematicians time award jordan ellenberg explained research popular audience work expertly blends dynamics geometry among things studies billiards move characteristic modern mathematics gets kind meta considers one billiard table universe possible billiard tables kind dynamics studies doesnt directly concern motion billiards table instead transformation billiard table changing shape rulegoverned way like table moves like strange planet around universe possible tables isnt kind thing win pool kind thing win fields medal need order expose dynamics heart geometry theres question theyre president hassan rouhani iran congratulated winning mirzakhani erdős number mirzakhani married jan vondrák czech theoretical computer scientist applied mathematician currently professor stanford mirzakhani lived palo alto mirzakhani described slow mathematician saying spend energy effort see beauty math solve problems mirzakhani would draw doodles sheets paper write mathematical formulas around drawings daughter described mothers work declared dont particular recipe developing new proofs like lost jungle trying use knowledge gather come new tricks luck might find way mirzakhani diagnosed breast cancer cancer spread bones died july age stanford hospital stanford iranian president hassan rouhani officials offered condolences praised mirzakhanis scientific achievements rouhani said message unprecedented brilliance creative scientist modest human made irans name resonate worlds scientific forums turning point showing great iranian women young people path towards reaching peaks glory various international upon death several iranian newspapers along president hassan rouhani broke taboo published photographs mirzakhani hair uncovered although newspapers used photographs dark background digital manipulation even paintings hide gesture widely noted western press social mirzakhanis death also renewed debates within iran regarding matrilineal citizenship children mixednationality parentage fars news agency reported subsequent mirzakhanis death iranian mps urged speeding amendment law would allow children iranian mothers married foreigners given iranian nationality order make easier mirzakhanis daughter visit numerous obituaries tributes published days following mirzakhanis result advocacy carried womens committee within iranian mathematical society persian کمیته بانوان انجمن ریاضی ایران international council science agreed declare mirzakhanis birthday may international women mathematics day respect various establishments also taken mirzakhanis namesake honor life achievements farzanegan high school high school mirzakhani formerly attended named amphitheater library additionally sharif university technology institute wherein mirzakhani obtained bachelors since named main library college mathematics house mathematics isfahan collaboration mayor named conference hall city students university oxford founded mirzakhani society society women nonbinary students studying mathematics university oxford mirzakhani met society september visited following donation xtx markets university oxford launched maryam mirzakhani scholarships provide support female mathematicians pursuing doctoral studies mirzakhani made member national academy sciences united states making first iranian woman officially accepted member february satellogic highresolution earth observation imaging analytics company launched ñusat type microsatellite named honor november breakthrough prize foundation announced maryam mirzakhani new frontiers prize created awarded outstanding women field mathematics year award presented earlycareer mathematicians completed phds within past two february international day women girls stem mirzakhani honoured un women one seven female
