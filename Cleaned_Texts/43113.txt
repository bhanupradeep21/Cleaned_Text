glucagonlike receptor agonists also known class drugs reduce blood sugar energy intake activating receptor mimic actions endogenous incretin hormone released gut eating agonists initially developed type diabetes american diabetes association standards medical care recommend agonists first line therapy type diabetes specifically patients atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease obesity drugs also noted reduce food intake body weight significantly also approved treat obesity absence diabetes also development indications nonalcoholic fatty liver disease polycystic ovary syndrome diseases reward system addictions agonists work activating receptor slow gastric emptying inhibit release glucagon stimulate insulin production therefore reducing hyperglycemia people type diabetes also reduce food intake therefore body weight making effective treatment another class antidiabetes drugs inhibitors work reducing breakdown endogenous generally considered less potent metabolic effects agonists rodents mediated via increased synthesis fibroblast growth factor dual receptor agonists developed pharmaceutical agonists developed initially type american diabetes association ada standards medical care diabetes include agonist inhibitor first line pharmacological therapy type diabetes patients high risk atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease heart failure also first line treatment people type diabetes kidney disease types medication combined one advantages agonists older insulin secretagogues sulfonylureas meglitinides lower risk causing ada also recommends use agonists instead starting insulin people type diabetes need additional glucose control except catabolism hyperglycemia certain threshold autoimmune diabetes metaanalysis found percent reduction allcause mortality analogs used treatment type diabetes well significant improvements cardiovascular renal metaanalysis including cardiovascular outcome trials found inhibitors reduce risk threepoint mace especially subjects estimated glomerular filtration rate egfr mlmin whereas receptor agonists beneficial persons higher likewise risk reduction due inhibitors larger populations higher proportion albuminuria relationship observed receptor agonists suggests differential use two substance classes patients preserved reduced renal function without diabetic nephropathy agonists inhibitors work reduce different mechanisms combined enhanced effect also possible provide additive cardioprotective agonists fda approved type diabetes used offlabel addition insulin help type diabetes patients improve body weight glucose agonists demonstrated cardioprotective effect used treat agonists recommended addon therapy lifestyle intervention calorie restriction exercise people bmi bmi least one weightrelated although agonists semaglutide effective weight loss drugs still less effective bariatric surgery causing weight agonists weight reduction effects come combination peripheral effects well activity brain via central nervous agonists studied treatment nonalcoholic fatty liver disease nafld least effective medications current use pioglitazone vitamin e significantly reduce steatosis ballooning necrosis lobular inflammation fibrosis according systematic semaglutide phase iii study nonalcoholic steatohepatitis severe form nafld agonists recommended treatment polycystic ovary syndrome alone combination metformin combination therapy shown greater efficacy improving body weight insulin sensitivity hyperandrogenism menstrual cycle usage agonists shown antidepressant neuroprotective effects also used treatment negative metabolic consequences secondgeneration agonists development substance use disorder condition pharmacological treatment options reduce selfadministered intake drugs alcohol nonhuman animals although effect proven humans mechanism addictionreducing effect agonists also investigation treatment binge eating disorder common eating common adverse effects agonists adverse effects limit maximum tolerated dose require gradual dose nausea vomiting diarrhea constipation commonly nausea directly related serum concentration agonist commonly reported threequarters people using shortacting agonists fewer using longacting agonists reactions injection site also common especially shorter acting human trials metaanalyses found association drugs pancreatitis pancreatic cancer however case reports pancreatitis emerged postmarketing reports american association clinical endocrinologists recommends caution people history pancreatitis discontinuation recommended acute pancreatitis occurs fda black box warning required risk thyroid ccell tumors drugs contraindicated family personal history medullary thyroid cancer multiple endocrine neoplasia type mice longterm use agonists stimulates calcitonin secretion leading ccell hypertrophy increased risk thyroid cancer however increased secretion calcitonin observed like insulin agonists cause exacerbate retinopathy believed caused indirectly rapid drop glucose rather direct patients develop antidrug antibodies common exenatide antibodies detectable third patients agonists decrease efficacy agonists increase risk gallstones used induce rapid weight native peptide hormone halflife minutes rapidly cleared enzyme dipeptidyl result different agonist drugs modified various ways extend halflife resulting drugs dosed multiple times per day daily weekly even less synthetic agonists delivered via subcutaneous injection barrier use reason selfinjected drugs especially difficult people vision motor difficulties common people type attempts develop orally bioavailable agonist either modified peptide case oral small molecule drug produced additional drug companies tested inhaled transdermal agonists expensive treatments type
