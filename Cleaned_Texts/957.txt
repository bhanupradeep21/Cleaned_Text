promiscuous gene expression pge formerly referred ectopic expression process specific thymus plays pivotal role establishment central tolerance phenomenon enables generation selfantigens called tissuerestricted antigens tras body expressed one specific tissues antigens rank among tras expressed less five tissues sixty tested antigens represented example insulin pancreas defensins gastrointestinal antigenpresenting cells apcs thymus namely medullary thymic epithelial cells mtecs dendritic cells dcs b cells capable present peptides derived tras developing cells thymus major origin cell hereby test whether cell receptors tcrs engage self entities therefore occurrence body potentially lead development autoimmune disease case thymic apcs either induce apoptosis autoreactive cells negative selection deviate become regulatory cells treg selection suppress selfreactive cells body escaped negative selection thus pge crucial tissues protection autoimmunity usual level gene expression peripheral tissues eg spleen kidney liver etc reaches mouse coding genome peripheral tissues including lungs brain testis reveal repertoire expressed genes broader importantly pge thymus

costimulatory molecules cells shown establish tolerance inactivation autoreactive cells rather inducing apoptosis aire classical transcription factor instead recognition specific consensus sequences aire seeks genes marked specific histone marks absence presence indicate transcriptionally inactive type gene recognition logically explains high numbers genes whose expression affected aire available also alternative explanation aire recognizes silenced chromatin thanks interaction molecular complex binds methylated cpg recognition aire dependent genes aire recruits topoisomerase ii perform doublestrand dna breaks transcriptional start sites brakes attract dna pk dna damage response proteins relax surrounding chromatin repair subsequently aire recruits elongation complex ptefb releases stalled rna ii polymerases therefore activates transcription pge airedependent interaction aire ptefb enabled another partner molecule stabilizes molecular altogether aire requires around fifty partner molecules properly activate among molecules rank acetylase crebbinding protein cbp enhances stability aire however dampens transactivation properties deacetylase sirtuin essential activation
