biological ornament characteristic animal appears serve decorative function rather utilitarian function many secondary sexual characteristics others appear young birds period dependent fed parents ornaments used displays attract mates may lead evolutionary process known sexual selection animal may shake lengthen spread ornament order get attention opposite sex turn choose attractive one mate ornaments often observed males choosing extravagantly ornamented male benefits females genes produce ornament passed offspring increasing reproductive fitness ronald fisher noted male offspring inherit ornament female offspring inherit preference said ornament lead positive feedback loop known fisherian runaway structures serve cues animal sexual behaviour sensory signals affect mating responses therefore ornamental traits often selected mate several evolutionary explanations presence ornaments darwin first correctly hypothesize sexual selection female choice responsible evolution elaborate plumage remarkable displays male birds quetzal sage sexual selection selection acting variation among individuals ability obtain access mating book descent man selection relation sex darwin perplexed elaborate ornamentation males species appeared detrimental survival negative consequences reproductive success darwin proposed two explanations existence traits traits useful malemale combat preferred recently many alternative theories sexual selection proposed many centered around idea elaborate male ornaments allow females assess quality males genes ensure offspring get best genes health physical vigor etc amotz zahavi proposed handicap principle idea elaborate male ornaments actually handicap males ornaments demonstrating physical quality showing survive despite potential mates know ornament indicates quality inferior mates could afford produce wastefully extravagant ornaments specifically ornaments may indicate underlying genetic quality male example peafowls tail size symmetry largely dictated words peafowl grows best tail able highest genetic quality produce impressive tail peafowl honest signal female determining health status potential william hamilton merlene zuk proposed male ornaments may enable healthy males advertise fact free diseases parasites theory known bright male according hypothesis animal diseased would able grow beautifully colored plumage since disease major source juvenile mortality females would choose males elaborate ornaments ensure healthy offspring females may improve survival offspring selecting mates basis ornamentation signals honestly reveal health numerous studies carried test sexual selection based intensity expression ornamentation males reflects level oxidative considered female choice may select traits males reliably indicate level oxidative stress traits would good indicator male elevated oxidative stress lead increased dna damage contribute aging cancer female choice thus may promote evolution ornaments males reliably reveal level oxidative stress potential mating partners ornamentation common biological trait seen birds male quetzal elaborate ornamentation aid mating male quetzals iridescent green wing coverts back chest head red belly mating season male quetzals grow twin tail feathers form amazing train three feet long one meter vibrant female quetzals ornamentation drab coloration tail feather length quetzals help determine mate choice females choose elaborately ornamented birds exhibit ornamentation include sage grouses widowbirds sage grouse birds gather lek special display area strut display plumage attract whereas extraordinary tail feathers male longtailed widowbird displayed choosy females male flies grassland biological ornamentation also seen common roach fish rutilus rutilus male roach develop sexual ornaments breeding tubercles breeding roach display leklike spawning behavior whereby females choose males usually choosing elaborately ornamented ones many instances decorations may appear ornamental actually serve functions example species spiders decorate webs shimmering ornaments order lure orbweaver spiders use elaborate ultraviolet coloured web ornaments attract bees specialize taking nectar similarly coloured flowers turn spider captures bee nest reaps food benefits case may seem ornament attract mates actually used lure trap food armaments anatomical weapons evolved amongst species whose males compete intrasexually access females armaments used direct contests opportunity mate resources needed attract mates weapons tusks antlers horns spurs lips increase success rivalry among competitors gain maintain dominance control harem obtain access territories examples animals use armaments compete battle rival males include deer antelope scarabid lucanid cerambycid beetles certain fish buck peak physical health shed antlers later weaker antlers harden breeding season drop afterward occur males except caribou antlers used extensively fighting ritualized antler antler shoving biological ornaments used courtship displays many species especially insects fish birds well known ornament used courting displays seen peafowls male peacocks spread shake tails attract impress potential mates peahens choose peacocks largest number eyespots healthiest peacocks afford divert energy nutrients towards growing expensive cumbersome explained handicap principle elaborate ornamentation increases likelihood male mate shown affect survival offspring males larger eyespots ornamented tails shown weigh likely alive years progeny males fewer ornaments play role reproduction develop influence two series first develops genes males determine presence characteristics ornament second develops genes females draw kind important studies concerning conducted stalkeyed fly showing females attracted mates share characteristics fathers therefore sexual selection mechanism differently affects sexes initially ornament may selected reasons linked reproduction time characteristic may become exaggerated due sexual females select elaborate ornamentation represents better survival skills male characteristics must physically fit enough handle unwanted predator attention comes therefore males extreme ornamentation offspring gene showiness passed evolution lead organs excessive size may become troublesome males large bushy tails bright feathers point equilibrium reached ornamentation becomes much handicap males survival vital natural selection goes work altering exaggerated characteristic reaches equilibrium sexually selected ornaments males may impose survival costs advance success competition interesting thing sexual ornaments impede males chances survival yet continue passed generation generation larger male peacocks tail feathers brighter birds feathers harder escape predators maneuver trees food need eat develop ornament peacocks tail almost certainly reduces survival peacock reduce maneuverability power flight make bird conspicuous ornaments therefore great effect fitness animals carry benefits ornament must outweigh costs passed biological ornamentation shown affect parental favoritism nestlings observed several species water example baby american coots hatch long orangetipped plumes backs throats provide signals parents used determine individuals feed experiments ornaments physically altered baby coots elaborate ornamentation proven beneficial young ornamented individuals received frequent feedings parents therefore relative growth rates ornamented chicks much higher compared experimentally altered male animals typically elaborately ornamented classic sexual selection theory notes sperm cheaper produce eggs males generally compete intensely reproductive opportunities invest less parental care females males obtain greater fitness benefits mating multiple therefore sexual selection typically results malebiased sex differences secondary sexual characteristics nonreproductive body parts help distinguish sexes female ornamentation long overlooked greater prevalence elaborate displays however circumstances females would benefit honestly signaling quality females expected invest ornamentation unless fitness benefits ornament exceed investing resources directly example scenario female ornamentation occurs pipefish within species fish sex roles reversed male responsible postzygotic care accordingly females must compete access male parental care thus females selected ornamentation benefit producing ornamentation namely male paternal care outweighs costs energy requirements notably venter becomes colourful breeding season males tend prefer females colourful venters research showing positive association ornament condition female ornamentation reliably indicates mate quality considered honest phalaropes eurasian dotterel females brightly colored males males primarily responsible parental care proposed females gain direct benefits mating females may
