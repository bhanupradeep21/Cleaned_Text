plant embryonic development also plant embryogenesis process occurs fertilization ovule produce fully developed plant embryo pertinent stage plant life cycle followed dormancy zygote produced fertilization must undergo various cellular divisions differentiations become mature end stage embryo five major components including shoot apical meristem hypocotyl root meristem root cap unlike embryonic development animals specifically humans plant embryonic development results immature form plant lacking structures like leaves stems reproductive however plants animals including humans pass phylotypic stage evolved causes developmental constraint limiting morphological embryogenesis occurs naturally result single double fertilization ovule giving rise two distinct structures plant embryo endosperm go develop zygote goes various cellular differentiations divisions order produce mature embryo morphogenic events form basic cellular pattern development shootroot body primary tissue layers also programs regions meristematic tissue formation following morphogenic events particular eudicots monocots following fertilization zygote endosperm present within ovule seen stage illustration page zygote undergoes asymmetric transverse cell division gives rise two cells small apical cell resting large basal two cells different give rise different structures establishing polarity embryo two rounds longitudinal division one round transverse division eightcelled embryo stage ii illustration indicates embryo looks like eight cell stage according laux et al four distinct domains eight cell first two domains contribute embryo proper apical embryo domain gives rise shoot apical meristem cotyledons second domain central embryo domain gives rise hypocotyl root apical meristem parts cotyledons third domain basal embryo domain contains hypophysis hypophysis later give rise radicle root cap last domain suspensor region bottom connects embryo endosperm nutritional purposes additional cell divisions occur leads sixteen cell stage four domains still present defined presence cells important aspect stage introduction protoderm meristematic tissue give rise protoderm outermost layer cells embryo name stage indicative embryos appearance point embryogenesis spherical globular stage iii photograph depicts embryo looks like globular stage indicating location endosperm important component globular phase introduction rest primary meristematic tissue protoderm already introduced sixteen cell stage according evert eichhorn ground meristem procambium initiated globular ground meristem go form ground tissue includes pith cortex procambium eventually form vascular tissue includes xylem phloem according evert eichhorn heart stage transition period cotyledons finally start form given name eudicots plants group two cotyledons giving embryo heart shaped appearance shoot apical meristem cotyledons stage iv illustration indicates embryo looks like point development indicates position cotyledons proembryo stage defined continued growth cotyledons axis addition programmed cell death must occur stage carried throughout entire growth process like however torpedo stage development parts suspensor complex must suspensor complex shortened point development nutrition endosperm utilized must space mature suspensor complex gone embryo fully stage v illustration indicates embryo looks like point development second phase postembryonic development involves maturation cells involves cell growth storage macromolecules oils starches proteins required food energy supply germination seedling growth stage seed coat hardens help protect embryo store available appearance mature embryo seen stage vi illustration end embryogenesis defined arrested development phase stop growth phase usually coincides necessary component growth called dormancy dormancy period seed germinate even optimal environmental conditions specific requirement breaking dormancy finding specific requirement seed rather difficult example seed coat extremely thick according evert eichhorn thick seed coats must undergo process called scarification order deteriorate cases seeds must experience stratification process exposes seed certain environmental conditions like cold smoke break dormancy initiate germination auxin hormone related elongation regulation also plays important role establishment polarity plant embryo research shown hypocotyl gymnosperms angiosperms show auxin transport root end hypothesized embryonic pattern regulated auxin transport mechanism polar positioning cells within ovule importance auxin shown research carrot embryos different stages subjected auxin transport inhibitors inhibitors carrots subjected made unable progress later stages embryogenesis globular stage embryogenesis embryos continued spherical expansion addition oblong embryos continued axial growth without introduction cotyledons heart embryo stage development additional growth axes hypocotyls auxin transport inhibition research conducted brassica juncea shows germination cotyledons fused two separate somatic embryos formed plant cells normally involved development embryos ie ordinary plant tissue endosperm seed coat formed around somatic embryo applications process include clonal propagation genetically uniform plant material elimination viruses provision source tissue genetic transformation generation whole plants single cells called protoplasts development synthetic seed technology cells derived competent source tissue cultured form undifferentiated mass cells called callus plant growth regulators tissue culture medium manipulated induce callus formation subsequently changed induce embryos form callus ratio different plant growth regulators required induce callus embryo formation varies type plant asymmetrical cell division also seems important development somatic embryos failure form suspensor cell lethal zygotic embryos lethal somatic embryos process androgenesis allows mature plant embryo form reduced immature pollen androgenesis usually occurs stressful embryos result mechanism germinate fully functional plants mentioned embryo results single pollen grain pollen grains consists three cells one vegetative cell containing two generative cells according maraschin et al androgenesis must triggered asymmetric division however vegetative cell starts make starch proteins androgenesis longer occur maraschin et al indicates mode embryogenesis consists three phases first phase acquisition embryonic potential repression gametophyte formation differentiation cells occur initiation cell divisions multicellular structures begin form contained exine wall last step androgenesis pattern formation embryolike structures released exile wall order pattern formation continue three phases occur rest process falls line standard embryogenesis events embryonic tissue made actively growing cells term normally used describe early formation tissue first stages growth refer different stages sporophyte gametophyte plant including growth embryos seedlings meristematic persistently embryonic growth new buds gymnosperms angiosperms young plant contained seed begins developing eggcell formed fertilization sometimes without fertilization process called apomixis becomes plant embryo embryonic condition also occurs buds form stems buds tissue differentiated grown complete structures resting state lying dormant winter conditions dry commence growth conditions become suitable start growing stem leaves flowers buds said embryonic state httpsenwikipediaorgwikiplantembryonicdevelopment
