simulation reality praised largely accurate orbital objects game except celestial bodies simulated using newtonian dynamics rocket thrust torque applied vehicles frame based placement engines joints parts limited strength much force break vehicle apart game simulates orbits using patched conic approximation instead full nbody simulation thus support lagrange points perturbations lissajous orbits halo orbits tidal forces implementing full nbody physics would require entire physics engine rewritten ingame astronauts kerbals physically simulated hitting object feet cause tumble celestial bodies atmospheres varying heights densities affecting impact drag wings parachutes simulations accurate enough realworld techniques aerobraking viable methods navigating solar system flight atmosphere results aerodynamic heating high enough temperatures cause components fail necessitating use heat shields careful flight profiles ingame atmospheres thin space finite heights unlike real atmospheres
