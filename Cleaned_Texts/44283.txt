manipulation e coli also plays important role modern biological engineering industrial work stanley norman cohen herbert boyer e coli using plasmids restriction enzymes create recombinant dna became foundation considered versatile host production heterologous researchers introduce genes microbes using plasmids allowing mass production proteins industrial fermentation processes genetic systems also developed allow production recombinant proteins using e coli one first useful applications recombinant dna technology manipulation e coli produce human modified e coli used vaccine development bioremediation production immobilised e coli used successfully produce proteins previously thought difficult impossible e coli containing multiple disulfide bonds requiring posttranslational modification stability function cellular environment e coli normally reducing disulphide bonds form proteins disulphide bonds therefore may secreted periplasmic space however mutants reduction thioredoxins glutathione impaired also allow disulphide bonded proteins produced cytoplasm e also used produce proteins various posttranslational modifications including glycoproteins using nlinked glycosylation system campylobacter jejuni engineered e efforts currently way expand technology produce complex studies also performed programming e coli potentially solve complicated mathematics problems hamiltonian path e coli frequently used model organism microbiology studies cultivated strains eg e coli welladapted laboratory environment unlike wild type strains lost ability thrive
