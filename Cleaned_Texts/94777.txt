ischemic colitis also spelled ischaemic colitis medical condition inflammation injury large intestine result inadequate blood supply although uncommon general population ischemic colitis occurs greater frequency elderly common form bowel causes reduced blood flow include changes systemic circulation eg low blood pressure local factors constriction blood vessels blood clot cases specific cause ischemic colitis usually suspected basis clinical setting physical examination laboratory test results diagnosis confirmed endoscopy using sigmoid endoscopic placement visible light spectroscopic catheter see diagnosis ischemic colitis span wide spectrum severity patients treated supportively recover fully minority severe ischemia may develop sepsis become sometimes fatally patients mild moderate ischemic colitis usually treated iv fluids analgesia bowel rest food water mouth symptoms resolve severe ischemia develop complications sepsis intestinal gangrene bowel perforation may require aggressive interventions surgery intensive care patients make full recovery occasionally severe ischemia patients may develop longterm complications chronic three progressive phases ischemic colitis symptoms ischemic colitis vary depending severity ischemia common early signs ischemic colitis include abdominal pain often leftsided mild moderate amounts rectal sensitivity findings among patients physical ischemic colitis often classified according underlying cause nonocclusive ischemia develops low blood pressure constriction vessels feeding colon occlusive ischemia indicates blood clot blockage cut blood flow coloncitation needed hemodynamically unstable patients ie shock mesenteric perfusion may compromised condition commonly asymptomatic usually apparent systemic inflammatory responsecitation needed mostly result thromboembolism commonly embolism caused atrial fibrillation valvular disease myocardial infarction cardiomyopathycitation needed addition ischemic colitis wellrecognized complication abdominal aortic aneurysm repair origin inferior mesenteric artery covered aortic review concerning patients accidental inferior mesenteric artery ligation common cause ischemic thus patients without adequate collateralization risk ischemia descending sigmoid colon bloody diarrhea leukocytosis postoperative period essentially diagnostic ischemic colitis complication prevented careful selection subjects may require replanting inferior mesenteric artery ima completing pre surgical procedure information instrumental evaluation surgical colon receives blood superior inferior mesenteric arteries blood supply two major arteries overlaps abundant collateral circulation via marginal artery colon however weak points watershed areas borders territory supplied arteries splenic flexure rectosigmoid junction watershed areas vulnerable ischemia blood flow decreases fewest vascular collateralscitation needed rectum receives blood inferior mesenteric artery internal iliac artery rectum rarely involved colonic ischemia due dual blood supplycitation needed ordinary conditions colon receives total cardiac blood flow colon drops ischemia develop arteries feeding colon sensitive vasoconstrictors presumably evolutionary adaptation shunt blood away bowel heart brain times result periods low blood pressure arteries feeding colon clamp vigorously similar process result vasoconstricting drugs ergotamine cocaine vasopressors vasoconstriction result nonocclusive ischemic colitiscitation needed range pathologic findings seen ischemic colitis corresponding spectrum clinical severity mildest form mucosal submucosal hemorrhage edema seen possibly mild necrosis severe ischemia pathologic picture resembling inflammatory bowel disease ie chronic ulcerations crypt abscesses pseudopolyps may severe cases transmural infarction resulting perforation may seen recovery muscularis propria may replaced fibrous tissue resulting following restoration normal blood flow reperfusion injury may also contribute damage ischemic colitis must differentiated many causes abdominal pain rectal bleeding example infection inflammatory bowel disease diverticulosis colon cancer also important differentiate ischemic colitis often resolves immediately lifethreatening condition acute mesenteric ischemia small bowelcitation needed devices test sufficiency oxygen delivery colon first device approved us fda uses visible light spectroscopy analyze capillary oxygen levels use aortic aneurysm repair detected colon oxygen levels fell sustainable levels allowing realtime repair several studies specificity higher acute colonic ischemia chronic mesenteric ischemia sensitivity device must placed using endoscopy recent optical test requires endoscopy see diagnosis specific blood tests ischemic colitis sensitivity tests among patients plain xrays often normal show nonspecific series patients plain abdominal radiography showing colic distension pneumoperitoneum ct scans often used evaluation abdominal pain rectal bleeding may suggest diagnosis ischemic colitis pick complications suggest alternate endoscopic evaluation via colonoscopy flexible sigmoidoscopy procedure choice diagnosis remains unclear ischemic colitis distinctive endoscopic appearance endoscopy also facilitate alternate diagnoses infection inflammatory bowel disease biopsies taken via endoscopy provide information visible light spectroscopy performed using catheters placed mm channel endoscope diagnostic see diagnosiscitation needed except severe cases ischemic colitis treated supportive care iv fluids given treat dehydration patient placed bowel rest meaning nothing eat drink symptoms resolve possible cardiac function oxygenation optimized improve oxygen delivery ischemic bowel nasogastric tube may inserted ileus presentcitation needed antibiotics sometimes given moderate severe cases data supporting practice date although recent animal data suggesting antibiotics may increase survival prevent bacteria crossing damaged lining colon use prophylactic antibiotics ischemic colitis prospectively evaluated humans many authorities recommend use based animal patients treated supportively carefully monitored develop worsening symptoms signs high white blood cell count fever worsened abdominal pain increased bleeding may require surgical intervention usually consists laparotomy bowel resectioncitation needed patients ischemic colitis recover fully although prognosis depends severity ischemia patients preexisting peripheral vascular disease ischemia ascending right colon may increased risk complications deathcitation needed nongangrenous ischemic colitis comprises vast majority cases associated mortality rate approximately however minority patients develop gangrene result colonic ischemia mortality rate surgical treatment mortality rate almost without surgical patients acute ischemic colitis may develop longterm complication known chronic ischemic symptoms include recurrent infections bloody diarrhea weight loss chronic abdominal pain chronic ischemic colitis often treated surgical removal chronically diseased portion bowelcitation needed colonic stricture band scar tissue forms result ischemic injury narrows lumen colon strictures often treated observantly may heal spontaneously months bowel obstruction develops result stricture surgical resection usual although endoscopic dilatation stenting also exact incidence ischemic colitis difficult estimate many patients mild ischemia may seek
