monogamous pairing animals refers natural history mating systems species pair bond raise offspring associated usually implicitly sexual monogamycitation needed monogamy defined pair bond two adult animals species pair may cohabitate area territory duration time cases may copulate reproduce monogamy may either shortterm lasting one seasons longterm lasting many seasons extreme cases lifelong monogamy partitioned two categories social monogamy genetic monogamy may occur together combination completely independently one example cichlid species variabilichromis moorii monogamous pair care eggs young together eggs may fertilized male giving monogamy mammals rather rare occurring larger percentage avian species known monogamous relationships avian species practice social genetic monogamy contrast previously assumed monogamy quite rare fish amphibians unheard appearing select social monogamy refers cohabitation one male one female two individuals may cooperate search resources food shelter andor caring paternal care monogamous species commonly displayed carrying feeding defending socializing social monogamy may expected sexual fidelity males existence purely social monogamy polygamous polyandrous social pair extra pair social monogamy shown increase fitness prairie voles shown female prairie voles live longer paired males social monogamous relationship could shared energy expenditure males females lower individuals largemouth bass females sometimes seen exhibit cuckoo behavior laying eggs another females nest thus stealing fertilizations sexual conflicts proposed arise social monogamy include infidelity parental investment proposed conflict derived conflictcentric differential allocation hypothesis states tradeoff investment genetic monogamy refers mating system fidelity bonding pair though individual pairs may genetically monogamous one species identified fully genetically monogamous species genetic monogamy female voles shown difference fecundity genetic monogamy may enforced males mate guarding typical tactic monogamous present many animal species sometimes expressed lieu parental care males may many reasons including paternity evolution monogamy animals broadly ascertained several theories monogamy may evolved anisogamy form sexual reproduction involves fusion two unequallysized gametes many animals two sexes male gamete small motile usually plentiful less energetically expensive female gamete larger energetically expensive made lower rate largely immobile anisogamy thought evolved isogamy fusion similar gametes multiple times many different introduction anisogamy caused males females tend different optimal mating males may increase fitness mating many females whereas females limited fecundity females therefore typically likely selective choosing monogamy suggested limit fitness differences males females mate would seem nonbeneficial males may cases several behaviors ecological concerns may led evolution monogamy relevant mating strategy partner resource availability enforcement mate assistance territory defense may prevalent factors affecting animal behavior first introduced facultative monogamy occurs females widely dispersed either occur females species tend solitary distribution resources available cause females thrive separated distinct territories instances less chance given male find multiple females mate case becomes advantageous male remain female rather seeking another risking finding another female b able fight another male interfering offspring mating female infanticide situations maletomale competition reduced female choice limited end result mate choice random dense population number effects including limiting dimorphism sexual resource availability limited mating multiple mates may harder density individuals lowered habitat sustain multiple mates monogamy may prevalent resources may found easily pair individual argument resource availability shown many species several species resource availability increases monogamy still increased resource availability males may offsetting restriction fitness several means instances social monogamy males may offset lowered fitness extra pair coupling extra pair coupling refers male females mating several mates raising offspring one mate male may related offspring main mate offspring raised broods males females thereby offsetting limitation males cuckolds female sexual partners cuckold males increase fitness males exhibit parental care habits order acceptable mate female males exhibit parental care would accepted sexual partner socially monogamous females enforcement kleiman also offered second theory obligate monogamy driving force behind monogamy greater need paternal investment theory assumes without biparental care fitness level offspring would greatly reduced paternal care may may equal maternal care related paternal care researchers argued infanticide true cause theory garnered much support however critiqued several authors including lukas cluttonbrock monogamous mating may also caused simply enforcement tactics mate species males prevent males copulating chosen female vice males help fend aggressive males keep mate seen species primates female may dominant male may need help avoid unwanted mating pair may still benefit form mate assistance however therefore monogamy may enforced ensure assistance males biparental care seen monogamous species however may cause female species mate guarding needed may still need pair protect example would sentinel behavior avian main advantage sentinel behavior many survival tactics improved stated male female act sentinel signal mate predator present lead increase survivorship foraging incubation male care offspring rather rare taxa species males may increase fitness searching multiple females limited fitness fecundity multiple mating affect fitness males opportunity find new mate earlier females internal fertilization females exhibit majority care males shown care offspring well females referred biparental care biparental care may occur lower chance survival offspring without male care evolution care associated energetically expensive biparental care exhibited many avian cases male greater chance increase fitness seeing offspring live long enough reproduce male present populations survivorship offspring drastically lowered lowering male without monogamy biparental care less common increased chance infanticide monogamous pairing would lead lowered fitness socially monogamous males seen wide monogamy mating system animals thought lower levels pre post copulatory competition reduction competition instances regulation certain morphological characteristics may lowered would result vast variety morphological physiological differences sexual dimorphism sperm quality sexual dimorphism denotes differences males females species even animals seemingly morphological sexual dimorphism visible still dimorphism gametes among mammals males smaller gametes females larger gametes soon two sexes emerge dimorphism gamete structures sizes may lead dimorphism sexual dimorphism often caused evolution response male male competition female polygamous species noted sexual dimorphism sexual dimorphism seen typically sexual signaling aspects morphology males typically exhibit dimorphic traits typically traits help signaling females male male monogamous species sexual conflict thought lessened typically little sexual dimorphism noted less ornamentation armor relaxation sexual may something feedback loop caused low population density sexual selection strenuous population low density population shrink continuing generations sexual selection become less less relevant mating becomes similar feedback loop thought occur sperm quality genetically monogamous pairs anisogamy emerged species due gamete dimorphism inherent level competition could seen sperm competition least sperm competition defined post copulatory mode sexual selection causes diversity sperm across soon sperm egg predominant mating types increase need male gametes large number unsuccessful sperm cost certain level expenditure energy without benefit individual sperm sperm polygamous sexual encounters evolved size speed structure competition causes selection competitive traits pre post species cryptic female choice one main sources competition females able choose sperm among various male typically sperm highest quality genetically monogamous species expected sperm competition absent otherwise severely limited selection highest quality sperm amongst sperm multiple males copulation random polygamous situations therefore sperm quality monogamous species higher variation lower quality sperm noted several species lack sperm competition advantageous sperm quality example eurasian bullfinch exhibits relaxed selection sperm competition sperm males lower velocity closely related polygamous passerine bird species amount abnormalities sperm structure length count compared similar bird families evolution mating systems animals received enormous amount attention biologists section briefly reviews three main findings evolution monogamy animals amount social monogamy animals varies across taxa birds engaging social monogamy mammals known list complete factors may also contribute evolution social monogamy moreover different sets factors may explain evolution social monogamy different species onesizefitsall explanation different species evolved monogamous mating systems sexual dimorphism refers differences body characteristics females males frequently studied type sexual dimorphism body size example among mammals males typically larger bodies females orders however females larger bodies males sexual dimorphism body size linked mating polygynous species males compete control sexual access females large males advantage competition access females consequently pass genes along greater number offspring eventually leads large differences body size females males polygynous males often times larger size females monogamous species hand females males equal access mates little sexual dimorphism body size new biological point view monogamy could result mate guarding engaged result sexual researchers attempted infer evolution human mating systems evolution sexual dimorphism several studies reported large amount sexual dimorphism australopithecus evolutionary ancestor human beings lived million years studies raise possibility australopithecus polygamous mating system sexual dimorphism began decrease studies suggest sexual dimorphism reached modern human levels around time homo erectus million years line reasoning suggests human ancestors started polygamous began transition monogamy somewhere million million years ago attempts infer evolution monogamy based sexual dimorphism remain controversial three reasons studies sexual dimorphism raise possibility early human ancestors polygamous rather monogamous line research remains highly controversial may early human ancestors showed little sexual dimorphism may sexual dimorphism early human ancestors relationship mating systems relative sizes male testes often reflect mating species promiscuous mating systems many males mate many females testes tend relatively large appears result sperm competition males large testes produce sperm thereby gain advantage impregnating females polygynous species one male controls sexual access females testes tend small one male defends exclusive sexual access group females thereby eliminates sperm competition studies primates support relationship testis size mating source chimpanzees promiscuous mating system large testes compared primates gorillas polygynous mating system smaller testes primates humans socially monogamous mating system moderately sized testescitation needed moderate amounts sexual nonmonogamy humans may result low moderate amount sperm competitioncitation needed species young particularly vulnerable may benefit protection parents monogamy may optimal strategy monogamy tends also occur populations small dispersed conductive polygamous behavior male would spend far time searching another mate monogamous behavior allows male mate consistently without waste energy searching females furthermore apparent connection time male invests offspring monogamous behavior male required care offspring ensure survival much likely exhibit monogamous behavior one selection factors favor different mating strategies species animal however may potentially operate large number factors throughout animals life cycle instance many species bear female often drive male soon mating later guard cubs thought may due fact many bears close one another may deplete food available relatively small growing cubs monogamy may social rarely geneticcitation needed example cichlid species variabilichromis moorii monogamous pair care eggs young eggs fertilized thierry argued monogamy result conflict interest sexes called sexual conflict species adopted monogamy great success instance male prairie vole mate exclusively first female ever mates vole extremely loyal go far even attack females may approach type behavior linked hormone vasopressin hormone released male mates cares young due hormones rewarding effects male experiences positive feeling maintain monogamous relationship test theory receptors control vasopressin placed another species vole promiscuous addition originally unfaithful voles became monogamous selected partner receptors found human brain found vary individual could explain human males tend loyal black vultures stay together beneficial young taken care parents take turns incubating eggs supplying fledglings food black vultures also attack vultures participating extra pair copulation attempt increase monogamy decrease promiscuous behaviorcitation needed similarly emperor penguins also stay together care young due harshness antarctic weather predators scarcity food one parent protect chick finds food however penguins remain monogamous chick able go chick longer needs care approximately parents part ways typically find new partner every breeding season hornbills socially monogamous bird species usually one mate throughout lives much like prairie vole female close nest cavity sealed nest plug two months time lay eggs cared mate males willing work support mate offspring order survival however unlike emperor penguin hornbills find new partners relatively uncommon find monogamous relationships fish amphibians reptiles however redbacked salamander well caribbean cleaner goby practice monogamy well however male caribbean cleaner goby fish found separate female suddenly leaving abandoned study conducted oregon state university found fish practices true monogamy serial monogamy essentially means goby multiple monogamous relationships throughout life one relationship redbacked salamander exhibited signs social monogamy idea animals form pairs mate raise offspring still partake extra pair copulation various males females order increase biological fitness relatively new concept salamanders seen frequently also concerning act monogamy may inhibit salamanders reproductive rates biological success however study conducted cooperation university louisiana lafayette university virginia showed salamanders inhibited monogamy show alternative strategies azaras night monkeys another species proved monogamous study conducted university pennsylvania monkeys proved entirely monogamous exhibiting genetic information visual information could lead assumption extra pair copulation occurring explained question male owl monkey invested much time protecting raising offspring monogamy often referred placing eggs one basket male wants ensure young survive thus pass desert grass spider agelenopsis aperta mostly monogamous well male size determining factor fights female larger male emerging winner since size signifies success future monogamous species include otters hooved animals bats certain species fox eurasian beaver beaver particularly interesting practicing monogamy reintroduction certain parts europe however american counterpart monogamous often partakes promiscuous behavior two species quite similar ecology american beavers tend less aggressive european beavers instance scarcity european beavers population could drive monogamous behavior moreover lowers risk parasite transmission correlated biological fitness monogamy proving efficient
