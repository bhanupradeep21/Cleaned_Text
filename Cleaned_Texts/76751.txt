geminiviridae genus begomovirus first report cassava mosaic disease cmd east africa since epidemics occurred throughout african continent resulting great economic loss devastating resistant line cassava predominant host pathogen established used international institute tropical agriculture nigeria resistance worked effective control many years however late century virulent virus broke uganda quickly spread east central highly virulent strain later discovered chimaera two distinct begomovirus cmd primarily managed phytosanitation practices well use conventional resistance breeding additionally vector management crossprotection help minimize transmission symptom though management practices useful viruses high rate recombination coinfection capabilities caused cmd one detrimental diseases affecting food supply cassava originated south america introduced africa relatively recent known droughttolerant crop ability yield even planted poor soils cassava first grown africa used subsidiary purposes though considered one important food staple crops production moving toward industrialized system plant material used variety products including starch flour animal cassava vegetatively propagated particularly vulnerable viruses thus cassava geminiviruses lead great economic loss infect host plant plant defense system triggered plants use gene silencing suppress viral replication though begomoviruses evolved counteracting suppressor protein natural host different species begomovirus produce different variants suppressor protein coinfection multiple species typically leads severe disease initially following infection cassava geminivirus cassava systemic symptoms symptoms include chlorotic mosaic leaves leaf distortion stunted leaf stalks characteristic infection overcome plant especially rapid onset symptoms occurs slow onset disease development usually correlates death besides conventional effects host pathogen characteristics soil fertility first shown affect symptomology mollard though cassavainfecting geminiviruses causes economic damage cassava able infect plants host range depends species virus able transmitted cause disease plants genera nicotiana cassava mosaic disease currently spreading across se cassava transmitted persistent manner whitefly bemisia tabaci vegetative propagation using cuttings infected plants occasionally mechanical cassava produces first leaves within weeks planting young leaves colonized viruliferous key infection period cmd geminiviruses infect older genome viruses two components dna b encapsidated separate geminate particles requires double inoculation cause generally whitefly requires hours feeding time acquire virus latent period hours needs minutes infect young variation literature score however sources citing acquisition time latent symptoms appear week latent adult whiteflies continue infect healthy plants hours initial acquisition single whitefly sufficient infect host however successful transmission increases multiple infected whiteflies feed entering plant leaves virus remains leaf cells singlestranded dna virus needs enter nucleus leaf cells initial period virus enters phloem travels base stem travel branches plant much slower travel stem cuttings branches infected stems may free literature indicated infection limited aboveground tissue clear would severity cassava mosaic disease impacted environmental factors light intensity wind rainfall plant density temperature given viruses transmitted whitefly spread virus going depend largely vector temperature important environmental factor controlling size vector literature vectorpreferred temperature estimates vary generally high temperatures associated high fecundity rapid development greater longevity increased light intensity shown increase activity whitefly whiteflies fly speeds mph highwind conditions move much greater distances shorter time thus increasing rate virus winddependent spread reflected location whitefly cassava fields populations greatest upwind borders lowest within virus incidence increases cassava growing thus plant density impacts spread virus lowdensity fields encouraging faster disease propagation highdensity dry areas rainfall limiting factor cassava growth higher rainfall associated higher incidence populations whitefly increase rainfall heavy rains may impede whitefly spread thus decrease incidence timing planting play important role severity disease cassava planted march showing incidence rate cmv compared seasonal distribution virus vary climate tropical rain forest type climates wet humid year rapid virus distribution occurred november june slow progress occurred july timing correlated higher lower temperatures study disease ivory coast africa maximum rate disease spread reached two months little infection occurs three months variation spread due change temperature radiation population levels whitefly control strategies cassava mosaic disease include sanitation plant resistance case sanitation means using cuttings healthy plants start healthy plot maintaining healthy plot identifying unhealthy plants immediately removing strategy protect inoculated whiteflies research shows virus aggressive plants infected contaminated cuttings insect vectors also specific varieties fare better viruses others plant resistance example hybrids result crossing cassava species manihot melanobasis glaziovii shown considerable resistance prevention methods cmv spread include avoiding planting alternative hosts virus castor bean ricinus communis
