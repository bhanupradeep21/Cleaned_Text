pulmonary circulation division circulatory system vertebrates circuit begins deoxygenated blood returned body right atrium heart pumped right ventricle lungs lungs blood oxygenated returned left atrium complete division circulatory system systemic circulation begins receiving oxygenated blood pulmonary circulation left atrium atrium oxygenated blood enters left ventricle pumped rest body returning deoxygenated blood back pulmonary circulation blood vessels pulmonary circulation pulmonary arteries pulmonary veins separate circulatory circuit known bronchial circulation supplies oxygenated blood tissue larger airways lung deoxygenated blood leaves heart goes lungs enters back deoxygenated blood leaves right ventricle pulmonary right atrium blood pumped tricuspid valve right atrioventricular valve right ventricle blood pumped right ventricle pulmonary valve pulmonary pulmonary arteries carry deoxygenated blood lungs carbon dioxide released oxygen picked arteries divided fine capillaries extremely pulmonary veins return oxygenated blood left atrium oxygenated blood leaves lungs pulmonary veins return left part heart completing pulmonary blood enters left atrium pumps

nonenglish discovery pulmonary circulation attributed many scientists credit distributed varying ratios varying sources much modern medical literature discovery credited english physician william harvey ce based comprehensive completeness correctness model despite relative sources credit greek philosopher hippocrates bce spanish physician michael servetus c ce arab physician ibn alnafis ce syrian physician qusta ibn several figures hippocrates alnafis receive credit accurately predicting developing specific elements modern model pulmonary circulation first describe pulmonary circulation discrete system separable systemic circulation whole making great strides understanding towards rigorous model great deal subjectivity involved deciding point complex system discovered typically elucidated piecemeal form first description complete accurate description significant forward leaps understanding considered acts discovery varying primitive descriptions cardiovascular system found throughout several ancient cultures earliest known description role air circulation produced egypt bce time egyptians believed heart origin many channels connected different parts body transported air well urine blood soul edwin smith papyrus bce named american egyptologist edwin smith ce purchased scroll provided evidence egyptians believed heartbeat created pulse transported substances throughout second scroll ebers papyrus c bce also emphasized importance heart connection vessels throughout body described methods detect cardiac disease pulse abnormalities although knowledge heartbeat vessels pulse egyptians attributed movement substances vessels air resided channels rather hearts exertion egyptians knew air played important role circulation yet conception role lungs next addition historical understanding pulmonary circulation arrived ancient greeks physician alcmaeon bce proposed brain heart connection point vessels body believed function vessels bring spirit pneuma air empedocles bce philosopher proposed series pipes impermeable blood continuous blood vessels carried pneuma throughout body proposed spirit internalized pulmonary hippocrates first describe pulmonary circulation discrete system separable systemic circulation corpus hippocraticum often regarded foundational text modern hippocrates developed view liver spleen produced blood traveled heart cooled lungs surrounded described heart two ventricles connected interventricular septum depicted heart nexus point vessels body proposed vessels carried blood others carried air hypothesized aircarrying vessels divisible pulmonary veins carried air left ventricle pulmonary artery carried air right ventricle blood lungs also proposed existence two atria heart functioning capture air one first begin accurately describe anatomy heart describe involvement lungs circulation descriptions built substantially previous contemporaneous efforts modern standards conceptions pulmonary circulation functions parts heart still largely greek philosopher scientist aristotle bce followed hippocrates proposed heart three ventricles rather two connected greek physician erasistratus bce agreed hippocrates aristotle heart origin vessels body proposed system air drawn lungs traveled left ventricle via pulmonary veins transformed pneuma distributed throughout body arteries contained system veins distributed blood throughout body thus blood circulate rather consumed greek physician galen c ce provided next insights pulmonary circulation though many theories like predecessors marginally completely incorrect theory pulmonary circulation dominated medical communitys understanding hundreds years galen contradicted erasistratus proposing arteries carried air blood rather air alone essentially correct leaving aside blood vessels carry constituents air air proposed liver originating point blood vessels also theorized heart pumping muscle rather organ blood galens theory included new description pulmonary circulation air inhaled lungs became pneuma pulmonary veins transmitted pneuma left ventricle heart cool blood simultaneously arriving mixture pneuma blood cooling produced vital spirits could transported throughout body via arteries galen proposed heat blood arriving heart produced noxious vapors expelled pulmonary veins first brought wrote right ventricle played different role left transported blood lungs impurities vented clean blood could distributed throughout body though galens description anatomy heart complete predecessors included several mistakes notably galen believed blood flowed two ventricles heart small invisible pores interventricular next significant developments understanding pulmonary circulation arrive centuries later persian polymath avicenna c ce wrote medical encyclopedia entitled canon medicine translated compiled contemporary medical knowledge added new information however avicennas description pulmonary circulation reflected incorrect views arab physician ibn alnafis wrote commentary anatomy avicennas canon provided possibly first known description system remains substantially congruent modern understandings spite flaws ibn alnafis made two key improvements galens ideas first disproved existence pores interventricular septum galen believed allowed blood flow left right ventricles second surmised way blood get right left ventricle absence interventricular pores system like pulmonary circulation also described anatomy lungs clear basically correct detail predecessors however like aristotle galen alnafis still believed quasimythical concept vital spirit formed left ventricle mixture blood air despite enormity ibn alnafiss improvements theories preceded commentary canon widely known western scholars manuscript discovered berlin germany result ongoing debate among western scholars credit discovery apportioned failed include ibn alnafis earliest century shortly came enjoy share several researchers described text predating work alnafis fargh beynroh va nafs comparable report pulmonary circulation researchers argue author qusta ibn luqa best candidate discoverer pulmonary circulation similar basis arguments favour alnafis took centuries scientists physicians reach conclusions similar accurate alnafis ibn luqa later progress constituting gap medieval modern understanding occurred throughout europe italian polymath leonardo da vinci ce one first propose heart muscle rather vessel spirits air still subscribed galens ideas circulation defended existence interventricular flemish physician andreas vesalius ce published corrections galens view circulatory anatomy questioning existence interventricular pores book de humani corporis fabrica libri septem spanish michael servetus first european physician accurately describe pulmonary assertions largely matched alnafis subsequent centuries frequently credited discovery historians propounded idea potentially access ibn alnafiss work writing servetus published findings christianismi restituto theological work considered heretical catholics calvinists alike result book author burned stake copies work italian physician realdo colombo c ce published book de anatomica libri xv accurately described pulmonary circulation still matter debate among historians whether colombo reached conclusions alone based unknown degree works alnafis finally influential british physician william harvey ad provided time complete accurate description pulmonary circulation scholar worldwide treatise exercitatio anatomica de motu cordis et sanguinis animalibus macroscopic level model still recognizable reconcilable modern understandings pulmonary media related pulmonary circulation wikimedia commons
