athetosis symptom characterized slow involuntary convoluted writhing movements fingers hands toes feet cases arms legs neck movements typical athetosis sometimes called athetoid movements lesions brain often direct cause symptoms particularly corpus symptom occur alone often accompanied symptoms cerebral palsy often result physical disability treatments athetosis effective cases simply aimed managing uncontrollable movement rather cause itselfcitation needed athetosis vary mild severe motor dysfunction generally characterized unbalanced involuntary movements muscle difficulty maintaining symmetrical posture associated motor dysfunction restricted part body present throughout body depending individual severity symptom one pronounced signs observed extremities particular writhing convoluted movement athetosis appear early months birth first signs including difficulty feeding hypotonia spasm involuntary writhing movements hands feet face progressively worsen adolescence times emotional athetosis caused lesions several brain areas hippocampus motor thalamus well corpus therefore children developmental age could possibly suffer severe communication deficits speech impairment hearing loss failed delayed acquirement sitting balance although people athetosis normal nearnormal athetosis symptom primarily caused marbling degeneration basal gangliacitation needed degeneration commonly caused complications birth huntingtons disease addition rare cases damage may also arise later life due stroke traumacitation needed two complications particular interest intranatal asphyxia neonatal jaundice asphyxia directly causes basal ganglia damage due lack oxygen therefore insufficient nutrient supplycitation needed lesions caused asphyxia prominent caudate nucleus however lessstudied consequence resulting hypoxia effect concentrations neurotransmitter dopamine within synapses neurons basal ganglia hypoxia leads increase extracellular dopamine levels therefore increase activity dopaminergic neurons furthermore increase extracellular concentration caused increase neurotransmitter synthesis instead inhibiting reuptake back neurons glial therefore increased dopaminergic effect dopamine remains synapse higher concentrations leading additional postsynaptic response result uncontrollable writhing motions witnessed athetosis deal overactivity synapses within basal gangliacitation needed neonatal jaundice chief complication leads basal ganglia damage associated condition jaundice caused hyperbilirubinemia abnormally high levels bilirubin blood bilirubin usually bound albumin immediately sent liver however neonatal jaundice concentration bilirubin overwhelms albumin bilirubin remains unconjugated enter brain normally bilirubin would able diffuse across barrier infants barrier immature higher permeability bilirubin toxic prevents phosphorylation many proteins including synapsin binds vesicles presynaptic therefore directly inhibits exocytosis neurotransmitters severely hinders synapses affects autopsies children suffered neonatal jaundice chronic changes neuronal loss gliosis demyelination observed basal ganglia specifically within globus another study done onset athetoid movement followed thalamic strokecitation needed thalamus part pathway involved cortical feedback loop signals cortex relayed striatum pallidus thalamus making back striatum receives excitatory inputs cortex inhibits pallidum frees thalamus pallidal inhibition allowing thalamus send excitatory outputs cortex therefore lesions thalamus part feedback loop result movement disorders alter reactivity one towards also case people thalamic stroke majority suffered severe sensory deficits ataxia proposed loss proprioception ensuing loss synergic stabilization may also lead abnormal movements dealt several different treatment approaches dealing athetosis common methods use drugs surgical intervention retraining movements afflicted person suggested training person relearn movements helpful select situations though generally type treatment work certain cases found helpful treating symptom drugs also used treatment athetosis however collective effectiveness single drug standard among treatment many different medicines used including instances drug use symptoms seem lessened tend mild cases treatment surgical intervention obviously immediate impact however cureall patients cerebral palsy cause athetosis demonstrated subthalamotomy tends help relieve extent athetosis approximately half patients additionally late early century surgical accounts state athetosis relieved removal part cerebral motor cortex cutting part posterior spinal patients undergo surgical treatment relieve athetosis often see significant improvement control limbs surgery often beneficial short term produce near immediate results long term seen effects incredibly long chorea another condition results damage basal ganglia similar athetosis results mutations affecting pallidum inhibition thalamus well increased dopaminergic activity level considering etiology disorders fairly similar comes surprise chorea athetosis usually occur together condition called choreoathetosis athetosis commonly occurring symptom disease cerebral people disease actually exhibit symptom athetosis component finding often symptoms involve athetosis occur part choreoathetosis opposed athetosis also noteworthy presence athetosis cerebral palsy well conditions causes significant increase persons basal resting metabolic rate observed cerebral palsy athetosis require approximately calories per day noncerebral palsy nonathetoid pseudoathetosis movement disorder similar athetosis symptoms differentiable actual athetosis however underlying cause different actual athetosis caused damage brain specifically basal pseudoathetosis caused loss loss proprioception caused damage area primary somatosensory cortex muscle spindles joint receptors additionally observing mri seen brain pseudoathetoid patient lesions brain seen basal area oftentimes cause athetosis characterized symptom present many forms central nervous system disorders affect body movement coordination cerebral palsy children may struggle engage social communication since poor coordination tongue mouth muscles reduce speech ability hinder social interaction greater caregivers affected children encouraged closely monitor nutrition growth provide hearing aids order relieve symptoms well support academic growing number patients shown benefit communication devices shorthand typing programs computer speech devices well simple picture patients living disorder adulthood often trouble involved daily activities eating walking dressing well performing everyday tasks consistently faced challenges limit ability live reluctant involved social activities romantic relationships likely develop poor selfesteem selfimage related physical limitations well cognitive disabilities though habitual thinking shown decline feel accepted supported patients also inclined associate people tend engaged physical activities according september issue journal physical activity health first noted case athetosis discovered w hammond described book diseases nervous system hammond also person created term athetosis greek without initial description athetosis extent uncontrolled movement limited fingers toes association noted patients calves forearms oftentimes flexed movements generally slow period time leading late century definition athetosis expanded include movements neck tongue face even trunk along expansion symptoms came recognition part many medical conditions including cerebral palsy athetosis relatively difficult treat efforts made help condition live perform tasks effectively efficiently one example work recently undertaken project help affected athetosis use computer ease software control computer uses joysticks perform linear filtering aid additional possible treatment option afflicted symptom neurostimulation studies begun cerebral palsy patients affected dystoniachoreoathetosis demonstrated neurostimulation effective treatment lessening symptoms patients tremendous amount experimentation though possible treatment disease httpsenwikipediaorgwikiathetosis
