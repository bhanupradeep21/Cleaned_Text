sinosaurus meaning chinese lizard extinct genus theropod dinosaur lived early jurassic period bipedal carnivore approximately metres ft length kilograms lb body mass fossils animal found lufeng formation yunnan province china composite term sinosaurus comes sinae latin word chinese greek word sauros σαυρος meaning lizard thus chinese lizard specific name triassicus refers triassic period fossils originally thought date sinosaurus described named chung chien young known father chinese vertebrate paleontology holotype ivpp found lower lufeng formation consists two maxillary upper jaw fragments four maxillary teeth lower jaw fragment three teeth teeth laterally compressed feature fine serrations anterior posterior edges teeth also variable size curved backwards material fragmentary determine length weight dinosaur years fossils referred sinosaurus material shown belong two fossils include sacrum three preserved sacral vertebrae material assigned sinosaurus postcrania includes mix plateosaurid melanorosaurid elements material red beds block reassigned kmv originally discovered specimen identified new species named dilophosaurus field expedition complete specimen found assigned species dong zhiming studied material sinosaurus triassicus finding quite similar dilophosaurus sinosaurus named earlier dilophosaurus sinensis became junior synonym study currie et al

two dorsal rib fragments partial proximal caudal neural arch new specimen sinosaurus described found represent new species shuangbaisaurus anlongbaoensis discovered named also considered synonym sinosaurus sinosaurus relatively large theropod early jurassic reaching ft length kg lb body according carrano et al sinensis considered least congeneric sinosaurus triassicus distinguished based fact vertical groove present lateral premaxilla adjacent contact maxilla sinosaurus dilophosaurid known complete braincase cryolophosaurus dilophosaurus zupaysaurus coelophysis kayentakatae known partial braincases two partial braincases found probably mostly complete except large sections obscured sediments exceptionally wellpreserved braincase found missing frontal bones complete skull preserved mandible cervical vertebrae described sinosaurus discovered near locality holotype found specimen also suggests three autapomorphies unique theropod regarding crest development various fenestrae originally thought coelophysoid related dilophosaurus cryolophosaurus oliver rauhut showed sinosaurus advanced theropod related cryolophosaurus dilophosaurus unpublished work carano agreed sinosaurus sinosaurus considered nomen dubium although dilophosaurus sinensis referred considered dilophosaurus sinensis shown junior synonym sinosaurus possibly closer antarctic theropod cryolophosaurus based fact anterior end jugal participate internal antorbital fenestra maxillary tooth row completely front eye socket sinensis exhibited dinofest although skull sinensis sports large nasolacrimal crests superficially like reconstructed wetherilli features elsewhere skeleton suggest closer tetanuran rauhut regarded sinensis basal tetanuran closely related sinosaurus lamanna et al examined material

monolophosaurus megalosauroidea avetheropoda recent studies placed sinosaurus outside ceratosauriatetanurae wang et al considered basalmost sinosaurus dilophosaurus possess dual crests however found crests could used skull sinosaurus deep notch premaxilla maxilla dong proposed notch used house jaw muscles giving sinosaurus powerful bite based estimated power jaws sinosaurus might either carnivore scavenger dong suspected premaxilla covered narrow hooked beak used rip open skin abdominal flesh also thought crest would used hold open abdominal cavity feeding dong studied feet sinosaurus well
