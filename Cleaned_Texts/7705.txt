conservation refers logical thinking ability allows person determine certain quantity remain despite adjustment container shape apparent size according psychologist jean piaget theory posits ability present children preoperational stage development ages develops concrete operational stage ages conservation tasks test child ability see properties conserved invariant object undergoes physical transformation following tasks also explain different types conservation piaget proposed childrens inability conserve due weakness way children think preoperational stage ages stage cognitive development characterized children focusing single salient dimension height length ignoring important attributes children stage also tend focus static characteristics objects instead focusing objects undergo changes critical element following start two glasses liquid exactly shape contain amount liquid ask child one less liquid child replies liquid one short glasses poured taller skinnier glass child conserve assume taller glass liquid shorter glass piaget famous task test conservation liquid involves showing child two beakers identical child agrees contain amount colored liquid liquid beaker poured taller thinner glass liquid poured glass identical child asked whether still amount liquid new glasses beakers child conserve would answer tall thin glasses child conserve would answer yes still amount piaget also replicated task beads glasses found children able conserve others conservation number task designed test children involves set several sticks round counters counters usually placed two parallel horizontal lines length researcher spreads counters one lines make line longer researcher asks number different number counters line child conserve answer counters longer line child conserve recognize number counters line child watches tester reassembles lines counters two lines equal length child agree length tester moves counters one line closer together line shorter asks two lines equal number counters line different number line child conserve recognize two lines number counters line conservation solid quantity task designed assess children involves two lumps clay researcher first rolls two lumps shape researcher stretches one balls long shape researcher asks child whether two clay shapes amount clay different amount child conserve answer shapes different amounts long shape child conserve understand still amount conservation solid quantity harder children learn conservation liquid occurs conservation weightmass task involves two lumps clay balance experimenter places two equal balls clay onto either side balance shows weights experimenter molds one ball clay oblong shape asks child two pieces clay still weigh amount child conserve answer weigh different amount child conserve recognize shape affect weightmass respond weigh ages children able complete conservation tasks varies individual differences cause children develop ability later earlier others also age vary across different countries see conservation across cultures however children able perform conservation number task correctly ages children develop ability ages conservation mass length occurs around age conservation weight around age conservation volume around piagets studies conservation led observe stages children pass gaining ability conserve first stage children yet ability conserve conservation liquid task children respond liquid tall glass always liquid short glass discern height amount second stage children expand judgments conservation liquid task also include width reason may answer shorter stouter glass liquid tall skinny glass third stage children gained ability conserve recognize height width affect conservers believe firmly answers conservation tasks paired nonconservers partners able offer multiple explanations likely manipulate task materials prove point many cases training tasks successful teaching nonconserving children correctly complete conservation children young four years age trained conserve using operant training involves repeating conservation tasks reinforcing correct responses correcting incorrect effects training one conservation task conservation liquid often transfer conservation research shows conserving children demonstrate greater fluency separately timed addition subtraction problems nonconserving research highlights importance logicalreversible thought element necessary conserve critical component childs ability perform inverse mathematical problems fluently nonconserving children research indicates teachers engage children ask questions often objects surrounds encourage development logical studies indicate conservation occurs similar sequence similar ages across cultures differences rate conservation cognitive abilities acquired across cultures example one study examining us zambian female adolescents found difference ability answer questions indicating ability conserve conservation weightmass another study looked children many countries australia netherlands england new zealand poland uganda tested ages conservation appears found rate children acquired conservation varied slightly different countries age trends conservation develops similar across borders despite cultural review crosscultural studies looking piagetian tasks supported finding found general stages cognitive development outlined piaget occur across cultures rate development consistent across cultures sometimes final stage formal operations reached children cultures due lack experiences would help develop kind great deal care taken crosscultural examinations conservation order avoid obtaining biased results example one study tested adolescents belonging wolof people senegal found able conserve conservation liquid however another study suggests interpretation experimenter purpose may conflicted giving straightforward answers standard piagetian questions except school interrogation wolof people seldom ask questions already know presented task languagelearning questions meaning quantity terms responses reflected understanding conservation tasks hence piagets theory criticized number fronts regards research methods many studies looked variations conservation tasks variations affect childrens responses example studies show children need assessed verbally nonverbally assessing solely verbal manner yield test results suggesting children unable conserve actuality children able answer conservation tasks correctly nonverbal research suggested asking question twice leads young children change answer assume asked got wrong first time importance context also emphasized researchers altered task naughty teddy changed array rather experimenter seemed give children clear reason second question asked fouryearold children able demonstrate knowledge conservation matter much earlier piagets reported threshold concrete research also examined whether nonhuman primates able conserve chimpanzees able make judgements whether two quantities liquid different able conserve correctly liquids transformed based inferences also able correctly conserve solid quantities able demonstrate conservation orangutans able differentiate different quantities liquid able pseudoconserve manner similar children second stage conservation development ultimately fail demonstrate complete conservation liquid see
