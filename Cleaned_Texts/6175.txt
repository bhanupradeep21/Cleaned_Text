recognition sequence dna sequence structural motif dnabinding domain exhibits binding specificity recognition sequences transcription factor example binds sequences gt indicates domain bind guanine thymine position restriction endonuclease psti recognizes binds cleaves sequence recognition sequence different recognition site given recognition sequence occur one times specific dna fragment recognition site specified position site example two psti recognition sites following dna sequence fragment starting base respectively recognition sequence specific sequence usually short less bases depending degree specificity protein dnabinding protein bind one specific sequence psti single sequence specificity always whether first recognition site second following example sequence multiple sequence specificity shown two recognition sites following example sequence fragment respective recognition sequences genetics article stub help wikipedia expanding httpsenwikipediaorgwikirecognitionsequence
