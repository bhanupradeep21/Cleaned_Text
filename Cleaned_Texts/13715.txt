phenomenon fraternal birth order research years established several facts first homosexual men tend higher birth order heterosexual men higher birth order attributed homosexual men greater number older according several studies older brother increases male childs naturally occurring odds homosexual orientation however numbers older sisters younger brothers younger sisters effect estimated approximately one seven homosexual males owes sexual orientation fraternal birth order seems effect birth order sexual orientation secondly fraternal birth order effect operates biological mechanism prenatal life childhood direct evidence fact fraternal birth order effect found even males raised biological brothers biochemical evidence found lab study determined biological brothers increase odds homosexuality laterborn males even reared different households whereas nonbiological siblings stepbrothers adopted brothers effect male sexual indirect evidence also indicates fraternal birth order

effect odds homosexuality later born males neither enhance counteract fraternal birth order blanchard bogaert investigated whether homosexual men higher mean birth order heterosexual men primarily older brothers older siblings sexes ie older brothers older confirmed homosexuality positively correlated mans number older brothers older sisters younger sisters younger multiple studies since confirmed studies homosexual subjects occasionally displayed larger number older brothers larger number older sisters comparison heterosexual men persons number older brothers number older sisters tend positively correlated proband older brothers proband b chances proband also older sisters proband findings excess older sisters hence occasional byproducts homosexual men excess older brothers found consistently excess older brothers thus need detract significance fraternal birth order samples drawn populations relatively high fertility rates positive correlation number older brothers older sisters may give false impression number older brothers number older sisters associated male sexual orientation indeed two samples high fertility samoan population displayed simultaneous fraternal sororal birth order effects however direct comparison magnitudes two effects showed fraternal birth order effect took precedence various studies metaanalyses confirmed older brother effect consistently associated fraternal birth order effect independent potential confounding factors age year birth socioeconomic also found fraternal birth order effect demonstrated whether homosexual heterosexual groups compared older brothers large small family sizes long groups family size adjusted simulate family size differs per country implication larger family size becomes greater

prenatal postnatal eg socialrearing mechanisms sought determine two account fraternal birth order effect examined association male sexual orientation biological siblings ie born mother nonbiological siblings ie adoptive siblings stepsiblings paternal halfsiblings whether long participants reared siblings also rearing social factors associated older brothers underlie fraternal birth order effect older brothers biological nonbiological reared participant predict sexual orientation older brothers share socialrearing environment younger brothers prenatal factor underlies fraternal birth order effect biological older brothers predict sexual orientation biological older brothers share prenatal characteristics eg gestation biological mother younger brothers study found biological older brothers predicted sexual orientation even number nonbiological older brothers significantly exceeded number biological older brothers hence opportunity effect via reared nonbiological older brothers high number biological older brothers nonbiological older brothers predicted sexual orientation rearing social factors underlie fraternal birth order effect amount time reared older brothers either biological nonbiological predict sexual orientation rearing time determines relative opportunity older brothers affect younger siblings postnatal sociosexual development prenatal factor underlies fraternal birth order effect postnatal factor rearing time older siblings biological nonbiological impact sexual orientation younger male siblings study found amount time reared older brothers either biological nonbiological neither predicted sexual orientation affected relationship older brothers sexual orientation thereby pointing prenatal origin fraternal birth order finally rearing social factors underlie fraternal birth order effect number biological older brothers participants reared predict sexual orientation impact postnatal sociosexual environment younger brothers prenatal factor underlies fraternal birth order effect biological older brothers participants reared still predict sexual orientation biological older brothers even reared participants share prenatal characteristics eg gestation mother younger brothers study found number biological brothers predict mens sexual orientation even participants reared biological older summation found biological older brothers significantly predicted male sexual orientation regardless whether long participants reared brothers whereas remaining sibling categories including nonbiological older brothers results thus support prenatal origin sexual orientation development indicate fraternal birth order effect probably result mothers bodys memory male births well male gestations ie every instance pregnant male even male fetus carried term still increases likelihood homosexuality subsequent male fetuses gestated mother existence fraternal birth order effect male sexual orientation confirmed many one approach establishing ubiquity effect search variety sample repeated finding fraternal birth order effect diverse samples shows effect nearly ubiquitous exception populations people older fraternal birth order effect found homosexual males different including white black hispanic east indian asian middle eastern effect also found homosexual males different historical ranging participants examined recent

homosexuality idea would supported could demonstrated causal biological factors fraternal birth order mechanism biological nature likely influence development male homosexuality nonwestern cultures thus establishing existence fraternal birth order effect hypothesized outcome fraternal birth order mechanism nonwestern culture would substantiate arguments similar biological influences underlie development homosexuality across cultures studies western well nonwestern cultures demonstrated fraternal birth order effect well fecundity effects relation male homosexuality crosscultural

mechanism causes males attracted males whatever mechanism causes males pedophilic opposed teleiophilic ie attracted adults different fraternal birth order mechanism fraternal birth order common feature identified developmental histories family demographics androphiles pedophiles key features distinguish two groups example androphilic males display gender nonconformity childhood whereas samesex attracted pedophiles prevent misunderstanding misuse studies fraternal birth order pedophiles researchers stressed conclusion homosexual pedophilia shares etiological factor androphilia imply ordinary homosexual men androphiles likely molest boys conclusion heterosexual pedophilia shares etiological factor gynephilia would imply ordinary heterosexual men gynephiles likely molest finding fraternal birth order effect cisgender transgender male androphiles men attracted boys attracted adult attracted groups differ widely possible characteristics characteristics desired suggest fraternal
