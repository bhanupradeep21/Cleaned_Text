environmental enrichment stimulation brain physical social surroundings brains richer stimulating environments higher rates synaptogenesis complex dendrite arbors leading increased brain activity effect takes place primarily neurodevelopment also adulthood lesser degree extra synapses also increased synapse activity leading increased size number glial energysupport cells environmental
