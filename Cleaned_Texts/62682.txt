phantom limb sensation amputated missing limb still attached approximately individuals amputation experience sensations amputated limb however small percentage experience painful phantom limb sensation phantom pain sensations relatively common amputees usually resolve within two three years without treatment research continues explore underlying mechanisms phantom limb pain plp effective treatment amputees experience phantom limb nonpainful amputee may feel strongly phantom limb still part people sometimes feel gesturing feel itches twitch even try pick things missing limb often feels shorter may feel distorted painful position occasionally pain made worse stress anxiety weather exposure extreme weather conditions especially freezing temperatures cause increased sensitivity sensation phantom limb pain usually intermittent continuous cases frequency intensity attacks usually declines repressed memories phantom limbs could potentially explain reason existing sensations amputation specifically several reports patients painful clenching spasms phantom hand feeling nails digging palms motor output amplified due missing limb therefore patient may experience overflow information pain patient contains repressed memories previous motor commands clenching hand sensory information digging nails palm memories remain due previous neural connections despite term phantom limb coined physician named silas weir mitchell earlier reports one first known medical descriptions phantom limb phenomenon written french military surgeon ambroise pare sixteenth century pare noticed patients continued reporting pain removed limb performed many years dominant hypothesis cause phantom limbs irritation peripheral nervous system amputation site neuroma late ronald melzack recognized peripheral neuroma account could correct many people born without limbs also experienced phantom according melzack experience body created wide network interconnecting neural structures called pons colleagues national institutes health nih showed primary somatosensory cortex macaque monkeys undergoes substantial reorganization loss sensory hearing results vilayanur ramachandran hypothesized phantom limb sensations humans could due reorganization human brains somatosensory cortex ramachandran colleagues illustrated hypothesis showing stroking different parts face led perceptions touched different parts missing limb later brain scans amputees showed kind cortical reorganization pons observed maladaptive changes cortex may account phantom limb pain pain researchers tamar makin oxford marshall devor hebrew university jerusalem argue phantom limb pain primarily result junk inputs peripheral nervous despite great deal research underlying neural mechanisms phantom limb pain still clear consensus cause brain peripheral nervous system may research continues precise mechanisms phantom limb syndrome pls sensation amputated missing limb still attached body different residual limb pain rlp often experienced people amputations rlp occurs remaining residual body part pain sensation associated pls experienced entire limb one portion missing limb phantom limb also present two ways phantom limb pain phantom limb sensations phantom limb pain painful unpleasant sensation experienced amputated limb phantom sensations nonpainful sensations perceived amputated missing limb differentiated types phantom sensations kinetic kinesthetic exteroceptive kinetic phantom sensations perceived movements amputated body part ie feeling toes flex kinesthetic phantom sensations related size shape position amputated body part ie feeling hand twisted position exteroceptive phantom sensations related sensations perceived felt amputated body part ie feelings touch pressure tingling temperature itch vibrations additional sensation people amputations experience known telescoping telescoping feel amputated limb becoming proximal body progressive pain temperature touch pressure information carried central nervous system via anterolateral system spinothalamic tracts spinoreticular tract spinomesencefalic tract pain temperature information transferred via lateral spinothalamic tracts primary sensory cortex located postcentral gyrus parietal lobe sensory information represented somatotropically forming sensory somatotopic representation seems factor experience phantom limb larger regions sensory homunculus typically experiencing phantom sensations pain areas include hands feet fingers toes phantom limb syndrome sensory input indicating pain part body longer existent phenomenon still fully understood hypothesized caused activation somatosensory one theory may related central sensitization common experience among amputees central sensitization changes responsiveness neurons dorsal horn spinal cord deals processing somatosensory information due increased activity peripheral nociceptors peripheral nociceptors sensory neurons alert us potentially damaging theories phantom limb phenomenon may relate reorganization somatosensory cortex limb removed body receives tactile input near residual limb brain convinced sensory input received amputated limb another brain region took reorganization thought related sensorydiscriminative parts pain well affectiveemotional parts ie insula anterior cingulate cortex frontal phantom sensations also occur peripheral nerve injury resulting deafferentation causes changes dorsal horn spinal cord normally inhibitory effect sensory approaches treatment past two decades shown consistent symptom improvement treatment approaches included medication antidepressants spinal cord stimulation vibration therapy acupuncture hypnosis reliable evidence lacking whether treatment effective treatments ketamine morphine may useful around time morphine may helpful longer periods evidence gabapentin perineural catheters provide local anesthetic agents poor evidence success placed surgery effort prevent phantom limb one approach received public interest use mirror box mirror box provides reflection intact hand limb allows patient move phantom limb unclench potentially painful although mirror therapy introduced vs ramachandran early little research done much subsequent research poor quality according review also criticized scientific quality many reports mirror therapy mt found goodquality studies conducted pool publications concluded mt seems effective relieving plp reducing intensity duration daily pain episodes valid simple inexpensive treatment phantom sensations may also occur removal body parts limbs eg amputation extraction tooth phantom tooth removal eye phantom eye people undergone gender reassignment surgery reported sensation phantom genitals reports less common among postoperative transgender women occur transgender men similarly subjects undergone mastectomy reported experiencing phantom breasts reports substantially less common among postoperative transgender
