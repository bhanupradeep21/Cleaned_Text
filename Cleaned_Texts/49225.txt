cognitive psychology word superiority effect wse refers phenomenon people better recognition letters presented within words compared isolated letters letters presented within nonword orthographically illegal unpronounceable letter array studies also found wse letter identification within words compared letter identification within eg wosk eg werk effect first described cattell important contributions came reicher wheeler cattell first wrote find takes twice long readwords connexion words make sentences letters connexions letters make words words make sentences letters words processes seeing naming overlap one mental effort subject recognize whole group words g reicher wheeler developed basic experimental paradigm study wse referred reicherwheeler paradigm paradigm observer presented word nonword string followed mask brief stimulus measure effects behavior observer asked name one letters cued position word string making test twoalternative forced choice example letter r word card observer might asked choose letter r usually efficient asked make choice string letters possible completion two possible letters word condition produce word wse since exhaustively studied context cognitive processes involved reading large amounts research also done try model effect using connectionist networks wse traditionally tested using tachistoscope durations letter string presentations need carefully controlled recently stimulus presentation software allowed much simpler manipulation presentation durations using computers wse also described without string letters usually four five flashed several milliseconds onto screen readers asked choose two letters flashed string example wosk flashed reader might decide whether k h wosk wse arises subjects choose correct letter consistently letter strings real words rather nonwords eg wkrg single letters existence wse generally implies type access encoding advantage words mind pseudowords single letters various studies proposed distinction result pronounceability differences nonwords pronounceable therefore easily remembered frequency real words frequently encountered used meaningfulness real words semantic value therefore better retained memory orthographic regularity real words follow familiar spelling conventions therefore better retained memory neighborhood density real words tend share letters words nonwords therefore activation mind studies proposed wse heavily affected even induced experimental factors type masking used presentation duration masks two popular models claiming explain wse interactive activation model dualroute coding model neither models takes attention account relationship looked research wse evidence shows wse persists without observers conscious awareness word presented implies attention neither necessary wse involved phenomenon however attentional focus demonstrated modulate wse agrees recent neurophysiological data explaining attention fact modulates early stages word activationverification model avm another model developed account reaction time data lexical decision naming tasks basic operations explored avm involved word letter recognition encoding verification iam avm share many basic assumptions fact stimulus input activates spatiallyspecific letter units activated letter units modulate activity word units letter word recognition frequently affected topdown processes eg reading phrase cow says person would guess moo checking word begins ignores rest wse proven important finding word recognition models specifically supported rumelhart mcclellands interactiveactivation model word recognition according model reader presented word letter parallel either stimulate inhibit different feature detectors eg curved shape c horizontal vertical bars h feature detectors stimulate inhibit different letter detectors finally stimulate inhibit different word detectors words activated stimulations however fact meaning combination letters inhibit words previously activated connection would carry different weight thus word work example would activated word therefore recognized reader according interactiveactivation model wse explained target letter presented within word feature detectors letter detectors word detectors activated adding weight final recognition stimulus however letter presented letter detector level activated therefore may remember presented stimulus word clearly thereby accurate identifying component letters observed wse deals encoding verification decision operations encoding used describe early operations lead unconscious activation learned units memory encoding verification occurs verification often leads conscious recognition single lexical entry respondents verification viewed independent topdown analysis stimulus guided stored previously learned representation word realtime processing verification mimicked computer simulation lastly factors affecting speed accuracy performance particular paradigm depend whether decisions based primarily information encoding verification one findings johnston mcclelland report wse occur inevitably whenever compare word nonword rather depends somewhat upon strategies readers use task readers paid attention letter particular position would experience adverse word superiority effect reader would longer benefit word detector
