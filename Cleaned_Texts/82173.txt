myxofibrosarcoma mfs although rare type tumor one common soft tissue sarcomas ie cancerous tumors develop soft tissues elderly initially considered type histiocytoma termed fibrous histiocytoma myxoid variant malignant fibrous angervall et al termed tumor myxofibrosarcoma world health organization reclassified mfs separate distinct category malignant fibroblastic myofibroblastic mfs tumors often treated surgical resection however tumors high recurrence rates sites local recurrences followed surgical resections may repeated multiple times cycles mfs tumors often progress lower grade higher aggressive grade metastasize become uncommon variant mfs tumors termed epithelioid myxofibrosarcoma even likely follow aggressive recurrent metastasizing lifethreatening course common form mfs mfs usually afflicts individuals fifth seventh decades life although uncommon cases occur adults outside age one large study mfs diagnosed individuals years old median age years studies diagnosed mfs slightly often men one large study conducted france found common individuals mfs present tumor located extremity cases usually lower extremity trunk cases head neck areas rarely tumors presented breast heart paratesticular region ie area inside scrotum including epididymis spermatic cord along bone liver multiple sites primary tumors presenting abdominal cavity retroperitoneum pelvis

individuals presenting localized mfs tumors radical surgical resection include cm margin soft tissue surrounding tumor planned resection entire area defined mridetected increased signals images done
