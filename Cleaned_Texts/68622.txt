huemul project spanish proyecto huemul early argentine effort develop fusion power device known thermotron concept invented austrian scientist ronald richter claimed design would produce effectively unlimited power richter able pitch idea president argentina juan perón soon received massive funding build experimental site huemul island lake outside town san carlos de bariloche patagonia near andes mountains construction began late site completed carrying tests february richter measured high temperatures suggested fusion achieved march day important international meeting leaders americas perón publicly announced richter successful adding future energy would sold packages size milk worldwide interest followed along significant skepticism part physicists little information forthcoming papers published topic next year number reporters visited site denied access buildings increasing pressure perón arranged team investigate richters claims return individual reports negative review reports equally negative project ended time optimism earlier news inspired groups around world begin research nuclear fusion perón overthrown aftermath richter arrested fraud appears spent periods time abroad including time libya eventually returned argentina died according rainer karlschs hitlers bomb world war ii german scientists walter gerlach kurt diebner carried experiments explore possibility inducing thermonuclear reactions deuterium using high explosivedriven convergent shock waves following karl gottfried guderleys convergent shock wave solution time richter proposed memorandum german government officials induction nuclear fusion shock waves highvelocity particles shot highly compressed deuterium plasma contained ordinary uranium vessel proposal carried shortly election perón began purge argentinas universities eventually resulted professors fired quitting causing serious setback argentine science lasting enmity perón argentine intelligentsia response physical association argentina afa began organize community retain links argentine scientists spread director afa physicist enrique gaviola wrote proposal set comisión nacional de investigaciones científicas national scientific research commission arguing postworld war ii friction leading cold war would present opportunity various northern hemisphere scientists move south escape limits

argentina richter invited join group arrived argentina august travelling name dr pedro tank personally introduced perón richter pitched perón idea nuclear fusion device would provide unlimited power make argentina world scientific leader purely civilian intent perón intrigued clearly impressed later telling reporters half hour explained secrets nuclear physics well pretty good idea gaviola still maintaining pressure form nuclear research group saw interest evaporate point offered services member richters firing german scientists including guido beck walter seelmanneggbert nowelderly richard gans quickly realized something amiss entire affair began align afa steering clear richter government general afa meeting september beck publicly resigned university buenos aires richter soon given laboratory tanks córdoba site early fire destroyed equipment richter claimed sabotage demanded protected location free support immediately forthcoming richter went tour visiting canada perhaps us europe year later lise meitner recalled meeting strange austrian argentine visa vienna demonstrated device claimed thermonuclear system meitner later dismissed chemical richters tour thinly veiled

changed design hole filled march edward miller us assistant secretary station interamerican affairs visited argentina ostensibly visit pan american games reality advance calling meeting american leaders later month discuss chinas entry korean war perón gave miller introduction richters work miller filed memo period perón seized argentine newspaper la prensa whose editor fled us led harsh criticism us miller suggested policy masterful inaction actively denying support project simply never providing leadership meeting take place march april time chinese emergency passed war entering new phase perón took opportunity announce richters results world march perón held press conference casa rosada stated february atomic energy pilot plant huemul island thermonuclear experiments carried

navy captain pedro iraolagoitía iraolagoitía soon began protest well finally convincing perón project instead calling upon local physics community perón put together team consisting iraolagoitía priest two engineers including mario báncora young physicist josé antonio balseiro time studying england asked return team visited site series demonstrations september committee analyzed richters work published separate reports topic september balseiro particular convinced nothing nuclear taking place report critiqued richters claims system supposed work especially claims system reaching temperatures needed demonstrate fusion stated fusion reactions would require something order million kelvin center electric arc would perhaps kelvin pointed richters radiation detectors showed large activity whenever arc discharged even fuel present meanwhile teams detectors showed low activity reported findings perón richter allowed officially respond report government appointed physicists richard gans antonio rodríguez review first report well richters response second group endorsed findings first review panel found richters response inadequate november richter buenos aires military
