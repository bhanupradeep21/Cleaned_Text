tendency attribute leadership effectiveness personality leadership style leader thus fixed measured calls least preferred coworker lpc scale instrument measuring individuals leadership orientation lpc scale asks leader think people ever worked describe person worked least well using series bipolar scales following high lpc score suggests leader human relations orientation low lpc score indicates task orientation fiedler assumes everybodys least preferred coworker fact average equally unpleasant people indeed relationship motivated tend describe least preferred coworkers positive manner eg pleasant efficient therefore receive higher lpc scores people task motivated hand tend rate least preferred coworkers negative manner therefore receive lower lpc scores least preferred coworker lpc scale actually least preferred worker instead person takes test persons motivation type individuals rate least preferred coworker relatively favorable light scales derive satisfaction interpersonal relationship rate coworker relatively unfavorable light get satisfaction successful task performance method reveals individuals emotional reaction people work critics point always accurate measurement

villages central america taskoriented leader performed better situations favorable relatively unfavorable relationshiporiented leader fared better situations intermediate lpc personality measure score believed quite stable time easily changed low lpcs tend remain low high lpcs tend remain high shows testreliability lpc according fiedler ability control group situation second component contingency model crucial leader leaders situational control confident orders suggestions carried followers leaders unable assume control group situation sure members leading execute commands situational control critical leadership efficacy fiedler broke factor three major components leadermember relations task structure position moreover ideal leader lowlpc taskoriented highlpc relationshiporiented leaders effective leadership orientation fits situation contingency theory allows predicting characteristics appropriate situations effectiveness three situational components determine favourableness situational control relations power basic findings contingency model taskmotivated leaders perform generally best favorable situations either conditions power control influence high conversely uncertainty low situation unfavorable low power control influence relationshipmotivated leaders tend perform best situations moderate power control relationship taskmotivated leaders perform well situations others accurate speak good poor leader rather leader may perform well one type situation another outstanding directors research teams necessarily make good production foremen military leaders outstanding battle field commanders like general patton necessarily make good chiefs staff good chairmen volunteer school picnic good leadermember relation highly structured task high leader position power situation considered favorable situation fiedler found lowlpc leaders effective extremely favourable unfavourable situations whereas highlpc leaders perform best situations intermediate favourability leaders high positions power ability distribute resources among members meaning reward punish followers leaders low position power control resources extent leaders high power lack degree situational control example ceo business high position power able increase reduce salary employees receive hand office worker business low position power although may leader new business deal control situation rewarding disciplining colleagues salary since personality relatively stable though changed contingency model suggests improving effectiveness requires changing situation fit leader called job engineering job restructuring organization leader may increase decrease task structure position power also training group development may improve leadermember relations book improving leadership
