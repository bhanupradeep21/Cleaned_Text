syndrome legius syndrome inherited autosomal dominant manner incontinentia pigmenti xlinked dominant sturgeweber syndrome sporadic neurocutaneous disorders found exclusively mosaics sturgeweber syndrome proteus syndrome others neurofibromatosis type well tuberous sclerosis complex potentially mosaics may mosaicism may suspected cases either mild incomplete presentation neurocutaneous disorder definitive diagnosis likely obtained testing affected tissues patients families affected neurocutaneous disorders often benefit genetic counseling may provide opportunity provide better understanding potential risk future offspring well improve coping various implications condition desired prenatal diagnosis obtained either amniocentesis chorionic villus sampling another potential option preimplantation genetic diagnosis embryo mutation selectively implanted many neurocutaneous syndromes established diagnostic criteria may facilitate diagnosis without necessarily requiring genetic testing instance neurofibromatosis types tuberous sclerosis complex incontinentia pigmenti formal diagnostic whereas syndromes noonan syndrome multiple lentigines instance cases conditions diagnostic criteria suspected genetic testing likely necessary diagnostic criteria perfect sensitivity specificity similarly genetic testing produce false negatives example genetic testing positive cases tuberous sclerosis thus clinicians must apply clinical judgement evaluating individual suspected neurocutaneous syndrome treatment neurocutaneous syndrome unique neurocutaneous syndromes neurofibromatosis tuberous sclerosis complex guidelines recommendations surveillance less common syndromes guidelines yet available surveillance necessity many neurocutaneous syndromes new manifestations may develop time may detected specific focused testing thus patients may advised obtain particular evaluations eg mri ophthalmologic dermatological examinations within recommended intervals time aim detecting new manifestations syndrome early currently available treatments neurocutaneous syndromes address underlying genetic cause example epilepsy surgery tuberous sclerosis complex vestibular schwannoma surgery neurofibromatosis type however treatments address underlying cause use mtor inhibitors tuberous sclerosis complex currently significant efforts underway develop additional treatments address underlying causes neurocutaneous neurocutaneous syndromes complex lifelong conditions potential affect many different organ systems time thus patients may benefit
