aprepitant sold brand name emend among others medication used prevent chemotherapyinduced nausea vomiting cinv prevent postoperative nausea vomiting may used together ondansetron taken administered intravenous common side effects include tiredness loss appetite diarrhea abdominal pain hiccups itchiness pneumonia blood pressure severe side effects may include use pregnancy appear harmful use well aprepitant belongs class receptor antagonists works blocking substance p attaching aprepitant approved medical use european union united states made merck world health organizations list essential aprepitant used prevent chemotherapyinduced nausea vomiting cinv prevent postoperative nausea vomiting may used together ondansetron aprepitant classified antagonist blocks signals given receptors therefore decreases likelihood vomiting patients g proteincoupled receptor located central peripheral nervous system receptor dominant ligand known substance p sp sp neuropeptide composed amino acids sends impulses messages brain found high concentrations vomiting center brain activated results vomiting reflex addition also plays key part transmission pain impulses peripheral receptors central nervous system aprepitant shown inhibit acute delayed emesis induced cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs blocking substance p landing receptors brains neurons positron emission tomography pet studies demonstrated aprepitant cross blood brain barrier bind receptors human also shown increase activity receptor antagonists ondansetron corticosteroid dexamethasone also used prevent nausea vomiting caused clinical testing new class therapeutic agent characterized terms preclinical metabolism excretion studies average bioavailability found around aprepitant metabolized primarily minor metabolism seven metabolites aprepitant weakly active identified human plasma moderate inhibitor aprepitant increase plasma concentrations coadministered medicinal products metabolized specific interaction demonstrated oxycodone aprepitant increased efficacy worsened side effects oxycodone however unclear whether due inhibition antagonist following iv administration prodrug aprepitant converted rapidly completely aprepitant approximately total radioactivity excreted urine feces unchanged substance excreted aprepitant made morpholine core two substituents attached adjacent ring carbons substitute groups trifluoromethylated fluorophenyl group aprepitant also third substituent triazolinone joined morpholine ring nitrogen three chiral centres close together combine produce amino acetal arrangement empirical formula shortly merck initiated research reducing severity likelihood cinv researchers discovered aprepitant effective prevention researchers worked coming process create aprepitant within short period came effective synthesis substance original synthesis deemed workable proved crucial step achieving commercialization however merck decided process environmentally sustainable due original synthesis requiring six steps many needed dangerous chemicals sodium cyanide dimethyltitanocene gaseous ammonia addition process effective cryogenic temperatures needed steps steps produced hazardous byproducts environmental concerns synthesis aprepitant became great merck research team decided withdraw drug clinical trials attempt create different synthesis gamble taking drug clinical trials proved successful shortly afterwards team merck researchers came alternative environmentally friendly synthesis aprepitant new process works four compounds similar size complexity fused together therefore much simpler process requires three steps half number original synthesis new process begins enantiopure trifluoromethylated phenyl ethanol joined racemic morpholine precursor results desired isomer crystallizing top solution unwanted isomer remaining solution unwanted isomer converted desired isomer crystallizationinduced asymmetric transformation end step secondary amine base drug formed second step involves fluorophenyl group attached morpholine ring achieved third final step initiated step involved side chain triazolinone added ring step successfully completed stable molecule aprepitant streamlined route yields around aprepitant original process reduces operating cost significant amount addition new process also reduces amount solvent reagents required saving estimated per ton aprepitant improvements synthesis process also decreased longterm detriment natural environment associated original procedure due eliminating use several hazardous chemicals approved us food drug administration fda fosaprepitant intravenous form aprepitant approved united states plans develop aprepitant antidepressant subsequently trials receptor antagonists casopitant orvepitant shown promising beyond suggestions pet receptor occupancy must used routinely cap dosing new medical indications human receptor occupancy might required consistent psychopharmacological therapeutic critical scientific dissection debate data might needed enable aprepitant class antagonists whole fulfill preclinically predicted utilities beyond cinv ie psychiatric disorders addictions neuropathic pain migraine osteoarthritis overactive bladder inflammatory bowel disease disorders suspected inflammatory immunological components however data remain proprietary thus reviews expanded clinical potential drugs like aprepitant range aprepitant identified extraordinarily effective rescue antiemetic due cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome nausea severe cyclical vomiting cramping abdominal pain occur due prolonged highdose cannabis use standard first line antiemetics zofran compazine often ineffective cannabinoid hyperemesis secondline treatments like haloperidol droperidol limited effectiveness ie may control vomiting nausea remains many patients published case study reported elimination nausea vomiting hospitalized patient previously responded ondansetron metoclopramide prochlorperazine omeprazole ranitidine promethazine haloperidol cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome two unusual features compulsive hot andor application topical capsaicin relieve nausea vomiting large percentage patients capsaicin hot showers thought work modulating receptor pathway turn reduces release substance would follow antagonists like aprepitant would also effective via decreased substance
