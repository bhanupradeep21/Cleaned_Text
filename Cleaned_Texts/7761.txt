ornithocheiromorpha ancient greek meaning bird hand form group pterosaurs within suborder pterodactyloidea fossil remains group date back early late cretaceous periods valanginian turonian stages around million years ago ornithocheiromorphs discovered worldwide except antarctica though genera recovered europe asia south diverse successful pterosaurs early cretaceous throughout late cretaceous replaced better adapted advanced pterosaur species pteranodontids azhdarchoids ornithocheiromorpha defined andres colleagues made ornithocheiromorpha inclusive clade containing ornithocheirus ornithocheiromorphs considered largest animals ever flown members group also regarded largest pterosaur wingspans one estimated huge tropeognathus though still large estimated azhdarchids may reached meters ornithocheiromorphs first appeared initially scavengers consisting terrestrial setting success made top predators skies well common type fisheating pterosaur throughout early late cretaceous paleontologists also consider ornithocheiromorphs earlier step evolution pteranodontids due similar flying techniques flight locomotions well diet mainly consisted fish therefore also hunted similarly ornithocheiromorphs also flew like soaring birds keeping wings stretched rarely flapping first specimens ornithocheiromorphs unearthed chalk pit near burham kent england british paleontologist james scott bowerbank named described remains found pterodactylus giganteus common time assign new described pterosaur species chalk pit p giganteus two pterosaur species discovered first named bowerbank pterodactylus honor prominent german naturalist zoologist georges cuvier second described year british paleontologist sir richard owen pterodactylus p compressirostris later became type species newly created genus called lonchodectes meaning lance biter review english paleontologist reginald walter hooley confusingly species also long regarded incorrectly type species pterosaur specimens found uk given new species pterodactylus simus british paleontologist harry govier seeley created new genus ornithocheirus new species year generic name translating bird hand due notion time pterosaurs ancestors modern birds seeley reassigned species pterodactylus cuvieri ornithocheirus richard owen proposed two new genera coloborhynchus meaning maimed beak criorhynchus meaning ram beak coloborhynchus consisted totally new type species c clavirostris well two species reassigned ornithocheirus criorhynchus consisted entirely former ornithocheirus species including simus later reassigned owen criorhynchus brazilian paleontologists taissa rodrigues alexander kellner made deeper analysis species pterodactylus cuvieri analysis stated needed separate genus assigning ornithocheirus inappropriate therefore created new genus called cimoliopterus new resulting combination cimoliopterus cuvieri study rodrigues kellner also reviewed species pterodactylus giganteus reassigned newly created genus called lonchodraco resulted new combination called lonchodraco seeley described new fossil remains isle wight island coast southern england thought belonged kind birdlike creature named ornithodesmus seeley also reported another specimen found site considered another species ornithodesmus seeley named new species latidens meaning wide later reginald hooley discussed latidens detail based specimens found led ornithodesmus placed within new family called paleontologist charles william andrews however expressed doubts whether latidens belonged genus ornithodesmus vertebrae specimen genus based differed markedly hooleys british paleontologists stafford c howse andrew c milner concluded holotype sacrum specimen cluniculus didnt belong pterosaur instead maniraptoran theropod dinosaur also pointed detailed attempts made compare sacrum cluniculus pterosaurs latidens effect treated type species genus howse milner david martill moved latidens new genus called istiodactylus also named new family called istiodactylidae istiodactylus important ornithocheiromorph discoveries include anhanguerids tropeognathus anhanguera romualdo formation tropeognathus described type species mesembrinus german paleontologist peter wellnhofer generic name derived greek τρόπις tropis meaning keel γνάθος gnathos meaning jaw specific name derived koine mesembrinos noontide simplified southern reference provenance southern hemisphere description led enormous taxonomic brazilian paleontologist alexander kellner considered anhanguera coloborhynchus mesembrinus veldmeijer criorhynchus mesembrinus german paleontologist michael mesembrinus considered junior synonym ornithocheirus simus british paleontologist david unwin proposed ornithocheirus mesembrinus however taissa rodrigues alexander kellner concluded tropeognathus would valid containing mesembrinus type discovery asia specifically northwestern china reported lake sediments allowed exceptional preservation fossils therefore paleontologists qiu zhanxiang wang banyue started official excavations part findings consisted dense concentrations pterosaur bones associated soft tissues eggs new species named described hamipterus tianshanensis named wang xiaolin alexander kellner jiang shunxing wang qiang yingxia yahefujiang paidoula cheng xin taissa rodrigues meng xi zhang jialiang

meters istiodactylus example wingspan ranging meters ft complete known skull estimated centimeters ft length based longlost fragment jaw reported though jaws measured centimeters less percent skulls anhanguerids typically larger others group successful within food chain rather ornithocheiromorphs one reason large size example tropeognathus mesembrinus normal wingspan meters ft meters ft maximum another species impressively large coloborhynchus capito total skull length could centimeters ft leading estimated wingspan meters however species may belong different genus called anhanguerids bore distinctive convex keeled crests snout underside mandible well developed several genera similar anhanguera possessed jaws tapered width expanded broad spoonshaped rosette tip jaws distinguished relatives several differences crest teeth unlike close relatives coloborhynchus ornithocheirus crest upper jaw anhanguera didnt begin tip snout therefore set farther back anhanguerids like cearadactylus first preparations many serious mistakes front snout lower jaws confused leading reconstruction anterior part head upside teeth extensively restored enlarged wider front jaws showed large robust teeth projecting outward arrangement maxilla kinked interlocking teeth suggested cearadactylus piscivourous diet allowing animal keep hold slippery another smaller genus similar cearadactylus guidraco holotype skull length centimeters makes smaller genera skull elongated however hollow profile seen pointed upper edge line jaw run nearly parallel even though ornithocheiromorphs didnt cranial crest like closely related pteranodontids exceptions included caulkicephalus caulkicephalus rounded snout similar ornithocheirus anhanguera therefore placed within either anhangueridae ornithocheiridae depending caulkicephalus also large pterosaur wingspan estimates around meters vertebral column ornithocheiromorphs heavily pneumatized extensive system air sacs leaving prominent pneumatic neck ornithocheiromorphs typically relatively long robust longer torso derived neural spines ornithocheiromorph cervical vertebrae generally tall genera tropeognathus istiodactylus six dorsal vertebrae fused genera anhanguera four seven sacral vertebrae fused tail well known ornithocheiromorphs however zhenyuanopterus known caudal vertebrae formed one longest tails anhanguera another wellknown genus shorter tail broad caudal vertebrae bore duplex crosssection similar pelvis ornithocheiromorphs moderate size compared body whole similar ornithocheiroids three pelvic bones often fused seen many species anhanguera santanae ilium long low front rear blades projected horizontally beyond edges lower pelvic despite structure length processes rodlike forms indicate hindlimb muscles attached limited pubic bone fused broad ischium ischiopubic blade resulting narrow build sometimes blades sides fused closing pelvis forming pelvic canal front pubic bones also articulated unique structure resulting pair prepubic bones within formed cusp covering rear belly located pelvis belly ribs hip joint ornithocheiromorphs perforated allowed considerable mobility leg suggests vertical therefore function breathing compensating relative rigidity chest several studies show ornithocheiromorphs less derived toothless pteranodontids pteranodon based different evolutionary changes therefore need grouped different clade pteranodon though still within david unwin considered family istiodactylidae group toothless pteranodontidae within group alexander kellner however grouped toothed anhangueridae instead resulting understandable change evolution two toothed brian andres colleagues found families istiodactylidae ornithocheiridae anhangueridae form group called lanceodontia consists advanced ornithocheiromorphs clade however excludes poorly known family lonchodectidae even though members family previously seen derived forms toothed pterosaurs analysis also included family boreopteridae within clade anhangueria though placed basal position also containing genus however nicholas longrich colleagues found boreopteridae outside anhangueria sister taxon family lonchodectidae groups placed basal members competing theories ornithocheiromorph phylogeny evolutionary relationships cladogram following topology recovered brian andres using recent iteration

cearadactylus ornithocheiridae anhangueridae ludodactylus guidraco cimoliopterus camposipterus aetodactylus cladogram showing results phylogenetic analysis presented longrich et al analysis placed genus hongshanopterus basal hongshanopterus lonchodraco lonchodectes boreopteridae istiodactylidae aetodactylus cimoliopterus guidraco ludodactylus cearadactylus brasileodactylus ornithocheiridae anhangueridae several new species ornithocheiromorphs found former species ornithocheirus wiedenrothi renamed targaryendraco description iberodactylus spain also made paleontologists reclassify genus hamipterus newly named family called ornithocheirid cimoliopterus also reclassified well currently grouped aetodactylus camposipterus clade targaryendraconia specifically family however analysis jacobs et al recovers camposipterus cimoliopterus within ornithocheiridae using new data matrix including previously recovered basal eupterodactyloid haopterus reclassified due description mimodactylus placed new family called however recent analysis using data description mimodactylus found haopterus basal member inclusive group many recent analyses also recovered several ornithocheirids including tropeognathus coloborhynchus caulkicephalus within family anhangueridae meaning closely related anhanguera ornithocheiromorphs originally regarded piscivorous creatures feeding mainly small midsized paleontologists even suggested details pterosaurs caught fish included dipping beaks close water hooley example found beak well known istiodactylus similar birds herons storks skimmers suggested istiodactylus probably fed fish mainly based jaw reconstruction peter wellnhofer compared jaw endings istiodactylus duck noticed wasnt duckbilled pterosaur anything similar even though popularly called analysis witton found teeth istiodactylus unlike recurved enlarged teeth seen derived ornithocheirids ornithocheirus instead pointed razoredged better suited carrion rather another ornithocheiromorph possessed similar features istiodactylus liaoxipterus known skull several unique traits including numerous peglike teeth shape teeth indicated liaoxipterus possible though conclusion isnt considered entirely anhanguerids like tropeognathus coloborhynchus considered fisheaters longer sharper teeth compared rounded teeth istiodactylus though still sometimes another difference seen primitive ornithocheiromorphs eyes proportionally smaller compared assumed predatory advanced anhanguerids adds fact primitive groups likely scavengers later got successful within food chain leading later advanced groups dominant fish hunters early late ornithocheiromorphs like pterosaurs considered skilled fliers well swift moving ground footprints several species show pterosaurs sprawl limbs large degree modern reptiles rather held limbs relatively erect walking like dinosaurs footprints yet known likely ornithocheiromorphs also walked compared earlier pterosaurs rhamphorhynchids ornithocheiromorphs unusually uneven limb proportions forelimbs resulting much longer scale compared hind limbs close relatives pteranodontids also found similar features though likely flew like modernday albatrosses rather anything else paleontologists also suggest likely spend long stretches time sea fishing traveling long distances without flapping time flying close surface water exploited wind speed without necessity would likely required use unique modes locomotion compared pterosaurs already seen earlier evolutions istiodactylus nurhachius powerful musculature attachments welldeveloped pectoral upper arm also possible ornithocheiromorphs ran walked bipedally used hopping many pterosaur researchers like mike habib noted limb proportions ornithocheiromorphs anhanguera consistent hopping though scavenging istiodactylids probably still best examples pterosaurs terrestrial even though ornithocheiromorphs discovered worldwide concentrated specific places one fossil site called romualdo formation contains impressive amount pterosaur fossils diverse lagerstätte larger geologic group called santana group sometimes called santana formation located araripe basin northeastern brazil dates back around million years ago albian stage early cretaceous formation includes many species several fossil remains basal ornithocheiromorphs including brasileodactylus cearadactylus unwindia well anhanguerids coloborhynchus maaradactylus pterosaur genera many recovered site also include thalassodromines tupuxuara well tapejarid creatures formation include theropods

formation referred brannerion rhinobatos rhacolepis tharrhias tribodus santana group also consists another lagerstätte called crato formation diverse romualdo formation fossil remains still considered fossil site underlies romualdo formation dates back around million years ago aptian stage meaning fossil content older age similarly crato formation also contained several species pterosaurs including basal lanceodontians brasileodactylus well ornithocheirid arthurdactylus pterosaur genera include tapejarids tupandactylus well chaoyangopterid lacusovagus formation also contains creatures enantiornithine cratoavis neosuchian susisuchus several species fish including belonostomus fish genera suggested prey pterosaurs lived formation fossil remains limited subject still another important fossil site wessex formation isle wight near coast england dates back around million years ago berriasian barremian stages formation doesnt contain many fossil remains pterosaurs compared romualdo
