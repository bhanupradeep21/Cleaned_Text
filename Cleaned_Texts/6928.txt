dercums disease rare condition characterized multiple painful fatty tumors called lipomas grow anywhere subcutaneous fat scalp plantar surface sometimes referred adiposis dolorosa medical literature dercum disease syndrome disease several clinically recognizable features signs symptoms characteristic tend occur together term adiposis dolorosa may correct term dercums disease often used along acronym onset dercums disease rapid insidious progressive beginning often third decade obesity rapid weight gain common dd chronic fatigue pain unresponsive pain associated dercum disease often severe may caused lipomas pressing nearby nerves inflamed connective tissue also called fascia commonly associated cause mechanism dercums disease remains possible causes include genetics autosomal dominant inheritance trauma nervous system dysfunction disturbances endocrine system metabolism fat maybe autoimmune cases dercums may occur one people family familial multiple although surgical resection liposuction improves pain regrowths occur dd mainly occurs adults ages years women affected disease described first time american neurologist francis xavier dercum headed university pennsylvania neurological clinic personal physician president woodrow published two papers disease used term adiposis dolorosa disease reported also philadelphia american physician james meschter anders british physician medical biographer guy hospital london sir william hale white past dercums considered synonymous lipedema regarded separate condition recognized world health organization orphanet national organization rare disorders also listed four cardinal symptoms sometimes used diagnostic criteria potential signs disease include however unclear symptoms cardinal symptoms minor signs dercums disease unclear used diagnostic criteria researchers proposed minimal definition based symptoms often part dercums disease generalized overweight obesity chronic pain adipose associated symptoms dercums disease include obesity fatty deposits easy bruisability sleep disturbances impaired memory depression difficulty concentrating anxiety rapid heartbeat shortness breath diabetes bloating constipation fatigue weakness joint muscle regarding associated symptoms dercums disease case reports published study involving medical examinations performed large group currently known causes disease studies currently proposing several theories causes include inflammation adipose tissue nervous system malfunction endocrine malfunction none theories currently proposed found viable since little known dercums disease currently known modes currently known mechanisms disease diagnosis dercums disease done physical examination order properly diagnose patient doctor must first exclude possible differential diagnoses basic criteria dercums disease patients chronic pain adipose tissue body fat patients also obese although rare diagnosis may include dercums disease also inherited family medical history may aid diagnosis specific laboratory test disease ultrasound magnetic resonance imaging play role common treatments dercums disease directed towards treating individual symptoms pain relief medication may administered temporarily reduce discomfort patient cortisone shots also shown effective temporarily reducing chronic pain surgical removal damaged adipose tissue effective often disease recur convincing large studies treatment dercums disease conducted different treatment strategies exist based case reports currently lack scientific data use integrative therapies treatment prevention dercums disease enough studies done substantiate diet supplements could help diseasecitation needed treatment methods include following modalities surgical excision fatty tissue deposits around joints liposuction used cases liposuction may temporarily relieve symptoms although recurrences often traditional analgesics pain dercums disease often reported refractory analgesics nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids however contradicted findings herbst et al reported pain diminished patients treated nsaids patients treated narcotic analgesics dosage required duration pain relief precisely stated article lidocaine early report showed intralesional injections procaine relieved pain six cases recently types local treatment painful sites lidocaine patches lidocaineprilocaine mg cream shown reduction pain treatment intravenous infusions lidocaine varying doses reported nine patients resulting pain relief lasted hours months five cases lidocaine treatment combined mexiletine class antiarrhythmic similar pharmacological properties lidocaine mechanism lidocaine reduces pain dercums disease unclear may block impulse conduction peripheral nerves thereby disconnect abnormal nervous impulse circuits nonetheless might also depress cerebral activity could lead increased pain thresholds iwane et al performed eeg administration intravenous lidocaine eeg showed slow waves appearing minutes start infusion disappearing within minutes end infusion hand pain relief effect greatest minutes end based authors concluded effect lidocaine peripheral nerves likely explains drug effect pain dercums disease contrast atkinson et al suggested effect central nervous system likely lidocaine depress consciousness decrease cerebral metabolism addition skagen et al demonstrated patient dercums disease lacked vasoconstrictor response arm leg lowering indicated sympathicusmediated local venoarteriolar reflex absent could suggest increased sympathetic activity infusion lidocaine increased blood flow subcutaneous tissue normalised vasoconstrictor response limbs lowered authors suggested pain relief caused normalisation upregulated
