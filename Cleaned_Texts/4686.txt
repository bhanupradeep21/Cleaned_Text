genetic algorithms ga general evolutionary algorithms ea chromosome also sometimes called genotype set parameters define proposed solution problem evolutionary algorithm trying solve set solutions also called individuals according biological model known genome individual consists one rarely chromosomes corresponds genetic representation task solved chromosome composed set genes gene consists one semantically connected parameters often also called decision variables determine one phenotypic characteristics individual least influence basic form genetic algorithms chromosome represented binary later eas general wide variety data structures creating genetic representation task determined decision variables degrees freedom task improved ea possible additional heuristics genotypephenotype mapping look like design chromosome translates considerations concrete data structures ea selected configured extended worst case created finding suitable representation problem domain chromosome important consideration good representation make search easier limiting search space similarly poorer representation allow larger search context suitable mutation crossover must also found newly defined fit chosen chromosome design important requirement operators allow points search space reached principle also make easy following requirements must met wellsuited chromosome first requirement indispensable depending application ea used one usually satisfied fulfilling remaining requirements far possible noted however evolutionary search supported possibly considerably accelerated fulfillment complete possible classical form gas use bit strings map decision variables optimized onto example one boolean three integer decision variables value ranges displaystyle

significant redundancy improved alternative added genotypephenotype mapping could look like displaystyle processing tasks realvalued mixedinteger decision variables eas evolution realcoded suited case mixedinteger values rounding often used represents violation redundancy requirement necessary precisions real values reasonably narrowed violation remedied using integercoded purpose valid digits real values mapped integers multiplication suitable factor example becomes integer multiplying must course taken account genotypephenotype mapping evaluation result presentation common form chromosome consisting list array integer real values combinatorial problems mainly concerned finding optimal sequence set elementary items example consider problem traveling salesman wants visit given number cities exactly shortest possible tour simplest obvious mapping onto chromosome number cities consecutively interpret resulting sequence permutation store directly chromosome one gene corresponds ordinal number however variation operators may change gene order remove duplicate chromosome thus contains path possible tour cities example sequence displaystyle nine cities may serve following

chromosomes dynamic length required gene type definitions also contain information permissible value ranges gene parameters observed chromosome generation corresponding mutations lead lethal mutations tasks combinatorial part suitable genetic operators move reposition genes whole ie parameters scheduling task used illustration workflows scheduled require different numbers heterogeneous resources workflow specifies work steps processed parallel executed one context heterogeneous resources mean different processing times different costs addition different processing scheduling operation therefore requires one parameters determine resource selection value ranges parameters depend number alternative resources available work step suitable chromosome provides one gene type per work step case one corresponding gene one parameter required resource order genes determines order scheduling operations therefore precedence case allocation conflicts exemplary gene type definition work step
