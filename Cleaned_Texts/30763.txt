panner disease osteochondrosis capitellum panner disease primarily seen boys ages five ten years panner disease often caused excessive throwing due valgus stress disease causes pain stiffness affected elbow may limit extension affected elbow usually dominant arm child disease may associated pitching athletic activity radiographs capitellum may appear irregular areas radiolucency treatment symptomatic good prognosis treatment minimal includes restricting athletic activity allow elbow heal pain disease named danish radiologist hans jessen panner individual panner disease commonly experiences elbow pain near symptoms include symptoms worsen physical activity throwing ball gymnastics example symptoms begin unexpectedly often present several days weeks symptoms tend last even extremely rare disease unknown exactly causes panner disease believed disease may brought continuous overuse elbow puts pressure elbow also strains elbow children period rapid bone growth overuse elbow due involvement sports baseball handball gymnastics sports involve throwing putting lot pressure repeated activities cause microtraumas results affected elbow swollen irritated pain panner disease results blood supply capitellum disrupted therefore cells within growth plate capitellum die becomes flat due softening collapsing surrounding bonecitation needed panner disease affects elbow arm elbow humerus meets ulna radius humerus long bone runs shoulder elbow ulna radius two bones make capitellum rounded knob end humerus held radius due radiuss cuplike shape panner disease part family bone development diseases known osteochondrosis blood supply area developing bone dominant elbow temporarily disrupted something yet well therefore tissues bone getting enough blood begin go necrosis begin die normally bones grow expansion uniting growth plates osteochondrosis disrupts process result cell death loss newly formed tissue death tissues eventually leads deterioration bones growth plate bones growth plate defined area end developing bone cartilage cells change bone bone tissue regrow necrosis cause temporary problems affected area strenuous arm elbow activity significantly decreased stopped period believed panner disease precursor similar condition called osteochondritis dissecans capitellum ocd different panner disease ocd occurs older children involve growth plate time ocd occurs growth plates already fused skeleton finished growingcitation needed symptoms become prominent child visit pediatrician family doctor confirm whether child panner disease child visits doctor doctor seek information childs age sports participation activity level childs dominant arm affected elbow compared healthy elbow differences two location pain elbow childs range motion extension also determined make accurate diagnosis check childs range motion extension limitation child asked move arm affected elbow various directions movement arm various directions allow doctor conclude good child able move arm doctor able determine pain caused various directions confirm diagnosis xray mri scan done radiograph enable doctor visualize irregularities see shape capitellum also visualize growth plate panner disease capitellum may appear flat bone growth plate look irregular fragmented areas bone breakdown occurred also visualized patient undergoes mri scan irregularities capitellum able visualized bone able visualized detail determine extent swelling mri results panner disease decreased signal intensity capitellum series increased signal intensity prevent future instances panner disease child instructed cease physical sports activities involve use affected elbow symptoms relievedcitation needed goal treatment panner disease relieve pain treatment panner disease minimal children bones repair blood supply rebuild leads rebuilding growth plate capitellum returns normal period rebuilding regrowth varies child child last anywhere weeks several months relieve pain child restricted participating sports activities elbow healed also rest affected elbow rest allow pain relieved return full elbow movement may also recommended children apply icepack heat elbow alleviate pain swelling child great difficulty bending straightening arm physical therapy may also recommended occasionally recommended children use nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids acetaminophen also reduce pain treatment panner disease heals well children rest restriction physical activity sports using affected arm prognosis also good treatment affected capitellum remodeled irregularities capitellum surrounding elbow area seen radiograph mri treatment effective flattened fragmented capitellum completely remodeled returns normal circular shape also high intensity signal mri series results indicate capitellum completely remodeled child able return normal physical sports activitiescitation needed although exact cause panner disease unknown recent research concluded may associated frequent throwing athletic article talks varying osteochondrosis diseases pointed panner disease always involves alteration capitellum visualized radiography another research article research team aimed summarize best available evidence diagnosis treatment panner disease article found common symptoms patients panner disease present elbow stiffness swelling limited range motion limited elbow alignment previously mentioned article team researchers also concluded panner disease involves irregularity capitellum specifically appears flattened panner disease often gets misdiagnosed osteochondritis dissecans ocd article distinguish difference two diseases age difference radiographic alignment two previously discussed articles another article reports three case studies panner disease states primary treatment used panner disease rest restriction physical athletic activity involves use upper extremities activity suggested
