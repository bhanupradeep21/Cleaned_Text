emerging technologies technologies whose development practical applications still largely unrealized technologies generally new also include older technologies finding new applications emerging technologies often perceived capable changing status quo emerging technologies characterized radical novelty application even origins relatively fast growth coherence prominent impact uncertainty ambiguity words emerging technology defined radically novel relatively fast growing technology characterised certain degree coherence persisting time potential exert considerable impact socioeconomic domains observed terms composition actors institutions patterns interactions among along associated knowledge production processes prominent impact however lies future emergence phase still somewhat uncertain emerging technologies include variety technologies educational technology information technology nanotechnology biotechnology robotics artificial intelligencenote new technological fields may result technological convergence different systems evolving towards similar goals convergence brings previously separate technologies voice telephony features data productivity applications video together share resources interact creating new efficiencies emerging technologies technical innovations represent progressive developments within field competitive converging technologies represent

superfluous push mass extinction made unnecessary advocates benefits technological change typically see emerging converging technologies offering hope betterment human condition cyberphilosophers alexander bard jan s√∂derqvist argue futurica trilogy man basically constant throughout human history genes change slowly relevant change rather direct indirect result technological innovation memes

transhumanist philosopher nick bostrom warn technologies could pose dangers perhaps even contribute extinction humanity ie could involve existential much ethical debate centers issues distributive
