strong reciprocity area research behavioral economics evolutionary psychology evolutionary anthropology predisposition cooperate even apparent benefit topic particularly interesting studying evolution cooperation behaviors seem contradiction predictions made many models response current work strong reciprocity focused developing evolutionary models account critics strong reciprocity argue artifact lab experiments reflect cooperative behavior real variety studies experimental economics provide evidence strong reciprocity either demonstrating peoples willingness cooperate others demonstrating willingness take costs punish one experimental game used measure levels cooperation dictator game standard form dictator game two anonymous unrelated participants one participant assigned role allocator role recipient allocator assigned amount money divide way choose participant trying maximize payoff rational solution nash equilibrium allocator assign nothing recipient meta study dictator game studies engel found average allocation participants giving nothing choosing equal split give recipient trust game extension dictator game provides additional evidence strong reciprocity trust game extends dictator game multiplying amount given allocator recipient value greater one allowing recipient give amount back allocator case participants trying maximize payoff recipient give nothing back allocator allocator assign nothing recipient meta analysis trust game studies revealed allocator gave average receiver returned average third commonly used experiment used demonstrate strong reciprocity preferences public goods game public goods game number participants placed group participant given amount money allowed contribute allocation common pool common pool multiplied amount greater one evenly redistributed participant regardless much contributed game anyone trying maximize payoff rational nash equilibrium strategy contribute anything however study fischbacher observed average contributions second component strong reciprocity people willing punish fail cooperate even punishment costly two types punishment second party third party punishment second party punishment person hurt parties failure cooperate opportunity punish noncooperator third party punishment uninvolved third party opportunity punish noncooperator common game used measure willingness engage second party punishment ultimatum game game similar previously described dictator game allocator divides sum money recipient ultimatum game recipient choice either accept offer reject resulting players receiving nothing recipients payoff maximizers nash equilibrium accept offer therefore allocators interest offer close zero however experimental results show allocator usually offers rejected recipient time recipients likely reject low offers rather high another example second party punishment public goods game described earlier second stage added participants pay punish participants game payoff maximizers rational strategy nash equilibrium punish contribute however experimental results show participants willing pay punish deviate average level contribution much becomes disadvantageous give lower amount allows sustained modifications dictator game prisoners dilemma provide support willingness engage costly third party punishment modified dictator game exactly traditional dictator game third party observing allocator makes decision third party opportunity pay punish allocator payoff maximizing third party would choose punish similarly rational allocator would choose keep entire sum however experimental results show majority third parties punish allocations less prisoners dilemma third party punishment two participants play prisoners dilemma must choose either cooperate defect game set regardless player rational income maxizer always choose defect even though players cooperating yields higher payoff players defecting third player observes exchange pay punish either player income maximizing third parties rational response would punish income maximizing players would choose defect study demonstrates near majority participants willing pay punish one participant defects parties defect still willing researchers investigated extent behavioral economic lab experiments social preferences generalized behavior field study fehr leibbrandt examined relationship

peter richersons model evolution third party punishment demonstrates even though logic underlying altruistic giving altruistic punishment may evolutionary dynamics model first employ cultural group

coordinated costly punishment quorumsensing model agent chooses whether willing engage punishment sufficient number agents willing engage punishment group acts collectively administer important aspect model strong reciprocity selfregarding rare population may altruistic common within group significant crosscultural variation observed strong reciprocity behavior dictator game experiments run small scale societies across world results experiments showed dramatic variation groups mean offer little great pattern receiver results also interesting participants cultures rejecting offers henrich colleagues determined best predictors dictator game allocations size group small groups giving less market integration involved markets participants study repeated different small scale societies better measures market integration finding similar pattern results consistent culturegene coevolution later paper researchers identified religion third major contributor people participate world religion likely exhibit strong reciprocity particularly prominent criticism strong reciprocity theory correspond behavior found actual environment particular existence third party punishment field called responded criticism pointing effective third party punishment rarely used therefore difficult others suggested evidence third party costly punishment critics responded claims arguing unfair proponents argue demonstration costly third party punishment well lack costly third party punishment evidence existence also question whether ethnographic evidence presented costly third party punishment call additional analysis costs benefits research shown different types strong reciprocity predict types strong reciprocity within existence strong reciprocity implies systems developed based purely material selfinterest may missing important motivators marketplace section gives two examples possible implications one area application design incentive schemes example standard contract theory difficulty dealing degree incompleteness contracts lack use performance measures even cheap implement strong reciprocity models based suggest explained peoples willingness act fairly even material selfinterest experimental results suggest indeed case participants preferring less complete contracts workers willing contribute fair amount beyond would another application strong reciprocity allocating property rights ownership structure joint ownership property similar public goods game owners independently contribute common pool returns investment evenly distributed parties ownership structure subject tragedy commons parties selfinterested one invest alternatively property could allocated owner employee relationship employee hired owner paid specific wage specific level
