screen screening technique allows rapid convenient detection recombinant bacteria vectorbased molecular cloning experiments method screening usually performed using suitable bacterial strain organisms yeast may also used dna transformation ligated vector vector inserted competent host cell viable transformation grown presence xgal cells transformed vectors containing recombinant dna produce white colonies cells transformed nonrecombinant plasmids ie vector grow blue colonies molecular cloning one commonly used procedures molecular biology gene interest may inserted plasmid vector via ligation plasmid transformed escherichia coli cells however plasmids transformed cells may contain desired gene insert checking individual colony presence insert timeconsuming therefore method detection insert would useful making procedure less time laborintensive one early methods developed detection insert screening allows identification successful products cloning reactions colour bacterial colony method based principle αcomplementation βgalactosidase gene phenomenon αcomplementation first demonstrated work done agnes ullmann laboratory françois jacob jacques monod function inactive mutant βgalactosidase deleted sequence shown rescued fragment βgalactosidase sequence αdonor peptide still langley et al showed mutant nonfunctional βgalactosidase lacking part nterminus residues deleted may complemented peptide formed residues filamentous phage containing sequence coding first amino acid later constructed messing et al αcomplementation via use vector demonstrated formation blue plaques cells containing inactive protein infected phage grown plates containing puc series plasmid cloning vectors vieira messing developed system first plasmids constructed take advantage screening method dna ligated plasmid disrupts α peptide therefore complementation process functional βgalactosidase form cells transformed plasmid containing insert therefore form white colonies cells transformed plasmid without insert form blue colonies result successful ligation thus easily identified white coloration cells formed unsuccessful blue βgalactosidase protein encoded lacz gene lac operon exists homotetramer active state however mutant βgalactosidase derived strain e coli nterminal residues deleted mutant ωpeptide unable form tetramer inactive mutant form protein however may return fully active tetrameric state presence nterminal fragment protein αpeptide rescue function mutant βgalactosidase αpeptide called αcomplementation method screening host e coli strain carries lacz deletion mutant contains ωpeptide plasmids used carry laczα sequence encodes first residues βgalactosidase αpeptide neither functional however two peptides expressed together plasmid containing laczα sequence transformed cells form functional βgalactosidase enzyme screening method works disrupting αcomplementation process plasmid carries within laczα sequence internal multiple cloning site mcs mcs within laczα sequence cut restriction enzymes foreign dna may inserted within laczα gene thereby disrupting gene produces αpeptide consequently cells containing plasmid insert functional βgalactosidase may formed presence active βgalactosidase detected xgal colourless analog lactose may cleaved βgalactosidase form spontaneously dimerizes oxidizes form bright blue insoluble pigment results characteristic blue colour cells containing functional βgalactosidase blue colonies therefore show may contain vector uninterrupted laczα therefore insert white colonies xgal hydrolyzed indicate presence insert laczα disrupts formation active βgalactosidase recombinant clones analyzed isolating purifying small amounts plasmid dna transformed colonies restriction enzymes used cut clone determine fragment dna necessary sequenced plasmids colonies need isolated point whether cut using restriction enzymes performing assays correct type vector competent cells important considerations planning screen plasmid must contain laczα examples plasmids pbluescript e coli cell contain mutant lacz gene deleted sequence ie commonly used cells genotype also understood lac operon affected presence glucose protein eiiaglc involved glucose import shuts lactose permease glucose transported cell media used agar plate therefore include glucose xgal lightsensitive therefore solution plates containing xgal stored dark isopropyl iptg functions inducer lac operon may used media enhance expression lacz xgal expensive material thus methods developed order screen bacteria gfp developed alternative help screen bacteria concept similar αcomplementation dna insert disrupt coding sequence within vector thus disrupt gfp production resulting nonfluorescing bacteria recombinant vectors vector insert white express gfp protein nonrecombinant vector fluoresce uv light gfp general used reporter gene individuals definitively determine clone carries gene researchers analyzing occasion medium colonies grow influence screen introduce falsepositive xgal medium occasionally degrade produce blue color gfp lose fluorescence medium impact researchers capabilities determine colonies desire recombinant possess white colonies may contain desired recombinant plasmid number reasons ligated dna may correct one properly ligated possible linearized vector transformed ends repaired ligated together laczα produced blue colonies may formed mutation also lead αfragment expressed colony vector also appear white may sometimes appear satellite colonies antibiotic used depleted also possible blue colonies may contain insert occurs insert frame laczα gene stop codon absent insert lead expression fusion protein functional laczα structure disrupted correct recombinant construct sometimes give lighter blue colonies may complicate identification
