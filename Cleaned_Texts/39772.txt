archaellum pl archaella formerly archaeal flagellum unique structure cell surface many archaea allows swimming motility archaellum consists rigid helical filament attached cell membrane molecular motor molecular motor composed cytosolic membrane pseudoperiplasmic proteins responsible assembly filament assembled rotation rotation filament propels archaeal cells liquid medium manner similar propeller boat bacterial analog archaellum flagellum also responsible swimming motility also compared rotating corkscrew although movement archaella flagella sometimes described whiplike incorrect cilia eukaryotes move manner indeed even flagellum word derived latin meaning whip misnomer bacterial flagella also work propellerlike structures early studies archaeal flagella identified several differences archaella flagella although differences dismissed possible adaptation archaella extreme ecological environments archaea time known inhabit first genomes archaeal organisms sequenced became obvious archaea code proteins part flagellum thus establishing motility system archaea fundamentally different bacteria order highlight difference two organelles name archaellum proposed following studies showed evolutionarily structurally different bacterial flagella eukaryotic archaella evolutionarily structurally related type iv filament systems tff family seems originated last universal common ancestor diversified archaella type iv pili type ii secretion systems tad first observations known archaellum took possibly place years ago even identification archaea archaea identified initially carl woese george e threedomain life eucarya archaea bacteria proposed years also suggested first time proteins compose archaellum filament distinct assemble flagella filament although convincing data still lacking next decade became apparent archaella thus far studied possessed strange features heavy presence glycosylation archaellins monomers form archaella filament discovery helped cloning first archaellinsthe strangeness archaella confirmed late first genome sequences archaeal species published namely methanocaldococcus jannaschii archaeoglobus fulgidus pyrococcus horikoshii although genes archaellins identified three genomes possible identify gene homolog involved flagellation besides evidence archaellum related flagellum also time similarities archaella type iv pili became one clearer evidences time observation archaellins synthesised cytoplasm preproteins signal peptide needs cleaved prior insertion presumably base growing archaellar filament flagellins hand synthesised preproteins rather proteins synthesised mature state travel lumen flagellar filament therefore hollow assemble based similarities archaella type iv pili first proposal archaella
