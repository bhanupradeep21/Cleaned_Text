norwood procedure first three surgeries intended create new functional systemic circuit patients hypoplastic left heart syndrome complex heart defects single ventricle first successful norwood procedure involving use cardiopulmonary bypass reported dr william imon norwood jr colleagues variations norwood procedure stage palliation proposed adopted last years however key steps remain unchanged order utilize right ventricle main blood pumping mechanism systemic pulmonary circulation connection left right atria established via atrial septectomy next connection right ventricle aorta forged reconstruction narrowed outflow track using tissue graft distal main pulmonary lastly aortopulmonary shunt created connecting aorta main pulmonary artery provide pulmonary blood flow second surgery also known glenn procedure focuses separating systemic pulmonary circulation pulmonary vascular resistance drops accomplished removing aortopulmonary conduit followed creation bidirectional svcpulmonary third surgery stage fontan procedure inferior vena cava ivc large vein carrying blood back heart lower part body connected branch pulmonary arteries surgery completed venous blood returning body flows directly norwood procedure commonly performed treat hypoplastic left heart syndrome however variations procedure also used palliation mitral tricuspid subsets transposition great arteries conditions urgent problem heart unable pump blood systemic circulation ie body goal three surgeries ultimately connect single ventricle systemic circulation accomplish blood flow lungs disrupted therefore alternative path must created provide blood flow entry body cavity norwood procedure gained vertical incision sternum separation sternum necessary surgery complex may vary slightly depending diagnosis overall condition heart surgery heart divided two main main pulmonary artery separated left right portions pulmonary artery joined upper portion aorta widening pulmonary artery often necessary may accomplished using patients existing biological tissue appropriate animal tissue allows blood mixture oxygenated deoxygenated pumped body via morphologic right ventricle pulmonary valve point surgery right ventricle directly connected systemic circulation neoaorta reconstructed aortic outflow track second step procedure establishes blood flow variations step proposed years however two adapted general practice last years cases conduit used direct blood flow lungs however anatomic anchoring varies two different types shunts used procedure modified blalock traussig mbts right ventricle pulmonary artery shunt rvpa sano shunt mbts shunt provides connection pulmonary artery brachiocephalic artery subclavian artery rvpa conduit provides connection right ventricle pulmonary arterycitation needed single ventricle reconstruction conducted compared two conduits one three five year intervals although rvpa shunts performed better one three year end points five year follow demonstrated difference survival improvement freedom norwood procedure infants enter interstage typically lasts months period patients medically optimized using diuretics infants normally undergo norwood procedure within first three seven days postpartum decision earlier intervention rests neonates cardiopulmonary status interstage period period norwood procedure stage ii palliation remains associated mortality rates ranging risk factors contributing increased interstage mortality identified gestational age less weeks delivery hispanic ethnicity census block poverty level airway complications well difficulties feeding upper respiratory infections also associated increased mortality despite results svr trial blalocktaussig conduits remained significantly associated interim death compared rvpa bypass year post immediate post surgical complications reported multiple studies involve paralysis vocal cords due close proximity recurrent laryngeal nerve cardiac sack cardiac arrhythmias result potential cardiac tissue manipulation damage proteinlosing increasing survival rates even complicated congenital heart diseases hlhs long term outcomes neurodevelopemental closely analyzed svr trial data et al ohye demonstrated average performance scored using psychomotor developmental index pdi mental developmental index mdi bayley scales infant development infants months older additionally ages stages questionnaire asq used three year follow consisting five domains asq evaluates communication gross motor fine motor problem solving personalsocial interactions statistical analysis demonstrated average performance norwood patients compared reference population five aforementioned domains risk factors directly affecting pdi score found lower birth weight longer length stay following norwood procedure complications norwood procedure year prenatal detection hlhs defect critical successful palliation hlhs incompatible life postpartum treatment surgery despite surgical intervention infants constant risk circulatory failure death fact recent reviews suggest infants live past years age furthermore infants mortality risk per year following last stage first ever series documented norwood procedures performed dr william imon norwood dr norwood american physician completed fellowship cardiothoracic pediatric surgery boston childrens medical center bcmc boston time bcmc became interested complex congenital heart defects particularly hlhs direct supervision program mentor dr aldo castanedo performed later perfected would become three stage
