dysphagia difficulty although classified symptoms signs contexts classified condition may sensation suggests difficulty passage solids liquids mouth lack pharyngeal sensation various inadequacies swallowing mechanism dysphagia distinguished symptoms including odynophagia defined painful globus sensation lump throat person dysphagia without odynophagia dysfunction without pain odynophagia without dysphagia pain without dysfunction together psychogenic dysphagia known dysphagia classified following major patients limited awareness dysphagia lack symptom exclude underlying dysphagia goes undiagnosed untreated patients high risk pulmonary aspiration subsequent aspiration pneumonia secondary food liquids going wrong way lungs people present silent aspiration cough show outward signs aspiration undiagnosed dysphagia also result dehydration malnutrition kidney signs symptoms oropharyngeal dysphagia include difficulty controlling food mouth inability control food saliva mouth difficulty initiating swallow coughing choking frequent pneumonia unexplained weight loss gurgly wet voice swallowing nasal regurgitation patient complaint swallowing asked food getting stuck patients often point cervical neck region site obstruction actual site obstruction always level level obstruction perceivedcitation needed common symptom esophageal dysphagia inability swallow solid food patient describe becoming stuck held either passes stomach regurgitated pain swallowing odynophagia distinctive symptom highly indicative carcinoma although also numerous causes related cancer achalasia major exception usual pattern dysphagia swallowing fluid tends cause difficulty swallowing solids achalasia idiopathic destruction parasympathetic ganglia auerbachs myenteric plexus entire esophagus results functional narrowing lower esophagus peristaltic failure throughout complications dysphagia may include aspiration pneumonia dehydration weight following table enumerates possible causes dysphagia difficulty inability swallow may caused exacerbated usage opiate andor opioid causes dysphagia considered differential diagnoses common ones esophageal dysphagia almost always caused disease adjacent esophagus occasionally lesion pharynx stomach many pathological conditions causing dysphagia lumen becomes progressively narrowed indistensible initially fibrous solids cause difficulty later problem extend solids later even liquids patients difficulty swallowing may benefit thickened fluids person comfortable liquids although far scientific study proves thickened liquids dysphagia may manifest result autonomic nervous system pathologies including due rapid iatrogenic correction electrolyte older adults presbyphagia normal healthy changes swallowing associated age considered alternative explanation many ways treat dysphagia swallowing therapy dietary changes feeding tubes certain medications surgery treatment dysphagia managed group specialists known multidisciplinary team members multidisciplinary team include speech language pathologist specializing swallowing disorders swallowing therapist primary physician gastroenterologist nursing staff respiratory therapist dietitian occupational therapist physical therapist pharmacist role members multidisciplinary team differ depending type swallowing disorder present example swallowing therapist directly involved treatment patient oropharyngeal dysphagia gastroenterologist directly involved treatment esophageal disordercitation needed implementation treatment strategy based thorough evaluation multidisciplinary team treatment strategies differ patient patient basis structured meet specific needs individual patient treatment strategies chosen based number different factors including diagnosis prognosis reaction compensatory strategies severity dysphagia cognitive status respiratory function caregiver support patient motivation adequate nutrition hydration must preserved times dysphagia treatment overall goal dysphagia therapy maintain return patient oral feeding however must done ensuring adequate nutrition hydration safe swallow aspiration food oral feeding results increased mealtimes increased effort swallow resulting enough food ingested maintain weight supplementary nonoral feeding method nutrition may needed addition patient aspirates food liquid lungs despite use compensatory strategies therefore unsafe oral feeding nonoral feeding may needed nonoral feeding includes receiving nutrition method bypasses oropharyngeal swallowing mechanism including nasogastric tube gastrostomy people dysphagia especially nearing end life may choose continue eating drinking orally even deemed unsafe known risk cochrane review found certain evidence immediate longterm effects modifying thickness fluids swallowing difficulties people thickening fluids may immediate positive effect swallowing improving oral intake longterm impact health person dementia also compensatory treatment procedures designed change flow foodliquids eliminate symptoms directly change physiology therapeutic treatment procedures designed change andor improve physiology patients may need combination treatment procedures maintain safe nutritionally adequate swallow example postural strategies may combined swallowing maneuvers allow patient swallow safe efficient mannercitation needed common interventions used oropharyngeal dysphagia speech language pathologists rehabilitation swallow oral motor exercises texture modification foods thickening fluids positioning changes effectiveness modifying food fluid preventing aspiration pneumonia questioned associated poorer nutrition hydration quality also considerable variability national approaches describing different degrees thickened fluids food textures however international dysphagia diet standardisation initiative iddsi group produced agreed iddsi framework consisting continuum levels drinks measured levels foods measured levels likely initiative widespread support among dysphagia practitioners improve communication carers lead greater standardisation modified dietscitation needed swallowing disorders
