clubroot common disease cabbages broccoli cauliflower brussels sprouts radishes turnips stocks wallflowers plants family brassicaceae caused plasmodiophora considered slime mold put group first phytomyxean genome many thirteen races gall formation distortion takes place latent roots gives shape club spindle cabbage attacks roots cause undeveloped heads failure head followed often decline vigor death important disease affecting estimated total cultured area historical reports clubroot date back century europe late century severe epidemic clubroot destroyed large proportions cabbage crop st petersburg russian scientist mikhail woronin eventually identified cause clubroot plasmodiophorous organism gave name plasmodiophora brassicae early century britain clubroot sometimes called finger toe fingers toes anbury ambury last two also meaning soft tumor horse potential cultural practices reduce crop losses due clubroot limited chemical treatments control disease either banned due environmental regulations cost effective breeding resistant cultivars therefore promising cabbage clubroot disease brassicaceae mustard family cabbage family caused soilborne plasmodiophora disease first appears scattered fields successive seasons infect entire field reducing yield significantly sometimes resulting yield symptoms appear yellowing wilting stunting galls roots transmitted contaminated transplants animals surface water runoff contaminated equipment irrigation pathogen survive field years resting spores without host present infect next crop planted susceptible host pathogen prefers wet climate ph around proper irrigation addition compounds raise ph used control control methods include sanitation prevent transmission chemical control resistant varieties cabbage clubroot affects cabbage chinese cabbage brussels sprouts severely range hosts affects less severely like kohlrabi kale cauliflower collards broccoli rutabaga sea kale turnips developing plants may show symptoms plants get older start show symptoms chlorosis yellowing wilting hot days exhibit stunted growth ground roots experience cell proliferation due increased auxin growth hormone production plant well causes formation galls grow big enough restrict xylem tissue inhibiting efficient water uptake plant galls appear like clubs spindles roots eventually roots rot plant spring resting spores soil germinate produce zoospores zoospores swim moist soil enter host plants wounds root hairs plasmodium formed division many amoebalike cells plasmodium eventually divides forms secondary zoospores released soil secondary infection zoospores infect first host surrounding hosts secondary zoospores transmitted fields farm machinery water erosion form secondary plasmodium affects plant hormones cause swelling root cells cells eventually turn galls clubs secondary plasmodium forms overwintering resting spores get released soil clubs rot disintegrate resting spores live soil years wait root tip come close proximity clubroot disease prefers warmer temperatures moist conditions ideal conditions proliferation disease would soil temperature ph less therefore disease tends prominent lower fields water tends clubroot hard control primary step management longterm control exclusion disease good sanitation practice important regard use tools machinery order prevent introduction pathogen diseasefree field uncommon inattentive farmer gardener unknowingly carry pathogen previously exposed different time one avoid purchasing infected transplants cabbage prohibit infestation p brassicae soil type also important factor development spread cabbage clubroot use sand allow plants grow welldrained soil thereby eliminating possibility pathogen proliferate hospitable although difficult eradicate pathogen introduced field several methods control keeping soil slightly basic ph addition agricultural lime well integration crop rotation reduce occurrence cabbage clubroot already infected fields fumigation using metam sodium field containing diseased cabbages yet another way decrease buildup control management practices already infected fields help reduce overall impact p brassicae field cabbage cruciferous plants extremely difficult rid individual plant disease already infected clubroot reoccurring problem years easily spread plant plant p brassicae able infect species cruciferous plants making disease recurring problem even crop wide host range allows pathogen continue infection cycle absence cabbages additionally cabbage clubroot may stubborn disease due ability form microbial cyst overwintering cysts may last many years soil comes contact suitable host making difficult entirely avoid introduction disease growing cabbage need aware possibility plasmodiophora infestation simply growing particular fields may cabbage clubroot previously clubroot identified alberta canada outbreak canola crops central area province mainly isolated edmonton area clubroot soilborne disease caused biotrophic protist plasmodiophora brassicae infection causes formation large galls roots look like clubs formations impede nutrient water uptake cause plant death wiping important money generating canola crops initially commercial fields canola identified number grew alberta declared p brassicae pest via foundation legislation hopes help contain spread pathotype predominant source alberta outbreaks studies showed strains p brassicae virulent form dominant alberta studies shown infestation numbers highest common field entrances decline move field away entrance results concluded infested soil farm machinery increasing spread pathogen natural field field spread starting seen liming effective control measure curb clubroot since century method eradicate clubroot slow development creating unfavorable conditions addition calcium magnesium added nutrition profile soil help control clubroot get efficient results field soil ph must kept takes massive applications field soil order treat soil spores clubroot found combining lime one treatment shown several strains canola tried including european winter canola cv mendel brassica napus clubrootresistant crop found cultivators exist specific genotypes exist mendel strain could solution canola crops canadian crop rotation nonhost crops another method help prevent clubroot half life p brassicae years unfortunately long rotations approximately years required order effective difficult typical canola rotations three years canola crop brings high revenue farmers would also require complete removal cruciferae crops wild radish fungicide found help clubroot pricey would take huge amounts saturate soil best way prevent contamination fields clean agricultural equipment vehicles come contact club root moving new field contaminated soil equipment tools must moved clean diseasefree fields best preventative method field monitoring throughout season plants monitored early
