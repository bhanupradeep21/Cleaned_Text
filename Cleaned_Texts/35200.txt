smaller less elongated mesiodistally ardipithecus enamel thicker dentition differs species presence mesial groove upper canines canines apelike reduced like found miocene apes female chimpanzees orrorin small postcanines microdont like modern humans whereas australopithecines however researchers denied compelling evidence orrorin closely related modern humans australopithecines early members genus homo almost certainly direct ancestors modern humans also femur head spherical rotated anteriorly neck elongated oval section lesser trochanter protrudes medially suggest orrorin bipedal rest postcranium indicates climbed trees proximal phalanx curved distal pollical phalanx human proportions thus associated toolmaking probably associated grasping abilities useful treeclimbing fossils found held kipsaraman village community museum museum subsequently closed since according community museums kenya chairman eustace kitonga fossils stored secret bank vault recently impressions resembling humanlike footprints reported island crete greece trachilos footprints found fossilized beach sediments near west cretan village trachilos dated similar time period orrorin fossils million years however consensus impressions distinct enough confidently assign primate even vertebrate indeed footprints orrorin proves direct human ancestor according paleoanthropologists australopithecines australopithecus afarensis lucy may considered side branch hominid family tree orrorin earlier almost million years similar modern humans afarensis main similarity orrorin femur morphologically closer homo sapiens lucys however debate debate largely centered around fact lucy female orrorin femur compared belonged another point view cites comparisons orrorin miocene apes rather extant great apes shows instead femur shows intermediate australopiths said earlier fossils leaves many mammals found lukeino formation show orrorin lived dry evergreen forest environment savanna assumed many theories human fossils orrorin tugenensis share derived features hominoid greatape contrast orrorin shares several apomorphic features modern humans well australopithecines including presence obturator externus groove elongated femoral neck anteriorly twisted head posterior twist australopithecus anteroposteriorly compressed femoral neck asymmetric distribution cortex femoral neck shallow superior notch well developed gluteal tuberosity coalesces vertically crest descends femoral shaft however also share many properties several miocene ape species even showing transitional elements basal apes like aegyptopithecus according recent studies orrorin tugenensis basal hominid adapted early form based structure femoral head still exhibited arboreal properties likely forage build length femoral neck orrorin tugenensis fossils elongated similar shape length modern humans originally claimed femoral head larger comparison australopithicines much closer shape relative size homo claim challenged researchers noted femoral heads male australopithicines akin orrorin extension modern humans female australopithicines proponents notion orrorin closely related humans lucy addressed asserting male australopithicine femurs question fact belong different species tugenensis appears developed bipedalism million years tugenensis shares early hominin feature iliac blade flared help counter torque body weight shows adapted bipedalism around features shared many species suggested pickford many features orrorin shares modern humans show closely related homo sapiens would mean australopithecus would represent side branch homin evolution directly lead however femora morphology tugenensis shares many similarities australopithicine femora morphology weakens another study conducted almecija suggested orrorin closely related early hominins analysis bar femur showed orrorin intermediate pan australopithecus current prevailing theory orrorin tugenensis basal hominin bipedalism developed early hominin clade successfully evolved human evolutionary clear phylogeny orrorin uncertain however evidence evolution bipedalism invaluable discovery early fossil hominin
