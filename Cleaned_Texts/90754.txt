dravidosaurus controversial taxon late cretaceous reptiles variously interpreted either ornithischian possibly stegosaurian dinosaur plesiosaur genus contains single species blanfordi known mostly poorly preserved fossils coniacian late cretaceous southern india dravidosaurus originally described latesurviving stegosaur younger age known stegosaurs tens millions years classification questioned sankar chatterjee suggested fossils actually plesiosaurian chatterjee however formally reclassify fossil specimens examine since researchers variously followed chatterjees assessment maintained

material examined highly weathered pelvic hindlimb elements plesiosaur though presented concrete morphological chatterjee dhiraj kumar rudra also described fossil plesiosaur material site dravidosaurus fossils neither publication formally reidentified reclassified chaterjee dhiraj k rudra still formally classified dravidosaurus stegosauria nomen dubium though stated visit could see anything related stegosaurian plates skull claimed authors maintained bones seen might opinions dravidosaurus varied within palaeontological community following chatterjees reclassification dravidosaurus still considered stegosaur without comment carpenter currie loyal khosla sahni several recent works either supported chatterjees opinion fossils plesiosaurian verma verma et al rozadilla

identified ornithischian khosla lucas likewise referred dravidosaurus ornithischian dinosaur though noted taxonomic validity chatterjees suggestion dravidosaurus plesiosaur first explicitly questioned peredo superbiola et al study pointed skull armor plates figured original description specimens chatterjee admittedly examined certainly plesiosaurian also stated fossils need similar criticism offered galton upchurch also noted skull armor plate described could plesiosaur consequently maintained dravidosaurus fastovsky weishampel followed galton upchurchs opinion noting features skull well
