voodoo death term coined walter cannon also known psychogenic death psychosomatic death phenomenon sudden death brought strong emotional shock fear anomaly recognized psychosomatic death caused emotional suggested outside force voodoo death particularly noted native societies concentration prisoner war camps condition specific particular walter bradford cannon md looked forerunner modern physiological psychology published work wherein postulated idea fear could affect person point physical condition would deteriorate response psychological citing examples extraordinary deaths extraneous circumstances aboriginal societies cannon posited idea fear supernatural consequences broken societal taboos caused deaths witnessed natives cannon describes since termed bonepointing syndrome wherein individual receives sort breaking socialreligious interprets ill omen physical condition deteriorates rapid rate dies within period short hours initial cannon discusses example maori woman learned fruit eaten came tapu tabooed place less hours later dead conversely cannon also shares example young man fallen ill local witch doctor pointed bone societal taboo meant curse death however perpetrator explained young man whole thing mistake bone pointed young mans health returned cannon notes similarities case individuals members society beliefs supernatural fiercely upheld suffered believed form curse dictated within personal beliefs also individuals shared similar physical symptoms yet case young man cause psychological distress removed mysterious illness disappeared cannon attributes rather drastic physical repercussions workings fear upon mind leads destruction physical according cannon emotion fear working mind terms sympathetic sympathicoadrenal division nervous system causes fall blood pressure brought reduction volume circulating cannon explains loss blood volume constant injection adrenaline small arterioles constrict preventing proper flow blood within body causing drop blood pressure weak blood pressure prevents sufficient circulation blood damaging heart nerves responsible maintenance vessels transport blood thus making harder circulation continue since organs necessary maintain proper blood circulation deteriorating accelerated heart rate ensues followed rapid breathing added symptoms effects food drink person experiencing psychological distress cannon suggests true shock medical sense could cause death result little food drink states cannon combination lack food water anxiety rapid pulse respiration associated shocking experience persistent effects would fit well fatal conditions reported primitive since scientists discovered many processes involved effect stress upon body region brain called amygdala series events sensory stimulus introduced mind amygdala processes emotion fear follows called visiontofear pathway auditorytofear pathway depending stimulus generally recognized sequence events enumerated esther sternberg md stands follows various chemicals electrical impulses released transmitted nerve fibers simultaneously hormones excreted brain adrenal pituitary glands response stress system cardiac arrhythmias often result overabundance hormones wylie vale phd discovered corticotrophin brains hypothalamic stress hormone crh hormone secreted hypothalamus coordinates brain stem adrenaline centers involved initiation sympathetic response cause massive release adrenalinelike nerve chemicals stress hormones together might well cause illness including loss appetite weakness cardiac arrhythmias even vascular collapse could result martin samuels md elaborates still another process death stating release adrenaline increased heart rate sometimes catecholamines stress hormones build leading calcium channels opening remaining open resulting overflow calcium system killing cannon believed extreme emotional stress could explained terms degree sympatheticadrenal excitation however experiment performed curt richter responded cannons challenge animal model richter placed prestressed rats closed turbulent water latency drowning recorded domestic lab rats lasted hours unexpectedly wild rats died within minutes richter monitored heart rate determined whether heart systole diastole death found heart rate slowed prior death heart engaged blood reflecting state diastole contradicted cannons proposal sympathetic adrenal overactivation result death since sympathetic overarousal would increase heart rate blood pressure severe degrees richter interpreted rats died result overstimulation parasympathetic nervous system specifically vagus nerve regulates heartbeat lethal vagal effect psychological state sudden prolonged immobility faked death adaptive response exhibited many mammalian species demonstrated several rodent species threatened exhibited immobility accompanied low heart rate rodents heart rate reached baseline hofer distinguished prolonged immobility faked death phenomenon unlike behavior hopelessness described richter deathfaking occurred sudden motor collapse active struggling hofer interpreted fearinducing slowing heart rate vagal data suggest vagus contributes severe emotional states may related emotional states immobilization extreme terror unfortunately immobilization technique potentially lifethreatening mammals reptiles mammals would undergo states bradycardia hypoxia overactivation parasympathetic vagus system organs oxygenhungry mammal deprived oxygen due lack blood flow animal dies despite cannons general ignorance particulars physiological breakdown scientists intervening years since publication cannons work generally agreed fundamental hypotheses concerning voodoo death criticisms generally come cannons work directed hearsay nature cannons case studies recent studies discovered numerous examples voodoo death various allege difficulty experimental process validating cannons theory barbara w lex article titled voodoo death new thoughts old explanation states voodoo death easily observed without complicated experiments pupillary constriction easily observable indicative parasympathetic activation amount saliva perspiration degree muscle tonicity skin pallor individual also discernible without complicated however contest theories involving psychologicallyinduced body failure david lester phd contends cannons evidence particularly evidence concerning animals anecdotal irrelevant instead sets forth concept death suggestion supports giving upgiven complex set forth george l engel thus attributing cause death entirely psychological state individual question rather connection adduced going even harry eastwell md article voodoo death mechanism dispatch dying east arnhem australia rejects entirely concept voodoo death stating deaths cases reported cannon et al likely due dehydration rather psychological deeply related cases sudden death cannon termed fightorflight response classified neurophysiologicalbehavioral response pattern fight flight phrase used describe instinctual physiological responses strong emotion within animals well humans cannon associates two emotions rage fear similar effects emotions upon mind encourage response fight fear encourage flight mind faced one emotions response perceived threat emit adrenaline heart rate increase however sometimes system overwhelmed responses collapse ensues brought workings stress case voodoo death flight response overpowers system little possibility action mind individual suffering perceived state aboriginal tribes victims believe suffering curse condemned die believe unable act save cannons theory concerning voodoo death opened research various fields psychological studies since publication cannons work scientists discovered many disorders like related psychosomatic responses situations cannons postulation mind could bring death scientists become open idea mind working body greater number ways leading development psychosomatic advent theories concerning voodoo death within scientific field also led development branch psychology termed though cases within aboriginal societies commonly cited researchers cannon set forth examples similar cases psychosomatic death also reported cultures article james l mathis md describes case previously healthy man died asthmatic attacks mother cursed going wishes mathis proposes fatal psychosomatic conditions cause mans death thus form voodoo another k meador discussed case man diagnosed cancer along physicians family believed dying cancer autopsy
