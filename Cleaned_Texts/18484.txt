syndrome thalamic pain syndrome condition developed thalamic stroke stroke causing damage ischemic strokes hemorrhagic strokes cause lesioning thalamuscitation needed initial stroke symptoms numbness tingling dissipate imbalance sensation causes later syndromes characterizing syndrome although treatments exist often expensive chemically based invasive treat patients time need treatment called refractory syndrome commonly preceded numbness affected side cases numbness replaced burning tingling sensations widely varying degree severity across majority reported cases symptoms severe debilitatingmedical citation needed burning tingling also accompanied hypersensitivity usually form dysaesthesia allodynia less commonly patients develop severe ongoing pain little allodynia pain stimulus would normally cause example patient experiences unrelenting pain breeze touches skin patients experiencing allodynia experience pain touch pressure however hypersensitive temperaturemedical citation needed dysaesthesia defined unpleasant abnormal sense touch often presents condition due thalamic lesioning form neuropathic pain combination itching tingling burning searing experienced spontaneously allodynia dysaesthesia replace numbness one week months thalamic stroke general development pain stopped type severity pain unchanging untreated persist throughout life consequentially many undergo form pain treatment adjust new lives best canmedical citation needed pain associated syndrome sometimes coupled anosognosia somatoparaphrenia causes patient undergone rightparietal rightsided stroke deny paralysis left side indeed deny paralyzed limbs belong although debatable symptoms rare considered part thalamic phenomenon normally considered characteristic syndromemedical citation needed although many contributing factors risks associated strokes associated syndrome thalamic lesions specifically general strokes damage one hemisphere brain include thalamus thalamus generally believed relay sensory information variety subcortical areas cerebral known sensory information environmental stimuli travels thalamus processing somatosensory cortex interpretation final product communication ability see hear feel something interpreted brain syndrome often compromises tactile sensation therefore damage thalamus causes miscommunication afferent pathway cortex brain changing one change could incorrect sensation experienced inappropriate amplification dulling sensation brain considered plastic individuals brain different almost impossible know sensation changed without brain mapping individual consultationcitation needed recently magnetic resonance imaging utilized correlate lesion size location area affected severity condition although preliminary findings

antidepressants newer pharmaceuticals include anticonvulsants kampo medicine scientific basis analgesic efficacy kampo medicine beyond placebo mainstream methods preferred pain treatments commonly administered via oral medication periodic injections topical addition physical therapy traditionally used alongside medication regimen recently electrical stimulation brain spinal cord caloric stimulation explored treatmentscitation needed common treatment plans involve schedule physical therapy medication regimen pain mostly unchanging development many patients test different medications eventually choose regimen best adapts lifestyle common orally intravenously administeredmedical citation needed expensive invasive treatments guaranteed work meeting needs patients need new less
