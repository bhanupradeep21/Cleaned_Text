therefore contraindicated pregnant substance also contraindicated pulmonary hypertension combination idiopathic interstitial pneumonia phiip clinical trial testing riociguat purpose prematurely terminated increased severe adverse effects mortality patients pulmonary hypertension caused idiopathic interstitial pneumonia compared serious adverse effects clinical trials included bleeding hypotension low blood pressure headache gastrointestinal disorders also nitrates phosphodiesterase inhibitors including inhibitors increase hypotensive blood pressure lowering effect riociguat combining drugs therefore contraindicated riociguat levels blood reduced tobacco smoking strong inducers liver enzyme increased strong cytochrome healthy individuals nitric oxide acts signalling molecule vascular smooth muscle cells induce vasodilation binds soluble guanylate cyclase sgc mediates synthesis secondary messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate cgmp sgc forms heterodimers

plasma concentration reached mean elimination halflife appears riociguat plasma concentrations also shown quite variable patients indicating clinical use probably necessary titrate drug specifically individual first nitric oxide independent haemdependent sgc stimulator synthetic benzylindazole derivative described characterisation years later demonstrated well increasing sgc activity acted synergy stimulate sgc however relatively weak vasodilator side effectsvague therefore search began novel indazole compounds potent specific sgc stimulators result identification bay bay compounds
