bone fracture abbreviated frx fx fx medical condition partial complete break continuity bone body severe cases bone may broken several fragments known comminuted bone fracture may result high force impact stress minimal trauma injury result certain medical conditions weaken bones osteoporosis osteopenia bone cancer osteogenesis imperfecta fracture properly termed pathologic although bone tissue contains pain receptors bone fracture painful several damage adjacent structures nerves muscles blood vessels spinal cord nerve roots spine fractures cranial contents skull fractures may cause specific signs fractures may lead serious complications including condition known compartment syndrome treated eventually compartment syndrome may require amputation affected limb complications may include nonunion fractured bone fails heal malunion fractured bone heals deformed manner one form malunion malrotation bone especially common femoral tibial complications fractures may classified three broad groups depending upon time occurrence follows natural process healing fracture starts injured bone surrounding tissues bleed forming fracture hematoma blood coagulates form blood clot situated broken within days blood vessels grow jellylike matrix blood clot new blood vessels bring phagocytes area gradually removes nonviable material blood vessels also bring fibroblasts walls vessels multiply produce collagen fibres way blood clot replaced matrix collagen collagens rubbery consistency allows bone fragments move small amount unless severe persistent force appliedcitation needed stage fibroblasts begin lay bone matrix form collagen monomers monomers spontaneously assemble form bone matrix bone crystals calcium hydroxyapatite deposited amongst form insoluble crystals mineralization collagen matrix stiffens transforms bone fact bone mineralized collagen matrix mineral dissolved bone becomes rubbery healing bone callus average sufficiently mineralized show xray within weeks adults less children initial woven bone strong mechanical properties mature bone process remodelling woven bone replaced mature lamellar bone whole process may take months adults strength healing bone usually normal months injurycitation needed several factors may help hinder bone healing process example tobacco smoking hinders process bone adequate nutrition including calcium intake help bone healing process weightbearing stress bone bone healed sufficiently bear weight also builds bone strength although theoretical concerns nsaids slowing rate healing enough evidence warrant withholding use type analgesic simple smokers generally lower bone density nonsmokers much higher risk fractures also evidence smoking delays bone bone fracture may diagnosed based history given physical examination performed radiographic imaging often performed confirm diagnosis certain circumstances radiographic examination nearby joints indicated order exclude dislocations fracturedislocations situations projectional radiography alone insufficient computed tomography ct magnetic resonance imaging mri may indicatedcitation needed orthopedic medicine fractures classified various ways historically named physician first described fracture conditions however systematic classifications wellcitation needed may divided stable versus unstable depending likelihood may shift furthercitation needed anatomical classification may begin specifying involved body part head arm followed specific localization fractures additional definition criteria merely localization often may classified subtypes fractures holsteinlewis fracture subtype humerus fracture typical examples orthopaedic classification given previous section classified appropriately specific part anatomical classification however may apply multiple anatomical fracture sites orthopaedic trauma association committee coding classification published classification system adopting similar system ao foundation extended unifying two systems regarding wrist hand foot ankle fractures number classifications named person eponymous developed high lowforce trauma cause bone fracture preventive efforts reduce motor

fractures types fracture older adults however vitamin supplementation alone reduce risk treatment bone fractures broadly classified surgical conservative latter basically referring nonsurgical procedure pain management immobilization nonsurgical stabilization similar classification open versus closed treatment open treatment refers treatment fracture site opened surgically regardless whether fracture open closed arm fractures children ibuprofen found effective combination paracetamol ems setting might applicable administer iv ketamine achieve dissociated state since bone healing natural process occur often fracture treatment aims ensure best possible function injured part healing bone fractures typically treated restoring fractured pieces bone natural positions necessary maintaining positions bone heals often aligning bone called reduction good position verifying improved alignment xray needed process extremely painful without anaesthesia painful breaking bone end fractured limb usually immobilized plaster fibreglass cast splint holds bones position immobilizes joints fracture initial postfracture oedema swelling goes fracture may placed removable brace orthosis treated surgery surgical nails screws plates wires used hold fractured bone together directly alternatively fractured bones may treated ilizarov method form external fixator occasionally smaller bones phalanges toes fingers may treated without cast buddy wrapping serves similar function making cast device called suzuki frame may used cases deep complex intraarticular digit allowing limited movement immobilization helps preserve anatomical alignment enabling callus formation toward target achieving union splinting results outcome casting children distal radius fracture little surgical methods treating fractures risks benefits usually surgery performed conservative treatment failed likely fail likely result poor functional fractures hip fractures usually caused osteoporosis surgery offered routinely nonoperative treatment results prolonged immobilisation commonly results complications including chest infections pressure sores deconditioning deep vein thrombosis dvt pulmonary embolism dangerous joint surface damaged fracture surgery also commonly recommended make accurate anatomical reduction restore smoothness joint infection especially dangerous bones due recrudescent nature bone infections bone tissue predominantly extracellular matrix rather living cells blood vessels needed support low metabolism able bring limited number immune cells injury fight infection reason open fractures osteotomies call careful antiseptic procedures prophylactic use antibiotics occasionally bone grafting used treat sometimes bones reinforced implants must designed installed care stress shielding occurs plates screws carry large portion bones load causing atrophy problem reduced eliminated use lowmodulus materials including titanium alloys heat generated friction installing hardware accumulate easily damage bone tissue reducing strength connections dissimilar metals installed contact one another ie titanium plate cobaltchromium alloy stainless steel screws galvanic corrosion result metal ions produced damage bone locally may cause systemic effects well bone stimulation either electromagnetic ultrasound waves may suggested alternative surgery reduce healing time nonunion proposed mechanism action stimulating osteoblasts proteins form bones using modalities evidence supporting use ultrasound shockwave therapy improving unions likely approaches make clinically significant difference delayed union physical therapy exercises either homebased physiotherapistled improve functional mobility strength gait training hip fractures physical exercise also often suggested help recover physical capacities fracture children whose bones still developing risks either growth plate injury greenstick fracture httpsenwikipediaorgwikibonefracture
