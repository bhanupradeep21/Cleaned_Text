megawhaitsia extinct genus large therocephalian therapsids lived late permian wuchiapingian eastern europe known species patrichae described several fossils discovered various oblasts european russia fossils representative large animal whose skull size estimated cm long notable feature megawhaitsia maxilla canals directly connected tooth root canines based characteristics present related genus euchambersia russian paleontologist mikhail ivakhnenko raises possibility animal may venom gland true would one oldest tetrapods known attribute subsequent studies challenged proposition imposing size megawhaitsia position apex predator could linked disappearance absence large gorgonopsians end late permian certain regions presentday european russia megawhaitsia could thus occupied ecological niches previously occupied gorgonopsians holotype specimen megawhaitsia discovered excavations carried locality located vladimir oblast european russia cataloged pin site dated wuchiapingian stage late originally incorrectly recorded jawbone gorgonopsian similar inostrancevia given low presence gorgonopsians late permian russia fossil reassigned large therocephalian work published without however receiving binomial mikhail feodosievich ivakhnenko attributed two additional fossil remains still unnamed taxon first partial maxillary bone cataloged pin discovered locality purly nizhny novgorod oblast second right part incomplete mandible cataloged pin discovered locality shabarshata kirov ivakhnenko published formal description new taxa based specimens pin pin describing first late permian whaitsiid eastern subsequently scope whaitsiids expanded include discoveries made earlier permian deposits russian regions including moschowhaitsia viatkosuchus described genus name megawhaitsia comes ancient greek μέγας megas great combined name another therocephalian genus whaitsia name witch today synonymous theriognathus specific epithet patrichae honors australian paleontologist patricia known fossils megawhaitsia incomplete thus preventing complete reconstruction animals anatomy however structure two known maxillary bones proves animals maxillary bone massive largest preserved fragment measuring cm length based proportions fuller skulls smaller south african representatives group total length animals skull estimated cm would make megawhaitsia largest therocephalian known date lower edge maxilla large space accommodate lower canine behind sockets three large upper canines two anterior somewhat larger roots teeth deep three deep alveolar partial mandible attributed megawhaitsia socket large canine lacks cheek feature maxillary bone three channels start region lacrimonasal duct pass along roots teeth open near sockets canines analogy hypotheses venomousness another genus therocephalians euchambersia ivakhnenko interprets canals possible proof presence poisonous glands megawhaitsia would used slaughter large however since venomousness euchambersia questioned study published particular basis comparison various modern venomous animals authors study suggest explanations presence maxillary canals might second half century fossil maxillary bones megawhaitsia considered belong gorgonopsid similar identical genus inostrancevia fossils reassigned undetermined therocephalian family moschorhinidae family article ivakhnenko megawhaitsia included family whaitsiidae within superfamily whaitsioidea time whaitsioidea taxon included euchambersiidae whaitsiidae sistergroups due similar study published less year later adam huttenlocker estimated families euchambersiidae moschorhinidae annatherapsididae represented junior synonyms akidnognathidae considered sistergroup huttenlocker christian sidor concluded akidnognathidae fact close chthonosauridae two forming sistergroup clade containing whaitsioidea superfamily whaitsioidea remains recognized valid taxa although contains whaitsiids related comparison south african therocephalians megawhaitsia noticeably larger size corresponding specialized carnivorous predator niche fed fairly large prey notably dicynodonts numerous russian regions europe upper permian possible presence venom glands megawhaitsia would consistent warmblooded dicynodont hypothesis venom offers significant advantage especially hunting active warmblooded one types large coprolites found vyazniki locality associated megawhaitsia closely related whaitsiids moschowhaitsia reveals high content bony material including bones bearing traces rich network blood vessels probably belonging dicynodonts indicating predator occupied top position trophic chain additionally remains fish scales material interpreted ganoine found morphotype coprolites well furlike structures interpreted oldest fossil coat remains known date although remains unclear whether belong prey swallowed predator result locality holotype megawhaitsia discovered contains numerous fossils tetrapods dating wuchiapingian including temnospondyl dvinosaurus well nonamniote reptiliomorphs including seymouriamorph karpinskiosaurus numerous chroniosuchians sauropsids present include pareiasaurs obirkovia archosauriforms family proterosuchidae archosaurus latter would also one main predators area therapsids present locality indeterminate dicynodont even therocephalians including annatherapsidus malasaurus researchers speculate due increased size east european whaitsiids occupied ecological niche large gorgonopsians time disappeared eastern europe possibly due climate
