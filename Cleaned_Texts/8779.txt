defensins small cysteinerich cationic proteins across cellular life including animals host defense peptides members displaying either direct antimicrobial activity immune signaling activities variously active bacteria fungi many enveloped nonenveloped viruses typically amino acids length three four highly conserved disulphide bonds animals produced cells innate immune system epithelial cells whereas plants fungi produced wide variety tissues organism usually produces many different defensins stored inside cells eg neutrophil granulocytes kill phagocytosed bacteria others secreted extracellular medium directly kill microbes mechanism action varies disruption microbial cell membrane metabolic disruption name defensin coined though proteins called cationic antimicrobial proteins neutrophil peptides gamma thionins amongst proteins called defensins evolutionarily related one instead fall two broad superfamilies contains multiple one superfamily transdefensins contains defensins
