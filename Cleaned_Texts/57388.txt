geophagia ˌdʒiːəˈfeɪdʒiə also known geophagy practice eating earth soillike substances clay chalk termite mounds behavioural adaptation occurs many nonhuman animals documented primate geophagy nonhuman primates primarily used protection parasites provide mineral supplements help metabolize toxic compounds geophagy also occurs humans commonly reported among children pregnant human geophagia form pica craving purposive consumption nonfood items classified eating disorder diagnostic statistical manual mental disorders dsm socially culturally sometimes geophagy consequence carrying hookworm infection although etiology remains unknown geophagy many potential adaptive health benefits well negative geophagia widespread animal kingdom galen greek philosopher physician first record use clay sick injured animals second century ad type geophagia documented many species mammals birds reptiles butterflies isopods especially among many species south american parrots observed clay licks sulphurcrested cockatoos observed ingesting clays papua new guinea analysis soils consumed wild birds show often prefer soils high clay content usually smectite clay families well preference certain types clay soil lead unusual feeding behaviour example peruvian amazon rainforest parrots congregate one particular bend manu river one specific layer soil runs hundreds metres horizontally along bend parrots avoid eating substrate layers one metre preferred layer parrots regularly eat seeds unripe fruits containing alkaloids toxins render seeds fruits bitter even lethal many chemicals become positively charged acidic stomach bind clay minerals negatively charged cationexchange sites thereby rendered safe preferred soils much higher cationexchange capacity adjacent rejected layers soils rich minerals smectite kaolin mica preferred soils surpass pure mineral kaolinate surpass approach pure bentonite capacity bind quinine tannic vitro vivo tests soils many others southeastern peru indicate also release nutritionally important quantities minerals calcium sodium manu river example cited preferred soil bands much higher levels sodium chosen repeated studies shown soils consumed commonly parrots south america higher sodium contents unclear factor driving avian however evidence mounting sodium important driver among parrots southeastern peru parrots known eat toxic foods globally geophagy concentrated specific researchers lee et al show parrot geophagy south america positively correlated significant degree distance ocean suggests overall lack sodium ecosystem variation food toxicity better predictor spatial distribution geophagy work coupled recent findings consistently high sodium levels consumed make highly likely sodium primary driver avian geophagy among parrots possibly taxa western amazon basin supplemental nutrients hypothesis supported peak geophagy occurring parrots breeding several hypotheses importance geophagia bats chimpanzees kibale national park uganda observed consume soil rich kaolinite clay shortly consuming plants including trichilia rubescens possesses antimalarial properties geophagy behavioural adaptation seen species nonhuman primates suborder haplorrhini strepsirrhini commonly ingested soils soils mounds soils tree bases soils termite mounds pong soils forest studies shown many benefits geophagy protection parasites minerals supplements helps metabolize toxic compounds leaves soil analysis seen one main compounds earth consumed primates clay minerals contains kaolinite commonly used medications diarrheal intestinal geophagic behaviour plays important role nonhuman primates kind zoopharmacognosy use differs one species another example mountain gorillas rwanda tend ingest clay soil dry season vegetation changes forcing feed plants toxic compounds case ingested clay absorbs toxins providing digestive kind seasonal behavioural adaptation also seen redhanded howler monkeys western brazilian amazonia also adapt shift feeding leaves contains toxic cases geophagy used ringtailed lemurs preventive therapeutic behaviour parasites control intestinal benefits clay ingestion also observed among rhesus study carried island cayo santiago observed rhesus macaques intestinal parasites health affected didnt many gastrointestinal effects data observed shows caused consumption clay soil hand observations shown behavioural geophagy provides minerals supplements seen among cambodians study done salt licks veun saisiem pang conservation area site visited various species nonhuman indepth research needs carried order better understand behavioural adaptation geaophagy among nonhuman primates debate whether geophagia bats primarily nutritional supplementation detoxification known species bats regularly visit mineral salt licks increase mineral consumption however voigt et al demonstrated mineraldeficient healthy bats visit salt licks therefore mineral supplementation unlikely primary reason geophagia bats additionally bat presence salt licks increases periods high energy voigt et al concluded primary purpose bat presence salt licks detoxification purposes compensating increased consumption toxic fruit evidence likely origin geophagy found remains early humans africa oldest evidence geophagy practised humans comes prehistoric site kalambo falls border zambia tanzania rootbernstein rootbernstein calciumrich white clay found alongside bones homo habilis immediate predecessor homo sapiens geophagia nearly universal around world tribal traditional rural societies although apparently documented japan ancient world several writers noted phenomenon geophagia pliny said noted ingestion soil lemnos island greece use soils island noted textbook hippocrates bce mentions geophagia famous medical textbook titled de medicina edited cornelius celsus ce seems link anaemia one rumis fables tells geophage cheated sugar seller leaves alone weight made clay waits man eats enough thus reducing amount sugar existence geophagy among native americans noted early explorers americas including gabriel soares de sousa reported tribe brazil using alexander von humboldt said tribe called otomacs ate large amounts africa david livingstone wrote slaves eating soil also thought large numbers slaves brought soileating practices trafficked new world part transatlantic slave slaves practised geophagia nicknamed clayeaters known consume clay well spices ash chalk grass plaster paint africa kaolinite sometimes known kalaba calaba calabachop equatorial guinea eaten pleasure suppress kaolin human consumption sold markets cameroon often flavoured spices black pepper consumption greatest among women especially cure nausea pregnancy spite possible dangerous levels arsenic lead unborn another example geophagia reported mangaung free state province south africa practice geochemically calabash chalk also eaten west haiti poor people known eat bonbon tè made soil salt vegetable shortening biscuits hold minimal nutritional value manage keep poor however longterm consumption biscuits reported cause stomach pains malnutrition recommended central java east java indonesia food made soil called ampo eaten snack light consists pure clay without mixture bentonite clay available worldwide digestive aid kaolin also widely used digestive aid base medicines attapulgite another type clay active ingredient many antidiarrheal clay minerals reported beneficial microbiological effects protecting stomach toxins parasites humans able synthesize vitamin cobalamin geophagia may behavioral adaption obtain bacteria mineral content soils may vary region many contain high levels calcium copper magnesium iron zinc minerals critical developing fetuses cause metallic soil chewing ice cravings pregnant women extent cravings subsequent mineral consumption well case cravings ice cold neck vasoconstricting food aid increasing brain oxygen levels restricting neck veins therapeutically effective decreasing infant mortality genetic predispositions associated environmental triggers likely found infant well likewise multigenerationally impoverished villages homogenous socioeconomic closed genetic communities likely rewarded gene expression soil clay consumption cravings increasing likelihood survival multiple pregnancies obvious health risks consumption soil contaminated animal human feces particular helminth eggs ascaris stay viable soil years lead helminth tetanus poses lead poisoning also associated soil well health risks associated zinc exposure
