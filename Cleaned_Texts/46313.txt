computeraided auscultation caa computerized assisted auscultation digital form auscultation includes recording visualization storage analysis sharing digital recordings heart lung sounds recordings obtained using electronic stethoscope similarly suitable recording device computeraided auscultation designed assist health care professionals perform auscultation part diagnostic process commercial caa products usually classified clinical decision support systems support medical professionals making diagnosis medical devices require certification approval competent authority eg fda approval ce conformity issued notified body compared traditional auscultation computeraided auscultation caa offers range improvements beneficial multiple stakeholders caa system sounds recorded electronic stethoscope audio data transferred electronic device via bluetooth audio cable connection special software device visualizes stores analyzes data sophisticated caa systems caa analysis yields results used objectify diagnoses decision support systemcitation needed components caa system depend complexity whereas simpler systems provide visualization storage options systems combine visualization storage analysis ability electronically manage said data electronic stethoscopes also digital stethoscopes convert acoustic sound waves digital electrical signals signals amplified means transducers currently reach levels times higher traditional acoustic stethoscopes additionally electronic stethoscopes used filter background noise feature safetyrelevant facilitate accurate diagnoses whereas sound amplification filtering main functions electronic stethoscope ability access sounds external means via bluetooth audio cables makes ideal soundcapturing device caa systemscitation needed devices used connect electronic stethoscope record audio signal eg heart lung sounds include pc laptop mobile devices like smartphones tablets generally caa systems include software visualize incoming audio signal sophisticated caa systems include live noise detection algorithms designed help user achieve best possible recording quality key feature caa systems automated analysis recorded audio signals signal processing algorithms algorithms run directly device used making recording hosted cloud connected device degree autonomy currently available analysis algorithms varies greatly systems operate fully early pcbased systems required significant user interaction interpretation analysis systems require degree assistance user like manual confirmationcorrection estimated heart recorded sounds associated analytical patient data electronically stored managed archived patient identifying information might handled stored process stored data classifies phi protected health information system hosting data must compliant countryspecific data protection laws like hipaa us data protection directive eu storage options current caa systems range basic ability retrieve downloadable pdf report comprehensive cloudbased interface electronic management auscultationbased datacitation needed user review patient records including replaying audio files via user interface eg via webportal browser standalone software electronic device functionalities include sharing records users exporting patient records integration ehr systems computeraided auscultation aimed detecting characterizing heart murmurs called computeraided heart auscultation also known automatic heart sound analysis auscultation heart using stethoscope standard examination method worldwide screen heart defects identifying murmurs requires examining physician acute hearing extensive experience accurate diagnosis remains challenging various reasons including noise high heart rates ability distinguish innocent pathological murmurs properly performed auscultatory examination heart commonly regarded inexpensive widely available tool detection management heart auscultation skills physicians however reported leads missed disease diagnoses andor excessive costs unnecessary expensive diagnostic testing study suggests one third previously undiagnosed congenital heart defects newborns missed referrals medical specialists costly echocardiography due misdiagnosis innocent caa heart thus potential become costeffective screening diagnostic tool provided underlying algorithms clinical tested stringent blinded fashions ability detect difference normal abnormal heart sounds heart murmurs cardiac murmurs audible noises stethoscope generated turbulent flow blood heart murmurs need distinguished heart sounds primarily generated beating heart heart valves snapping open shut generally heart murmurs classified innocent also called physiological functional pathological abnormal innocent murmurs usually harmless often caused physiological conditions outside heart result certain benign structural defects pathological murmurs often associated heart valve problems may also caused wide array structural heart defects various characteristics constitute qualitative description heart murmurs including timing systolic murmur diastolic murmur shape location radiation intensity pitch quality caa systems typically categorize heart sounds murmurs class class iii according american heart sophisticated caa systems provide additional descriptive murmur information like murmur timing grading ability identify positions heart sounds detection heart murmurs caa systems based analysis digitally recorded heart sounds approaches use following four stages common types performance measures caa systems based two approaches retrospective nonblinded studies using existing data prospective blinded clinical studies new patients retrospective caa studies classifier trained machine learning algorithms using existing data performance classifier assessed using data different approaches used eg kfold crossvalidation leaveoneout crossvalidation main shortcoming judging quality sensitivity specificity caa system based retrospective performance data alone comes risk approaches used overestimate true performance given system using data training validation lead significant overfitting validation set classifiers designed analyse known data well might general enough correctly classify unknown data ie results look much better would tested new unseen patients true performance selected network caa system confirmed measuring performance third independent set data called test set summary reliability retrospective nonblinded studies usually considered much lower prospective clinical studies prone selection bias retrospective bias published examples include pretorius et prospective clinical studies hand better suited assess true performance caa system provided study blinded well controlled prospective clinical study evaluate performance caa system output caa system compared gold standard diagnoses case heart murmurs suitable gold standard diagnosis would auscultationbased expert
