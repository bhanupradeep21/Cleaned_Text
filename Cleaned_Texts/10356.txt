ulna ulnal bone pl ulnae long bone found forearm stretches elbow wrist anatomical position found medial side forearm ulna side forearm little finger runs parallel radius long bone forearm ulna longer radius shorter radius thicker ulna thinner therefore ulna considered smaller bone two bones lower arm corresponding bone lower leg fibula ulna long bone found forearm stretches elbow wrist anatomical position found medial side forearm broader close elbow narrows approaches wrist close elbow ulna bony process olecranon process hooklike structure fits olecranon fossa humerus prevents hyperextension forms hinge joint trochlea humerus also radial notch head radius ulnar tuberosity muscles attach close wrist ulna styloid process near elbow ulna two curved processes olecranon coronoid process two

radial notch medial surface prominent free margin serves attachment part ulnar collateral ligament front part surface small rounded eminence origin one head flexor digitorum superficialis behind

ulna forms part wrist joint elbow joints specifically ulna joins articulates specific types ulna fracture include conservative management possible ulnar fractures located distal twothirds involve shaft shortening less angulation less cases cast applied goes fourlegged animals radius main loadbearing bone lower forelimb ulna important primarily muscular attachment many mammals ulna partially wholly fused radius may therefore exist separate bone however even extreme cases fusion horses olecranon process still present albeit projection upper birds dinosaurs ulna forms surface attachment secondary feathers often leave osteological evidence form quill knobs allowing identification feathers fossils otherwise lack integumentary position ulna red animation image bones right arm showing
