duve born estate agent alphonse de duve wife madeleine pungs village thames ditton near london parents fled belgium outbreak first world war war age three family returned belgium precocious boy always best student primus perpetuus recalled school except one year pronounced competition give chance educated jesuits onzelievevrouwinstituut antwerp studying catholic university leuven wanted specialize endocrinology joined laboratory belgian physiologist joseph p bouckaert whose primary interest one last year medical school germans invaded belgium drafted belgian army posted southern france medical officer almost immediately taken prisoner war germans ability speak fluent german flemish helped outwit captors escaped back belgium adventure later described comical immediately continued medical course obtained md leuven graduation de duve continued primary research insulin role glucose metabolism earl sutherland made initial discovery commercial preparation insulin contaminated another pancreatic hormone insulin antagonist however laboratory supplies leuven shortage therefore enrolled programme earn degree chemistry cancer institute research insulin summed book titled glucose insuline et diabète glucose insulin diabetes published simultaneously brussels paris book condensed technical dissertation earned advanced degree university level agrégation de lenseignement supérieur equivalent doctorate called sort glorified phd thesis followed number scientific subsequently obtained msc chemistry worked purification enhance skill biochemistry trained laboratory hugo theorell later nobel prize physiology medicine nobel medical institute stockholm months received financial assistance rockefeller foundation fellow worked six months carl gerti cori washington university st louis husband wife joint winners nobel prize physiology medicine march de duve joined faculty medical school catholic university leuven teaching physiological chemistry became full professor detlev bronk president rockfeller institute rockefeller university new york city met brussels offered professorship laboratory rector leuven afraid entirely losing de duve made compromise dinner de duve would still parttime appointment relief teaching conducting examinations rector bronk made agreement would initially last five years official implementation de duve simultaneously headed research laboratories leuven rockefeller university dividing time new york catholic university leuven contentiously split two separate universities along linguistic lines de duve chose join frenchspeaking side université catholique de louvain took emeritus status university louvain rockefeller though continued conduct research among subjects studied distribution enzymes rat liver cells using ratezonal centrifugation work cell fractionation provided insight function cell structures specialized subcellular biochemistry cell biology discovered new cell hormone glucagon discovered cp kimball john r murlin hyperglycaemic bloodsugar elevating substance among pancreatic biological importance glucagon known name essentially forgotten still mystery time de duve joined bouckaert leuven university work insulin since insulin first commercial hormonal drug originally produced eli lilly company extraction methods introduced impurity caused mild hyperglycaemia opposite expected desired may de duve realised crystallisation could remove impurity demonstrated lillys insulin process contaminated showing injected rats lilly insulin caused initial hyperglycaemia danish novo insulin following research published lilly upgraded methods eliminate de duve joined carl cori gerty cori washington university st louis worked fellow researcher earl wilbur sutherland jr later nobel prize physiology medicine sutherland working puzzle insulinimpurity substance named hyperglycemicglycogenolytic hg factor de duve soon discovered hg factor synthesised pancreas also gastric mucosa certain parts digestive tract found hormone produced pancreatic islets cells differing insulinproducing beta cells presumably alpha cells de duve realised sutherlands hg factor fact glucagon rediscovery led permanent name de duve reintroduced pairs work showed glucagon major hormone influencing breakdown glycogen process known sugars produced released de duves original hypothesis glucagon produced pancreatic alpha cells proven correct demonstrated selectively cobaltdamaged alpha cells stopped producing glucagon guinea finally isolated purified hormone including de duve first hypothesise production insulin decreased blood sugar levels stimulated uptake glucose liver also proposed mechanism inplace balance productions insulin glucagon order maintain normal blood sugar level see homeostasis idea much disputed time rediscovery glucagon confirmed theses experimentally demonstrated glucagon influence production thus uptake christian de duve team continued studying insulin mechanismofaction liver cells focusing enzyme glucose key enzyme sugar metabolism glycolysis target insulin found principal enzyme regulating blood sugar could even repeated experiments purify isolate enzyme cellular extracts tried laborious procedure cell fractionation detect enzyme moment serendipitous discovery estimate exact enzyme activity team adopted procedure using standardised enzyme acid phosphatase finding activity unexpectedly low ie expected value one day measured enzyme activity purified cell fractions stored five days surprise enzyme activity increased back fresh sample similar results replicated every time procedure repeated led hypothesis sort barrier restricted rapid access enzyme substrate enzymes able diffuse period time described barrier saclike structure surrounded membrane containing acid unrelated enzyme cell fractionation procedure come membranous fractions known cell organelles de duve named lysosomes reflect digestive year alex b novikoff university vermont visited de duves laboratory using electron microscopy successfully produced first visual evidence lysosome organelle using staining method acid phosphatase de duve novikoff confirmed location hydrolytic enzymes acid hydrolases serendipity followed de duve another major discovery confirmation lysosome de duves team troubled presence rat liver cell fraction enzyme urate oxidase de duve thought lysosome acid hydrolase typical lysosomal enzymes still similar distribution enzyme acid phosphatase found enzymes catalase damino acid oxidase similarly distributed cell thought mitochondrial w bernhard c rouillier described extramitochondrial organelles microbodies believed precursors de duve noted three enzymes exhibited similar chemical properties similar peroxideproducing de duve skeptical referring newfound enzymes microbodies noted little known enzyme complement role physiology liver cells substantiate proposal present suggested enzymes belonged cell organelle one different previously known strong evidences still lacking publish hypothesis team demonstrated similar cell fractions biochemical properties ciliated protozoan tetrahymena pyriformis thus indicated particles undescribed cell organelles unrelated mitochondria presented discovery meeting american society cell biology formally published creating name peroxisomes organelles involved peroxidase achieved first largescale preparation peroxisomes confirming lα hydroxyacid oxidase damino acid oxidase catalase unique enzymes de duve team went show peroxisomes play important metabolic roles including βoxidation longchain fatty acids pathway different mitochondria members large family evolutionarily related organelles present diverse cells including plants protozoa carry distinct functions given specific names glyoxysomes de duves work contributed emerging consensus towards accepting endosymbiotic theory idea proposes organelles eukaryotic cells originated certain prokaryotic cells came live inside eukaryotic cells endosymbionts according de duves version eukaryotic cells structures properties including ability capture food endocytosis digest intracellularly developed first later prokaryotic cells incorporated form de duve proposed peroxisomes allowed cells withstand growing amounts free molecular oxygen earlyearth atmosphere may first endosymbionts peroxisomes dna proposal much less evidence similar claims mitochondria later years mostly devoted origin life studies admitted still speculative field see de duve prolific writer technical popular works notable works de duve brought
