placentation refers formation type structure arrangement placenta function placentation transfer nutrients respiratory gases water maternal tissue growing embryo instances remove waste embryo placentation best known livebearing mammals theria also occurs fish reptiles amphibians diversity invertebrates flowering plants vertebrates placentas evolved times independently majority instances occurring squamate reptiles placenta defined organ formed sustained apposition fusion fetal membranes parental tissue physiological definition modified original mossman definition constrained placentation animals instances occurred uterus live bearing mammals placenta forms embryo implants wall uterus developing fetus connected placenta via umbilical cord mammalian placentas classified based number tissues separating maternal fetal blood include pregnancy placentation formation growth placenta inside uterus occurs implantation embryo uterine wall involves remodeling blood vessels order supply needed amount blood humans placentation takes place days fertilization humans placenta develops following manner chorionic villi embryo embryonic pole grow forming chorion frondosum villi opposite side abembryonic pole degenerate form chorion laeve chorionic laevae smooth surface endometrium mother chorion frondosum part endometrium called decidua basalis forms decidual plate decidual plate tightly attached chorion frondosum goes form actual placenta endometrium opposite side decidua basalis decidua parietalis fuses chorion laevae thus filling uterine case twins dichorionic placentation refers presence two placentas dizygotic monozygotic twins monochorionic placentation occurs monozygotic twins develop one placenta bears higher risk complications pregnancy abnormal placentation lead early termination pregnancy example preeclampsia placentation often results evolution live birth origins live birth lizards snakes squamata seen close equal number independent origins placentation means occurrence placentation squamata frequent vertebrates making ideal research evolution placentation viviparity squamates two separate placentae form utilising separate embryonic tissue chorioallantoic yolksac placentae species complex placentation see regional specialisation amino lipid placentae form following implantation uterine tissue seen mammals formation likely facilitated plasma membrane reptiles exhibit strict epitheliochorial placentation eg pseudemoia entrecasteauxii however least two examples endotheliochorial placentation identified mabuya sp trachylepis unlike eutherian mammals epitheliochorial placentation maintained maternal tissue embryos readily invade tissues outside placenta organ evolved multiple times evolved relatively recently

male seahorses underbelly skin become highly modified form pouch embryos develop mammals reptiles including viviparous southern grass skink uterus becomes regionally specialised support placental functions within regions new specialised uterine structure southern grass skink three distinct regions placenta form likely perform different functions placentome supports nutrient transfer via membrane bound transport proteins paraplacentome supports exchange respiratory gasses yolk sac placenta supports lipid transport via apocrine placental functions include nutrient transport gas
