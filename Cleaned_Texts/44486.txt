effect cognitive people limited competence particular domain overestimate abilities researchers also include opposite effect high performers tendency underestimate skills popular culture effect often misunderstood claim general overconfidence people low intelligence instead specific overconfidence people unskilled particular task effect usually measured comparing selfassessment objective performance example participants may take quiz estimate performance afterward compared actual results initial study published david dunning justin kruger focused logical reasoning grammar social skills since studies conducted across wide range tasks include skills fields business politics medicine driving aviation spatial memory examinations school literacy disagreements causes effect according metacognitive explanation poor performers misjudge abilities fail recognize qualitative difference performances performances others statistical model explains empirical findings statistical effect combination general tendency think one better average rational model holds overly positive prior beliefs ones skills source false selfassessment another explanation claims selfassessment difficult errorprone low performers many similar skill levels disagreements effects magnitude practical consequences inaccurate selfassessment lead people make bad decisions choosing career unfit engaging dangerous behavior may also inhibit affected addressing shortcomings improve effect defined tendency people low ability specific area give overly positive assessments often seen cognitive bias ie systematic tendency engage erroneous forms thinking case effect applies mainly people low skill specific area trying evaluate competence within area systematic error concerns tendency greatly overestimate competence ie see skilled effect usually defined specifically selfassessments people low level theorists restrict bias people low skill also discussing reverse effect ie tendency highly skilled people underestimate abilities relative abilities case source error may selfassessment ones skills overly positive assessment skills phenomenon understood form falseconsensus effect ie tendency overestimate extent people share ones beliefs attitudes knowing scope ignorance part human condition problem see people dont see first rule club dont know youre member club david researchers include metacognitive component definition view effect thesis incompetent given area tend ignorant incompetence ie lack metacognitive ability become aware incompetence definition lends simple explanation effect incompetence often includes unable tell difference competence incompetence reason difficult incompetent recognize sometimes termed dualburden account since low performers affected two burdens lack skill unaware definitions focus tendency overestimate ones ability see relation metacognition possible explanation part contrast relevant since metacognitive explanation controversial many criticisms effect target explanation accept empirical findings low performers tend overestimate among laypeople effect often misunderstood claim people low intelligence confident knowledge skills people high according psychologist robert mcintosh colleagues sometimes understood popular culture claim stupid people stupid know effect applies intelligence general skills specific tasks claim people lacking given skill confident high performers rather low performers overestimate confidence level still high common approach measuring effect compare selfassessment objective performance selfassessment sometimes called subjective ability contrast objective ability corresponding actual selfassessment may done done afterward participants receive independent clues performance well thus activity involves answering quiz questions feedback given whether given answer measurement subjective objective abilities absolute relative terms done absolute terms selfassessment performance measured according objective standards eg concerning many quiz questions answered correctly done relative terms results compared peer group case participants asked assess performances relation participants example form estimating percentage peers effect present cases tends significantly pronounced done relative terms means people usually accurate predicting raw score assessing well relative peer main point interest researchers usually correlation subjective objective provide simplified form analysis measurements objective performances often divided four groups start bottom quartile low performers proceed top quartile high strongest effect seen participants bottom quartile tend see part top two quartiles measured relative initial study david dunning justin kruger examined performance selfassessment undergraduate students inductive deductive abductive logical reasoning english grammar appreciation humor across four studies research indicates participants scored bottom quartile overestimated test performance abilities test scores placed percentile ranked studies focus persons selfview causes inaccurate studies indicate extent inaccuracy depends type task improved becoming better overall effect studied across wide range tasks aviation business debating chess driving literacy medicine politics spatial memory many studies focus example assess performance exam cases studies gather compare data different studies often done laboratories effect also examined settings examples include assessing hunters knowledge firearms large internet various theorists tried provide models explain effects underlying original explanation dunning kruger holds lack metacognitive abilities responsible interpretation universally accepted many alternative explanations discussed academic literature focus one specific factor others see combination various factors metacognitive explanation rests idea part acquiring skill consists learning distinguish good bad performances skill assumes people low skill level unable properly assess performance yet acquired discriminatory ability leads believe better actually see qualitative difference performance others regard lack metacognitive ability recognize model also called dualburden account doubleburden incompetence since burden regular incompetence paired burden metacognitive metacognitive lack may hinder people becoming better hiding flaws used explain selfconfidence sometimes higher unskilled people people average skill latter aware attempts made measure metacognitive abilities directly examine hypothesis findings suggest poor performers reduced metacognitive sensitivity clear extent sufficient explain another study concluded unskilled people lack information metacognitive processes quality skilled indirect argument metacognitive model based observation training people logical reasoning helps make accurate many criticisms metacognitive model hold insufficient empirical evidence alternative models offer better different interpretation removed psychological level sees effect mainly statistical based idea statistical effect known regression toward mean explains empirical findings effect happens two variables perfectly correlated one picks sample extreme value one variable tends show less extreme value variable effect two variables actual performance selfassessed performance person low actual performance selected selfassessed performance tends researchers acknowledge regression toward mean relevant statistical effect must taken account interpreting empirical findings achieved various theorists like gilles gignac marcin zajenkowski go argue regression toward mean combination cognitive biases like betterthanaverage effect explain empirical type explanation sometimes called noise plus according betterthanaverage effect people generally tend rate abilities attributes personality traits better example average iq people average think iq betterthanaverage effect differs effect since track overly positive outlook relates skill effect hand focuses type misjudgment happens poor betterthanaverage effect paired regression toward mean shows similar tendency way explain unskilled people greatly overestimate competence reverse effect highly skilled people much less shown using simulated experiments almost correlation objective selfassessed ability actual critics model argued explain effect assessing ones ability relative ones peer group may able explain selfassessment relative objective objection claims seeing effect regression toward mean form relabeling problem explain mechanism causes based statistical considerations nuhfer et al arrive conclusion strong tendency overly positive selfassessment label unskilled unaware applies study criticized based methodological rational model effect explains observed regression toward mean statistical artifact result prior low performers expect perform well cause give overly positive selfassessment model uses psychological interpretation differs metacognitive explanation holds error caused overly positive prior beliefs inability correctly assess example answering tenquestion quiz low performer four correct answers may believe got two questions right five questions wrong unsure remaining three positive prior beliefs automatically assume got three remaining questions right thereby overestimate another model sees way high low performers distributed source erroneous based assumption many low performers skill levels similar ie many people piled bottom rungs skill would make much difficult accurately assess skills relation according model reason increased tendency give false selfassessments lack metacognitive ability challenging situation ability one criticism interpretation directed assumption type distribution skill levels always used explanation found various fields effect researched present another criticism holds model explain effect selfassessment measured relative ones peer group may fail measured relative absolute explanation sometimes given theorists economic background focuses fact participants corresponding studies lack incentive give accurate cases intellectual laziness desire look good experimenter may motivate participants give overly positive selfassessments reason studies conducted additional incentives accurate one study gave participants monetary reward based accurate selfassessments studies failed show significant increase accuracy incentive group contrast control disagreements effects magnitude practical consequences compared psychological effects claims significance often focus causes affected people make decisions bad outcomes others example according gilles e gignac marcin zajenkowski longterm consequences leading poor performers careers unfit high performers underestimating skills though may forgo viable career opportunities matching skills favor less promising ones skill level cases wrong decisions also shortterm effects example pavel et al hold overconfidence lead pilots operate new aircraft lack adequate training engage flight maneuvers exceed emergency medicine another area correct assessment ones skills risks treatment matters according lisa teneyck tendencies physicians training overconfident must considered ensure appropriate degree supervision schlösser et al hold effect also affect economic activities negatively case example price good used car lowered buyers uncertainty quality overconfident buyer unaware lack knowledge may willing pay much higher price take account potential flaws risks relevant another implication concerns fields researchers rely peoples selfassessments evaluate skills common example vocational counseling estimate students professionals information literacy according khalid mahmood effect indicates selfassessments often correspond underlying skills implies unreliable method gathering type regardless field question metacognitive ignorance often linked effect may inhibit low performers improving since unaware many flaws may little motivation address overcome accounts effect focus negative sides also concentrate positive sides eg ignorance sometimes bliss sense optimism lead people experience situation positively overconfidence may help achieve even unrealistic distinguish negative positive sides two important phases suggested relevant realizing goal preparatory planning execution plan according dunning overconfidence may beneficial execution phase increasing motivation energy detrimental planning phase since agent may ignore bad odds take unnecessary risks fail prepare contingencies example overconfident may advantageous general day battle additional inspiration passed troops disadvantageous weeks ignoring need reserve troops additional protective
