human condition associated presence alimentary toxic aleukia manifests inflammation gastric intestinal mucosa severe progressive leukopenia anemia increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate subsequently petechial hemorrhages skin mucosa well enlarged lymph nodes seen symptoms respiratory system include bronchopneumonia pulmonary hemorrhages sepsis lung abscesses vomiting bloody stools lassitude incoordination also severity disease course determined quantity toxin various reactive properties various tissues organs four stages ata first stage acute intoxication leukopenia stage next third stage distinguished distinct clinical symptoms anginalhemorrhagic stage fourth recovery possible local systemic symptoms appear immediately several hours consuming meal prepared toxic wintered grain local symptoms include bitter taste mouth leads complete loss taste tongue numbness swelling burning sensation mouth pain swallowing hazardous grain consumed foregoing symptoms subsided within days resurfaced soon patient resumed consumption grain toxemia manifested weakness malaise rheumaticlike pain hyperhidrosis condition similar alcohol intoxication insomnia symptoms typically go away isolated cases acute food poisoning resulting acute esophagitis gastritis gastroenteritis hypersalivation nausea vomiting esophageal stomach pain diarrhea fevers degrees giddiness headache mydriasis tachycardia cyanosis limb coldness convulsions also reported also hemorrhagic diathesis cutaneous mucosal hemorrhages epistaxis circumstances blood count indicate hematopoiesis alterations quickly days followed neutropenia relative lymphocytosis thrombocytopenia erythrocyte sedimentation rate subsequent ingesting toxic grain disease advances enters second stage within days habituation harmful substance local symptoms may reoccur duration ata leukopenia stage could vary weeks weeks even months clinically leukopenia stage manifests symptoms central vegetative nervous systems patients reported fatigue apathy vertigo headache poor sleep patients skin would appear pale dry symptoms late dermographism mydriasis would clearly visible patients showed petechial rash towards end leukopenia stage petechial patches initially quite little disease advanced grew size leukopenia stage treated promptly adequately often followed acute symptoms rash hemorrhages necrotic angina high temperature tachycardia mark third ata stage leukocyte count continues fall bleeding time increases coagulability blood delayed hemorrhages occur nose pharynx esophagus gut kidney bladder uterus hemorrhages severe difficult control resulting significant blood loss even death patients develop angina several days following formation petechial rash severe cases might necrotic gangrenous tonsils completely decomposed followed acute edema laryngeal vestibule blockage within days necrotic masses blood clots asphyxia aphonia ensued many people died result gangrenous process progressed soft palate gums tongue lips cheeks nasal cavity resulting tooth loss cheek perforation symptoms particularly prevalent individuals imbalanced diet children severe anginal symptoms followed increase hemorrhagic diathesis acute hepatitis typically manifests third ata stage liver would become slightly enlarged spleen would remain normal microhematuria rare occasions hematuria even severe cases significant improvements even recovery within weeks feasible heart paralysis uncontrollable hemorrhages suffocation pneumonia pulmonary abscesses gangrene contributed pathogenetic therapy administered condition advanced fourth stage lasted days necrotic fool began mend hemorrhages stopped pealed reduction fever showed recovery acute toxemia however lingering toxic symptoms tachycardia hypotension apical systolic murmur left heart dilatation dyspnea weakness vertigo gastritis gastroenteritis hepatitis central vegetative nervous system problems persisted extended period early stages condition therapeutic measures include excluding various wintered grain products flour diet monitoring erythrocyte platelet leukocyte differential counts second stage therapeutic interventions include balanced nutrition includes biologically beneficial proteins vitamins ascorbic acid thiamine riboflavin niacin vitamin b folacin vitamin condition reaches third stage patient immediately hospitalized placed
