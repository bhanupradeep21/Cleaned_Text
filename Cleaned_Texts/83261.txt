enable researchers study neurological diseases disorders focusing diseased damaged structures without losing global perspective thats something weve never able three dimensions although clarity procedure attained unprecedented levels protein retention lipid extraction technique still loses estimated proteins per instance detergent repeated imaging single sample would amplify loss antibody

founded karl deisseroth found detergent process originally published antibody removal ideal approach developed destaining solution detrimental tissue integrity potential disadvantages technique length time takes create image sample immunohistochemical staining alone takes six weeks perform fact acrylamide used highly toxic carcinogenic time often cited limiting factor disadvantage using clarity technique however several academic biotech companies logos bioscience clearlight biotechnologies continued develop optimize clarity reagents significantly truncated immunostaining time frame reducing
