daliansaurus meaning dalian reptile genus small troodontid theropod dinosaur measuring approximately metre ft long early cretaceous china contains single species liaoningensis named shen colleagues nearly complete skeleton preserved three dimensions daliansaurus unusual possessing enlarged claw fourth digit foot addition sickle claw found second digit feet paravians also long metatarsal bones apparently possesses birdlike uncinate processes first among troodontids lujiatun beds yixian formation volcanicallyinfluenced region cold climate daliansaurus lived alongside closest relatives sinovenator sinusonasus mei forms group sinovenatorinae daliansaurus small lightlybuilt likely feathered troodontid measuring approximately metre ft similar size sinovenator typical mature neural arches fused vertebral centra dorsal trunk vertebrae known specimen overall daliansaurus similar sinovenator sinusonasus mei closest relatives differs subtle skull daliansaurus measures centimetres long proportionally larger mei daliansaurus also smaller nostril projection premaxilla nostril flattened instead rodlike like sinovenator another projection nostril straight like sinusonasus unlike sinovenator two openings skull front eyes teardropshaped premaxillary fenestra large oval antorbital fenestra like mei sinovenator sinornithoides unlike sinusonasus bottom edge lower jaw straight convex least tooth positions upper jaw lower latter less sinovenator troodontids like sinovenator however teeth towards back mouth small serrations rear edges four premaxillary teeth recurved daliansaurus least nine cervical vertebrae probably thirteen dorsal vertebrae five sacral vertebrae least twentyeight caudal vertebrae tail sacral vertebrae fifth widest transverse processes daliansaurus third widest sinovenator front margin process also less strongly concave daliansaurus ribs two dorsal vertebrae unusually appear bear uncinate processes form curved rodlike projections similar structures unprecedented among troodontids like sinorthoides bottom end anterior caudal chevrons long platelike directed humerus daliansaurus relatively long deltopectoral crest taking length similar sinovenator sinornithoides three digits hand first metacarpal bone strongly curved vertical plane sinornithoides meanwhile second metacarpal shorter third opposite true sinovenator sinusonasus first digit hand robust claw digit bears distinctly deep groove side meanwhile claw third digit daliansaurus ilium proportionally larger compared femur either sinornithoides mei two halves ilium distinctly separated starting level third sacral like mei albeit shorter distance bottom edge rear ilium concave instead flat like sinovenator femur strongly bowed process known lateral crest lower another process posterior trochanter whereas level sinornithoides like sinornithoides tibia times length femur smaller sinovenator times length proportionally daliansaurus much longer metatarsal bones troodontids like sinovenator outer condyle bottom first metatarsal larger inner one second metatarsal unusually shorter fourth bottom end second terminating trochlea knuckle fourth opposite case sinovenator sinusonasus third metatarsal partially obscured behind fourth unlike tochisaurus partially caused crushing among troodontids daliansaurus best distinguished large claw fourth outermost
