acquired noninflammatory myopathy anim neuromuscular disorder primarily affecting skeletal muscle commonly limbs humans resulting weakness dysfunction myopathy refers problem abnormality myofibrils compose muscle tissue general noninflammatory myopathies grouping muscular diseases induced autoimmunemediated inflammatory pathway muscular diseases usually arise pathology within muscle tissue rather nerves innervating tissue anim wide spectrum causes include drugs toxins nutritional imbalances acquired metabolic dysfunctions acquired defect protein structure acquired noninflammatory myopathy different diagnosis inflammatory myopathy inflammatory myopathies direct result type autoimmune mediated pathway whereas anim result dysfunction immune addition cause inflammatory myopathy relatively unknown whereas many causal agents anim discovered typically affect structural integrity function muscle myopathies typically first diagnosed classified idiopathic inflammatory however diagnosis anim occurs cause myopathy found arise autoimmune patients acquired noninflammatory myopathy typically experience weakness cramping stiffness tetany commonly skeletal muscle surrounding limbs upper shoulder commonly reported symptoms acquired noninflammatory myopathy caused variety factors including metabolic abnormalities drugs nutritional deficiency trauma upstream abnormalities resulting decreased function two common causes anim hyperthyroidism excessive steroid use many drugs used treat rheumatism known inducing agents cases anim linked drugs dietary abnormalitiescitation needed uncommon drugs damage muscle fibers particular families drugs known induce myopathies molecular level thus altering organelle function mitochondria use multiple drugs families conjunction one another increase risk developing many drugs associated inducing myopathies patients found rheumatology practicecitation needed many dietary factors aberrations induce anim chemical imbalances brought abnormal diets may either affect muscle directly induce abnormal functionality upstream pathways trauma muscle also common cause acute anim due muscular contusions partial complete loss function affected muscle patients history one key factors diagnosing acquired noninflammatory myopathy history used analyze time frame patient began express symptoms also see disease within patients family history check medication drug use history see patient trauma due illness infection basic exams test muscle weakness weak performed testing proximal distal muscle strength well testing signs neurogenic symptoms impaired sensation deep tendon reflexes needed advanced equipment used help determine whether patient anim includes examining serum levels muscle enzymes relative levels creatine kinase aldolase aspartate aminotransferase alanine aminotransferase lactate dehydrogenase closely examined abnormal levels proteins indicative inflammatory myopathy emgs particularly useful locating affected muscle groups well determining distribution myopathy throughout cell emgs measure several indicators myopathies magnetic resonance imaging elicit edema inflammatory patients likely show nothing patients anim show individuals anim result metabolite defect additional tests required tests directed enzyme function rest exercise enzyme intermediates molecular genetic testing often used determine predisposition expressed vigorous ischemic exercise skeletal muscle functions anaerobically generating lactate ammonia coproduct muscle myoadenylate deaminase ampd activity forearm ischemic exercise test takes advantage physiology standardized screen disorders glycogen metabolism ampd deficiency patients glycogen storage disease manifest normal increase ammonia change baseline lactate whereas ampd deficiency lactate levels increase ammonia levels ischemic exercise testing gives abnormal result enzyme analysis must performed muscle confirm putative deficiency state falsepositive results occurcitation needed treatment acquired noninflammatory myopathy directed towards resolution underlying condition pain management muscle rehabilitation drug induced anims reversed improved tapering drugs finding alternative hyperthyroidism induced anim treated antithyroid drugs surgery eating foods high iodine kelp treatment hyperthyroidism results complete recovery anim caused vitamin deficiency easily resolved taking vitamin supplements increasing ones exposure direct pain managed massaging affected areas use nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids exercise physical therapy occupational therapy used rehabilitate affected muscle areas resist atrophy use walkers canes braces may assist mobility affected individual diagnostic test statinassociated autoimmune necrotizing myopathy available soon order differentiate different types myopathies diagnosis presence abnormal spontaneous electrical activity resting muscles indicates irritable myopathy postulated reflect presence active necrotising myopathic process unstable muscle membrane potential however finding poor sensitivity specificity predicting presence inflammatory myopathy biopsy research spontaneous electrical activity allow accurate differential diagnosis different currently muscle biopsy remains critical test unless diagnosis secured genetic testing genetic testing less invasive test improved upon would ideal molecular genetic testing available many common metabolic myopathies muscular dystrophies tests costly thus best used confirm rather screen diagnosis specific myopathy hope researchers testing methods improve function costs access become increased study muscle pathophysiology importance researchers helps better differentiate inflammatory versus noninflammatory aim treatment part differential diagnosis certainly classification schemes better define wide range myopathies help clinicians gain better understanding think patients continued research efforts help appreciate pathophysiology improve clinicians ability administer appropriate therapy based particular variety mechanism myopathy individuals low vitamin completely understood decreased availability
