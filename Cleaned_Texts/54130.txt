ensemble coding also known ensemble perception summary representation theory cognitive neuroscience internal representation groups objects human mind ensemble coding proposes information recorded via summary statistics particularly average variance experimental evidence tends support theory lowlevel visual information shapes sizes well highlevel features face gender nonetheless remains unclear extent ensemble coding applies highlevel nonvisual stimuli theory remains subject active research extensive amounts information available visual system ensemble coding theory suggests people process general gist complex visual surroundings grouping objects together based shared properties world filled redundant information human visual system become particularly brain exploits redundancy condenses information example leaves tree blades grass give rise percept treeness demonstrated individuals ability quickly accurately encode ensembles objects like leaves tree gather summary statistical information like mean variance groups research suggests process provides rough visual information entire visual field giving way complete accurate picture visual although individual details accurate picture might inaccessible gist scene remains ensemble coding adaptive process lightens cognitive load processing storing visual representations use david whitney allison yamanashi leib developed operational flexible definition stating ensemble coding cover following five research found countering evidence theory ensemble coding vision science noted although humans take large amounts visual information adults able process attend retain roughly four items visual furthermore scientists found visual upper limit capacity exists across various phenomena including change object feature additional theories vision science propose stimuli represented brain individually small low resolution icons stored templates limited capacities organized associative throughout history ensemble coding known many names interest theory began emerge early earliest years ensemble coding known gestalt max wertheimer gestalt psychology theorist addressing humans perceive visual world holistically rather gestaltists argued object perception individual object features either lost difficult perceive therefore grouped object favored although gestaltists helped define central principles object perception research modern ensemble coding occur many years latercitation needed norman anderson one earliest conduct explicit ensemble coding andersons research social ensemble coding showed individuals described two positive terms rated favorably individuals described two positive terms two negative research impression formation demonstrated weighted mean average captures information integrated rather additional research time explored ensemble coding group shopping perceived badness findings dan ariely first data support modern theories ensemble coding ariely used novel experimental paradigms labeled mean discrimination member identification examine sets objects perceived conducted three studies involving shape ensembles varied size across studies participants able accurately encode mean size ensemble objects inaccurate asked certain object part set arielys findings first found statistical summary information emerge visual perception grouped consistent arielys followup research conducted sang chul chong anne treisman provided evidence participants engaging summary statistical processes research revealed participants maintained high accuracy encoding mean size stimuli even short stimuli presentations low milliseconds memory delays object distribution additional research demonstrated ensemble coding limited mean size objects additional content extracted average line average spatial average statistical summaries detected observers also able extract accurate perceptual summaries highlevel features average direction eye gaze grouped average walking direction people ability encode ensembles objects along various dimensions divided levels vary lowlevel highlevel feature information lowlevel ensemble coding observed various psychophysical areas research example people accurately perceive average size motion direction grouped line spatial highlevel ensemble coding extends complex higher level objects including findings suggest lowerlevel higherlevel information may processed independent cognitive based early work appears humans integrate semantic well social information memory using ensemble coding findings suggest social processes may hinge sort underlying mechanisms allow people perceive average object orientation average object direction recent years ensemble coding field social vision emerged social vision field research examines people perceive one another addition ensemble coding field able explore people perception people perceive groups people specific research area focuses observers accurately perceive extract social information groups extracted information influences downstream judgments seminal research introducing use ensemble coding field social vision conducted briana goodale goodales research found humans accurately extract sex ratio summaries ensembles faces sex ratio provides early visual cue signaling sense belonging fit within specifically research found participants felt stronger sense belonging given ensemble members sex increased perceived additional research uncovered little milliseconds participants able derive average sex ratio ensemble furthermore within milliseconds participants able form impressions based perceived sex ratio make inferences groups perceived specifically research found groups judged threatening ratio men women
