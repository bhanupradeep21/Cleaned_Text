cognitive psychology sequence learning inherent human ability integrated part conscious nonconscious learning well activities sequences information sequences actions used various everyday tasks sequencing sounds speech sequencing movements typing playing instruments sequencing actions driving sequence learning used study skill acquisition studies various groups ranging neuropsychological patients according ritter nerb order material presented strongly influence learned fast performance increases sometimes even whether material learned sequence learning known understood form explicit learning also studied form implicit learning well forms learning sequence learning also referred sequential behavior behavior sequencing serial order behavior first half century margaret floy washburn john b watson behaviorists believed behavioral sequencing governed reflex chain states stimulation caused initial movement triggers additional movement triggers another additional movement karl lashley neurophysiologist harvard university published problem serial order behavior addressing current beliefs sequence learning introducing hypothesis criticized previous view basis six lines evidence first line movements occur even sensory feedback interrupted second movement sequences occur quickly elements sequences triggered feedback preceding elements next errors behavior suggest internal plans done later also time initiate movement sequence increase length complexity sequence next line properties movements occurring early sequence anticipate later features lastly neural activity indicate preparation upcoming behavior events including upcoming behavior events relatively longterm lashley argued sequence learning behavioral sequencing serial order behavior attributable sensory feedback rather proposed plans behavior since nervous system prepares behaviors others said hierarchical organization plans came several lines evidence first context changes functional interpretations behaviors way wright right right rite write interpreted based context sentence right interpreted direction something good depending context second line evidence says errors involved human behavior hierarchical organization addition hierarchical organization plans comes timing behavioral sequences larger phrase longer response time factors decoding unpacking hierarchical plans additional evidence easy hard learn sequence mind create memory happen well memory happened final evidence hierarchical organization plans characterized chunking skill combines multiple units larger two broad categories sequence subcategories explicit sequence learning known studied since discovery sequence learning however recently implicit sequence learning gained attention research form implicit learning implicit sequence learning concerns underlying learning methods people words learning without knowing exact properties number mechanisms implicit learning forms implicit sequence learning include motor sequence learning temporal sequence learning associative sequence learning sequence learning problems used better understand different types sequence learning four basic sequence learning problems sequence prediction sequence generation sequence recognition sequential decision making problems show sequences formulated show patterns sequences follow different sequence learning problems related sequence prediction attempts predict next immediate element sequence based preceding elements sequence generation basically sequence prediction attempt piece together sequence one one way naturally occurs sequence recognition takes certain criteria determines whether sequence legitimate sequential decision making sequence generation actions breaks three variations goaloriented trajectoryoriented reinforcementmaximizing three variations want pick actions steps lead goal sequence learning problems reflect hierarchical organization plans element sequences builds previous elements classic experiment published alfred l yarbus demonstrated though subjects viewing portraits reported apprehending portrait whole eye movements successively fixated informative parts image observations suggest underlying apparently parallel process face perception serial oculomotor process common observation skill acquired attentive initial phase repeated practice skill becomes nearly also known unconscious competence concentrate learning new action performing previously learned actions skillfully thus appears neural code representation learned skill created brain usually
