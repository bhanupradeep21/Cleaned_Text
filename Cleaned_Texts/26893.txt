leptomeningeal cancer rare complication cancer disease spreads original tumor site meninges surrounding brain spinal leads inflammatory response hence alternative names neoplastic meningitis nm malignant meningitis carcinomatous term leptomeningeal greek lepto meaning fine slight describes thin meninges arachnoid pia mater cerebrospinal fluid disorder originally reported eberth also known leptomeningeal carcinomatosis leptomeningeal disease lmd leptomeningeal metastasis meningeal metastasis meningeal carcinomatosis occurs cancers likely spread central nervous common cancers include leptomeninges breast cancer lung cancer melanomas metastasize subarachnoid brain offers hospitable environment growth metastatic tumor individuals whose cancer spread area brain known posterior fossa greater risk developing leptomeningeal condition also arise primary brain tumor like medulloblastoma leptomeningeal disease becoming evident cancer patients living longer many chemotherapies reach sufficient concentrations spinal fluid kill tumor depending tumor cells settle leptomeningeal cancer cause almost neurological common symptoms leptomeningeal cancer pain seizures symptoms may include headaches usually associated nausea vomiting lightheadedness gait difficulties weakness ataxia memory problems incontinence sensory cases symptoms may include double vision numb back pain leg weakness sphincterrelated problems loss urine control difficulty walking symptoms less common cranial nerve abnormalities spinal symptoms limb weakness paresthesia bowel bladder dysfunction diplopia common

goals treatment include prolonging survival stabilizing neurological symptoms radiotherapy used mostly focal type nm due nature damage success rate associated treatment radiotherapy targets tumor destroys collective tissues cancerous cells chemotherapy injected directly cerebrospinal fluid either lumbar puncture spinal tap surgically implanted device called ommaya intrathecal therapy preferred since intravenous chemotherapy penetrate common chemicals used liposomal cytarabine depocyte intrathecal methotrexate mtx downside spinal tap diagnosis highly accurate reliable also report

factor makes treatment difficult suitable method evaluate disease prognosis generally poor survival typically measured median survival time patients without treatment four six weeks best prognoses seen nm due breast cancer median overall survival six months diagnosis death generally due progressive neurological dysfunction treatment meant stabilize neurological function prolong survival neurological dysfunction usually fixed progressive dysfunction halted survival may increased four six months occurs approximately cancer disease usually terminal left untreated median survival weeks whereas treated median survival increase treatment effective done primary tumor metastasizes brain spinal cord patients leukaemia achieve better results compared patients solid tumours undergone treatment found patients stabilize improve several months opposed patients respond progressive disease despite initial improvement patients survive months breast cancer small cell lung cancer two solid tumors respond best patients better others particularly whose primary cancer hematologic bone marrow lymph much prognosis determined damage due primary cancer negative hormone receptor status
