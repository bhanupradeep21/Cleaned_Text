cat anatomy comprises anatomical studies visible parts body domestic cat similar members genus felis cats carnivores highly specialized teeth four types permanent dentition teeth structure mouth twelve incisors four canines ten premolars four premolar first molar located side mouth together called carnassial pair carnassial pair specialize cutting food parallel incisors located front section lower upper mouth small narrow single root used grasping biting cat also deciduous dentition prior formation permanent one dentition emerges seven days birth composed teeth slight differences mouth smaller incisors slender strongly curved upper canines vertical lower canines even smaller upper lower although upper lower molars smaller ones arise permanent dentition similarities cats tongue covered mucous membrane dorsal aspect types sharp spines papillae papillae filiform fungiform foliate vallate cats sense smell taste work closely together vomeronasal organ allows use tongue scent longitudinal transverse vertical intrinsic muscles aid similar dogs cats sensitive ears move independently mobility cat move body one direction point ears another direction rostral caudal dorsal ventral auricular muscle groups ear comprise fifteen muscles responsible cats straight ears pointing upward unlike dogs flapeared breeds extremely rare scottish folds one exceptional mutation angry frightened cat lay back ears accompany growling hissing sounds makes cats also turn ears back playing listen sound coming behind fold skin forming pouch lower posterior part ear known henrys pocket usually prominent cats function unknown though may assist filtering sounds cats highly territorial secretion odors plays major role cat communication nose helps cats identify territories cats mates locate food various cats sense smell believed fourteen times sensitive humans rhinarium leathery part nose see quite tough allow absorb rather rough treatment sometimes color varies according genotype genetic makeup cat cats skin color fur color nose leather probably dictated dedicated gene cats white fur skin susceptible damage ultraviolet light may cause cancer extra care required outside hot cats digitigrades means walk toes like dogs advantage cats digitigrades agile animals animals ground reaction forces grfs around two three times body weight per limb digitigrades higher grf animals due increased weight smaller surface area would six times body weight per toe tufts commonly found cats medium long coats clumps fur stick least cm beyond paw pad considered tufts addition soft paw pads toe tufts help cat silently stalk prey muffling excess noise however outdoor cats tend lose toe tufts due excessive abrasion rougher outdoor surfaces distinct contrast indoor cats spend time walking carpet smooth floors cats also able walk precisely adult cats walk fourbeat gait meaning foot step spot whether walk fast slowly cats walk considered symmetric right limbs imitate position left limbs walk type locomotion provides sense touch four paws necessary precise cats vertebrae held muscles rather ligaments like contributes cats elasticity ability elongate contract back curving upwards oscillating along vertebral cats also able jump greater heights without serious injury due efficient performance limbs ability control impact forces case hindlimbs able absorb shock energy comparison forelimbs jumping surface surface well steer cat weightbearing like nearly members family felidae cats protractable claws normal relaxed position claws sheathed skin fur around toe pads keeps claws sharp preventing wear contact ground allows silent stalking prey claws forefeet typically sharper hind cats voluntarily extend claws one paws may extend claws hunting selfdefense climbing kneading extra traction soft surfaces bedspreads thick rugs skin etc also possible make cooperative cat extend claws carefully pressing top bottom paw curved claws become entangled carpet thick fabric cause injury cat unable free cats total digits claws forefoot digit dewclaw hind foot dewclaw located high foreleg contact ground nonweight cats digits due common mutation called polydactyly result five seven toes per paw normal body temperature cat cat considered febrile hyperthermic temperature greater hypothermic less comparison humans average body temperature domestic cats normal heart rate ranges beats per minute bpm largely dependent excited cat cat rest average heart rate usually bpm twice human averages however monitored wild cats often running higher daily temperatures order properly operate night falls see larger decrease body temperature compared cats might inhabit indoors reading group stray cats observed australia showed temperatures higher regular house cats possess rather loose skin allows turn confront predator another cat fight even grip also advantage veterinary purposes simplifies fact lives cats chronic kidney disease sometimes extended years regular injection large volumes fluid particularly loose skin back neck known scruff area mother cat grips kittens carry result cats tend become quiet passive gripped behavior also extends adulthood male grab female scruff immobilize mounts prevent running away mating process takes technique useful attempting treat move uncooperative cat however since adult cat heavier kitten pet cat never carried scruff instead weight supported rump hind legs chest front pawsoriginal research cats share common traits due heredity one primordial pouch sometimes referred spay sway owners notice cat spayed neutered located cats belly appearance similar loose flap skin might occur cat overweight lost weight provides little extra protection kicks common cat fights cat try rake rear claws wild cats ancestors domesticated felines pouch appears present provide extra room case animal opportunity eat large meal stomach needs expand stomach pouch also allows cat bend expand allowing faster running higher cats

carbohydrates therefore saliva contain enzyme food moves mouth esophagus stomach gastrointestinal tract domestic cats contains small cecum unsacculated cecum similar dogs coiled cecum stomach cat divided distinct regions motor activity proximal end stomach relaxes food food digested portion stomach either rapid stationary contractions sustained tonic contraction different actions result either food moved around food moving towards distal portion distal portion stomach undergoes rhythmic cycles partial depolarization sensitizes muscle cells likely contract stomach muscular structure also serves chemical function releasing hydrochloric acid digestive enzymes break food food moves stomach small intestine first part small intestine duodenum food moves duodenum mixes bile fluid neutralizes stomach acid emulsifies fat pancreas releases enzymes aid digestion nutrients broken pass intestinal mucosa blood travel rest pancreas produce starch processing enzymes cats eat diet high since cat digests low amounts glucose pancreas uses amino acids trigger insulin release instead food moves jejunum nutrient absorptive section small intestine liver regulates level nutrients absorbed blood system small intestine jejunum whatever food absorbed sent ileum connects large first part large intestine cecum second portion colon large intestine reabsorbs water forms fecal matter things cats able digest example cats clean licking fur tongue causes swallow lot fur causes buildup fur cats stomach creates mass fur often thrown better known short length digestive tract cat causes cats digestive system weigh less species animals allows cats active cats well adapted predators limited ability regulate catabolic enzymes amino acids meaning amino acids constantly destroyed therefore cats require higher protein proportion diet many species cats adapted synthesize niacin tryptophan carnivores convert carotene vitamin eating plants harmful provide nutrients female cat genitalia includes uterus vagina genital passages teats together vulva vagina cat involved mating provides channel newborns parturition birth vagina long genital passages oviducts cat short narrow male cat genitalia includes two testicles penis covered small female genitourinary system male genitourinary system male genitourinary system penile spines cats familiar easily kept animals physiology particularly well studied generally resembles carnivorous mammals displays several unusual features probably attributable cats descent desertdwelling cats able tolerate quite high temperatures humans generally start feel uncomfortable skin temperature passes cats show discomfort skin reaches around tolerate temperatures access cats conserve heat reducing flow blood skin lose heat evaporation mouths cats minimal ability sweat glands located primarily paw pant heat relief high may also pant stressed cats body temperature vary throughout day part cats general lack circadian rhythms may reflect tendency active day cats feces comparatively dry urine highly concentrated adaptations allow cats retain much water kidneys efficient survive diet consisting meat additional tolerate high
