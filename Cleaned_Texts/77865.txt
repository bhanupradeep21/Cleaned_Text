reduced wearing mouthguard mouthguards often less effective fitted properly despite wide availability use mouthguards relatively many people use even situations carry high risk dental injury use addition mouthguards may dislodged wearers mouth leaving teeth unprotected certain occlusal traits class ii malocclusions increased overjet associated higher incidence dental traits corrected orthodontist dental avulsion real dental emergency prompt management within minutes injury affects prognosis avulsed permanent tooth gently well rinsed saline care taken damage surface root may living

damage permanent dental although dentists advise best treatment avulsed tooth immediate variety reasons difficult nonprofessional person teeth often covered debris debris must washed physiological solution scrubbed often multiple teeth knockedout person know socket individual tooth belongs injured victim may serious injuries require immediate attention injuries severely lacerated bleeding lip gum prevent easy visualization socket pain may severe person may resist replantation teeth people may light infectious diseases eg hiv fear handling teeth touching blood associated immediate replantation possible teeth placed appropriate storage solution brought dentist replant dentist clean socket wash teeth necessary replant sockets splint nonknockedout teeth maximum two weeks teeth normal alveolar process bone support properly handled even replantation periodontally compromised permanent teeth older patients good maintenance reported splinting extending weeks due reduced support

hygiene chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash soft cold diet avoidance smoking several days may provide favorable condition periodontal ligaments patient arrives dentist seen quickly urgency tooth placed suitable storage medium dentist immediately thorough extraoral intraoral examination performed clinician consider age patient history injury whether line clinical findings concern nonaccidental injury safeguarding procedures prior beginning procedure local anesthetic administered palatallingual tissues minimize discomfort gentle irrigation saline solution performed removes clots within socket could prevent proper repositioning tooth original position tooth always handled via enamel crown root wash root surface saline careful scrub root surface may crush delicate cells stubborn debris removed gently dabbing gauze soaked saline tooth may gently placed back soaking practice soaking tooth active medicament update shown soaking avulsed tooth immunemodulating drug prior reimplantation increase periodontal healing tooth survival compared saline every tooth connected surrounding bone periodontal ligament tooth receives nourishment ligament tooth knocked ligament stretched splits half half

tested powdered milk enfamil gatorade contact lens solution shown either ineffective damaging avulsed tooth despite treatment provided dental avulsion carries one poorest outcomes replanted teeth eventually three main factors significantly influence prognosis tooth include dental trauma varies widely complexity usually little lay people professionals excluding dentists however avulsion one type traumatic dental injury lay people play critical role determining prognosis tooth best prognosis replanted within minutes also excellent prognosis stored optimal storage medium within one hour pdl healing primary outcome measure assessing interventions tooth healing pdl unfavorable means longer protection root surrounding alveolar bone bone surrounds tooth continually undergoing
