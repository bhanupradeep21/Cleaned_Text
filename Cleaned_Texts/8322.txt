chemical stratification oxygen deficits productivity ecological significance oxidationreduction potential lake waters four volume treatise limnology became standard limnology students hutchinson expanded field limnology especially ecological biogeochemical aspects advocated use statistical mathematical methods postdoctoral associate raymond lindeman furthered hutchinsons model trophic dynamic concept together looked energy flows lake trophic levels followed energy using hutchinsons notation system organism given integer mark many organisms energy go order reach designated trophic level became possible measure efficiency given system energy losses ascending trophic hutchinson also recognized first use radioisotopes tracers field experiments along graduate student vaughan bowen credited creating radiation ecology brand new major field ecology turned linsley pond released twentyfour portions two lines dispersed uniformly across water week later collected water across
