choking game blackout challenge act intentionally cutting oxygen brain goal inducing temporary loss consciousness euphoria limited research conducted regarding motivations practicing fainting game although thrill seeking identified risk perception lowrisk anecdotal reasons stated include reasons practice distinct erotic asphyxiation steve field chairman royal college general practitioners claims fainting game pursued primarily children teens get high without taking drugs children arent playing game sexual gratification frequently confused erotic asphyxiation oxygen deprivation sexual arousal unlike erotic asphyxiation practice fainting game appears uncommon two main mechanisms behind many variations practice resulting cerebral hypoxia oxygen deprivation brain two mechanisms tend confused treated one quite dissimilar although potential cause permanent brain damage death two mechanisms strangulation selfinduced work follows ligature belt rope around neck hands arm pressure neck
