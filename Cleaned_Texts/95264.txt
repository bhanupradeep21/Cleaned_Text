may increase risk gallstones include constipation eating fewer meals per day low intake nutrients folate magnesium calcium vitamin low fluid least men high intake carbohydrate high glycemic load high glycemic index wine wholegrained bread may decrease risk rapid weight loss increases risk weight loss drug orlistat known increase risk cholecystokinin deficiency caused celiac disease increases risk gallstone formation especially diagnosis celiac disease pigment gallstones commonly seen developing world risk factors pigment stones include hemolytic anemias sicklecell disease hereditary spherocytosis cirrhosis biliary tract people erythropoietic protoporphyria epp increased risk develop additionally prolonged use proton pump inhibitors shown decrease gallbladder function potentially leading gallstone cholesterol modifying medications affect gallstone formation statins inhibit cholesterol synthesis evidence use may decrease risk getting fibrates increase cholesterol concentration bile use associated increased risk bile acid malabsorption may also risk cholesterol gallstones develop bile contains much cholesterol enough bile salts besides high concentration cholesterol two factors important causing gallstones first often well gallbladder contracts incomplete infrequent emptying gallbladder may cause bile become overconcentrated contribute gallstone formation caused high resistance flow bile gallbladder due complicated internal geometry cystic second factor presence proteins liver bile either promote inhibit cholesterol crystallization gallstones addition increased levels hormone estrogen result pregnancy hormone therapy use combined estrogencontaining forms hormonal contraception may increase cholesterol levels bile also decrease gallbladder motility resulting
