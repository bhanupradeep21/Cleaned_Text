disorders consciousness medical conditions inhibit define disorders consciousness change complete selfawareness inhibited absent selfawareness arousal category generally includes minimally conscious state persistent vegetative state sometimes also includes less severe lockedin syndrome severe rare chronic differential diagnosis disorders active area biomedical finally brain death results irreversible disruption conditions may cause moderate deterioration eg dementia delirium transient interruption eg grand mal petit mal seizures consciousness included categorycitation needed patients dramatically altered state consciousness present unique problems diagnosis prognosis treatment assessment cognitive functions remaining traumatic brain injury difficult voluntary movements may small inconsistent easily exhausted quantification brain activity differentiates patients sometimes differ brief small movement fingercitation needed consciousness complex multifaceted concept divided two main components arousal awareness arousal associated functional brainstem neuron populations projecting thalamic cortical therefore assessment reflexes using glasgow coma scale important investigate functional integrity brainstem awareness thought related functional integrity cerebral cortex subcortical connections important point regarding classification disorders consciousness consciousness measured objectively machine although many scoring systems developed quantification consciousness neuroimaging techniques important tools clinical research extending understanding underlying mechanisms disorders consciousness represent immense social ethical issues diagnosis methodologically complex needs careful interpretation also ethical framework must developed guide research patientscitation needed lockedin syndrome patient awareness sleepwake cycles meaningful behavior viz eyemovement isolated due quadriplegia pseudobulbar palsy resulting disruption corticospinal corticobulbar pathways lockedin syndrome condition patient aware awake move communicate verbally due complete paralysis nearly voluntary muscles body except eyes eye eyelid movements main method total lockedin syndrome version lockedin syndrome eyes paralyzed minimally conscious state patient intermittent periods awareness wakefulness criteria minimally conscious state patients vegetative state able communicate consistently means patients show limited reproducible signs awareness themself environment could following simple commands intelligible speech purposeful behavior including movements affective behavior relation external stimuli reflexive improvement towards full conscious recovery likely state vegetative state still patients remain mcs persistent vegetative state patient sleepwake cycles lacks awareness able communicate displays reflexive nonpurposeful behavior term refers organic body able grow develop devoid intellectual activity social diagnosis vegetative state questioned degree sustained reproducible visual pursuit fixation response threatening gestures state reflects intact brainstem allied structures severely damaged white gray matter cerebral hemispheres preservation structures maintains arousal automatic overall metabolism drops average normal range four weeks vegetative state vs patient classified persistent vegetative state metabolism drops normal range seems result transsynaptic neuronal although diagnosis problematic formal absence sign conscious perception deliberate action essential diagnosis classified permanent vegetative state pvs approximately year vegetative state traumatic brain like coma chronic coma results mostly cortical whitematter damage neuronal axonal injury focal brainstem lesions usually metabolism grey matter decreases normal range patient lacks awareness arousal patient lies eyes closed aware self surroundings stimulation produce spontaneous periods wakefulness eyeopening unlike patients vegetative state medicine coma greek κῶμα koma meaning deep sleep state unconsciousness lasting six hours person awakened fails respond normally painful stimuli light sound lacks normal sleepwake cycle initiate voluntary actions although according glasgow coma scale person confusion considered mildest coma cerebral metabolism shown correlate poorly level consciousness patients mild severe injury within first month traumatic brain injury person state coma described comatose general patients surviving coma recover gradually within weeks recovery full awareness arousal always possible patients progress vegetative state minimally conscious state sometimes also results prolonged stages recovery complete although coma patient may appear awake unable consciously feel speak hear move patient maintain consciousness two important neurological components must function impeccably first cerebral cortex gray matter covering outer layer brain structure located brainstem called reticular activating system ras aras injury either components sufficient cause patient experience comacitation needed brain death irreversible end brain activity function including involuntary activity necessary sustain life main cause total necrosis cerebral neurons following loss brain oxygenation brain death patient lacks sense awareness sleepwake cycles behavior typically look dead deep sleepstate coma although visually similar comatose state persistent vegetative state two confused criteria brain death differ country country however clinical assessments require loss brainstem reflexes demonstration continuing apnea persistently comatose patient functional imaging using pet ct scans typically show hollow skull phenomenon confirms absence neuronal function whole brain patients classified brain dead legally dead qualify organ donors organs surgically removed prepared particular recipientcitation needed brain death one deciding factors pronouncing trauma patient dead determining function presence necrosis trauma whole brain brainstem may used determine brain death used many states uscitation needed metabolic studies useful able identify neural activity within specific region specific cognitive processes functionality identified general level metabolism cortical subcortical regions may contribute cognitive processescitation needed present established relation cerebral metabolic rates glucose oxygen measured pet patient outcome decrease cerebral metabolism occurs also patients treated anesthetics point unresponsiveness lowest value normal range reported propofol anesthesia also deep sleep represents phase decreased metabolism normal general quantitative pet studies assessment cerebral metabolic rates depends many assumptions pet example requires correction factor lumped constant stable healthy brains reports global decrease constant emerges traumatic brain correction factors change due tbi another issue possibility anaerobic glycolysis could occur tbi case glucose levels measured pet tightly connected oxygen consumption patients third point regarding pet scans overall measurement per unit volume brain tissue imaging affected inclusion metabolically inactive spaces eg cerebrospinal fluid case gross hydrocephalus artificially lowers calculated also issue radiation exposure must considered patients already severely damaged brains preclude longitudinal followup studiescitation needed disorders consciousness present variety ethical concerns obvious lack consent treatment decisions patients pvs mcs able decide possibility withdrawal lifesupport also general question whether receive lifesustaining therapy duration problems regarding patients consent also account neuroimaging studies without patients consent studies perceived additionally patients created advance directives losing decisionmaking capacitycitation needed typically approval must obtained family legal representatives depending governmental hospital guidelines even consent representatives researchers refused grants ethics committee approval publicationcitation needed social issues arise enormous costs associated people disorders consciousness especially chronic comatose vegetative patients recovery highly unlikely treatment icu considered futile clinicianscitation needed addition aforementioned problems question rises medical resources used broader public good patients seemed little gain nevertheless irreversibility conditions remains open question studies demonstrated patients disorders consciousness may aware despite clinical unresponsivenesscitation needed findings could major impact ethical social httpsenwikipediaorgwikidisordersofconsciousness
