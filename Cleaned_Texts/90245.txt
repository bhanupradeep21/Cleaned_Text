leading misunderstandings gasp kind paralinguistic respiration form sudden sharp inhalation air mouth gasp may indicate difficulty breathing panicked effort draw air lungs gasps also occur emotion surprise shock disgust like sigh yawn moan gasp often automatic unintentional gasping closely related sighing inhalation characterizing gasp induced shock surprise may released sigh event causing initial emotional reaction determined less shocking surprising observer first symptom physiological problems apneustic respirations aka apneusis gasps related brain damage associated stroke trauma sigh kind paralinguistic respiration form deep especially audible single exhalation air mouth nose humans use communicate emotion voiced pharyngeal fricative sometimes associated guttural glottal breath exuded low tone often arises negative emotion dismay dissatisfaction boredom sigh also arise positive emotions particularly response negative situation ending avoided like gasp yawn moan sigh often automatic unintentional literature sigh often used signify person producing lovelorn scientific studies show babies sigh breaths serves improve mechanical properties lung tissue also helps
