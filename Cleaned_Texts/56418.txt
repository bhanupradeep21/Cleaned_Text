messages containing copies avoid detection users viruses employ different kinds deception old viruses especially dos platform make sure last modified date host file stays file infected virus approach fool antivirus software however especially maintain date cyclic redundancy checks file viruses infect files without increasing sizes damaging files accomplish overwriting unused areas executable files called cavity viruses example cih virus chernobyl virus infects portable executable files files many empty gaps virus kb length add size viruses try avoid detection killing tasks associated antivirus software detect example conficker virus may also hide presence using rootkit showing list system processes disguising within trusted computers operating systems grow larger complex old hiding techniques need updated replaced defending computer viruses may demand file system migrate towards detailed explicit permission every kind file accesscitation needed addition small fraction known viruses actually cause real incidents primarily many viruses remain theoretical epidemic kinds antivirus software employ various techniques counter stealth mechanisms infection occurs recourse clean system unreliable microsoft windows operating systems ntfs file system proprietary leaves antivirus software little alternative send read request windows files handle requests viruses trick antivirus software intercepting requests operating system virus hide intercepting request read infected file handling request returning uninfected version file antivirus software interception occur code injection actual operating system files would handle read request thus antivirus software attempting detect virus either permitted read infected file read request served uninfected version reliable method avoid stealth viruses boot medium known clear security software used check dormant operating system files security software relies virus signatures employ security software may also use database file hashes windows os files security software identify altered files request windows installation media replace authentic versions older versions windows file cryptographic hash functions

modern antivirus programs try find viruspatterns inside ordinary programs scanning socalled virus different antivirus programs employ different search methods identifying viruses virus scanner finds pattern file perform checks make sure found virus merely coincidental sequence innocent file notifies user file infected user delete cases clean heal infected file viruses employ techniques make detection means signatures difficult probably impossible viruses modify code infection infected file contains different variant viruscitation needed one method evading signature detection use simple encryption encipher encode body virus leaving encryption module static cryptographic key cleartext change one infection case virus consists small decrypting module encrypted copy virus code virus encrypted different key infected file part virus remains constant decrypting module would example appended end case virus scanner directly detect virus using signatures still detect decrypting module still makes indirect detection virus possible since would symmetric keys stored infected host entirely possible decrypt final virus probably required since selfmodifying code rarity finding may reason enough virus scanners least flag file suspiciouscitation needed old compact way use arithmetic operation like addition subtraction use logical conditions byte virus constant exclusiveor operation repeated decryption suspicious code modify code encryptiondecryption may part signature many virus definitionscitation needed simpler older approach use key encryption consisted operations parameters like incrementing decrementing bitwise rotation arithmetic negation logical viruses called polymorphic viruses employ means encryption inside executable virus encrypted certain events virus scanner disabled updates computer called cryptovirology polymorphic code first technique posed serious threat virus scanners like regular encrypted viruses polymorphic virus infects files encrypted copy decoded decryption module case polymorphic viruses however decryption module also modified infection wellwritten polymorphic virus therefore parts remain identical infections making difficult detect directly using antivirus software detect decrypting viruses using emulator statistical pattern analysis encrypted virus body enable polymorphic code virus polymorphic engine also called mutating engine mutation engine somewhere encrypted body see polymorphic code technical detail engines viruses employ polymorphic code way constrains mutation rate virus significantly example virus programmed mutate slightly time programmed refrain mutating infects file computer already contains copies virus advantage using slow polymorphic code makes difficult antivirus professionals investigators obtain representative samples virus bait files infected one run typically contain identical similar samples virus make likely detection virus scanner unreliable instances virus may able avoid detection avoid detected emulation viruses rewrite completely time infect new executables viruses utilize technique said metamorphic code enable metamorphism metamorphic engine needed metamorphic virus usually large
