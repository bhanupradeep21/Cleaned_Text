urushiolinduced contact dermatitis also called toxicodendron dermatitis rhus dermatitis type allergic contact dermatitis caused oil urushiol found various plants notably sumac family species genus toxicodendron poison ivy poison oak poison sumac chinese lacquer name derived japanese word sap chinese lacquer tree urushi plants sumac family including mango pistachio burmese lacquer tree india marking nut tree shell cashew also contain unrelated plants ginkgo case contact dermatitis urushiolinduced allergic rashes type iv hypersensitivity reaction also known delayedtype hypersensitivity symptoms include itching inflammation oozing severe cases burning sensation american academy dermatology estimates million cases urushiolinduced dermatitis annually united states alone accounting losttime injuries united states forest service poison oak significant problem rural western southern united states poison ivy rampant eastern united states dermatitis poison sumac less common urushiol causes eczematous contact dermatitis characterized redness swelling papules vesicles blisters people vary greatly sensitivity urushiol approximately people urushiol trigger immune system response least people strong immune response resulting severe symptomscitation needed rash takes one two weeks run course may cause scars depending severity severe cases involve small mm clear fluidfilled blisters skin pusfilled vesicles containing whitish fluid may indicate infection poison ivy rashes without infections resolve within days without treatment excessive scratching may result infection commonly staphylococcal streptococcal species may require antibiotics severe allergic reaction urushiol poison oak days exposure blistering hours urushiol contact poison ivy rash days poison ivy rash swelling days direct contact urushiolinduced contact dermatitis caused contact plant object containing urushiol oil adheres almost anything comes contact towels blankets clothing landscaping clothing materials touch plant washed touch skin common causes people never exposed yet allergic urushiol may take days reaction occur first time allergic urushiol however people break hours contact oil typically individuals exposed least several times develop rash typically persists one two weeks cases may last five weeks urushiol primarily found spaces cells beneath outer skin plant effects less severe plant tissue remains undamaged contact oil resin thoroughly washed skin rash contagious urushiol always spread bonded skin transferred urushiol washed away although simple skin exposure common ingestion urushiol lead serious systemic reactions burning plant material commonly said create urushiolladen smoke causes systemic reaction well rash throat eyes firefighters often get rashes eye

bound skin proteins attacking cells foreign bodies treatment consists two phases stopping urushiol contact causing reaction must done within later reducing pain primary treatment involves washing exposed skin thoroughly soap cool water friction soon possible exposure soap detergent necessary urushiol oil friction washcloth something similar necessary urushiol adheres strongly removal preparations available areas poison ivy grows usually contain surfactants nonionic detergent triton solubilize urushiol products also contain abrasives us food drug administration recommends applying wet compress soaking affected area cool water topical corticosteroids available overthecounter oral corticosteroids available prescription topical skin protectants zinc acetate zinc carbonate zinc oxide calamine baking soda colloidal oatmeal relieve minor irritation itching aluminium triacetate sometimes known burows solution also ease showers compresses using hot scalding water relieve itching several hours though also taxes skins integrity opening pores generally making vulnerable useful secondary treatment cleaning urushiol skin done cold people prior systemic reaction may able prevent subsequent exposure turning systemic avoiding heat excitation circulatory system applying moderate cold infected skin biting pain cases extreme symptoms steroids prednisone triamcinolone dexamethasone sometimes administered attenuate immune response prevent longterm skin damage especially eyes involved prednisone commonly prescribed systemic treatment cause serious adrenal suppression must taken carefully tapered bacterial secondary infection affected areas occurs antibiotics may also necessary scrubbing plain soap cold water remove urushiol skin done within minutes rarely cited doubleblind
