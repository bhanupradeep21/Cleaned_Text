amargasaurus small sauropod measuring meters feet length weighing approximately metric tons short followed typical sauropod body plan long tail neck small head barrelshaped trunk supported four

elongated bifurcated vertebral spines remain salgado bonaparte suggested spines represented defense weapons predators arguing tapered towards tips also could served display perhaps courtship intimidate subsequently published life restorations showed double row spines supporting two parallel skin sails gregory paul considered possibility unlikely noting neck sails would reduced neck flexion spines circular crosssection rather flattened case sailbearing animals instead found shape indicates spines supported keratinous sheath would extended length spines life spines could used display weapons predators members species animal might able point anterior spines forward bending neck also hypothesized spines could clattered together generate keratinous sheaths covering spines also shown skeletal restoration published jack bailey argued spines resembled sailbearing pelycosaurs like dimetrodon according author amargasaurus might also possessed sail might used display unlike pelycosaurs neural spines amargasaurus bifurcated forming double row along neck back space rows merely cm inches existence two parallel sails seems unlikely instead bailey suggested spines represented scaffold completely enveloped single skin neural spines penultimate dorsal vertebra foremost tail vertebrae also strongly elongated different structure forming single row paddleshaped projections according bailey projections resembled modern humped ungulates bison indicating presence fleshy hump hips bailey suggested similar humps dinosaurs strongly elongated neural spines spinosaurus daniela schwarz colleagues concluded bifurcated neural spines diplodocids dicraeosaurids enclosed air sac would connected lungs part respiratory system dicraeosaurus air sac socalled supravertebral diverticulum would rested top neural arch filled entire space spines amargasaurus upper twothirds spines would covered sheath keratin restricting air sac space lower onethird spines cover either keratin skin indicated striations surface spines similar bony horn cores todays mark hallett mathew wedel suggested backwardsdirected spines might able skewer predators neck abruptly drawn backwards attack similar defense strategy found todays giant sable antelope arabian oryx use long backwards directed horns stab attacking lions apart possible function defense spines may used display either intimidation rivaling individuals hallett wedel also hypothesized rival males might interlocked spines neck pablo gallina colleagues described closely related bajadasaurus neural spines similar amargasaurus suggested genera employed defense defense function would especially effective bajadasaurus spines directed forwards would reached past tip snout deterring predators keratinous sheath likely covered spines might extended length seen modern eventoed ungulates extended sheaths would made delicate spines resistant critical threat bases spines form roof spinal detailed study ignacio cerda colleagues analyzing structure morphology microanatomy vertebral spines amargasaurus indeterminate dicraeosaurid also la amarga formation suggested spines covered keratinous sheath previously

amargasaurus quadrupedal moved four legs probably unable rear hind salgado bonaparte suggested amargasaurus slow walker forearms lower legs proportionally short feature common slowmoving contradicted gerardo mazzetta richard fariña argued amargasaurus capable rapid locomotion locomotion leg bones strongly affected bending moments representing limiting factor maximum speed animal leg bones
