california oregon recently become known rejection sexual selection theistic evolutionism work holobiont evolution roughgarden born paterson new jersey united states received bachelor science biology distinction phi beta kappa bachelor arts philosophy highest honors university rochester later phd biology harvard university roughgarden came transgender changed name joan making coming post website roughgarden worked instructor assistant professor biology university massachusetts boston joined faculty department biology stanford university becoming full professor retired became emeritus professor founded directed earth systems program stanford received awards service undergraduate education moved hawaii became adjunct professor hawaiʻi institute marine biology academic career roughgarden advised phd students postdoctoral roughgarden authored books scientific articles addition textbook ecological evolutionary theory roughgarden carried ecological field studies caribbean lizards barnacles larvae along california coast wrote fiction novel sciencefiction retelling ramayana roughgardens early work helped develop anolis lizards caribbean important model system evolution ecology example used twospecies enclosure experiments two caribbean islands demonstrate increasing strength interspecific competition resource partitioning central tenet competition theory anolis system thus provided early example ecoevolutionary development jonathan losos others become important example adaptive radiation setting lab hopkins marine station roughgarden sought extend approach combining theoretical field research studying intertidal acorn barnacles balanus chthamalus spp earlier work joseph connell bob paine others suggested characteristic zonation rocky intertidal communities predominantly structured example pisaster seastars wherein dominant balanus species displaced chthamalus species high intertidal zones together student steve gaines roughgarden showed interspecific interactions important intertidal localities communities high density barnacles connell others studied hopkins central california however barnacle density lower amount free space best explained periodic pulses larval student sean connolly showed empirical observation modeling latitudinal gradient upwelling along west coast north america created dense barnacle recruitment north oregon washington upwelling weak sparse barnacle recruitment south california upwelling turn explained field studies north found interspecific interactions important field studies south found larval recruitment important structuring intertidal deft synthesis helped drive paradigm shift marine ecology emphasized larval dispersal recruitment dynamics adult interactions favored demographic models populations open larval recruits distant localities dominated field around time transition roughgarden began shift research focus darwin theory sexual selection book evolution roughgarden analyzes biology influence human sexuality gender identity explores substantial diversity mating systems sexuality throughout animal kingdom eye toward understanding human sexual categories like gay lesbian trans book articles around time offered criticism sexual selection providing examples species depart predictions homosexual behavior bonobos elephants lizards well highlighting contradictions population genetic theory sexual selection theory also provided beginnings alternative theory sexual selection called social selection describes focused natural selection based differential offspring production sexual selection focused differential mating success article journal science student erol akçay meeko oishi formally presented theory social selection terms game beyond nash competitive equilibrium nce imported evolutionary biology john maynard smith evolutionary stable strategy roughgarden et al discuss nash bargaining solution nbs exists alternative nce reached negotiation playing developmental time opposed evolutionary time game player stands lose individual fitness nce relative competitor may establish threat point promising play suboptimal strategy negotiation example via side payment players arrive nbs playing mixed strategies across repeated games thereby maximizes fitness cooperative team consists players rather one player roughgarden et al provide several examples cooperative game play would look like nature define evolutionary theory social selection one considers cooperative team games developmental tier primitive state sexual conflict derived state argue social selection theory mutually exclusive evolutionary theory sexual selection treats sexual conflict primitive state sexual cooperation derived following science paper forty scientists produced ten critical stating article misleading contained misunderstandings misrepresentations sexual selection accounted data presented subsumed roughgardens theoretical analysis sexual selection explained data theory could troy day stated many people felt completely shoddy science poor scholarship motivated personal roughgarden stated altogether surprised volume dissent theory extension sexual selection tim cluttonbrock oxford university wrote detailed rebuttal science concedes point males engage sexual selection females even species operational sex ratio biased towards males stating consequently satisfactory explanations evolution sex differences requires understanding operation sexual selection females well nevertheless cluttonbrock concludes sexual selection robust theoretical framework without ever addressing theoretical distinction polarity intersexual cooperation conflict highlighted roughgarden et book genial roughgarden continues build case sexual selection theory present social selection theory alternative book titled response popular book selfish gene richard expounds roughgarden describes neospencerian view nature red tooth claw competition conflict dominate genial gene initial section defining attacking sexual selection followed definition social selection one based differences offspringproduction rather differences mating success second section focused genetic basis social selection first chapter addresses sexual reproduction evolved first place makes case roughgarden portfolio hypothesis emphasizes sexual reproduction creates genetic diversity recombination opposed commonly favored muller ratchet emphasizes sex removes deleterious mutations recombination second chapter explains binary distribution gamete types sperm vs egg strategy maximize gametic contact rather result conflicting gametic strategies final chapter argues hermaphroditism rather gonochorism primitive state sexuality third section takes twotier approach developing social selection theory behavioral tier focuses game theory nash bargaining solutions outlined second population genetic tier described operates result many replays behavioral tier book concludes listing phenomena according roughgarden explained differently sexual selection theory better explained social selection theory says sexual selection theory derives view natural behavior predicated selfishgene concept competition deception whereas socialselection theory derives teamwork honesty genetic equality continued study social selection opposed sexual selection important driver evolution colonial species corals perhaps roughgardens criticism sexual selection rejected scientific community papers received citations scientific interview stated biologists remain defensive sexual selection theory roughgarden funded catalysis meeting national evolutionary synthesis center goal debating reviewing status sexual selection studies indicate challenges future group struggled come consensus definition sexual selection subgroup offered definition first time explicitly differentiated fecundity selection sexual selection sensu roughgarden written relationship christianity book evolution christian faith reflections evolutionary biologist presents scripture passages emphasize belief bible conflict evolutionary biology relates christianity evolution asserting life interconnected members faith community connected roughgarden opposes creationism intelligent design asserts belief gods involvement speaker beyond belief symposium professor emerita dr roughgarden turned attention emerging concept holobiont defined animal plant host together microbes living exosymbionts endosymbionts concept originated increasing recognition rise second thirdgeneration dna sequencing methods allow microbial communities ie microbiome host examined close association microbiome host led suggest holobiont may evolutionary unit selection combination host genes microbiome produce extended genome hologenome however hologenome concept criticized grounds microbiomes usually vertically transmitted parent thereby violating commonly thought one key principles natural selection variation inherited mendelian fashion together proponents holobiont concept roughgarden wrote review examined evidence holobiont biological entity considered tight integration physiological developmental reproductive even immunological components host microbial symbionts provide foundation concept example mammalian mothers milk contains sugars appear benefit microbial symbionts metabolized also cite horizontal acquisition dna coding protein allows formation placenta key step evolution placental mammals also demonstrates adaptive evolution holobiont roughgarden begins sketch population genetic model holobiont evolution containing host species single microbial symbiont selection based number copies symbiont genome acquired host model contains three sequential processes per generation microbes move hosts proliferate within hosts holobionts survive perish dependent number symbionts acquired model enough show vertical transmission deleterious symbiont reduce number holobionts symbionts beneficial symbiont tend increase sizes groups however horizontal transmission binds collection microbiomes unified system metacommunity rather collection independent communities roughgarden followed review two fleshed model holobiont evolution showed microbes colonize hosts following poisson distribution horizontal transmission still lead holobiont evolution beneficial symbionts increase success hosts thus flood microbial source pool converse case parasitic microbes also holds true calls phenomenon collective inheritance opposed lineal mendelian inheritance second adds second microbial species model well colonization parameter partially determines poisson rate parameter parameter approximates density symbiont strain around host host selectivity symbiont species depending context microbial colonization host follows poisson distribution hardyweinberg analog directional selection tends diffuse expectated vertical transmission reasons twomicrobe model host likely use antibodies probodies modulate microbial species effect orchestrating things microbes provide minimum amount altruism toward host allowed remain symbiosis host microbe standpoint species provide minimum amount altruism clear host threshold tend outcompete provide carefully demonstrates hostorchestrated species selection process conceptually distinct coevolution multilevel selection predict explain tight integration
