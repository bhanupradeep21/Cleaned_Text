theropods acrocanthosaurus forelimbs make contact ground used locomotion instead served predatory function discovery complete forelimb ncsm allowed first analysis function range motion forelimb study examined bone surfaces would articulated bones determine far joints could move without dislocating many joints bones fit together exactly indicating presence considerable amount cartilage joints seen many living archosaurs among findings study suggested resting position forelimbs would hung shoulders humerus angled backward slightly elbow bent claws facing medially shoulder acrocanthosaurus limited range motion compared humans arm could swing complete circle could retract swing backward vertical humerus could actually angled slightly upwards protraction swinging forward limited past vertical arm unable reach vertical position adducting swinging downwards could abduct swing upwards horizontal movement elbow also limited compared humans total range motion arm could completely extend straighten could flex bend far humerus unable even form right angle forearm radius ulna forearm bones locked together possibility pronation supination twisting human none carpals wrist bones fit together precisely suggesting presence large amount cartilage wrist would stiffened digits able hyperextend bend backward nearly touched wrist flexed middle digit would converge towards first digit third digit would twist inwards first digit hand bore largest claw permanently flexed curved back towards underside hand likewise middle claw may permanently flexed third claw also smallest able flex determining ranges motion joints forelimb study went hypothesize predatory habits acrocanthosaurus forelimbs could swing forward far unable even scratch animals neck therefore likely used initial capture prey acrocanthosaurus probably led mouth hunting hand forelimbs able retract towards body strongly prey seized jaws heavily muscled forelimbs may retracted holding prey tightly body preventing escape prey animal attempted pull away would impaled permanently flexed claws first two digits extreme hyperextensibility digits may adaptation allowing acrocanthosaurus hold struggling prey without fear dislocation prey trapped body acrocanthosaurus may dispatched jaws another possibility acrocanthosaurus held prey jaws repeatedly retracting forelimbs tearing large gashes less probable theories suggested forelimb range motion able grasp onto side sauropod clinging topple sauropods smaller stature though unlikely due acrocanthosaurus rather robust leg structure compared similarly structured theropods scientists reconstructed endocast replica acrocanthosaurus cranial cavity using computed tomography ct scanning analyze spaces within holotype braincase omnh life much space would filled meninges cerebrospinal fluid addition brain however general features brain cranial nerves could determined endocast compared theropods endocasts created brain similar many theropods similar allosauroids resembles brains carcharodontosaurus giganotosaurus rather allosaurus sinraptor providing support hypothesis acrocanthosaurus brain slightly sigmoidal sshaped without much expansion

preserves many dinosaur footprints including large threetoed theropod famous trackways discovered along paluxy river dinosaur valley state park section exhibit american museum natural history new york

cloverly formation northcentral wyoming possibly even arundel formation maryland geological formations dated radiometrically scientists used biostratigraphy estimate age based changes ammonite taxa boundary aptian albian stages early cretaceous located within glen rose formation texas may contain acrocanthosaurus footprints lies twin mountains formation indicates twin mountains formation lies entirely within aptian stage lasted million years antlers formation contains fossils deinonychus tenontosaurus two dinosaur genera also found cloverly formation radiometrically dated aptian albian stages suggesting similar age therefore acrocanthosaurus likely existed million years time area preserved twin mountains antlers formations large floodplain drained shallow inland sea million years later sea would expand north becoming western interior seaway dividing north america two nearly entire late cretaceous glen rose formation represents coastal environment possible acrocanthosaurus
