gene doping hypothetical nontherapeutic use gene therapy athletes order improve performance sporting events prohibit applications genetic modification reasons treatment disease april evidence gene doping used athletic performanceenhancement sporting gene doping would involve use gene transfer increase decrease gene expression protein biosynthesis specific human protein could done directly injecting gene carrier person taking cells person transfecting cells administering cells back historical development interest gene doping athletes concern risks gene doping detect moved parallel development field gene therapy especially publication work transgenic mouse overexpressing insulinlike growth factor much stronger normal mice even old age preclinical studies published way deliver erythropoietin epo via gene therapy publication creation marathon mouse much greater endurance normal mice created delivering gene expressing ppar gamma mice scientists generating publications contacted directly athletes coaches seeking access technology public became aware activity efforts part evidence presented trial german coach scientists well bodies including world antidoping agency wada international olympic committee american association advancement science started discussing risk gene doping wada added gene doping list banned doping practices shortly thereafter began funding research methods detect gene doping genetic enhancement includes manipulation genes gene transfer healthy athletes purpose physically improving performance genetic enhancement includes gene doping potential abuse among athletes opening door political ethical history concern potential gene doping follows history gene therapy medical use genes treat diseases first clinically tested interest athletic community especially spurred creation university lab mighty mouse created administering virus carrying gene expressing insulinlike growth factor mice mice stronger remained strong even aged without lab seeking treatments muscle wasting diseases work made public lab inundated calls athletes seeking treatment one coach offering whole scientist told new york times quite surprised must admit people would try entice saying things like itll help advance research offered pay also told times every time similar research published gets calls explains even treatment became ready use people would take years would serious risks including death also said even explains athletes still want field gene therapy set back jesse gelsinger died gene therapy clinical trial suffering massive inflammatory reaction led regulatory authorities us europe increase safety requirements clinical trials even beyond initial restrictions put place beginning biotechnology era deal risks recombinant june theodore friedmann one pioneers gene therapy johann olav koss olympic gold medallist speed skating published paper first public warning gene also june gene therapy working group convened medical commission international olympic committee noted aware potential abuse gene therapy medicines shall begin establish procedures stateoftheart testing methods identifying athletes might misuse research published preclinical gene therapy called repoxygen delivered gene encoding erythropoietin epo potential treatment scientists company also received calls athletes year world antidoping agency held first meeting discuss risk gene us presidents council bioethics discussed gene doping context human enhancement several field gene therapy took step forward step back first gene therapy drug approved gendicine approved china treatment certain children france seemingly effective treated gene therapy severe combined immunodeficiency nonhuman began developing balco scandal became public chemists trainers athletes conspired evade doping controls new undetectable doping world doping agency proactively added gene doping list banned doping also symposium convened american association advancement science focused research published showing mice given gene therapy coding protein called ppar gamma double endurance untreated mice dubbed marathon mice scientists received calls athletes also world antidoping agency began fund research detect gene doping formed permanent expert panel advise risks guide interest athletes gene doping received widespread media coverage due mention trial german coach accused found guilty giving athletes performance enhancing drugs without knowledge email coach attempted obtain repoxygen read open court first public disclosure athletes interested gene second gene therapy drug approved neovasculgen delivers gene encoding vegf approved russia treat peripheral artery glybera treatment rare inherited disorder became first treatment approved clinical use either europe united field gene therapy developed risk gene doping becoming reality increased numerous genes interest agents gene include erythropoietin insulinlike growth factor human growth hormone myostatin vascular endothelial growth factor fibroblast growth factor endorphin enkephalin risks gene doping would similar gene therapy immune reaction native protein leading equivalent genetic disease massive inflammatory response cancer death cases risks would undertaken shortterm gain opposed treating serious found skeletal muscle humans identified several genetic studies different polymorphism worldclass athletes compared normal people one form causes gene make protein found sprinters related increased power another form causes gene make less protein found endurance gene doping agents could designed either polymorphism endurance athletes dna construct interfered expression like small interfering myostatin protein responsible inhibiting muscle differentiation growth removing myostatin gene otherwise limiting expression leads increase muscle size demonstrated knockout mice lacking gene dubbed schwarzenegger humans born defective genes also serve knockout models german boy mutation copies myostatin gene born welldeveloped advanced muscle growth continued birth boy could lift weights kg age work published scientists administered follistatin via gene therapy quadriceps nonhuman primates resulting local muscle growth similar erythropoietin glycoprotein acts hormone controlling red blood cell production athletes injected epo protein performanceenhancing substance many years blood doping additional epo increases production red blood cells circulation increases amount oxygen available muscle enhancing athletes recent studies suggest may possible introduce another epo gene animal order increase epo production epo genes successfully inserted mice monkeys found increase hematocrits much percent however endogenous transgene derived epo elicited autoimmune responses animals form severe insulinlike growth factor protein involved mediation growth hormone administration mice resulted muscle growth quicker muscle nerve athletes use sustained production could cause heart disease modulating levels proteins affect psychology also potential goals gene doping example pain perception depends endorphins enkephalins response stress depends bdnf increase synthesis monamines could improve mood preproenkephalin administered via gene therapy using replicationdeficient herpes simplex virus targets nerves mice results good enough justify phase clinical trial people terminal cancer uncontrolled adopting approach athletes would problematic since pain deadening would likely vegf tested clinical trials increase blood flow considered potential gene doping agent however long term follow clinical trial subjects showed poor true fibroblast growth glucagonlike increases amount glucose liver administered via gene therapy livers mouse models diabetes shown increase gluconeogenesis athletes would make energy available reduce buildup lactic world antidoping agency wada main regulatory organization looking issue detection gene direct indirect testing methods researched organization directly detecting use gene therapy usually requires discovery recombinant proteins gene insertion vectors indirect methods involve examining athlete attempt detect bodily changes structural differences endogenous recombinant indirect methods nature subjective becomes difficult determine anomalies proof gene doping simply natural though unusual biological example eero mäntyranta olympic cross country skier mutation made body produce abnormally high amounts red blood cells would difficult determine whether mäntyrantas red blood cell levels due innate genetic advantage artificial gene doping detection idea started wada put gene doping banned list started investigating new method detect inserted transgenes first generation gene doping detection techniques used pcr tests targets transgenes sequences obtained blood sample contain endogenous transgene dna since small amount transgene leak bloodstream easily distinguished endogenous dna lacks introns since transgene likely use cdna obtained reverse transcriptase rna removed intones though rna splicing leaving exonexon junction include coding sequences important sequences like promoters since viral victors limited capacity therefore pcr target exonexon junctions unique sequence present pcr many applications molecular biology field including dna analysis main purpose pcr amplify double dna sequences exponentially gene doping detection sequence started amplify producing exponential graph test positive indicates presence gene sample obtained person sequence didnt amplify linear graph produced test said negative targeted dna sequence present persons limitation firstgeneration detection methods important develop new method overcomes previous failures high accuracy detect manipulation dna sequences could evade detected pcr methods solution using next generation sequencing ngs method determine nucleotide orders whole genome targets exonexon junctions transgene compare reference gene sequence method fast accurate getting cheaper time opened new field science wasnt possible like sequencing whole genome dna sequencing established twodimensional chromatography kept improving completion human genome project costed three billion dollars required years finish sequencing whole genome however nowadays sequencing technology whole genome sequencing wgs takes single day costs around thousand dollars moreover new sequencing technology development cost dollars many ngs techniques used dna sequencing used method one done review found dna polymorphisms identified literature related aspect athletic performance related endurance related power replicated three studies six identified genomewide association studies replicated least one replicated markers six gwas
