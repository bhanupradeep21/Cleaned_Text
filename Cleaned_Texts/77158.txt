anemia anaemia british english blood disorder blood reduced ability carry oxygen due lower normal number red blood cells reduction amount hemoglobin hemoglobin name derived ancient greek ἀναιμία anaimia meaning lack blood ἀν αἷμα haima anemia comes slowly symptoms often vague tiredness weakness shortness breath headaches reduced ability anemia acute symptoms may include confusion feeling like one going pass loss consciousness increased anemia must significant person becomes noticeably symptoms anemia depend quickly hemoglobin additional symptoms may occur depending underlying preoperative anemia increase risk needing blood transfusion following anemia temporary long term range mild anemia caused blood loss decreased red blood cell production increased red blood cell causes bleeding include bleeding due inflammation stomach intestines bleeding surgery serious injury blood causes decreased production include iron deficiency vitamin deficiency thalassemia number bone marrow causes increased breakdown include genetic disorders sickle cell anemia infections malaria certain autoimmune anemia also classified based size red blood cells amount hemoglobin cells small called microcytic anemia large called macrocytic anemia normal sized called normocytic diagnosis anemia men based hemoglobin less gl gdl women less gl testing required determine large number patients diagnosed anemia chronic disease present active inflammation dietary issues include many reduced limb loading spinal cord injured patients astronauts elderly people limited mobility bedbound experimental bedrest certain groups individuals pregnant women benefit use iron pills dietary supplementation without determining specific cause use blood transfusions typically based persons signs without symptoms

blood loss fluid overload hypervolemia several may interplay cause anemia common cause anemia blood loss usually cause lasting symptoms unless relatively impaired rbc production develops turn commonly iron anemias increased red blood cell destruction generally classified hemolytic anemias types generally feature jaundice elevated levels lactate roots words anemia ischemia refer basic idea lack blood anemia ischemia thing modern medical terminology word anemia used alone implies widespread effects blood either scarce eg blood loss dysfunctional oxygensupplying ability due whatever type hemoglobin erythrocyte problem contrast word ischemia refers solely lack blood poor perfusion thus ischemia body part cause localized anemic effects within fluid overload hypervolemia causes decreased hemoglobin concentration apparent certain gastrointestinal disorders cause anemia mechanisms involved multifactorial limited malabsorption mainly related chronic intestinal inflammation causes dysregulation hepcidin leads decreased access iron number definitions anemia reviews provide comparison contrast strict broad definition absolute decrease red blood cell however broader definition lowered ability blood carry operational definition decrease wholeblood hemoglobin concentration standard deviations mean age sexmatched reference difficult directly measure rbc hematocrit amount rbcs
