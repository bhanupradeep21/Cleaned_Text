seven caudal vertebrae five haemal arches nearly complete pelvis left according research team discovered taxon genus name dreadnoughtus alludes gigantic body size taxon presumably rendered healthy adult individuals nearly impervious attack two argentine dreadnoughts served first half twentieth century rivadavia moreno thus genus name also honors country dreadnoughtus schrani discovered name type species schrani given recognition american entrepreneur adam schran financial support researchers described dreadnoughtus schrani estimated weight using equation campione evans allows body mass quadrupedal animal estimated based circumference humerus femur using scaling equation concluded dreadnoughtus type specimen weighed tonnes long tons short comparison would mean schrani weighed eight half times much male african elephant even exceeded boeing airliner several large mass estimate quickly criticized svpow web blog sauropod researcher matt wedel used volumetric models based published figures yielded estimates tonnes long tons short even low approximately tonnes long tons short tons based shorter researcher gregory paul posted response lacovara et al pointing error margins using equations based limb bones large using equation dreadnoughtus type specimen could anywhere tonnes long tons short tons using volumetric techniques based accurate skeletal restoration paul estimated low tonnes long tons short benson et al suggested maximum body mass metric tons short estimates questioned due large error range lack formal reevaluation animals weight published june research team led karl bates compared simple scaling equation results results found using volumebased digital model various amounts soft tissue empty space respiratory system found model using scalebased weight estimate would meant animal impossible amount bulk fat skin muscle etc layered onto skeleton compared schrani volumetric model sauropods complete skeletons better understood mass estimates conclude schrani type specimen must weighed range tonnes long tons short ullmann lacovara disputes methods used bates et al arguing new study treats dreadnoughtus exception wellestablished mass estimate methods proven living animals limb bones would unnecessarily large new mass estimates considering argument ullmann lacovara gregory paul moderated mass estimate dreadnoughtus type specimen metric tons short tons slightly higher previous estimation even noted holotype may heavier tonne two studies estimated mass dreadnoughtus much higher metric tons short discovery dreadnoughtus schrani provides insight size anatomy giant titanosaurian sauropods especially limbs shoulder hip girdles majority schrani bones well preserved minimal deformation especially limb bones fine features locations muscle attachment frequently clearly visible dreadnoughtus also unusually long neck body size making almost half animals length estimates based measurements known parts skeleton suggest known individual dreadnoughtus schrani approximately metres ft long stood stories scapula longer known titanosaur shoulder ilium top bone pelvis also larger measuring forearm longer previously known titanosaur shorter long forearms brachiosaurids inclined body preserves longer humerus upper arm bone although species likely slightly different body proportions measurements demonstrate massive nature dreadnoughtus estimated mass type specimen metric tons short completeness may assessed different ways sauropod dinosaur skeletons often recovered little skull material completeness often looked terms postcranial completeness ie completeness skeleton excluding skull completeness may also assessed terms numbers bones versus types bones important metric understanding anatomy fossil animal types bones completeness statistics dreadnoughtus schrani follows completeness schrani compared extremely massive metric tons sauropods thus skeleton schrani substantially complete extremely massive metric tons schroeter colleagues discovered soft tissues collagens holotype specimen noted possibility individual holotype specimen belongs may trapped rapid burial event may explain holotype schrani completely preserved titanosaurs called widegauge posture relative term describe stance feet fell apart body midline derived titanosaurs greater degree widegauge limbs held widely ancestors contemporaneous counterparts stance dreadnoughtus schrani clearly widegauge degree saltasaurids femoral condyles perpendicular shaft rather fact head femur turned towards body support phylogenetic conclusion dreadnoughtus saltasaurid animals broad sternal bones also demonstrate wide pectoral girdle giving broadshouldered broadchested appearance paleontologist kenneth lacovara compared animals gait imperial although forelimbs schrani longer previously known titanosaur significantly longer hind therefore lacovara et al reconstructed neck held horizontally rather anteriorly inclined manner tail dreadnoughtus schrani several characteristic features included diagnosis species first vertebra tail ridge ventral surface called keel first third tail bases neural spines extensively subdivided cavities caused contact air sacs part dinosaurs respiratory system addition anterior posterior boundaries neural spines distinct ridges pre postspinal laminae connecting pre postzygapophyses articulation points neural arches middle tail vertebrae triangular process extends centrum towards preceding like modern archosaurs tails crocodilians schrani bones vertebrae called chevrons haemel arches bones connect ventral surface vertebrae shaped viewed anteriorly dreadnoughtus schrani bottom stem broadly expanded likely attachment shoulder girdle forelimb schrani also exhibit unique features oblique ridge crosses interior face scapular blade extending top side near far end blade bottom side near base scapular blade finally end radius exhibits unique form top proximal end distinct concave embayment posterior face bottom distal end nearly square shape instead broadly based cladistic analysis dreadnoughtus schrani appears derived basal titanosaur quite lacovara et al note wide array relatively advanced primitive features skeleton dreadnoughtus schrani current instability titanosaurian interrelationships future analyses may find widely differing positions within titanosauria camarasauridae europasaurus euhelopus brachiosauridae andesaurus argentinosaurus futalognkosaurus dreadnoughtus malawisaurus rapetosaurus isisaurus alamosaurus opisthocoelicaudia neuquensaurus saltasaurus however subsequent analysis limb bones ullman lacovara found dreadnoughtus possessed many characteristics lithostrotians particular shares number traits aeolosaurus gondwanatitan collectively may indicate actually lithostrotian closely related aeolosauridae new phylogenetic analysis conducted suggested future cladistic analyses investigate relationships dreadnoughtus aeolosaurus holotype specimen likely fully grown died histology holotype humerus shows lack external fundamental system outer layer bone found fullygrown vertebrates abundant fastdeposited stillgrowing woven tissue primary fibrolamellar bone outer bone cortex led lacovara et al determine specimen still growing remains unknown large individual would grown died based sedimentary deposits site two dreadnoughtus schrani specimens appear buried quickly fluvial avulsion event break levee resulting flood event generated liquefacted crevasse splay deposit entombed two dinosaurs thus rapid relatively deep burial dreadnoughtus type specimen accounts extraordinary completeness numerous small theropod teeth found amongst bones likely evidence scavenging likely perhaps orkoraptor
