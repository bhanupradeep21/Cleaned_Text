neuroimaging medical technique allows doctors researchers take pictures inner workings body brain patient show areas heightened activity areas high low blood flow structure patients brainbody well certain abnormalities neuroimaging often used find specific location certain diseases birth defects tumors cancers clogged arteries neuroimaging first came medical technique invention human circulation balance since lead inventions xray air ventriculography cerebral angiography petspect scans magnetoencephalography xenon ct scanning human circulation balance noninvasive way measure blood flow brain mental technique worked placing patients table supported fulcrum allowing table sway depending activity levels patients exposed cognitively complex stimuli table would sway towards invented angelo mosso human circulation balance said first technique neuroimaging created mosso known year wilhelm roentgen developed first radiograph commonly known roentgen awarded nobel peace prize discovery immediately release xray machines manufactured used worldwide however first step development neuroimaging brain almost entirely composed soft tissue radioopaque meaning remains essentially invisible ordinary plain xray examinations also true brain abnormalities though exceptions example calcified tumor egmeningioma craniopharyngioma types glioma easily seen combat neurosurgeon walter dandy developed technique called air ventriculography method injected filtered air directly lateral ventricles better take pictures ventricle systems thanks local anesthetics painful procedure significantly risky hemorrhage severe infection extreme changes intrarenal pressure threats procedure despite dandy stop proceeded discover encephalography medical procedure used record brains electrical method involved attaching sensors brain detect measure brains electrical signals signals translated visual showing brains activity patterns early advances neuroimaging beginning used diagnose conditions epilepsy brain injuries sleep disorders providing invaluable information brain function would one day added upon devolvement modern neuroimaging introduced cerebral angiography enabled doctors accurately detect diagnose anomalies brain tumors internal carotid artery occlusions course year egas moniz inventor cerebral angiography ran experiments various dye solution percentages injected arteries help better visualize blood vessels brain discovering solution consisting sodium iodide safest patients well effective visualization blood vessels arteries within positron emission tomography pet scan scan shows areas high activity body way works patient first given radioactive substance called tracer via injection hand arm tracer circulates body attaches specific substance organ tissue produces metabolism glucose result positrons created positrons scanned pet camera scanned computer produces either image activity occurring within organ idea pet scan originally proposed william sweet first fullbody pet scanner wasnt actually developed michael similarly singlephoton emission computed tomography scan spect scan also works scanning tracer within patient difference however spect directly scans gamma rays tracer attaches rather positrons pet scans result images spect scan creates clear images produced pet scan typically cheaper procedure spect developed david kuhl kuhl also helped set foundation would lead pet magnetoencephalography meg technique looks regions activity brain detecting large groups electrically charged ions moving originally developed physicist david cohen early noninvasive order noninvasive meg designed like giant helmet patient would put head inside turned would read electromagnetic pulses coming brain later cohen invented squid superconducting quantum interference device gave meg ability detect extremely small changes ions magnetic fields xenon computed tomography modern scanning technique reveals flow blood areas brain scan tests consistent sufficient blood flow areas brain patients breathe xenon gas contrast agent show areas high low blood flow although many trial scans tests ran development process computed tomography british biomedical engineer godfrey hounsfield founder technique invented first ct scanner nobel prize however adoption scanners united states didnt occur six years later regardless ct scanner already gaining notable reputation popularity beforehand shortly initial development ct magnetic resonance imaging mri mr scanning developed rather using ionizing xradiation mri uses variation signals produced protons body head placed strong magnetic field associated early application basic technique human body names jackson damadian abe paul lauterburin lauterbur sir peter mansfield awarded nobel prize physiology medicine discoveries concerning mri first structural imaging benefited functional imaging introduction mri veritable explosion technical refinements diagnostic mr applications took place enabling even neurological tyros diagnose brain pathology would elusive incapable demonstration living person decade two httpsenwikipediaorgwikihistoryofneuroimaging
