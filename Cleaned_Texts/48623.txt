orexin ɒˈrɛksɪn also known hypocretin neuropeptide regulates arousal wakefulness common form narcolepsy type individual experiences brief losses muscle tone drop attacks cataplexy caused lack orexin brain due destruction cells produce exists forms orexina orexinb orexinproducing neurons human located predominantly perifornical area lateral project widely throughout central nervous system regulating wakefulness feeding two types orexin peptide two types orexin orexin discovered almost simultaneously two independent groups researchers working rat one group named orexin orexis meaning appetite greek group named hypocretin produced hypothalamus bears weak resemblance secretin another officially hypocretin hcrt used refer genes transcripts orexin used refer encoded considerable

international union basic clinical two types orexin orexina orexinb excitatory neuropeptides approximately sequence identity produced cleavage single precursor precursor protein known preproorexin preprohypocretin amino acid prepropeptide encoded gene hrct located chromosome orexina amino acid residues long two intrachain disulfide bonds orexinb linear amino acid residue although peptides produced small population cells lateral posterior hypothalamus send projections throughout brain orexin peptides bind two gprotein coupled orexin receptors orexina binding approximately equal affinity orexinb binds mainly times less potent orexins strongly conserved peptides found major classes orexin system initially suggested primarily involved stimulation food intake based finding central administration orexina b increased food intake addition stimulates wakefulness regulates energy expenditure modulates visceral function orexin system hypothesized function exciting neurons produce neurotransmitters locus coeruleus well inhibiting neurons ventrolateral preoptic nucleus region brain whos neuronal activity imperative proper sleep many studies support orexin neurons regulate brown adipose tissue bat activity via sympathetic nervous system enhance energy although orexin knockout mice reported show maldevelopment brown adipose tissue subsequent report shown normal development orexin seems promote wakefulness studies indicate major role orexin system integrate metabolic circadian sleep debt influences determine whether animal asleep awake active orexin neurons strongly excite various brain nuclei important roles wakefulness including dopamine norepinephrine histamine acetylcholine appear play important role stabilizing wakefulness sleep discovery orexin receptor mutation causes sleep disorder canine doberman pinschers subsequently indicated major role system sleep regulation genetic knockout mice lacking gene orexin also reported exhibit transitioning frequently rapidly sleep wakefulness mice display many symptoms narcolepsy researchers using animal model narcolepsy study narcolepsy results excessive daytime sleepiness inability consolidate wakefulness day sleep night cataplexy loss muscle tone response strong usually positive emotions dogs lack functional receptor orexin narcolepsy animals people lacking orexin neuropeptide also narcolepsy organisms narcolepsy also found experience rem sleep time day suggesting alteration function rem sleep lead hypnagogic hallucinations hallucinations occur organism goes central administration orexina strongly promotes wakefulness increases body temperature locomotion elicits strong increase energy expenditure sleep deprivation also increases orexina transmission orexin system may thus important regulation energy expenditure regulation food intake fact orexindeficient people narcolepsy increased obesity rather decreased bmi would expected orexin primarily appetite

narcolepsy associated specific variant human leukocyte antigen hla furthermore genomewide analysis shows addition hla variant people narcolepsy also exhibit specific genetic mutation tcell receptor alpha conjunction genetic anomalies cause immune system attack kill critical orexin neurons hence absence orexinproducing neurons people narcolepsy may result autoimmune orexin increases craving food correlates function substances promote production orexin also shown increase meal size suppressing inhibitory postingestive however studies suggest stimulatory effects orexin feeding may due general arousal without necessarily increasing overall food review findings suggest hyperglycemia occurs mice due habitual highfat diet leads reduction signalling orexin orexin receptors may future
