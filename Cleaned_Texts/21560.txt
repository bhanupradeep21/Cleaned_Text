measurable effect whole organ transplantation increasing life expectancy patient hla similarity therefore relevant factor choosing donors tissue organ transplant especially important pancreas kidney transplants due inherited nature hla genes family members likely histocompatible odds sibling received haplotypes parents chance sibling would share one haplotype chance would share neither however variability due crossing haplotypes may rearrange generations siblings may intermediate degree histocompatibility required dependent individual factors including type tissue organ medical condition recipient whole organ transplants successful unmatched individuals increased histocompatibility lowers rates rejection result longer lifespans overall lower associated hospital impact hla matching differs even among whole organ transplants studies reporting less importance liver transplants compared heart lung comparison hematopoietic stem cell transplants often require higher degrees matching

thus histocompatibility factor individual factors age sometimes factors matching protocol immune response older transplant patients towards mhc proteins slower therefore less compatibility necessary positive postoperative immunosuppressant therapy often used lessen immune response prevent tissue rejection dampening immune systems response foreign hla increase likelihood successful transplantation nonidentical transplant clinical significance histocompatibility tissue transplants several methods typing used check hla allele expression serological typing involves incubating lymphocytes recipient serum containing known antibodies varying hla alleles serum contains antibody specific hla allele present recipients lymphocyte antibodies bind cell activate complement signaling cascade resulting cell lysis lysed cell take added dye trypan blue allowing identification comparing serums triggers cell lysis allows identification hla alleles present cell surface recipients serological typing benefit quickly identifying expressed hla alleles ignores nonexpressed alleles could little immunological significance however recognize subclasses alleles sometimes necessary hla alleles determined directly analyzing hla loci chromosome sequence specific oligonucleotide probes sequence specific primer pcr amplification direct sequencing used identify hla alleles often providing amino acid level
