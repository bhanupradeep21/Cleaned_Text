facial nerve paralysis common problem involves paralysis structures innervated facial nerve pathway facial nerve long relatively convoluted number causes may result facial nerve common bells disease unknown cause may diagnosed exclusion identifiable serious causes facial nerve paralysis characterised facial weakness usually one side face symptoms possibly including loss taste hyperacusis decreased salivation tear secretion signs may linked cause paralysis vesicles ear may occur facial palsy due shingles symptoms may develop several acute facial pain radiating ear may precede onset bells palsy common cause acute facial nerve known cause bells although associated herpes simplex infection bells palsy may develop several days may last several months majority cases recovering spontaneously typically diagnosed clinically patients risk factors causes without vesicles ear neurological signs recovery may delayed elderly complete paralysis bells palsy often treated lyme disease infection caused borrelia burgdorferi bacteria spread ticks account cases facial palsy areas lyme disease us lyme common new england midatlantic states parts wisconsin minnesota expanding first sign lyme infections typically one two weeks tick bite usually expanding rash may accompanied headaches body aches fatigue lyme infections facial palsy appears several weeks later may first sign infection noticed lyme rash typically itch painful lyme disease treated reactivation varicella zoster virus well associated bells palsy may also direct cause facial nerve palsy reactivation latent virus within geniculate ganglion associated vesicles affecting ear canal termed ramsay hunt syndrome type addition facial paralysis symptoms may include ear pain vesicles sensorineural hearing loss vertigo management includes antiviral drugs oral steroids otitis media infection middle ear spread facial nerve inflame causing compression nerve canal antibiotics used control otitis media options include wide myringotomy incision tympanic membrane decompression patient improve chronic otitis media usually presents ear chronic discharge otorrhea hearing loss without ear pain otalgia suspected immediate surgical exploration determine cholesteatoma formed must removed present inflammation middle ear spread canalis facialis temporal bone canal travels facial nerve together statoacoustisus nerve case inflammation nerve exposed edema subsequent high pressure resulting periferic type palsy blunt trauma facial nerve commonly injured cranial physical trauma especially fractures temporal bone may also cause acute facial nerve paralysis understandably likelihood facial paralysis trauma depends location trauma commonly facial paralysis follows temporal bone fractures though likelihood depends type fracture transverse fractures horizontal plane present highest likelihood facial paralysis patients may also present blood behind tympanic membrane sensory deafness vertigo latter two symptoms due damage vestibulocochlear nerve inner ear longitudinal fracture vertical plane present lower likelihood paralysis patients may present blood coming external auditory meatus tympanic membrane tear fracture external auditory canal conductive hearing loss patients mild injuries management bells palsy protect eyes wait patients severe injury progress followed nerve conduction studies nerve conduction studies show large change nerve conduction nerve decompressed facial paralysis follow immediately trauma due direct damage facial nerve cases surgical treatment may attempted cases facial paralysis occur long time trauma due oedema inflammation cases steroids good help tumor compressing facial nerve anywhere along complex pathway result facial paralysis common culprits facial neuromas congenital cholesteatomas hemangiomas acoustic neuromas parotid gland neoplasms metastases often since facial neoplasms intimate relationship facial nerve removing tumors region becomes perplexing physician unsure manage tumor without causing even palsy typically benign tumors removed fashion preserves facial nerve malignant tumors always resected along large areas tissue around including facial nerve inevitably lead facial paralysis safe removal malignant neoplasm vital patient survival tumor removal facial nerve reinnervated techniques crossfacial nerve grafting nerve transfers endtoend nerve alternative treatment methods include muscle transfer techniques gracilis free muscle static procedures patients facial nerve paralysis resulting tumours usually present progressive twitching paralysis neurological signs recurrent bells palsytype presentation latter always suspicious bells palsy recur chronically discharging ear must treated cholesteatoma proven otherwise hence must immediate surgical exploration computed tomography ct magnetic resonance mr imaging used identify location tumour managed accordingly neoplastic causes include leptomeningeal carcinomatosis central facial palsy caused lacunar infarct affecting fibers internal capsule going nucleus facial nucleus affected infarcts pontine arteries unlike peripheral facial palsy central facial palsy affect forehead forehead served nerves coming motor causes may include medical history physical examination including neurological examination needed diagnosis first step observe parts face move normally person tries smile blink raise eyebrows forehead wrinkles normally diagnosis central facial palsy made person evaluated otherwise diagnosis peripheral facial palsy cause needs identified possible ramsey hunts syndrome causes pain small blisters ear side palsy otitis media trauma postsurgical complications may alternatively become apparent history physical examination history trauma tumour suspected ct scan mri may used clarify impact blood tests xrays may ordered depending suspected likelihood facial palsy caused lyme disease estimated based recent history outdoor activities likely tick habitats warmer months recent history rash symptoms headache fever whether palsy affects sides face much common lyme bells palsy likelihood negligible serological test lyme disease performed test positive diagnosis lyme disease cause found diagnosis bells palsy facial nerve paralysis may divided supranuclear infranuclear lesions clinical setting commonly used classifications include intracranial extracranial acute subacute chronic central facial palsy caused lacunar infarct affecting fibers internal capsule going nucleus facial nucleus affected infarcts pontine arteries corticobulbar fibers travelling internal capsule infranuclear lesions refer majority causes facial palsy underlying cause found facial palsy treated estimated likelihood facial palsy caused lyme disease exceeds empiric therapy antibiotics initiated without corticosteroids reevaluated upon completion laboratory tests lyme patients treated corticosteroids palsy severe antivirals facial palsy considered severe person unable close affected eye completely face asymmetric even rest corticosteroids initiated within three days bells palsy onset found increase chances recovery reduce time recovery reduce residual symptoms case incomplete however facial palsy caused lyme disease corticosteroids found studies harm studies found antivirals possibly improve outcomes relative corticosteroids alone severe bells whose blinking disrupted facial palsy frequent use artificial tears awake recommended along ointment patch taping eye closed several surgical treatment options exist restore symmetry paralyzed face patients function return see section tumors study followed thirty individuals facial paralysis following stroke six months onset paralysis twothirds patients fully recovered mild facial case bells palsy individuals fully recover without sequelae additionally majority individuals begin recover within seven days onset httpsenwikipediaorgwikifacialnerveparalysis
