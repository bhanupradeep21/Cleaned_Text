parental investment evolutionary biology evolutionary psychology parental expenditure eg time energy resources benefits parental investment may performed males females biparental care females alone exclusive maternal care males alone exclusive paternal care care provided stage offsprings life prenatal eg egg guarding incubation birds placental nourishment mammals postnatal eg food provisioning protection offspring parental investment theory term coined robert trivers predicts sex invests offspring selective choosing mate lessinvesting sex intrasexual competition access mates theory influential explaining sex differences sexual selection mate preferences throughout animal kingdom charles darwin published origin introduced concept natural selection world well related theories sexual selection first time evolutionary theory used explain females coy males ardent compete females attention ronald fisher wrote genetical theory natural introduced modern concept parental investment introduced sexy son hypothesis introduced fishers principle angus john bateman published influential study fruit flies concluded female gametes costly produce male gametes reproductive success females limited ability produce ovum reproductive success males limited access trivers continued line thinking proposal parental investment theory describes parental investment affects sexual behavior concludes sex higher parental investment selective choosing mate sex lower investment compete intrasexually mating trivers extended parental investment theory explain parentoffspring conflict conflict investment optimal parents versus offsprings parental investment theory branch life history theory earliest consideration parental investment given ronald fisher book genetical theory natural wherein fisher argued parental expenditure sexes offspring equal cluttonbrock expanded concept parental investment include costs component parental fitnesscitation needed male dunnocks tend discriminate young another male polyandrous polygynandrous systems increase reproductive success feeding offspring relation access female throughout mating period generally good predictor indiscriminative parental care males also observed redlip insects male parental investment given form nuptial gift instance ornate moth females receive spermatophore containing nutrients sperm defensive toxins male copulation gift account males body mass constitutes total parental investment male species humans many birds offspring altricial unable fend extended period time birth species males invest offspring male parents precocial species since reproductive success would otherwise suffer benefits parental investment offspring large associated effects condition growth survival ultimately reproductive success offspring example cichlid fish tropheus moorii female high parental investment young mouthbroods young mouthbrooding nourishment takes goes feed young effectively starves young larger heavier faster would without benefits advantageous since lowers risk eaten predators size usually determining factor conflicts however benefits come cost parents ability reproduce future eg increased risk injury defending offspring predators loss mating opportunities whilst rearing offspring increase time interval next reproduction special case parental investment young need nourishment protection genetic parents actually contribute effort raise offspring example bombus terrestris oftentimes sterile female workers reproduce raise mothers brood instead common social hymenoptera due haplodiploidy whereby males haploid females diploid ensures sisters related ever would offspring incentivizing help raise mothers young overall parents selected maximize difference benefits costs parental care likely evolve benefits exceed costs reproduction costly individuals limited degree devote time resources producing raising young expenditure may also detrimental future condition survival reproductive output however expenditure typically beneficial offspring since enhances condition survival reproductive success differences may lead parentoffspring conflict parents naturally selected maximize difference benefits costs parental care tend exist benefits substantially greater costs parents equally related offspring order optimize fitness chance reproducing genes distribute investment equally among current future offspring however single offspring related dna common siblings siblings usually share dna best offsprings fitness parents invest optimize fitness parent would want invest offspring equally offspring would want larger share parental investment parent selected invest offspring point investing current offspring costlier investing future iteroparous species individuals may go several reproductive bouts lifetime tradeoff may exist investment current offspring future reproduction parents need balance offsprings demands selfmaintenance potential negative effect parental care explicitly formalized trivers originally defined term parental investment mean investment parent individual offspring increases offsprings chance surviving hence reproductive success cost parents ability invest penguins prime example species drastically sacrifices health wellbeing exchange survival offspring behavior one necessarily benefit individual genetic code individual arises seen king penguin although animals exhibit altruistic behaviors towards individuals direct relation many behaviors appear mostly parentoffspring relationships breeding males remain fastingperiod breeding site five weeks waiting female return incubation shift however time period males may decide abandon egg female delayed return breeding shows penguins initially show tradeoff health hopes increasing survivorship egg comes point male penguins costs become high comparison gain successful breeding season olof olsson investigated correlation many experiences breeding individual duration individual wait abandoning egg proposed experienced individual better individual replenishing exhausted body reserves allowing remain egg longer period males sacrifice body weight possible survivorship order increase offsprings chance survival tradeoff current reproductive success parents future tradeoff makes sense examples kinbased altruism clear example use altruism attempt increase overall fitness individuals genetic material expense individuals future survival maternaloffspring conflict also studied animals species humans one case documented ethologist wulf

mother towards child alloparental care also referred allomothering member community apart biological parents infant partake offspring care range behaviors fall term alloparental care carrying feeding watching protecting grooming alloparental care stress parents especially mother reduced therefore reducing negative effects parentoffspring conflict apparent altruistic nature behavior may seem odds darwins theory natural selection taking care offspring ones would increase ones direct fitness taking time energy resources away raising ones offspring however behavior explained evolutionarily increasing indirect fitness offspring likely nondescendent kin therefore carrying genetics parental investment behavior enhances chances survival offspring require underlying mechanisms compatible empathy applicable adults situations involving unrelated offspring require offspring reciprocate altruistic behavior parentally investing individuals vulnerable exploited adults parental investment defined robert trivers investment offspring parent increases offsprings chances surviving hence reproductive success expense parents ability invest offspring large parental investment largely decreases parents chances investing offspring parental investment split two main categories mating investment rearing investment mating investment consist sexual act sex cells invested rearing investment time energy expended raise offspring conception species females parental investment mating rearing efforts greatly surpasses male terms sex cells egg sperms cells females investment typically larger portion genetic material overall verillity typically males produce thousands sperm cells daily basis human women fixed supply around ova sperm cells men supplied rate twelve million per also fertilization gestation occur women investments outweigh mans investment single effective sperm cell furthermore women one act sexual intercourse could result ninemonth commitment human gestation subsequent commitments related rearing breastfeeding trivers theory parental investment several implications follow first implication women often always investing sex fact often investing sex leads second implication evolution favors females selective mates ensure intercourse would result unnecessary wasteful costs third implication women invest essential reproductive success offspring valuable resource men result males often compete sexual access females many species type male investment received sex cells terms female investment greatly exceeds male investment previously mentioned however ways males invest offspring example male find food example balloon may find safe environment female feed lay eggs exemplified many may also protect young provide opportunities learn young case many wolves overall main role males overtake protection female young often decrease discrepancy investment caused initial investment sex cells species mormon cricket pipefish seahorse panamanian poison arrow frog males invest among species male invests male also pickier sex placing higher demands selected female example female often choose usually contain eggs rejected links parental investment theory pit sexual selection parental investment bigger male female usually female competes mate shown phalaropidae polyandrous bird species species females usually aggressive brightly colored larger suggesting investing sex choice selecting mate compared sex engaged intrasexual selection second prediction follows trivers theory fact females invest heavily offspring makes valuable resource males ensures survival offspring driving force natural selection therefore sex invests less offspring compete among breed heavily investing sex words males compete females argued jealousy developed avert risk potential loss parental investment male redirects resources another female costly loss time energy resources offspring however risks males higher although women invest offspring bigger maternity certainty carried child however males never paternal certainty therefore risk investing resources time offspring genetically unrelated evolutionary psychology views jealousy adaptive response problem trivers theory influential predictions makes correspond differences sexual behaviors men women demonstrated variety research crosscultural study buss shows males tuned physical attractiveness signals youth fertility ensures male reproductive success increased copulating many fertile females possible women hand tuned resources provided potential mates reproductive success increased ensuring offspring survive one way getting resources alternatively another study shows men promiscuous women giving support theory clark found men willing sex female stranger propositioned compared women hand women agreed date male stranger suggests males seek shortterm relationships women show strong preference longterm relationships however preferences male promiscuity female choosiness explained ways western cultures male promiscuity encouraged availability pornographic magazines videos targeted male audience alternatively western eastern cultures discourage female promiscuity social checks pit parental investment theory also explains patterns sexual males likely show stress response imagining partners showing sexual infidelity sexual relations someone else women showed stress imagining partner emotionally unfaithful love another woman pit explains womans sexual infidelity decreases males paternal certainty thus show stress due fear cuckoldry hand woman fears losing resources partner provides partner emotional attachment another female likely wont invest offspring much thus greater stress response shown circumstance heavy criticism theory comes thornhill palmers analysis natural history rape biological bases sexual seems rationalise rape sexual coercion females thornhill palmer claimed rape evolved technique obtaining mates environment women choose mates pit claims males seek copulate many fertile females possible choice women could result negative effect males reproductive success women didnt choose mates thornhill palmer claim would rape ignores variety sociocultural factors fact fertile females raped underage rape victims means fertile age thus evolutionary advantage raping rapes england committed increase mans reproductive success conception thus thornhill palmer called evolved machinery might advantageous trivers theory overlooks women shortterm relationships onenight stands men behave promiscuously alternative explanation pit parental investment theory mate preferences would buss schmitts sexual strategies sst argues sexes pursue shortterm longterm relationships seek different qualities short longterm partners shortterm relationship women prefer attractive partner longterm relationship might willing tradeoff attractiveness resources commitment hand men might accepting sexually willing partner shortterm relationships ensure paternal certainty seek faithful partner instead parental investment theory used explain evolutionary phenomena human behavior describes recurrences international politics well specifically parental investment referred describing competitive behaviors states determining aggressive nature foreign policies parental investment hypothesis states size coalitions physical strengths male members determines whether activities foreign neighbors aggressive according trivers men relatively low parental investments therefore forced fiercer competitive situations limited reproductive resources sexual selection naturally took place men evolved address unique reproductive problems among adaptations mens psychology also developed directly aid men intrasexual one essential psychological developments involved decisionmaking whether take flight actively engage warfare another rivalry group two main factors men referred situations whether coalition part larger opposition whether men coalition greater physical strength male psychology conveyed ancient past passed modern times causing men partly think behave ancestral wars according theory leaders international politics exception example united states expected win vietnam war due greater military capacity compared enemies yet victory according traditional rule greater coalition size come us take enough consideration factors perseverance local parental investment hypothesis contends male physical strength coalition still determines aggressiveness modern conflicts states idea may seem unreasonable upon considering male physical strength one least determining aspects todays warfare human psychology nevertheless evolved operate basis moreover although may seem mate seeking motivation longer determinant modern wars sexuality rape undeniably evident conflicts even many species males produce larger number offspring course lives minimizing parental investment favor investing time impregnating reproductiveage female fertile contrast female much smaller number offspring reproductive life partly due higher obligate parental investment females selective choosy mates males choosing males good fitness eg genes high status resources etc help offset lack direct parental investment male therefore increase reproductive success robert trivers theory parental investment predicts sex making largest investment lactation nurturing protecting offspring discriminating mating sex invests less offspring compete via intrasexual selection access higherinvesting sex see batemans species sexes invest highly parental care mutual choosiness expected arise example seen crested auklets parents share equal responsibility incubating single egg raising chick crested auklets sexes humans evolved increasing levels parental investment biologically behaviorally fetus requires high investment mother altricial newborn requires high investment community species whose newborn young unable move require parental care high degree altriciality human children born unable care require additional parental investment postbirth order trivers hypothesized greater biologically obligated investment predict greater voluntary investment mothers invest impressive amount children even born time nutrients required develop fetus risks associated giving nutrients undergoing childbirth sizable investment ensure investment nothing mothers likely invest children born sure survive successful relative species human mothers give resources offspring higher risk health even child born associated evolution slower life history fewer larger offspring born longer intervals requiring increased parental developing human especially nutrients grow later weeks gestation fetus requires

increased resources result health problems mother preeclampsia childbirth detachment placental chorion cause excessive obstetrical dilemma also makes birth difficult results increased maternal investment humans evolved bipedalism large brain size evolution bipedalism altered shape pelvis shrunk birth canal time brains evolving larger decreasing birth canal size meant babies born earlier development smaller brains humans give birth babies brains developed primates give birth offspring brains second possible explanation early birth humans energy required grow sustain larger brain supporting larger brain gestationally requires energy mother may unable obstetrical dilemma makes birth challenging distinguishing trait humans need assistance childbirth altered shape bipedal pelvis requires babies leave birth canal facing away mother contrary primate species makes difficult mother clear babys breathing passageways make sure umbilical cord isnt wrapped around neck pull baby free without bending body wrong human need birth attendant also requires sociality order guarantee presence birth attendant humans must aggregate groups controversially claimed humans like ants bees relatively high parental investment cooperative care young division labor unclear evolved first sociality bipedalism birth attendance bonobos closest living relatives alongside chimpanzees high female sociality births among bonobos also social sociality may prerequisite birth attendance bipedalism birth attendance could evolved long five million years female primates age ability reproduce decreases grandmother hypothesis describes evolution menopause may may unique humans among women age costs investing additional reproduction increase benefits decrease menopause beneficial stop reproduction begin investing grandchildren grandmothers certain genetic relation grandchildren especially children daughters maternal certainty children high daughters certain maternity children well also theorized grandmothers preferentially invest daughters daughters x chromosomes carry dna granddaughters closely related altriciality increased investment individuals mother became necessary high sociality meant female relatives present help mother paternal investment increased well paternal investment increases becomes difficult additional children effects investment offspring fitness men likely women give parental investment children children lowinvesting fathers likely give less parental investment children father absence risk factor early sexual activity teenage father absence raises childrens stress levels linked earlier onset sexual activity increased shortterm mating daughters absent fathers likely seek shortterm partners one theory explains preference outside nonpartner social support perceived uncertain future uncertain availability committing partners highstress women get pregnant ovulating human ovulation concealed signaled externally concealed ovulation decreases paternity certainty men unsure women evolution concealed ovulation theorized result altriciality increased need paternal men unsure time ovulation best way successfully reproduce would repeatedly mate woman throughout cycle requires pair bonding turn increases paternal sociosexuality first described alfred kinsey willingness engage casual uncommitted sexual sociosexual orientation describes
