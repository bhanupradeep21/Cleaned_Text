waru waru aymara term agricultural technique developed prehispanic people andes region south america ecuador bolivia regional agricultural technique also referred camellones spanish functionally similar agricultural techniques developed parts world fall broad category raised field agriculture type altiplano field agriculture consists parallel canals alternated raised planting beds would strategically located floodplains near water source fields could properly irrigated flooded fields composed soil rich nutrients due presence aquatic plants organic materials process mounding soil create planting beds natural recyclable fertilizer made available region nitrogenrich soils rare trapping solar radiation day raised field agricultural method also protected crops freezing overnight raised planting beds irrigated efficiently adjacent canals extended growing season significantly allowing food yield waru waru able yield larger amounts food previous agricultural methods due overall efficiency system technique dated around bc commonly associated tiwanaku culture lake titicaca region southern bolivia used method grow crops like potatoes type agriculture also created artificial ecosystems attracted food sources fish lake birds past cultures lake titicaca region likely utilized additional resources subsistence method combines raised beds irrigation channels prevent damage soil erosion floods fields ensure collecting water either fluvial water rainwater phreatic water subsequent drainage drainage aspect method makes particularly useful many areas subjected risks brutal floods tropical parts bolivia peru emerged raised field agricultural methods used many countries china mexico belize mexican chinampas similar waru waru created near water source order properly irrigate crops raised fields known belize various sites including pulltrouser swamp geographers william denevan george plafker kenneth lee found evidence raisedfield agriculture utilized llanos de

amongst contemporary aymara quechuaspeaking native peoples bolivia peru utilizing centuriesold technique modern people region able make use harsh altiplano landscape around lake method used different areas south america farming difficult altiplano amazon basin method indigenous people able farm landscape much efficiently without use modern equipment method also allows largescale agriculture performed amazon basin without rely deforestation research done two raisedfield sites diego sanchez de lozada et al northern altiplano bolivia near lake titicaca effort better understand effects frost potato crops altitude ft crops subject temperature moisture variation temperatures soil top cm high raised mounds degree celsius higher temperature ground nearby fields showing raisedfield technique able partially mitigate frost effects potato crops night temperature moisture analysis raised fields showed higher temperature present due aboveground processes caused cold air fall canals planted rows frost mitigation effects raised field system kept crops freezing overnight increased crop yield century spanish accounts lake titicaca region mentioned different types agriculture utilized native peoples detail however never mention raised fields records lack spanish accounts strongly suggests waru waru longer use time conquistadors reached lake titicaca region raised fields region numerous
