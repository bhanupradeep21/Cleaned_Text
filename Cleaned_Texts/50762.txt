motor neuron diseases motor neurone diseases mnds group rare neurodegenerative disorders selectively affect motor neurons cells control voluntary muscles include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis progressive bulbar palsy pbp pseudobulbar palsy progressive muscular atrophy pma primary lateral sclerosis pls spinal muscular atrophy sma monomelic amyotrophy mma well rarer variants resembling als motor neuron diseases affect children motor neuron disease affects patients differently cause movementrelated symptoms mainly muscle diseases seem occur randomly without known causes forms studies inherited forms led discoveries various genes eg thought important understanding disease symptoms motor neuron diseases first seen birth come slowly later life diseases worsen time als shorten ones life expectancy others currently approved treatments majority motor neuron disorders care mostly signs symptoms depend specific disease motor neuron diseases typically manifest group movementrelated come slowly worsen course three months various patterns muscle weakness seen muscle cramps spasms may occur one difficulty breathing climbing stairs exertion difficulty breathing lying orthopnea even respiratory failure breathing muscles become involved bulbar symptoms including difficulty speaking dysarthria difficulty swallowing dysphagia excessive saliva production sialorrhea also occur sensation ability feel typically affected emotional disturbance eg pseudobulbar affect cognitive behavioural changes eg problems word fluency decisionmaking memory also lower motor neuron findings eg muscle wasting muscle twitching upper motor neuron findings eg brisk reflexes babinski reflex hoffmans reflex increased muscle tone motor neuron diseases seen children affect children tend inherited familial symptoms either present birth appear learning walk affect adults tend appear age clinical course depends specific disease progress worsen course fatal eg als others eg various patterns muscle
