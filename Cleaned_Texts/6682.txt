adenosine deaminase also known adenosine aminohydrolase ada enzyme ec involved purine metabolism needed breakdown adenosine food turnover nucleic acids tissues primary function humans development maintenance immune however full physiological role ada yet completely ada exists small form monomer large form monomer form enzyme polypeptide folded eight strands parallel αβ barrels surround central deep pocket active addition eight central βbarrels eight peripheral αhelices ada also contains five additional helices residues fold three helices located folds two antiparallel carboxyterminal helices located across aminoterminal βbarrel ada active site contains zinc ion located deepest recess active site coordinated five atoms zinc cofactor necessary activity substrate adenosine stabilized

ring competitive inhibition observed ada product inosine acts competitive inhibitor enzymatic ada considered one key enzymes purine enzyme found bacteria plants invertebrates vertebrates mammals high conservation amino acid high degree amino acid sequence conservation suggests crucial nature ada purine salvage pathway primarily ada humans involved development maintenance immune system however ada association also observed epithelial cell differentiation neurotransmission gestation also proposed ada addition adenosine breakdown stimulates release excitatory amino acids necessary coupling adenosine receptors heterotrimeric g adenosine deaminase deficiency leads pulmonary suggesting chronic exposure high levels adenosine exacerbate inflammation responses rather suppressing also
