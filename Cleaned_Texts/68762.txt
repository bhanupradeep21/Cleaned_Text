receptor type cytokine receptor heterodimer interleukin receptor alpha subunit receptor belongs type cytokine receptor family heterodimer composed two polypeptide chains one α subunit binds confers upon receptor cytokine specificity one β subunit contains signal transduction domains chain exclusively expressed eosinophils basophils murine cells b cell like many cytokine receptors alternative splicing αchain gene results expression either membrane bound soluble form bαchain soluble form lead signal transduction therefore antagonistic effect signaling monomeric forms low affinity receptors dimerization βchain produces high affinity either case αchain exclusively binds intracellular portion associated janus kinase jak protein tyrosinekinase essential signal βsubunit receptor responsible signal transduction contains several intracellular signaling domains unlike αchain βchain bind specific cytokine expressed practically leukocytes fact βsubunit receptor also found gmcsf receptors associated gmcsfrα subunits therefore known common β receptor βc subunit β subunit cytoplasmic domain constitutively associated well another tyrosine kinase essential signal three monoclonal antibodies available target benralizumab binds mepolizumab reslizumab bind preventing binding
