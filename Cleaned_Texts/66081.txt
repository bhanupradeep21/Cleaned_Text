biology phototropism growth organism response light stimulus phototropism often observed plants also occur organisms fungi cells plant farthest light contain hormone called auxin reacts phototropism occurs causes plant elongated cells furthest side light phototropism one many plant tropisms movements respond external stimuli growth towards light source called positive phototropism growth away light called negative phototropism negative phototropism confused skototropism defined growth towards darkness whereas negative phototropism refer either growth away light source towards plant shoots exhibit positive phototropism rearrange chloroplasts leaves maximize photosynthetic energy promote vine shoot tips exhibit negative phototropism allows grow towards dark solid objects climb combination phototropism gravitropism allow plants grow correct several signaling molecules help plant determine light source coming activate several genes change hormone gradients allowing plant grow towards light tip plant known coleoptile necessary light middle portion coleoptile area shoot curvature occurs hypothesis developed early century predicts presence asymmetric light auxin move towards shaded side promote elongation cells side cause plant curve towards light auxins activate proton pumps decreasing ph cells dark side plant acidification cell wall region activates enzymes known expansins disrupt hydrogen bonds cell wall structure making cell walls less rigid addition increased proton pump activity leads solutes entering plant cells dark side plant increases osmotic gradient symplast apoplast plant water enters cells along osmotic gradient leading increase turgor pressure decrease cell wall strength increased turgor pressure yield causes cells swell exerting mechanical pressure drives phototropic movement proteins encoded second group genes pin genes found play major role phototropism auxin transporters thought responsible polarization auxin location specifically

change maturation mature leaves contain chloroplasts essential photosynthesis chloroplast rearrangement occurs different light environments maximize photosynthesis several genes involved plant phototropism including gene involved chloroplast double mutants found reduced phototropic responses fact two genes redundant determining curvature stem recent studies reveal multiple agc kinases except involved plant phototropism firstly pinoid exhibiting lightinducible expression pattern determines subcellular relocation phototropic responses via direct phosphorylation secondly homologs modulates auxin transport activity likely phosphorylation well third upstream acts essential activator agc kinases interestingly different agc kinases might participate different steps progression

models respect stem phototropism proposed using arabidopsis thaliana study plant first model incoming light deactivates auxin light side plant allowing shaded part continue growing eventually bend plant towards second model light inhibits auxin biosynthesis light side plant thus decreasing concentration auxin relative unaffected third model horizontal flow auxin light dark side plant incoming light causes auxin flow exposed side shaded side increasing concentration auxin shaded side thus growth fourth model shows plant receiving light inhibit auxin basipetal exposed side causing auxin flow
