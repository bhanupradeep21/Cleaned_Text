skull bone protective cavity skull composed four types bone ie cranial bones facial bones ear ossicles hyoid bone however two parts prominent cranium pl craniums crania humans two parts neurocranium braincase viscerocranium facial skeleton includes mandible largest bone skull forms anteriormost portion skeleton product brain several sensory structures eyes ears nose humans sensory structures part facial skeleton functions skull include protection brain fixing distance eyes allow stereoscopic vision fixing position ears enable sound localisation direction distance sounds animals horned ungulates mammals hooves skull also defensive function providing mount frontal bone horns english word skull probably derived old norse latin word cranium comes greek root κρανίον kranion human skull fully develops two years birth junctions skull bones joined structures called sutures skull made number fused flat bones contains many foramina fossae processes several cavities sinuses zoology openings skull called fenestrae human skull bone structure forms head human skeleton supports structures face forms cavity brain like skulls vertebrates protects brain skull consists three parts different embryological neurocranium sutures facial skeleton also called membraneous viscerocranium neurocranium braincase forms protective cranial cavity surrounds houses brain upper areas cranial bones form calvaria skullcap membranous viscerocranium includes mandible sutures fairly rigid joints bones neurocranium facial skeleton formed bones supporting face except mandible bones skull joined immovable joints formed bony ossification sharpeys fibres permitting flexibility sometimes extra bone pieces within suture known wormian bones sutural bones commonly found course lambdoid suture human skull generally considered consist twentytwo cranial bones fourteen facial skeleton bones neurocranium occipital bone two temporal bones two parietal bones sphenoid ethmoid frontal bones bones facial

include hyoid bone three ossicles middle ear overall general consensus number bones human skull stated twentytwo occipital parietal frontal neurocranium nasal lacrimal vomer facial skeleton flat bones skull also contains sinuses airfilled cavities known paranasal sinuses numerous foramina sinuses lined respiratory epithelium known functions lessening weight skull aiding resonance voice warming moistening air drawn nasal cavity foramina openings skull largest foramen magnum allows passage spinal cord well nerves blood vessels many processes skull include mastoid process zygomatic processes fenestrae latin meaning windows openings skull jugal skull bone found reptiles amphibians birds mammals jugal often called zygomatic bone malar prefrontal bone bone separating lacrimal frontal bones many tetrapod skulls skull fishes formed series loosely connected bones lampreys sharks possess cartilaginous endocranium upper lower jaws separate elements bony fishes additional dermal bone forming less coherent skull roof lungfish holost fish lower jaw defines chin simpler structure found jawless fish cranium normally represented troughlike basket cartilaginous elements partially enclosing brain associated capsules inner ears single nostril distinctively fish cartilaginous fish sharks rays also simple presumably primitive skull structures cranium single structure forming case around brain enclosing lower surface sides always least partially open top large fontanelle anterior part cranium includes forward plate cartilage rostrum capsules enclose olfactory organs behind orbits additional pair capsules enclosing structure inner ear finally skull tapers towards rear foramen magnum lies immediately single condyle articulating first vertebra addition various points throughout cranium smaller foramina cranial nerves jaws consist separate hoops cartilage almost always distinct cranium rayfinned fish also considerable modification primitive pattern roof skull generally well formed although exact relationship bones tetrapods unclear usually given similar names convenience elements skull however may reduced little cheek region behind enlarged orbits little bone upper jaw often formed largely premaxilla maxilla located back additional bone symplectic linking jaw rest although skulls fossil lobefinned fish resemble early tetrapods said living lungfishes skull roof fully formed consists multiple somewhat irregularly shaped bones direct relationship tetrapods upper jaw formed pterygoids vomers alone bear teeth much skull formed cartilage overall structure skulls earliest tetrapods closely resembled ancestors amongst lobefinned fishes skull roof formed series platelike bones including maxilla frontals parietals lacrimals among others overlaying endocranium corresponding cartilaginous skull sharks rays various separate bones compose temporal bone humans also part skull roof series plate composed four pairs bones forms roof mouth include vomer palatine bones base cranium formed ring bones surrounding foramen magnum median bone lying forward homologous occipital bone parts sphenoid mammals finally lower jaw composed multiple bones anterior dentary homologous mammalian living tetrapods great many original bones either disappeared fused one another various arrangements birds diapsid skull reptiles prelacrimal fossa present reptiles skull single occipital skull consists five major bones frontal top head parietal back head premaxillary nasal top beak mandible bottom beak skull normal bird usually weighs birds total bodyweight eye occupies considerable amount skull surrounded sclerotic eyering ring tiny bones characteristic also seen reptiles living amphibians typically greatly reduced skulls many bones either absent wholly partly replaced mammals birds particular modifications skull occurred allow expansion brain fusion various bones especially notable birds individual structures may difficult identify skull complex structure bones formed intramembranous endochondral ossification skull roof bones comprising bones facial skeleton sides roof neurocranium dermal bones formed intramembranous ossification though temporal bones formed endochondral ossification endocranium bones supporting brain occipital sphenoid ethmoid largely formed endochondral ossification thus frontal parietal bones purely geometry skull base fossae anterior middle posterior cranial fossae changes rapidly anterior cranial fossa changes especially first trimester pregnancy skull defects often develop birth human skull made separate bony elements development many bony elements gradually fuse together solid bone example frontal bone bones roof skull initially separated regions dense connective tissue called fontanelles six fontanelles one anterior frontal one posterior occipital two sphenoid anterolateral two mastoid posterolateral birth regions fibrous moveable necessary birth later growth growth put large amount tension obstetrical hinge squamous lateral parts occipital bone meet possible complication tension rupture great cerebral vein growth ossification progress connective tissue fontanelles invaded replaced bone creating sutures five sutures two squamous sutures one coronal one lambdoid one sagittal suture posterior fontanelle usually closes eight weeks anterior fontanel remain open eighteen months anterior fontanelle located junction frontal parietal bones soft spot babys forehead careful observation show count babys heart rate observing pulse pulsing softly anterior fontanelle skull neonate large proportion parts body facial skeleton one seventh size calvaria adult half size base skull short narrow though inner ear almost adult craniosynostosis condition one fibrous sutures infant skull prematurely changes growth pattern skull expand perpendicular fused suture grows parallel sometimes resulting growth pattern provides necessary space growing brain results abnormal head shape abnormal facial cases compensation effectively provide enough space growing brain craniosynostosis results increased intracranial pressure leading possibly visual impairment sleeping impairment eating difficulties

significant brain damage death unless urgent operation performed relieve pressure patients concussion must watched extremely carefully repeated concussions activate structure skull bones brains protective dating back neolithic times skull operation called trepanning sometimes performed involved drilling burr hole cranium examination skulls period reveals patients sometimes survived many
