knobshaped boss inside near pubic cedarpelta shows mix basal derived traits presence premaxillary teeth plesiomorphic character inherited earlier ornithischia contrast closure opening side skull behind orbit lateral temporal fenestra advanced derived apomorphic character known ankylosaurid two skulls known skull length cedarpelta estimated roughly centimetres one cedarpelta skulls found disarticulated first ankylosaur skull allowing paleontologists unique opportunity examine individual bones instead limited ossified unit skull relatively elongated show strongly appending beak conical premaxillary teeth first largest maxilla bears eighteen teeth eye socket surrounded lacrimal single supraorbital large postorbital excluding prefrontal jugal orbital rim postcranial skeleton described skulls though large thus juvenile individuals show distinctive pattern fused caputegulae head tiles inspired carpenter propose alternative hypothesis ankylosaur skull osteoderm formation formerly assumed armour plates either formed direct skin ossification distinct scutes later fused skull popular theory reaction skull bones pattern overlying scales lack clear pattern cedarpelta suggested carpenter ossification took place intermediate layer scales skull roof surmised carpenter placed cedarpelta within family ankylosauridae offered two interpretations position first could basalmost known ankylosaurid ie first discovered branch split ankylosaurid stem line would line plesiomorphic traits fact supposed barremian age made one oldest known ankylosaurids second formed early
