intentional stance term coined philosopher daniel dennett level abstraction view behavior entity terms mental properties part theory mental content proposed dennett provides underpinnings later works free consciousness folk psychology evolution works first decide treat object whose behavior predicted rational agent figure beliefs agent ought given place world purpose figure desires ought considerations finally predict rational agent act goals light beliefs little practical reasoning chosen set beliefs desires instances yield decision agent ought predict agent dennett p states took concept intentionality work german philosopher franz clarifying distinction mental phenomena viz mental activity physical phenomena brentano p argued contrast physical distinguishing characteristic mental reference something object characteristic called intentional dennett constantly speaks aboutness intentionality example aboutness pencil marks composing shopping list derived intentions person whose list dennett p john searle pp stresses competence predictingexplaining human behaviour involves able recognize others intentional beings interpret others minds intentional states eg beliefs desires according dennett pp folk psychology provides systematic reasongiving explanation particular action account historical origins action based deeply embedded assumptions namely approach also consistent earlier work fritz heider marianne simmel whose joint study revealed subjects presented animated display shapes inclined ascribe intentions dennett p argues based fixed personal views humans ought believe desire predict explain beliefs desires actions others calculating normative driven reasonable assumption humans rational beings specific beliefs desires act basis beliefs desires order get want predictionsexplanations based four simple rules core idea understanding explaining andor predicting behavior object choose view varying levels abstraction concrete level accurate principle predictions abstract greater computational power gain zooming skipping irrelevant details dennett defines three levels abstraction attained adopting one three entirely different stances intellectual strategies physical stance design stance intentional key point switching higher level abstraction risks well benefits example view bimetallic strip tube mercury thermometers lose track

making specific commitments deeper reality artifacts folk psychology addition controversy inherent also dispute extent dennett committing realism mental properties initially dennetts interpretation seen leaning towards years idea used support extensive theories consciousness taken like realism words hint something middle suggests self real center gravity abstract object theorists fiction operationally way thinking things dennetts intentional stance entirely consistent everyday commonsense understanding thus meets eleanor roschs p criterion maximum information least cognitive effort rosch argues implicit within system categorization assumptions also intentional stance meets criteria dennett specified pp algorithms general notion three level system widespread late example discussing mental representation information cognitive psychology perspective glass colleagues p distinguished three important aspects representation significant cognitive scientists also advocated three level system allen newell zenon pylyshyn david marr parallels four representations implicitly assumed computers human minds displayed three distinct levels detailed following table obvious objection dennett intuition matters us whether object inner life claim dont imagine intentional states people order predict behaviour fact thoughts feelings like central notions trust friendship love blockhead argument proposes someone jones twin fact person sophisticated robot looks acts like jones every way claimed somehow thoughts feelings chip controls behaviour words lights ones home according intentional systems theory ist jones robot precisely beliefs desires claimed false ist expert assigns mental states blockhead jones whereas fact blockhead thought head dennett argued denying premise basis robot philosophical zombie therefore metaphysically impossible words something acts ways conscious necessarily consciousness defined terms behavioral capacity ineffable another objection attacks premise treating people ideally rational creatures yield best predictions stephen stich argues people often beliefs desires irrational bizarre ist doesnt allow us say anything persons environmental niche examined closely enough possibility malfunction brain might affect reasoning capacities looked may possible formulate predictive strategy specific person indeed often someone behaving unpredictably look reasons words deal irrationality contrasting background assumption rationality development significantly undermines claims intentional stance argument rationale behind intentional stance based evolutionary theory particularly notion ability make quick predictions systems behaviour based think might thinking evolutionary adaptive advantage fact predictive powers perfect result advantages sometimes accrued acting contrary expectations philip robbins anthony jack suggest dennetts philosophical distinction physical intentional stances lot going perspective

followup paper robbins jack describe four experiments intentional phenomenal stances relate feelings moral concern first two experiments showed talking lobsters strongly emotional led much greater sentiment lobsters deserved welfare protections talking lobsters highly intelligent third fourth studies found perceiving agent vulnerable led greater attributions phenomenal experience also people
