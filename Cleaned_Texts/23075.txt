bálints syndrome uncommon incompletely understood triad severe neuropsychological impairments inability perceive visual field whole simultanagnosia difficulty fixating eyes oculomotor apraxia inability move hand specific object using vision optic named austrohungarian neurologist psychiatrist rezső bálint first identified bálints syndrome occurs often acute onset consequence two strokes less place hemisphere therefore occurs rarely frequent cause complete bálints syndrome said sudden severe hypotension resulting bilateral borderzone infarction occipitoparietal rarely cases progressive bálints syndrome found degenerative disorders alzheimers certain traumatic brain injuries border parietal occipital lobes brain lack awareness syndrome may lead misdiagnosis resulting inappropriate inadequate treatment therefore clinicians familiar bálints syndrome various bálints syndrome symptoms quite debilitating since impact visuospatial skills visual scanning attentional since represents impairment visual language functions significant disability affect patients ones home environment render person incapable maintaining many cases complete trio perceive visual field whole simultanagnosia difficulty fixating eyes oculomotor apraxia inability move hand specific object using vision optic noticed patient rehabilitation therapists unfamiliar bálints syndrome may misdiagnose patients inability meet progress expectations symptom areas simply indicating incapability benefiting traditional therapy nature bálint symptom frustrates rehabilitation progress symptoms much research needed develop therapeutic protocols address bálint symptoms group since disabilities simultanagnosia inability perceive simultaneous events objects ones visual people bálints syndrome perceive world erratically series single objects rather seeing wholeness spatial disorder visual ability identify local elements scene global referred constriction individuals global gestalt visual window attention people fixate eyes specific images social scenes informative meaning scene forthcoming recovery simultanagnosia may related somehow expanding restricted attentional window characterizes simultanagnosia profound visual deficit impairs ability perceive multiple items visual display preserving ability recognize single objects one study suggests simultanagnosia may result extreme form competition objects makes difficult attention disengaged object patients simultanagnosia restricted spatial window visual attention see one object time see world patchy spotty manner therefore pick single object even components individual object without able see global big picturecitation needed study directly tested relationship restriction attentional window simultanagnosia compared vision healthy participants normal limits visual processing confirmed limitations difficulties patients considerable evidence persons cortex essentially divided two functional streams occipitalparietalfrontal pathway processes information occipitaltemporalfrontal pathway provides information bálint referred psychic paralysis inability voluntarily guide eye movements changing new location visual fixation major symptom oculomotor apraxia person control eye movements however vertical eye movements typically unaffected example often difficulty moving eyes desired direction words saccades rapid eye movements abnormal patients oculomotor apraxia turn heads order follow objects coming optic ataxia inability guide hand toward object using visual inability explained motor somatosensory visual field deficits acuity deficits optic ataxia seen bálints syndrome characterized impaired visual control direction armreaching visual target accompanied defective hand orientation grip considered specific visuomotor disorder independent visual space misperceptioncitation needed optic ataxia also known misreaching dysmetria english difficult measure secondary visual perceptual deficits patient bálints syndrome likely defective hand movements visual guidance despite normal limb strength patient unable grab object looking object due discoordination eye hand movement especially true contralesional handcitation needed dysmetria refers lack coordination movement typified undershoot overshoot intended position hand arm leg eye sometimes described inability judge distance bálint states optic ataxia impaired patients daily activities since cutting slice meatwhich held fork left hand would search outside plate knife right hand lighting cigarette often lit middle end bálint pointed systematic nature disorder evident patients behaviour searching space thus asked grasp presented object right hand would miss regularly would find hand knocked reaching ability patient also altered takes longer reach toward object ability grasp object also impaired patients performance even severely deteriorated vision either hand target visual difficulties bálints syndrome usually due damage parietooccipital lobes sides brain parietal lobe middle area top part brain occipital lobe back part brain usually affect temporal lobescitation needed lack awareness syndrome may lead misdiagnosis blindness psychosis symptoms bálints syndrome likely noticed first optometrists ophthalmologists eye check therapists providing rehabilitation following brain lesions however due scarcity among practitioners familiarity syndrome symptoms often explained away incorrectly without considered possibility followed medical confirmation clinical neuroradiological severe disturbance
