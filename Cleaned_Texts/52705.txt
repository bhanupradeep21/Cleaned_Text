alpaca fleece natural fiber harvested alpaca two different types alpaca fleece common fleece type comes huacaya huacaya fiber grows looks similar sheep wool animal looks fluffy second type alpaca suri makes less south american alpaca population suri fiber similar natural silk hangs body locks dreadlock fibers used worsted milling process using light weight yarn thread huacaya fiber also used woolen process spun various weight yarns soft durable silky natural fiber huacaya fiber similar sheeps wool warmer prickly lanolin makes alpaca fiber naturally waterrepellent fire huacaya alpaca grows soft spongy fiber natural crimp thus making naturally elastic yarn wellsuited knitting suri crimp thus better fit woven goods designer armani used suri alpaca fashion mens womens united states groups smaller alpaca breeders banded together create fiber coops make manufacture alpaca fiber products less expensive preparing carding spinning weaving finishing process alpaca similar process used wool two types alpaca huacaya produce dense soft crimpy sheeplike fiber suri silky pencillike locks resembling dreadlocks without matted fibers suris prized longer silkier fibers estimated make north american alpaca since import united states number suri alpacas grown substantially become color diverse suri thought rarer likely breed reserved royalty incan suris often said less cold hardy huacaya breeds successfully raised extreme climates developed south america alpacas bred precolumbian south america years domesticated vicuñas ancient tribes andean highlands ecuador peru chile bolivia northwest argentina according archaeological studies alpaca fiber similar quality wild vicuña prior spanish conquests paracas textiles thought include alpaca also known fiber gods alpaca used make clothing recent yearswhen alpacas also exported countries countries us australia new zealand breeders shear animals annually weigh fleeces test fineness resulting knowledge able breed heavierfleeced animals finer fiber fleece weights vary top stud males reaching annual shear weights kg total fleece kg good quality fleece discrepancy weight alpaca guard hair often removed spinning alpacas shorn year spring shearing fleece roughly cleaned sorted according color dried wool carded process loose alpaca fibers aligned strain alpaca fleece carding machines help like sheep alpacas thicker awn hairs long straight hairs located undercoat ensure fine coat become matted therefore alpacas brushed would destroy undercoat structure awn hairs much coarser fine undercoat carded easily also sorted final result sorting process called baby alpaca carding strains ready spun yarn spinning wheel finally wool washed remove impurities alpaca wool contains almost wool grease lanolin making easy clean wool ready sale knitting wool amerindians peru used fiber manufacture many styles fabrics thousands years introduction europe commercial product alpaca crucial component ancient life andes provided warm clothing also meat incan culture involved alpaca well llamas guanacos ritual sacrifice methods killing beasts varied based god receiving sacrifice festival took place even color animals fur one method

product apparently number alpacas available never increased appreciably unsuccessful attempts made acclimatize alpaca england european continent australia even cross english breeds sheep alpaca cross alpaca true hybrid every material placed upon liverpool market name huarizo crosses alpaca vicuña proved satisfactory crosses produced offspring short fleece characteristic currentwhen attempts cross two breeds underway farms us alpacas bred us canada australia new zealand uk germany numerous places recent yearswhen interest alpaca fiber clothing surged perhaps partly alpaca ranching reasonably low impact environment individual us farms producing finished alpaca products like hats mitts scarves socks insoles footwarmers sweaters jackets well almost product outdoor sports enthusiasts claim lighter weight better warmth provides comfort colder weather using alpaca wool blend merino common alpaca fiber industry reduce price however additional materials need added improve processing qualities final alpaca improves textile blended however alpaca garments made without addition materials creates long lasting luxurious product december general assembly united nations proclaimed international year natural fibres raise profile alpaca natural fibers alpaca fiber similar structure sheep wool fiber fiber softness comes different smoother scale surface sheep wool american breeders enhanced softness selecting finer fiber diameter fiber similar merino wool fiber diameter highly inherited trait alpaca sheep difference individual fiber scales compared sheep wool also creates glossy shine prized alpaca alpaca fibers higher tensile strength wool fibers processing slivers lack fiber cohesion single alpaca rovings lack strength blend together durability increased several times twisting necessary especially suri reduce yarns alpaca fine light fleece retain water thermal insulator even wet resist solar radiation effectively characteristics guarantee animals permanent appropriate coat protect extreme changes fiber offers protection humans medullated fibers fibers central core may continuous interrupted fragmented cortical cells make walls fiber wrapped around medulla core made another type cell called medullary cells later cells may contract disappear forming air pockets assist medullation objectionable trait medullated fibers take less dye standing finished garment weaker proportion medullated fibers higher coarser unwanted guard hairs less medullation finer lower micrometer undesirable fibers easy see give garment hairy appearance quality alpaca products free medullated fibers good quality alpaca fiber approximately μm breeders report fiber sell per ounce world wholesale price processed spun alpaca tops according quality ie per finer fleeces ones smaller diameter preferred thus expensive alpaca gets older diameter fibers gets thicker μm μm per year sometimes caused overfeeding excess nutrients converted thicker fiber rather fatcitation needed elite alpaca breeders united states attempting breed animals fleece degrade quality animals age looking lingering fineness fiber diameters remaining μm aging animals believed lingering fineness heritable thus improved time fleeceproducing animals quality varies animal animal alpacas produce fiber less ideal fiber conformation two important factors determining alpacas value alpacas come natural colors shades true black brownblacks browns fawns white silvergreys rosegreys even however white selective breeding white fiber dyed largest ranges colors south america preference white generally better fleece darkercolored animals demand darker fiber sprung united states elsewhere though reintroduce colors quality darker fiber decreased slightly breeders diligently working
