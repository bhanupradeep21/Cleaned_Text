land lab area land set aside use biological studies thus literally outdoor laboratory based area land studies may elementary advanced instance students may simply given task identifying tree species land lab advanced student may intensive survey microbial life forms found soil sample hands tangible projectbase learning key aspect land labs within educational context land labs exist anywhere outdoor access educational campuses residential neighborhoods periurban settings urban settings even small courtyard driving principle behind land lab education getting outside interacting world directly land labs often marked plots transects studies plot may size usually marked square meters allows intensive delimited studies changes inventories biota transects straight lines intervals measurements taken profile ecological community land labs serve important role giving students access natural environment observe native plants wildlife apply stem concepts hands projects build better understanding critical biodiversity ecological health learning produce food fiber energy sustainable ways tremendous opportunity students ages within land labs students explore biomass energy biogas fuels solar energy permaculture composting organic gardening many facets sustainability land labs designing systems mimic natural processes biomimicry able produce food fiber energy sustainable ways local communities numerous environmental economic benefits exist growing food locally producing energy locally biomimicry inspired systems circular nature nothing wasted outputs one circular system become inputs another circular system experiments promoting circular economy natural fit educational land labs circular systems function ensuring nothing wasted every output system becomes input another system example food scraps feed chickens chicken manure fertilizes garden garden grows vegetables food scraps available vegetables feed chickens circular systems wellsuited land labs include land labs help form ecosystem well suited longterm projectbased learning students teachers community members participate multidisciplinary activities ranging land restoration animal husbandry gardening weather analysis outdoor art studies multidisciplinary context within land lab perfect crosscurricular education following disciplines subjects tie land lab activities integrated fashion land labs exist perpetual educational projects span years decades common goals within land lab often land labs designed shapes sizes key attributes land lab typically following small land lab could little courtyard balcony garden designated patch land outside classroom window conversely larger land lab could encompass hundreds acres ideal size flexible land lab space allowing many different ecological activities circular systems acre acres land labs reallife environments design projectbased environment encourages students teachers community members experiment ecological solutions implemented small scale ideally solutions systems implemented land lab transferred beyond land lab surrounding community composting rainwater catchment foodwaste upcycling methane digesters bsf local food production harnessing solar power land lab systems implemented throughout community various scales residential schools community gardens local businesses purpose land lab allow students develop implement learn practical sustainable solutions addressing five basic physiological needs humans industrial systems providing food water energy shelter sanitation inherent weaknesses centralized models long supply chains fossilfuel dependance environmental damage fragmented production goods common traits industrial models land labs tie basic human needs together integrated systems permaculture concept integrating human needs local ecological humanscale systems land labs thought education area promoting creative solutions meeting needs ensuring land local ecology restored process land labs provide students realworld experiences help change behavior consumers get involved meeting physiological needs land labs focused production rather consumption western consumer culture makes provision basic physiological needs abstract far removed daily life people basic needs abstracted away consumers easier underlying systems providing needs operate without supervision ensure ethical sustainable todays digital world many students spend inordinate amounts time screen home school inherent limits exist project based learning takes place entirely behind screen within classroom land labs help break students digital environment providing much needed time outdoors studies shown digital landscape social media exploded popularity depression mental struggles increased dramatically studies also show students mental health benefits immensely outdoors participating hands projects meaningful multiple types local waste streams often obtained freely used supply land lab raw materials build soil generate power grow food restore biodiversity part process building land lab developing relationships local businesses neighbors restaurants community members begin upcycling wastes materials systems needed within land lab many people desire help students working hard meaningful community project much materials listed little cost relationships formed
