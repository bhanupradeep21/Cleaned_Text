environment close possible human child attempt satisfy psychological need washoe gardners foutses careful communicate asl washoe rather using vocal communication assumption would create less confusing learning environment washoe technique said resemble used teaching human children first couple years language project gardners roger fouts discovered washoe could pick asl gestures without direct instruction instead observing humans around signing amongst example scientists signed toothbrush brushed teeth near time observation washoe showed signs learned sign later occasion reacted sight toothbrush spontaneously producing correct sign thereby showing fact previously learned asl sign moreover gardners began realize rewarding particular signs food tickles actually interfering intended result conversational sign language changed strategy food meal times never juxtaposed instruction times addition stopped tickle rewards instruction generally resulted laughing breakdowns instead set conversational environment evoked communication without use rewards specific needed washoe learned approximately words sign researchers consider washoe learned sign use spontaneously appropriately consecutive signs tested using doubleblind vocabulary test test demonstrated chimpanzee subjects could communicate information conditions source information available human observer signing chimpanzee independent observers agreed chimpanzees used signs refer natural language sign dog could refer dog flower flower shoe washoe mates able combine hundreds signs learned novel combinations never taught rather created different meanings instance washoes mate moja didnt know word thermos moja referred metal cup drink however whether washoes combinations constitute genuine inventive language controversial herbert terrace contended concluding seeming sign combinations stand single item rather three individual taking thermos example rather metal cup drink composite meaning thermos could washoe indicating item metal metal one shaped like cup cup could drunk drink one washoes caretakers pregnant missed work many weeks miscarried roger fouts recounts following situation people arent
