laboratory rats scientists also spent time studying thermoregulation rats tail research rats tail works variable heat exchanger tails blood flow allows thermoregulation take place control sympathetic vasoconstrictor vasodilation occurs tail temperature increases causing heat loss vasoconstriction occurs tail temperature decreases allowing heat conserved thermoregulation rat tail used study strain
