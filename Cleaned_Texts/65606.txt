muscle soft tissue one four basic types animal tissue muscle tissue gives skeletal muscles ability contract muscle formed embryonic development process known myogenesis muscle tissue contains special contractile proteins called actin myosin interact cause movement among many muscle proteins present two regulatory proteins troponin tropomyosin muscle tissue varies function location body vertebrates three types skeletal striated smooth muscle nonstriated muscle cardiac skeletal muscle tissue consists elongated multinucleate muscle cells called muscle fibers responsible movements body tissues skeletal muscle include tendons perimysiumcitation needed smooth cardiac muscle contract involuntarily without conscious intervention muscle types may activated interaction central nervous system well receiving innervation peripheral plexus endocrine hormonal activation striated skeletal muscle contracts voluntarily upon influence central nervous system reflexes form nonconscious activation skeletal muscles nonetheless arise activation central nervous system albeit engaging cortical structures contraction occurredcitation needed different muscle types vary response neurotransmitters hormones acetylcholine noradrenaline adrenaline nitric oxide depending muscle type exact location musclecitation needed subcategorization muscle tissue also possible depending among things content myoglobin mitochondria myosin atpase etccitation needed word muscle comes latin musculus diminutive mus meaning mouse appearance flexed biceps resembles back mouse phenomenon occurred greek μῦς mȳs means mouse muscle three types muscle tissue vertebrates skeletal cardiac smooth skeletal cardiac muscle types striated muscle smooth muscle nonstriated three types muscle tissue invertebrates based pattern striation transversely striated obliquely striated smooth muscle arthropods smooth muscle transversely striated type similar skeletal muscle vertebrate skeletal muscle tissue elongated striated muscle tissue fibres ranging width three eight micrometers length micrometers uterine wall pregnancy enlarge length skeletal striated muscle tissue arranged regular parallel bundles myofibrils containing many contractile units known sarcomeres give tissue striated striped appearance skeletal muscle voluntary muscle anchored tendons sometimes aponeuroses bones used effect skeletal movement locomotion maintain posture postural control generally maintained unconscious reflex muscles responsible also react conscious control average adult man made skeletal muscle percentage body mass average adult woman made cardiac muscle tissue found walls heart myocardium involuntary muscle controlled autonomic nervous system cardiac muscle tissue striated like skeletal muscle containing contractile units called sarcomeres highly regular arrangements bundles skeletal muscles arranged regular parallel bundles cardiac muscle connects branching irregular angles known intercalated discs smooth muscle tissue nonstriated involuntary smooth muscle found within walls organs structures esophagus stomach intestines bronchi uterus urethra bladder blood vessels arrector pili skin controls erection body hair skeletal muscle broadly classified two fiber types type slowtwitch type ii fasttwitch muscle density mammalian skeletal muscle tissue contrasted density adipose tissue fat makes muscle tissue approximately denser fat tissue skeletal muscle highly oxygen consuming tissue oxidative dna damage induced reactive oxygen species tends accumulate oxidative dna damage accumulates heart skeletal muscle mouse rat also dna doublestrand breaks accumulate age skeletal muscle smooth muscle involuntary nonstriated divided two subgroups singleunit unitary multiunit smooth muscle within singleunit cells whole bundle sheet contracts syncytium ie multinucleate mass cytoplasm separated cells multiunit smooth muscle tissues innervate individual cells allow fine control gradual responses much like motor unit recruitment skeletal muscle smooth muscle found within walls blood vessels smooth muscle specifically termed vascular smooth muscle tunica media layer large aorta small arteries arterioles veins smooth muscle also found lymphatic vessels urinary bladder uterus termed uterine smooth muscle male female reproductive tracts gastrointestinal tract respiratory tract arrector pili skin ciliary muscle iris eye structure function basically smooth muscle cells different organs inducing stimuli differ substantially order perform individual effects body individual times addition glomeruli kidneys contain smooth musclelike cells called mesangial cells cardiac muscle involuntary striated muscle found walls histological foundation heart specifically myocardium cardiac muscle cells also called cardiomyocytes myocardiocytes predominantly contain one nucleus although populations two four nuclei needed myocardium muscle tissue heart forms thick middle layer outer epicardium layer inner endocardium layer coordinated contractions cardiac muscle cells heart propel blood atria ventricles blood vessels leftbodysystemic rightlungspulmonary circulatory systems complex mechanism illustrates systole heart cardiac muscle cells unlike tissues body rely available blood electrical supply deliver oxygen nutrients remove waste products carbon dioxide coronary arteries help fulfill function muscles derived paraxial mesoderm paraxial mesoderm divided along embryos length somites corresponding segmentation body obviously seen vertebral somite three divisions sclerotome forms vertebrae dermatome forms skin myotome forms muscle myotome divided two sections epimere hypomere form epaxial hypaxial muscles respectively epaxial muscles humans erector spinae small intervertebral muscles innervated dorsal rami spinal nerves muscles including limbs hypaxial innervated ventral rami spinal development myoblasts muscle progenitor cells either remain somite form muscles associated vertebral column migrate body form muscles myoblast migration preceded formation connective tissue frameworks usually formed somatic lateral plate mesoderm myoblasts follow chemical signals appropriate locations fuse elongate skeletal muscle primary function muscle tissue contraction three types muscle tissue skeletal cardiac smooth significant differences however three use movement actin myosin create contraction skeletal muscle contraction stimulated electrical impulses transmitted motor nerves cardiac smooth muscle contractions stimulated internal pacemaker cells regularly contract propagate contractions muscle cells contact skeletal muscle many smooth muscle contractions facilitated neurotransmitter acetylcholine smooth muscle found almost organ systems hollow organs including stomach bladder tubular structures blood lymph vessels bile ducts sphincters uterus eye addition plays important role ducts exocrine glands fulfills various tasks sealing orifices eg pylorus uterine os transport chyme wavelike contractions intestinal tube smooth muscle cells contract slowly skeletal muscle cells stronger sustained require less energy smooth muscle also involuntary unlike skeletal muscle requires stimulus cardiac muscle muscle heart selfcontracting autonomically regulated must continue contract rhythmic fashion whole life organism hence special
