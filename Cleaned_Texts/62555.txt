kembawacela iron digger extinct genus cistecephalid dicynodont late permian east africa genus contains two known species type species kembawacela kitchingi madumabisa mudstone formation zambia described second species k yajuwayeyi chiweta beds malawi described like cistecephalids kembawacela specialised fossorial burrowing lifestyle similar modern day moles unique amongst cistecephalids presence pair tusks upper jaw characteristic many dicynodonts lost cistecephalids likely kembawacela locally endemic species cistecephalid luangwa basin zambia kembawacela broadly resembled cistecephalids size shape small dicynodont skull length roughly centimetres long along base highly specialised body plan digging kembawacela known skulls lower jaws various pieces postcrania including

fenestra short tapered snout large strongly forward facing eyes like cistecephalids including cistecephalus unlike smaller sideways facing eyes cistecephaloides kawingasaurus similarly zygomatic arches project almost laterally behind eyes curve back almost degrees back skull pineal foramen third eye positioned far back roof skull overhanging back skull similar kembawacela obviously distinguished prominent tusks upper jaw majority kembawacela specimens tusks possible sexually dimorphic species tusks face slightly sides sit prominent caniniform process projecting jaw margin like

individual implying lack tusks due fully grown yet sexual dimorphism known cistecephalids prominent ridges eyes cistecephalus although kembawacela lacks traits presence absence tusks suggested indicator sexual dimorphism broadly dicynodonts unfortunately relatively small sample size means possibility statistically tusks kembawacela also notable one specimen preserves unerupted tusks within
