mcgillivray syndrome rare syndrome characterized mainly heart defects skull facial abnormalities ambiguous genitalia symptoms syndrome ventricular septal defect patent ductus arteriosus small jaw undescended testes webbed fingers beside symptoms symptoms related bone structure misshape mcgillivray syndrome birth defect one joints bones babys skull close prematurely babys brain fully formed baby craniosynostosis brain grow natural shape head misshapen affect one joints babys skull cases craniosynostosis associated underlying brain abnormality prevents brain growing properly treating mcgillivray usually involves surgery separate fused bones underlying brain abnormality surgery allows babys brain grow develop adequate space babys skull seven bones normally bones dont fuse around age giving babys brain time grow joints called cranial sutures made strong fibrous tissue hold bones together front babys skull sutures intersect large soft spot fontanel top babys head normally sutures remain flexible bones fuse signs craniosynostosis may noticeable birth become apparent first months babys life symptoms differs types synostosis first sagittal synostosis scaphocephaly premature fusion suture top head sagittal suture forces head grow long narrow rather wide scaphocephaly common type craniosynostosis one called coronal synostosis anterior plagiocephaly premature fusion coronal suture one structures run ear sagittal suture top head may force babys forehead flatten affected side may also raise eye socket cause deviated nose slanted skull bicoronal synostosis brachycephaly coronal sutures fuse prematurely baby may flat elevated forehead browcitation needed first physical exam doctors examine babys head abnormalities suture ridges look facial deformities also utilizes computerized tomography scan babys skull fused sutures identifiable absences xrays also may used measure precise dimensions babys skull using technique called cephalometrycitation needed genetic testing doctor suspects babys misshapen skull caused underlying hereditary syndrome genetic testing may help identify syndrome genetic tests usually require blood sample depending type abnormality suspected doctor may take sample babys hair skin tissue cells inside cheek sample sent lab analysiscitation needed two less common types mcgillivray syndromes metopic synostosis trigonocephaly metopic suture runs babys nose sagittal suture premature fusion gives scalp triangular appearance another one lambdoid synostosis posterior plagiocephaly rare form craniosynostosis involves lambdoid suture runs across skull near back head may cause flattening babys head affected side misshapen head doesnt always indicate craniosynostosis example back babys head appears flattened could result birth trauma babys spending much time back condition sometimes treated customfit helmet helps mold babys head back normal positioncitation needed major treatment surgery babies type surgery would undergo differs age strength main reason surgery alleviate pressure brain create space brain developing growing would improve infants appearancecitation needed first one traditional surgery surgery make incision babys scalp cranial bones reshape portion skull sometimes plates screws often made material absorbed time used hold bones place surgery performed general anesthesia usually takes hourscitation needed surgery baby remains hospital least three days children may require second surgery later craniosynostosis reoccurs also children facial deformities often require future surgeries reshape facescitation needed another one endoscopic surgery less invasive form surgery isnt option everyone certain cases surgeon may use lighted tube endoscope inserted one two small scalp incisions affected suture surgeon opens suture enable babys brain grow normally endoscopic surgery usually takes hour causes less swelling blood loss shortens hospital stay often one day surgerycitation needed mcgillivray syndrome referenced writings virchow understanding descriptions irregular calvarial growth patterns basis law virchow according observations abnormal cranial growth observed persons craniosynostosis occurs perpendicular involved calvarial sutures therefore suture line prematurely ossified growth present direction perpendicular suture surgical treatment craniosynostosis initially advocated odilon lannelongue needed patients microcephaly craniosynostosis thought imbeciles patients accordingly underwent craniectomy remove involved suture line release brain soon linear craniectomy introduced new procedure one met much resistance however resistance surgical intervention slowly put rest mounting evidence several studies indicated craniosynostectomy treatment choice release fused suture lines skull studies showed time cranial suture areas excised strip craniectomy still became fused led abnormal cranial contourcitation needed strip craniectomy easier involved less blood loss compared newer cranial vault reconstruction strip craniectomy also address frontal bossing associated abnormalities calvarial shape relied rapid growth brain correct strip craniectomy optimal first months infancy surgeons could use cranial vault reconstruction throughout infancy consequently strip craniectomy lost favor surgical treatment modified include cranial vault remodeling recently advent endoscopy attention returned endoscopic strip craniectomy endoscopic technique tried last several years offers advantages shorter safer operation less cost less inhospital time less blood loss operation shown success study patients younger months critical success departure standard strip craniosynostectomy extensive use postoperative remodeling helmet although first introduced persing et al helmet therapy used extensively postoperative therapeutic interventioncitation needed httpsenwikipediaorgwikimcgillivraysyndrome
