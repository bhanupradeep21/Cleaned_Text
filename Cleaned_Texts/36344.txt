fatty acid metabolism consists various metabolic processes involving closely related fatty acids family molecules classified within lipid macronutrient category processes mainly divided catabolic processes generate energy anabolic processes serve building blocks catabolism fatty acids metabolized produce energy mainly form adenosine triphosphate atp compared macronutrient classes carbohydrates protein fatty acids yield atp energy per gram basis completely oxidized water beta oxidation citric acid fatty acids mainly form triglycerides therefore foremost storage form fuel animals lesser extent plants anabolism intact fatty acids important precursors triglycerides phospholipids second messengers hormones ketone bodies example phospholipids form phospholipid bilayers membranes cell
