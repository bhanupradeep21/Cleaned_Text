microsleep sudden temporary episode sleep drowsiness may last seconds individual fails respond arbitrary sensory input becomes episodes microsleep occur individual loses regains awareness brief lapse consciousness often without warning sudden shifts states wakefulness sleep behavioural terms mss may manifest droopy eyes slow eyelidclosure head electrical terms microsleeps often classified shift electroencephalography eeg hz theta wave activity replaces waking hz alpha wave background mss frequently occur result sleep deprivation however healthy individuals sleepdeprived tired also experience mss monotonous experts define microsleep according behavioral criteria head nods drooping eyelids etc others rely eeg since many ways detect mss variety contexts little agreement best identify classify microsleep episodes microsleep extremely dangerous occurs situations demand constant alertness driving motor vehicle working heavy machinery people experience microsleeps often remain unaware instead believing awake whole time temporarily lost fatalities nonfatal injuries occurring annually united states alone result drowsy driving sleep loss become public health experiencing microsleeps driving automobile perspective driver driving car suddenly realize several seconds passed unnoticed obvious driver asleep missing seconds although fact sleeping driver high risk collision microsleep historically many accidents catastrophes resulted microsleep episodes example microsleep episode claimed one factor contributing waterfall rail accident driver ie trains engineer heart attack guard ie trains conductor reacted trains increasing speed said defender microslept thus causing held unaccountable may air france plane air france flight carrying people brazil france crashed atlantic ocean killing everyone board pilot plane reported didnt sleep enough last night one hour enough handing control two copilots respond appropriately plane possible microsleep recorded part narrative verdict inquest croydon tram thus microsleeps often examined context driver drowsiness detection prevention workrelated injuries public safety incidents eg truck crashes locomotive crashes airplane crashes etc statistics microsleep episodes dangerous however risk comes potential carry cause incidents resulting lack awareness individual occurrences microsleep environment free potential environmental risk associated consequences episodes microsleep generally microsleeps characterized decrease activity wakefulnessrelated regions brain increase activity sleeprelated regions brain looking neural correlates microsleeps difficult microsleeps also triggered monotonous tasks eg driving dozing class therefore important examine neural correlates microsleep events respect experimental setups eg simulated driving setup reaction time setup etc individual variability brain structure also makes difficult diagnose microsleep events needed one study neural activity underlying mss investigated simultaneously measuring eye video response behavior eeg fmri normallyrested individuals engaged sensorymotor twenty participants tracked visual stimulus joystick minutes dimensions updownrightleft computer screen participants performed task fmri scanner joystick response right eyevideo eeg eeg electrodes fmri data recorded simultaneously participants frequent microsleeps continuous visuomotor task tracking visual stimulus screen corresponding decreased activity arousalrelated brain regions time thalamus midbrain posterior cingulate another study examined activation patterns people woke microsleeps simulated driving found upon awakening visual area frontal cortex limbic lobe activated intense activation phase frontal cortex temporal cortex primary motor area insula activated post abrupt awakening phase therefore study concluded decisionmaking activated immediately upon waking ms episode likely increasing risk injury intense decisionmaking tasks like driving surgery transition wakefulness sleep regulated variety chemicals adenosine likely causes feeling sleepy side microsleeps dopamine likely reduces microsleep events promoting wakefulness shown microsleeps correlate spontaneous pontinegeniculateoccipital pgo waves waves suppress visual processing basal ganglia pathway activated cells superior colliculus causes release dopamine disinhibited via basal ganglia leading poor processing ability microsleep currently many ways detect microsleeps however lack general consensus best way identify classify microsleeps simplest methods detect events seem psychological tests speech tests behavioral tests eg yawn test eyevideo test complex expensive ways detect microsleeps include eeg fmri eog psg tied various software platforms multiple tests used parallel detection microsleeps likely become despite attempts globally classify microsleeps detection methods particular emphasis eeg slow eyelid closure tests great variability types microsleeps people subjective selfreported psychological tests like karolinska sleepiness scale kss though widely adopted positively correlated eeg often limited utility individuals sometimes aware level future research needs focus objective microstates eg detailed electrical output briefer intervals underlie microsleep events electrical events understood terms behavioral events greater microsleep events could seamlessly distinguished states consciousness silent consciousness experienced microsleeps often tied diseases sleep apnea far significant disease tied microsleeps terms prevalence affecting roughly million diseases may tied microsleeps include narcolepsy hypersomnia schizophrenia causes excessive daytime sleepiness microsleep episodes often neglected used diagnostic indicator diseases instead clinicians use instrumentation like psg sleep study patients assess overall sleep quality laboratory microsleeps recur negatively influence daytoday living often clustered category excessive daytime sleepiness thus clinical studies related microsleeps context reducing microsleeps excessive daytime sleepiness use pharmacological interventions particularly modafinil become popular drug reduce microsleeps due stimulant effect little side effects new drugs often compared results modafinil placebo assess efficacy eg methylphenidate parkinsons disease modafinil also tested across range diseases schizophrenia narcolepsy cataplexy sleep apnea overall trajectory clinical studies relating negative symptom microsleeps seems thoroughly test modafinil across diseases compare new drugs efficacy modafinil reduce negative effects microsleeps people across spectrum diseases microsleeps sometimes side effect various drugs particularly reference dopaminestimulating drugs parkinsons disease particularly somnolence recognized adverse effect dopamine agonists pramipexole ropinirole drugs known cause suddenonset sleep spells roughly patients parkinsons disease pd therefore clinical interventions pertaining microsleeps may also encompass reducing excessive sleepiness side effect drug administration orexin antagonists daridorexant suvorexant may cause hypersomnolence microsleeps microsleeps clinically significant however individuals feel sleepy wish maintain alertness often consume overthecounter stimulants caffeine coffee specifically shown highfrequency lowdose caffeine intake effective countering poor work performance effects due extended wakefulness confirming hypothesis adenosine mediator performance decrements associated extended stimulants could decrease
