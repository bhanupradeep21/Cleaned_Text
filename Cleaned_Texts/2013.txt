genetic chimerism chimera kaɪˈmɪərə kymeerə kɪˈmɪərə kimeerə single organism composed cells one distinct genotype animals human chimeras means individual derived two zygotes include possessing blood cells different blood types subtle variations form phenotype animal chimeras produced merger two embryos plant chimeras however distinct types tissue may originate zygote difference often due mutation ordinary cell division normally genetic chimerism visible casual inspection however detected course proving contrast individual cell contains genetic material two organisms different breeds varieties species genera called another way chimerism occur animals organ transplantation giving one individual tissues developed different genome example transplantation bone marrow often determines recipients ensuing blood typecitation needed level chimerism occurs naturally wild many animal species however cases may required obligate part life cycle chimerism occurs naturally adult ceratioid anglerfish fact natural essential part life cycle male achieves adulthood begins search female using strong olfactory smell receptors male searches locates female anglerfish male less inch length bites skin releases enzyme digests skin mouth body fusing pair bloodvessel level attachment become necessary males survival eventually consume anglerfish fuse single hermaphroditic individual sometimes process one male attach single female symbiote case consumed body larger female angler fused female males reach sexual maturity developing large testicles organs atrophy process allows sperm constant supply female produces egg chimeric fish able greater number chimerism found species marine four distinct genotypes found single individual potential even greater genetic heterogeneity genotype functions independently terms reproduction different intraorganism genotypes behave single large individual terms ecological responses like shown yellow crazy ants obligate chimeras first known case species

tetragametic chimerism form congenital chimerism condition occurs fertilization two separate ova two sperm followed aggregation two blastocyst zygote stages results development organism intermingled cell lines put another way chimera formed merging two nonidentical twins similar merging presumably occurs identical twins genotypes significantly distinct resulting individual would considered chimera male female mixed intersex citations tetragametic state important implications organ stem cell transplantation chimeras typically immunologic tolerance cell linescitation needed microchimerism

genetically identical mothers observed higher rates autoimmune diseases presumably immune system responsible destroying cells common immune defect prevents also causes autoimmune problems higher rates autoimmune diseases due presence maternallyderived cells study man sclerodermalike disease autoimmune rheumatic disease female cells detected blood stream via fish fluorescence situ hybridization thought maternallyderived however form microchimerism found due vanished twin unknown whether microchimerism vanished twin might predispose individuals autoimmune diseases mothers often also cells genetically identical children people also cells genetically identical siblings maternal siblings since cells passed mother retained themcitation needed germline chimerism occurs germ cells example sperm egg cells organism genetically identical recently discovered marmosets carry reproductive cells fraternal twin siblings due placental fusion development marmosets almost always give birth fraternal organism develops come possess organs different sets chromosomes example chimera may liver composed cells one set chromosomes kidney composed cells second set chromosomes occurred humans one

individuals known halfsider animal chimera single organism composed two different populations genetically distinct cells originated different zygotes involved sexual reproduction different cells emerged zygote organism called mosaic innate chimeras formed least four parent cells two fertilised eggs early embryos fused together population cells keeps character resulting organism mixture

early stages prenatal development artificial chimerism individual one cell lineage inherited genetically time formation human embryo introduced procedure including organ transplantation blood specific
