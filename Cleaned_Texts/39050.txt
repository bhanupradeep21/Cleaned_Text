mercaptan serotonin tryptophan brain affects neurotransmitter level neuroreceptor activation autoregulation cerebral blood flow impaired associated anaerobic glycolysis oxidative stress neuronal cell astrocytes susceptible changes swell resulting increased intracranial pressure inflammatory mediators also play important unfortunately signs elevated intracranial pressure papilledema loss pupillary
