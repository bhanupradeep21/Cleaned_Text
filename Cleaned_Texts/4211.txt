consoling touch prosocial behavior involving physical contact distressed individual caregiver physical contact commonly recognized form hand hold embrace intended comfort one participating individuals consoling touch intended provide consolation alleviate lessen emotional physical type social support observed across species studies found little difference applications consoling touch minor differences frequency occurrence across cultures findings suggest degree remains unclear whether relationship social touch interpersonal emotional bonds reflect biologically driven culturally normative behavior evidence consoling touch nonhuman primates embrace one another following distressing events suggest biological numerous studies consoling touch humans animals unveil consistent physiological response embrace friend relative even stranger trigger release oxytocin dopamine serotonin neurotransmitters associated positive mood numerous health benefits cortisol stress hormone also studies found degree intimacy quality relationship consoler consoled mediates physiological words subjects experience reduced cortisol levels holding hand stranger exhibit larger effect receiving comfort trusted friend greater still holding hand high quality romantic partner importance consoling touch first explored harry frederick harlow oct dec harlow conducted controversial research rhesus monkeys observing maladaptation resulting maternalseparation social infant monkeys separated biological mothers given two inanimate surrogate mothers cheekily referred iron maidens first two surrogates constructed wire contained feeding mechanism second contained food constructed rubber soft terrycloth variations paradigm infants spent significantly time clinging cloth mother monkeys hungry leave terrycloth return eating monkeys accompanied iron maidens behaved differently novel environments complete isolation chaperoned surrogate mother monkeys explored new environments retreated surrogate startled continue exploring thereafter monkeys put novel environments without iron maiden cowered nearest corner fearful explore raised complete isolation developed marked disturbed behavior pacing cages staring blankly selfmutilation introduced rhesuss raised isolation socialize kept separate group refused eat harlow rehabilitated socially inept monkeys enclosing nonthreatening well socialized harlow observed social pair interactions calling isolate therapist upon introduction isolate huddled corner therapist reacted embracing isolate consoling touch modeling social interaction isolates indistinguishable therapists one year harlow concluded social rehabilitation possible however may critical period much like language development humans need close comforting physical contact became known contact contact comfort believed foundation attachment serves basis consoling touch extensive research documented importance physical touch human emotional physical wellbeing developmental perspective touch plays vital role infants physical cortical growth stress relief secure attachment nurturing touch positively associated childrens neuronal development thus determining

due sensitive periods brain development first year half therapeutic perspective consoling touch provides pain alleviation facilitates study young adults undergoing chemotherapy hand holding rated significantly effective coping strategy ameliorating treatmentrelated pain overwhelmingly patients preferred hold hand close relative partner consoling touch functioned reduce anxiety associated impending treatments served source security patients subjective experience treatmentrelated pain significantly reduced felt secure less tense social marshall klauss work demonstrated power social touch labour delivery found women receiving consoling touch delivery reduced labour duration reported less anxiety physical pain reduced need caesarean numerous studies conducted exploring pain mitigation consoling touch romantic partners electric shocks temperatures hot touch holding hand loved one decreases physical pain couples brought lab administered mild heat pain undergoing eeg pain ratings significantly reduced hand holding condition couples exhibited known braintobrain coupling neural means neural firing topographically temporally matches another mechanism hypothesized integral feature empathy shared experience neural synchrony easily detected couples shared experience importantly social touch neural synchrony analgesics consoling touch reduce pain perception eliminate entirely recent research shown consoling touch modulates emotional responses well study neurobehavioral correlates consoling touch examined showing participants photos recently deceased relatives undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri participant brain activity monitored two conditions either solitude holding hand significant activation varied several brain areas reduced reactivity reported anterior cingulate cortex acc cerebellum handholding acc neural connections limbic system emotional center prefrontal cortex known higher cognitive function accs location paired numerous empirical studies confirm involvement emotion pain cerebellum located brainstem classically responsible coordinating voluntary movements however recent work suggests may play role emotional valence similar fmri experiment evaluated neurological effects viewing moderately disturbing images holding hand significant connectivity anterior insula acc decreased partner touch anterior insula known emotional olfactory appraisal observed focus decreased connectivity two regions hand holding condition suggest consoling touch elicits buffering consoling touch emotional component utilizes different neural networks nerves physical sensation processing distinction described studies examining discriminative touch versus affective touch discriminative touch conveys information regarding pressure vibration stretching skin kind processing involves type nerve fibers relay information quickly brains sensory regions affective touch however involves type c nerve fibers unmyelinated slower
