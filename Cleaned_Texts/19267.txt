gross motor skills abilities usually acquired childhood part childs motor learning time reach two years age almost children able stand walk run walk stairs etc skills built upon improved better controlled throughout early childhood continue refinement throughout individuals years development adulthood gross movements come large muscle groups whole body movement skills develop headtotoe order children typically learn head control trunk stability standing walking shown children exposed outdoor play time activities develop better gross motor skills motor skills movements actions muscles typically categorized two groups gross motor skills fine motor skills gross motor skills involved movement coordination arms legs large body parts movements gross motor skills divided two subgroups locomotor skills object control skills gross locomotor skills would include running jumping sliding swimming object control skills would include throwing catching kicking fine motor skills involved smaller movements occur wrists hands fingers feet toes participate smaller actions picking objects thumb finger writing carefully even blinking two motor skills work together provide coordination less developed children focus gross movements developed children control fine movementscitation needed gross motor skills well many activities require postural control infants need control heads stabilize gaze track moving objects also must strength balance legs newborn infants voluntarily control posture within weeks though hold heads erect soon lift heads prone months age babies sit supported lap infant seat sitting independently accomplished months age standing also develops gradually across first year life months age infants usually learn pull hold chair often stand alone months new device called standing dani developed help special needs children walking upright requires able stand balance position one foot although infants usually learn walk around time first birthday neural pathways control leg alternation component walking place early age possibly even birth shown given support feet contact motorized treadmill show wellcoordinated alternating steps problem switching balance one foot babies could walk earlier tests performed crawling walking babies slopes placed front path babies decide whether safe tests proved babies learned walk know capable often went slopes safe whereas experienced walkers knew could practice big part teaching child vision effect muscle growth could slow childs process learning walk according nonprofit blind children center without special training fully capable infants visually impaired may learn crawl walk appropriate age gross fine motor skills properly develop child able see object motivation child try reach therefore want learn independently learning walk done modeling others watching children put environments older children observe try copy movements done helps child learn trial error babies imitate others picking skills lot faster creating errors visually impaired children may need physical therapy help learn gross motor skills faster one hour therapy week enough parents make sure involved process parent help telling baby direction object encourage get must patience every child developmental schedule even truer children special needs focusing progress child better focusing comparing child children humphreycitation needed observed scientists motor skills generally develop center body outward head tail babies need practice skills therefore grow strengthen better need space time explore environment use muscles tummytime good example first able lay belly floor around two months start gain muscle raise head chest ground also able go elbows also start kick bend legs lying helps prepare crawling four months able start control head hold steady sitting rolling belly back movements started five months baby start wiggle limbs strengthen crawling muscles infants start sit put weight legs hold onto something support six months enter firstyear caregivers needs active babies want get everything house needs become baby proofed babies able start reach play toys said use baby walkers devices help hold baby upright said delay process walking research found delays developing core torso strength lead different issues future around ten months able stand throughout years life different motor skills formed oswalt regards gait pattern study shows infant months old exhibit larger mediolateral motion may caused weak muscle strength lack stability also show synchronized use hip shoulder walking different mature gait pattern performed adults ankles didnt move much among infants compared adults performing mature development second year life toddlers become motorically skilled mobile longer content playpen want move place child development experts believe motor activity second year vital childs competent development restrictions except safety placed motoric months toddlers move steps carry toys reach top stairs though able get back also begin move one position another smoothly oswalt significant changes gait patterns also observed second year infants second year discordant use hip shoulder walking closer adult walking pattern also able utilize range motion ankles toes heels similar mature months move quicker run short distance along motor skills also start walk backwards circles begin run also walk stairs hands feet able hold onto handrail walk near end second year complex gross motor skills begin develop including throwing kicking skills becomes natural pedaling tricycle jumping place acquired end mobile go place place normal get small situations could dangerous walking street brain cant send information fast enough feet parents need keep eye children times oswalt majority select kinematic kinetic variables greater differences twoyearold children fouryearoldchildren four year old children six year old children variables significant differences tended displacement velocity magnitude force children disabilities young seven months learn drive power wheelchair give specific benefits leg paralyzedcitation needed chair may decrease rate development childs gross motor skills ways compensate children usually work physical therapist help leg movements walkers devices used help aide process avoid obstacles negative side limited mobility research find device encourage children explore environment gaining gross motor skills also hopefully help cochrane review found children delays associated cerebral palsy syndrome age six use treadmill may accelerate development independent early childhood critical period development fundamental motor skills children preschooler develop depending interactions surrounding environment child encouraging environment constructive feedback develop fundamental motor skills faster rate typically females perform better fundamental movement skills earlier age males although many studies prove true dominantly true walking girls typically go maturity faster boys causing also less active allows boys deemed active due fact mature much later opposing gender however give clear answer whether girls learn walk boys one would think learning walk sooner would allow higher activity level though since girls noticeably lower activity level boys one would assume would mean girls would learn walk boys since mature earlier would involve walking stage grow older children become proficient tasks allowing use high developed skill events sports motor skills highly required children master fundamental motor skills less likely participate sport games childhood adolescence one explanation boys tend less athletic opposite gender children younger age might able perform level older children ability learn improve motor skills much highercitation needed years age children enjoy simple movements hopping jumping running back forth sheer delight performing activities however findings article relationship fine gross motor ability selfperceptions selfworth children adolescents stated statistical significance athletic competence social competence correlation coefficient simply means low correlation two relationships child able perform certain gross fine motor skills mean ability demonstrate social skills conversation social awareness sensitivity body body stability focused childs dynamic body base related visual perceptions height depth study done assess motor skill development overall rate level growth development study shows preschool age children develop goaldirected behaviors plays big role learning focuses around play physical activity assessing gross motor skills children challenging essential order ensure children prepared interact environment live different tests given children measure skill age children continue actions age moving beginning able go stairs one foot step years age fully able go stairs one foot time addition improvements balance running body stability becomes mature trunk fixed posture performances fluent less influenced factors slope width middle late childhood childrens motor development becomes much smoother coordinated early age children become able control bodies increased attention span child sport help coordination well social aspectscitation needed teachers suggest students may need occupational therapists different situations students could get frustrated writing exercises difficulties writing skills also may affect teacher illegible children also may reports hands getting tired many occupational therapists today give students help need therapists used something seriously wrong child used help children best according article relationship fundamental motor skills outsideschool physical activity elementary school children developmental level overhand throwing jumping elementary kids related skill specific physical activity outside school studies done boys seen higher scores developmental level overhand throwing higher scores caltrac accelerometer rapidtrunk movement motor skill related physical activity girls seen higher scores lowerintensity physical activities physical inactivity study showed developmental level fundamental skills overhandthrowing jumping related skillspecific physical activity outside school elementary children conclude boys younger age develop fundamental motor skills quicker girls studies seen higher motor proficiency leads kids active cases athletic lead issues childhood development issues weight increasing public health epidemic childhood obesitycitation needed ages increase running speed able skip jumping also acquired better increase throwing kicking theyre able bat dribble ball age gross motor skills usually continue improving adolescence peak physical performance even though athletes keep getting better faster jumping higher lifting age reach peak performance remained virtually age functions begin decline older adults move slower younger adults moving one place another continually moving exercising regularly maintaining healthy lifestyle slow process aging individuals active biologically healthy perform motor skills higher level less active less healthy aging
