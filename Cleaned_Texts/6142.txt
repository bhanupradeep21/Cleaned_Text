including alfred russel wallace take interest idea proponents transmutation almost inclined deism idea popular among many century western intellectuals god initially created universe left operate develop natural law rather divine intervention thinkers like erasmus darwin saw transmutation species part development world natural law saw challenge traditional also believed human history
