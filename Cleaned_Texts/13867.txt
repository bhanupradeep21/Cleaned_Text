animal plant species cooperate members species members species symbiotic mutualistic humans cooperate reasons animals immediate benefit genetic relatedness reciprocity also particularly human reasons honesty signaling indirect reciprocity cultural group selection reasons cultural evolution language allows humans cooperate large scale certain studies suggested fairness affects human cooperation

unfair situations anterior insula observed image scoring participant learns counterparts prior behavior reputation promotes cooperative behavior situations direct reciprocity implies situations reputation status involved humans tend cooperate many organisms apes fish birds insects exhibit cooperative behavior teaching helping selfsacrifice coordinate solve problems author nichola raihani argues earth history teamwork collective action selfish behavior working together towards solving problem yields success engage cooperatively typically means work effort towards solving problem often ever solved cooperative effort example individuals working cooperatively especially within families made cooperation behaviors generally aggregated together accomplish major problem solving survival like migration success particularly familial success democracy instance created three key traits social comparison engagement collaboration wanting someone shares stems desire monopolize resources gradually accept divvying resources collaboration cliques teams greater communities clients watching see current interaction reacting badly sometimes everyone else waiting stop watching go elsewhere thus may provide better service client made aware ability exhibit cooperative behavior observed generosity tournaments oneupmanship behavior among people among cleaner fish example costly behavior

cooperation invariably leads individuals inculcate social interest common good help achieve cooperation common nonhuman animals besides cooperation immediate benefit actors behavior appears occur mostly relatives spending time resources assisting related individual may reduce organisms chances survival relatives share genes may increase likelihood helpers genetic traits passed future cooperative pulling paradigm experimental design used assess conditions animals cooperate involves two animals pulling rewards towards via apparatus successfully operate researchers assert cooperation complex maintain helpers may receive direct less indirect gains assisting others commonly reported furthermore insist cooperation may solely interaction two individuals may part broader goal unifying one specific form cooperation animals kin selection defined animals helping rear relatives offspring order enhance different theories explaining kin selection proposed including paytostay territory inheritance hypotheses paytostay theory suggests individuals help others rear offspring order return favor breeders allowing live land territory inheritance theory contends individuals help order improved access breeding areas breeders depart two hypotheses appear valid least cichlid studies conducted red wolves support previous contention helpers obtain immediate longterm gains cooperative breeding researchers evaluated consequences red wolves decisions stay packs extended periods time birth found delayed dispersal involved helping wolves rear offspring extended male wolves life spans findings suggest kin selection may benefit individual longterm terms increased fitness shortterm well enhanced chance research even suggests certain species provide help individuals closely related
