auditory verbal agnosia ava also known pure word deafness inability comprehend speech individuals disorder lose ability understand language repeat words write dictation patients ava describe hearing spoken language meaningless noise often though person speaking foreign however spontaneous speaking reading writing preserved maintenance ability process nonspeech auditory information including music

methods rely fixing damaged areas brain particularly important ava cases hard identify causes agnosia first place much less treat areas directly sign language therapy allows person cope work around disability much way helps deaf people beginning therapy work identifying key objects establishing initial core vocabulary signs patient graduates expand vocabulary intangible items items view present later patient learns single signs sentences consisting two signs different cases sentences first written patient asked sign speak different ava patients vary level speech comprehension sign language
