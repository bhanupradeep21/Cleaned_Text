binaural recording method recording sound uses two microphones arranged intent create stereo sound sensation listener actually room performers instruments effect often created using technique known dummy head recording wherein mannequin head fitted microphone ear binaural recording intended replay using headphones translate properly stereo speakers idea threedimensional internal form sound also translated useful advancement technology many things stethoscopes creating inhead acoustics imax movies able create threedimensional acoustic experience term binaural frequently confused synonym word
