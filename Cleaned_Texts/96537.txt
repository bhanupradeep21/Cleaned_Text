air sacs spaces within organism constant presence air among modern animals birds possess air sacs extinct dinosaurian relatives showing great increaseclarification needed pneumatization presence air birds use air sacs respiration well number theropods like aerosteon many air sacs body bones identified primitive form modern bird sauropods well known large number air pockets bones especially vertebra although one theropod deinocheirus shows rivalling number air birds system air sacs ventilation air sacs work produce unidirectional flow air enters exits lung rate contrasting lungs tetrapods mammals air enters exits lung tidal ventilation avian lungs bronchial system air flows dorsobronchi parabronchi exiting via gas exchange occurs avian pulmonary air sacs lined simple epithelial secretory cells supported elastin connective air sacs either poorly vascularized entirely gas exchange occurs within five main air sacs birds three branch ventrobronchi two branch intrapulomonary bronchus connecting dorsobronchi air sacs usually paired except clavicular air sac creating total air however morphology varies among bird species birds parrots different air sac morphologies individual air sacs also vary among bird birds gas exchange volume change occur gas exchange occurs parabronchi lungs lungs change volume much instead voluminous expansion occurs air volume changes cause pressure gradients air sacs higher gradients causing air flow parabronchi inhalation lower gradients casing air flow parabronchi different air sacs alternate contraction expansion causing air motion fundamental mechanism avian compliance air sacs related timing moving parts involved respiration birds hollow pneumatic bones hollow air spaces bird bones outside head connected air sacs way bird blocked windpipe bone broken manner inside bone connected outside world could still pneumatic bones less vascularized nonpneumatic bones many pneumatic bones pneumatic foramina openings air skeletal pneumaticity often originates developmentally offshoots air sacs especially bone pneumaticity generally found appendicular birds penguins loons solid birds temperature control occurs respiratory water vapor heats cool air inhalation trachea increases resulting evaporative water loss varies greatly depends several factors including air sac pressure subsequent rate air flow diving birds air sacs aid helping birds movement muscles involved diving cause pressure differential air sacs would cause air move would increase uptake oxygen stored respiratory penguins air sac volumes constricted deep dives protect effects water penguins found inflating air sacs dives exhale much air deepest point dives change buoyancy descending ascending air sacs play role song production songbirds related birds studies hypothesizing air sac may involved resonating pressure air air sac also heavily involved song production different males singing song similar modulations air sac changes air pressure patterns indicative respiratory muscle activity airflow around syrinx primary vocalization organ portion neural pathways control respiration vocalization changes air sac pressure control vocal pressure interclavicular air sac highly correlated fundamental frequency birdsong birdsong primarily occurs expiration therefore syllables fundamental frequency highly correlated increased interclavicular air sac changes air sac pressure also affect length trachea also affect fundamental pressure change midpoint folds syrinx action converts higher pressure higher species tyrannid sister group true songbirds birds two different sources sound around high air sac pressures two sound sources different frequencies low pressure generation bird trills involves modulation pressure air since many aspects birdsong depend air sac pressure trade trill rate duration call though studied onwards scientists generally agreed postcranial skeletons many dinosaurs contained many
