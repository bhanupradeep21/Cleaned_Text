megapalaelodus wetmore megapaloelodus extinct genus stem flamingo family palaelodidae megapaloelodus primarily known miocene america south dakota oregon north argentina south species megapaloelodus goliath found europe additionally one unnamed species discovered miocene sediments namibia due lack skull material little said ecology megapaloelodus species genus typically larger palaelodus appear inhabited similar brackish lake environments additionally may capable locking legs standing position megapaloelodus named american alden h miller basis fossil femur tarsometatarsus collected lower miocene rosebud formation south dakota recognizing similarities fossils palaelodus miller described material new genus phoenicopteriform named megapaloelodus initially miller impression megapaloelodus missing link basal palaelodus derived loye h miller described fragment tibiatarsus ulna late miocene california also referring connectens miller notes california bones presents sizable gap space time also overlapping type material established six years prior however description refers axiom things differ way thing differ reasoned californian fossil differs palaelodus similar ways fossils south dakota could belonged species although conclusion acknowledged tentative miller explained seemed reasonable establish new species fragmentary addition finds second species described juntura oregon pierce brodkorb species may also occurred south jacques cheneval published major revision palaelodids saintgérandlepuy besides agreeing prior studies synonymized many european species also transferred palaelodus goliath genus czech paleontologist jiří mlíkovský disagreed assessment instead suggested megapaloelodus synonymized palaelodus however taxonomic treatment genus whole met criticism considered premature several specimens argentina previously identified indetermined phoenicopterid described species megapaloelodus name megapaloelodus combines ancient greek word mega meaning great misspelling name palaelodus roughly translating ancient inhabitant closely related genus primarily known european deposits name chosen reflect fact first discovered megapaloelodus remains belonging connectens appeared larger already big palaelodus rendered somewhat ironic subsequent research placed palaelodus goliath megapaloelodus well various scant remains possibly belonging megapaloelodus also known across america instance remains found sharktooth hill bonebed kern county others discovered ituzaingó formation argentina prior description p one possible species megapaloelodus might even present northern sperrgebiet namibia early miocene however record based partial humerus known megapaloelodus species subsequently assignment made based fossils great many regards bones megapaloelodus closely resembles palaelodus genera instance share many characteristics tibiotarsus noticeable furrows along edge pons supratendinous lack pits cranial surface noted p kurochkini may present distinct genus palaelodid megapaloelodus differs relatives pronounced tubercle located trochlea articulates carpal bones tubercle present rounded point located upper rim articulation point coracoid clavicle overhangs two distinct pits much shallower palaelodus missing entirely modern flamingos yet also present early compared bones modern forms straightlegged birds cranes seriemas shows tendency flatten profile internal condyle tibiotarsus associated tendency birds hold tibiotarsus tarsometatarsus relatively straight one another megapaloelodus taken extreme profile simply flattened actually indented deep rounded notch accompanied large hooked process similar hook may also present profile external fossils assigned genus oftentimes identified based greater size relative palaelodus species generally smaller however overlap species example palaelodus ambiguus megapaloelodus add doubts around latters genus designation megapaloelodus opsigonos likewise overlaps size larger palaelodus belgian adelalopus oldest known palaelodid similar size megapaloelodus described slightly larger megapaloelodus species generally similar size greater megapaloelodus placed family palaelodidae group primarily neogene stemflamingos considered important link modern flamingos grebes form group mirandornithes members family include common palaelodus early adelalopus initially megapaloelodus thought intermediate palaelodus groups modern relatives later research discovered palaelodids instead formed monophyletic sister group precise internal relationships individual species family known mayr smith point various similarities megapaloelodus adelalopus currently oldest known member within genus peiranoi suggested basal member due similarities basal mirandornithes like following phylogenetic tree depicts mirandornithes recovered torres colleagues juncitarsus podicipediformes palaelodidae phoenicopterus phoenicoparrus although exact function pronounced notches hooked processes leg bones megapaloelodus known miller mentions possibility may anchored powerful ligaments according colleague suggested may allowed birds lock legs upright standing position sleeping thus stabilizing resting possible megapaloelodus much like many phoenicopteriforms inhabited lakes times may highly saline brackish shallow lake formed sediments barstow formation may freshwater given presence freshwater molluscs absence salts deposits suggested undergone cycles dry periods concentrated water still conditions fully understood local climate may wetter today allow presence palm french locality saintgérandlepuy megapaloelodus goliath known inhabited brackish lacustrine environment underwent cyclical wet dry periods megapaloelodus shared environment least two genera flamingo palaelodus may present form several species derived flamingo harrisonavis already developed curved beak group known precise ecology megapaloelodus environment remains unknown due comparative lack material particular skull currently known palaelodid preserved cranial material palaelodus shows straight bill different derived flamingos thought fed insect larvae aquatic httpsenwikipediaorgwikimegapaloelodus
