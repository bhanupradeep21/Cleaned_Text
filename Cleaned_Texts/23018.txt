christmas eye also known seasonal corneal ulcer alburywodonga syndrome harvesters eye harvesters keratitis refers seasonal epidemic corneal ulceration predominantly occurs particular region australia caused chemicals released upon death small native beetles seasonal epidemic first identified long time remained poorly understood condition commonly occurs around christmas time hence name southwest region new south wales northeast victoria christmas eye monocular meaning infection occurs one eye known extremely painful many patients actually awakened early hours mornings due major pain condition known terrible patients indicated pain torturous par giving birth tormenting children often cant communicate severity pain regardless extreme pain comes contracting christmas eye treatment management condition fairly straightforward condition healed signs ongoing damage person diagnosed christmas eye undergo minimal symptoms highly severe individual christmas eye experiences extreme eye pain swollen watery eye itchy burning lesions pain level commonly ranges score early stages could less depending degree corneal disruptions apart direct eye symptoms individual could also experience excessive lacrimation photosensitivity headaches comes clinical signs eye demonstrates corneal epithelium disturbance progresses extensive epithelial loss ranges cornea could also show corneal oedema leads thickening corneal extensive conjunctival injection enlargement conjunctival vessels conjunctival chemosis swelling tissues lines eyelids surface eye also mild reaction anterior chamber eye decreased years cause condition mystery due lack physical evidence ongoing research revealed condition caused small native beetles genus circumstantial evidence suggests beetles genus paederus staphylinidae beetles genus orthoperus corylophidae carry compound pederin hemolymph mixture blood interstitial fluid chemical released crushing insect eye causes painful temporary eye lesions also cause severe dermatitis socalled whiplash stripe across since pederin strong inhibitor protein biosynthesis blistering agent surprising causes major effect corneal christmas eye ulceration may punctate lead forming one large ulcer involves cornea often spares periphery beetle enters eye crushed released chemical pederin cause autocatalytic reaction result corneal epithelial cell death ulceration molecular level pederin inhibit mitosis disrupting dna protein synthesis overall induce acute necrotic could possible eye movements rubbing persons sleep lead precipitating confirming diagnosis important keep mind similar conditions demonstrate similar signs symptoms herpes keratitis corneal abrasion infectious corneal ulcer order diagnosis christmas eye essential take look history meaning patient prior attending emergency room day also particular attention placed timeline pain discomfort biomicroscopy show extent corneal damage amount remaining epithelium present assist providing confirmation diagnosis essential factor considering time year since christmas eye generally occurs late october early march addition higher pain level likely christmas eye presentation patients condition generally arrive hospital severe pain hand leave affected eye due amount pain time frame pain usually instantaneous causes individual wake early hours morning increasing eye pain pain continues increase regardless persons best attempt reduce aggravation addition stain fluorescein demonstrates bright green splash cornea epithelium surrounding area infected eye often disrupted demonstrates considerable amount early stages desquamation starts patchy progresses covering corneal surface iritis corneal stroma breech bowmans layer ulceration accompanied conjunctivitis without mucus pus addition oedema lids lastly regional lymphadenopathy second eye christmas eye diagnosed treatment simple straightforward keep mind corneal epithelium heal rapidly epithelium begins recover pain levels start diminish mind first approach treatment would control reduce pain begin patient would given topical anesthesia reduce pain pain slightly reduced documented photo epithelial loss corneal thickness specific results used checkups results obtained bandage silicone hydrogel contact lens inserted infected eye patient prescribed chloramphenicol eye drops apply four times day eye drops essential treating bacterial infection preventing growth patient also take oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medication example nurofen patient leaves hospital need return every two three days review corneal epithelium healed healed bandage removed patient start using aft hylo forte eye drops daily two weeks treatment reduce severe dryness eye two weeks patient return final known christmas eye seasonal condition means order prevent exposure toxin individuals australia extremely cautious summer specifically outside activities like gardening mowing christmas eye contagious majority patients get condition heal perfectly without ongoing visual loss ulcers healing without scaring pain lasts epithelium regenerated hours vision regeneration may take days rarely weeks patients generally get back normal vision fully repaired leftover signs corneal early research suggests people frequently affected summer period middecember midjanuary southwest new south wales northeast victoria people elsewhere patients often describe near body water previous evening first cases usually occur daytime temperature approaches typically late november condition appears geographically limited far determined syndrome occurred large numbers outside southwest slopes plains new south wales statistically however majority cases occur northeast severity christmas eye continues vary year year leads improving treatment management painful condition currently new research christmas eye many new cases christmas eye largely seen december robert holloway bscoptom revisited condition christmas eye publication optometry australia indicated encountered three cases localized area stromal thinning corneal response treatment appears expected fourday mark corneal inflammation oedema seem remain inflammation reduced stroma appears thin corneal topography changes show area depression due leads vision addition also came across another patient experienced development discshape intrastromal corneal scar fiveday mark developed discshaped subepithelial lesion marked corneal thickening next six months cornea involved proceeded flatten thin density corneal scarring also decreased year later lesion still present much less dense corneal thickness become stabilized regardless lesion cause slight blur mild flare night corneal ulcer httpsenwikipediaorgwikichristmaseye
