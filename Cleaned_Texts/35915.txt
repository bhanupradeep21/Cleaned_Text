caseids cotylorhynchus would suggest semiaquatic hypothesis however disputed kenneth angielczyk christian kammerer well robert reisz colleagues based paleontological taphonomic data combined absence large caseids morphological adaptations aquatic lifestyle however authors yet provide alternative explanations internal bone structure large werneburg colleagues think lalieudorhynchus large caseids general could semiquatic lifestyle comparable hippopotamuses spending time water practicing kind subaquatic walking rather swimming possibly returning land feed terrestrial plants however
