rhineceps extinct genus temnospondyl amphibian family rhineceps found northern malawi formerly nyasaland southern africa known type species r nyasaensis rhineceps late permian mya semiaquatic carnivore lived streams rivers lakes rhineceps early divergent stereopondyl within family rhinesuchidae existed late permian lopingian failed survive permiantriassic extinction unlike stereospondyl rhineceps originally discovered upper bone beds chiweta beds north waller area northern fossil first described named haughton whereby describes fossil left mandibular ramus r nyasaensis within genus rhinesuchus due similarity fossils rhinesuchus watson later determined letter parrington original fossil actually anterior end right ramus left watson described fossils newly found locality collected parrington fossils r nyasaensis determined watson also placed r nyasaensis part new genus rhineceps distinct rhinesuchus rhineceps belongs family rhinesuchidae within clade stereospondyli temnospondyl clade recently morphology historical placement phylogenetic analysis placed rhineceps sister group rhinesuchus within rhinesuchinae early diverging group rhineceps rhinesuchus broomianus rhinesuchus whaitsi uranocentrodon senskalensis broomistega putterelli australerpeton serra de cadeado shortsnouted laccosaurus watsoni rhinesuchus capensis rhinesuchoides tenuiceps marsicano et al created new phylogeny places rhineceps sister group uranocentrodon rather within rhinesuchinae longer monophyletic australerpeton rhinesuchoides capensis rhinesuchoides tenuiceps rhineceps uranocentrodon broomistega rhinesuchus laccosaurus discrepancy clearly describing phylogenetic relationships likely due adaptive radiation stereospondylomorphs took place late permian early terrestrial temnospondyls devastated period caused selective pressures semiaquatic fully aquatic temnospondyls acquire many new niches relatively short time rhineceps mediumsized semiaquatic carnivorous basal stereospondyl lopingian lived fresh water bodies including rivers lakes lagoons diets mainly stereospondyls historically compared contemporary crocodilians giant salamanders due similar position freshwater however likely existed niche unique independent crocodilians giant niche differences inferred cranial stress structural patterns along labyrinthodont dentition labyrinthodonty refers infolding enamel dentine within morphology rhineceps thus likely restricts ability hunt specific ways crocodilians giant salamanders sweeping sideways bites rhineceps also used unique morphology service catching prey including strong powerful bite palatal tooth row grasp hold fish many temnospondyls including rhineceps likely shared certain physiological characteristics modern amphibians directly observed fossil record rhineceps likely possessed heightened phenotypic plasticity among juvenile individuals like seen modern plasticity allowed physiological changes organisms lifetime alter morphology development specific different environmental factors plasticity means stereospondyls adaptively radiate many different species rhineceps like temnospondyls ecological indicator species like modern amphibians thus likely sensitive chemical changes uv radiation mutagens within rhineceps like modern amphibians obligatory aquatic rhineceps like stereospondyls result evolutionary gigantism resulted stunted metamorphosis morphological differences adults metamorphosis likely lost stereospondyls extreme phenotypic plasticity allowed environmental acclimation changes morphology without needing binary developmental life history larval adult eventually led neoteny whereby larval stage morphologically similar adult stereospondyls including rhineceps gradual changes juvenile adult stages fossils suggest presence type metamorphosis major greater ambiguity created stereospondyls including rhineceps traits traditionally associated metamorphosis including amphibious dermal presence types gills

explanation contradiction known bystrows paradox temnospondyls internal gills external gills external gills present larvae internal gills homologous osteichthyes bony fish gills later become modern amphibian thus rhineceps larvae likely external gills adult rhineceps internal gills although difficult confirm given lack evidence metamorphosis stereospondyls including rhineceps rhineceps

sedimentary rocks span carboniferous period jurassic period sedimentary layers created sediment shed lakes rivers near gondwanide mountains continent rhineceps found upper bone beds chiweta beds north waller area northern malawi south central sedimentary rocks chiweta beds originated mostly river sediments often contain fossil bones surrounded pedogenic lacustrine lake derived sediment contain bone instead contains pollen used identify age range chiweta beds less overlap stratigraphic ranges specific therapsid taxa place cistecephalus assemblage zone chiweta beds zone rhineceps found within

aquatic carnivorous late permian also characterized reductions biodiversity limited number existing genera groups temnospondyls existed terrestrially went extinct consequently stereospondyls
