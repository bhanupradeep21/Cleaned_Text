careful studies life history fungi contribution understanding algae higher plants established landmarks born frankfurt physician august theodor de bary emilie meyer de bary anton de bary one ten joined excursions naturalists collected local specimens de bary interest inspired george fresenius physician also taught botany senckenberg institute fresenius expert thallophytes de bary graduated gymnasium frankfurt began study medicine heidelberg continuing marburg went berlin continue pursuing study medicine also continued explore develop interest plant science although received degree medicine dissertation berlin titled de plantarum generatione sexuali botanical subject also published book fungi causes rusts graduation de bary briefly practiced medicine frankfurt drawn back botany became privatdozent botany university tübingen worked assistant hugo von mohl succeeded botanist karl wilhelm von nägeli freiburg established advanced botanical laboratory time directed many de bary moved university halle successor professor diederich franz leonhard von schlechtendal hugo von mohl cofounded pioneer botanical journal botanische zeitung de bary became coeditor later sole editor editor contributor journal exercised great influence upon development botany following francoprussian war de bary took position professor botany university director jardin botanique de luniversité de strasbourg founder new also elected inaugural rector reorganized conducted much research university botanical institute attracted many international students made large contribution development book vergleichende morphologie und biologie der pilze mycetozoen und bakterien translated english comparative morphology biology fungi mycetozoa bacteria clarendon press de bary devoted study life history fungi time various fungi still considered arise via spontaneous proved pathogenic fungi like plants products secretions sick de bary time potato late blight caused sweeping crop devastation economic loss origin plant diseases known time de bary studied pathogen phytophthora infestans formerly peronospora infestans elucidated life miles joseph berkeley insisted oomycete found potato blight caused disease similarly de bary asserted rust smut fungi caused pathological changes affected diseased plants concluded uredinales ustilaginales de bary spent much time studying morphology fungi noticed certain forms classed separate species actually successive stages development organism de bary studied developmental history myxomycetes slime molds thought necessary reclassify lower animals first coined term mycetozoa include lower animals slime molds work myxomycetes pointed one stage life cycle plasmodial stage nearlyformless motile masses substance félix dujardin called sarcode protoplasm fundamental basis protoplasmic theory de bary first demonstrate sexuality fungi observed conjugation alga spirogyra described sexual reproduction fungus peronospora sp saw importance observing pathogens throughout whole life cycle attempted follow practice studies living host de bary published first work potato blight fungi spent years studying peronosporeae particularly phytophthora infestans formerly peronospora infestans cystopus albugo parasites potato published work entitled recherches sur le developpement de quelques champignons parasites reported inoculating healthy potato leaves spores p infestans observed mycelium penetrated leaf affected tissue forming conidia black spots characteristic potato blight similar experiments tubers potato stalks watched conidia soil infection tubers observing mycelium could survive cold winter tubers based studies concluded organisms generated thorough investigation puccinia graminis pathogen produces rust wheat rye grains noticed p graminis produced reddish summer spores urediospores darker winter spores teleutospores inoculated leaves barberry berberis vulgaris sporidia winter spores wheat rust sporidia germinated leading forming aecia yellow spores familiar symptoms infection barberry de bary inoculated aecidiospores moistureretaining slides transferred leaves seedling rye plants time observed reddish summer spores appearing leaves sporidia winter spores germinated barberry de bary clearly demonstrated p graminis lived upon different hosts different stages development called phenomenon heteroecism contrast autoecism development takes place one host de bary discovery explained practice eradicating barberry plants important control de bary also studied formation lichens result association fungus alga traced stages growth reproduction showed adaptations helped survive conditions drought winter coined word symbiosis meaning living together unlike organisms publication die erscheinung der symbiose strasbourg carefully studied morphology molds yeasts fungi basically established mycology independent de barys concept methods great impact fields bacteriology botany making one influential bioscientists published research many students later became distinguished botanists microbiologists including sergei winogradsky william gilson farlow pierremariealexis millardet de bary married
