reproduction contrast offspring sexual organisms contain random mixtures parents chromosomes produced independent assortment related process called homologous recombination sexual organisms exchange dna two matching recombination reassortment alter allele frequencies instead change alleles associated producing offspring new combinations sex usually increases genetic variation may increase rate twofold cost sex first described john maynard first cost sexually dimorphic species one two sexes bear young cost apply hermaphroditic species like plants many invertebrates second cost individual

three offspring produced possibly survive conditions produce competition organisms survival reproduction consequently organisms traits give advantage competitors likely pass traits next generation traits confer teleonomy quality whereby process natural selection creates preserves traits seemingly fitted functional roles consequences selection include nonrandom genetic hitchhiking central concept natural selection evolutionary fitness fitness measured organisms ability survive reproduce determines size genetic contribution next however fitness total number offspring instead fitness indicated proportion subsequent generations carry organisms example organism could survive well reproduce rapidly offspring small weak survive organism would make little genetic contribution future generations would thus low allele increases fitness alleles gene generation allele higher probability becoming common within population traits said selected examples traits increase fitness enhanced survival increased fecundity conversely lower fitness caused less beneficial deleterious allele results allele likely becoming selected importantly fitness allele fixed characteristic environment

despite diversity various species concepts various concepts placed one three broad philosophical approaches interbreeding ecological biological species concept bsc classic example interbreeding approach defined evolutionary biologist ernst mayr bsc states species groups actually potentially interbreeding natural populations reproductively isolated despite wide longterm use bsc like species concepts without controversy example genetic recombination among prokaryotes intrinsic aspect called species researchers attempted unifying monistic definition species others adopt pluralistic approach suggest may different ways logically interpret definition barriers reproduction two diverging sexual populations required populations become new species gene flow may slow process spreading new genetic variants also populations depending far two species diverged since recent common ancestor may still possible produce offspring horses donkeys mating produce hybrids generally infertile

laboratory conditions sexually reproducing organisms speciation results reproductive isolation followed genealogical divergence four primary geographic modes speciation common animals allopatric speciation occurs populations initially isolated geographically habitat fragmentation migration selection conditions produce rapid changes appearance behaviour selection drift act independently populations isolated rest species separation may eventually produce organisms second mode speciation peripatric speciation occurs small populations organisms become isolated new environment differs allopatric speciation isolated populations numerically much smaller parental population founder effect causes rapid speciation increase inbreeding increases selection homozygotes leading rapid genetic third mode parapatric speciation similar peripatric speciation small population enters new habitat differs physical separation two populations instead speciation results evolution mechanisms reduce gene flow two generally occurs drastic change environment within parental species habitat one example grass anthoxanthum odoratum undergo parapatric speciation response localised metal pollution plants evolve resistance high levels metals soil selection interbreeding metalsensitive parental population produced gradual change flowering time metalresistant plants eventually produced complete reproductive isolation selection hybrids two populations may cause reinforcement evolution traits promote mating within species well character displacement two species become distinct finally sympatric speciation species diverge without geographic isolation changes habitat form rare since even small amount gene flow may remove genetic differences parts generally sympatric speciation animals requires evolution genetic differences nonrandom mating allow reproductive isolation one type sympatric speciation involves crossbreeding two related species produce new hybrid species common animals animal hybrids usually sterile meiosis homologous chromosomes parent different species successfully pair however common plants plants often double number chromosomes form allows chromosomes parental species form matching pairs meiosis since parents chromosomes represented pair example speciation event plant species arabidopsis thaliana arabidopsis arenosa crossbred give new species arabidopsis happened years speciation process repeated laboratory allows study genetic mechanisms involved indeed chromosome doubling within species may common cause reproductive isolation half
