lie detection assessment verbal statement goal reveal possible intentional deceit lie detection may refer cognitive process detecting deception evaluating message content well nonverbal also may refer questioning techniques used along technology record physiological functions ascertain truth falsehood response latter commonly used law enforcement united states rarely countries based pseudoscience wide variety technologies available common long used measure polygraph comprehensive review national academy sciences existing research concluded little basis expectation polygraph test could extremely high evidence substantiate nonverbal lie detection looking body language effective way detect lies even widely used law cumulative research evidence suggests machines detect deception better

avoid statements ownership distance stories avoid taking responsibility behavior also using negative emotion words hate worthless sad second use exclusionary words except distinguishing recently evidence provided work ca morgan iii ga hazlett computer analysis cognitive interview derived speech content ie response length unique word count provides method detecting deception demonstrably better professional judgments professionals useful distinguishing genuine false adult claims exposure highly stressful potentially traumatic method shows particular promise non confrontational well scientifically cross culturally valid typically three types questions used polygraph testing voice stress analysis testing irrelevant questions establish baseline compare answers asking simple questions clear true false answers comparison questions indirect relationship event circumstance designed encourage subject lie relevant questions compared comparison questions represent false answers irrelevant questions represent true answers whatever particularly question control question test cqt uses control questions known answers serve physiological baseline order compare questions relevant particular incident control question greater physiological response truth told lesser physiological response guilty knowledge test gkt multiplechoice format answer choices one correct answer additional incorrect answers read physiological response recorded controls incorrect alternative answers greater physiological response correct point determine subject knowledge particular addition test skewing towards finding people innocent also issues offenders might greater physiological response control question specific question making difficult determine guilt using method even people using specific techniques try trick although issues cqt falsepositive falsenegative rates discussed also methodological issues proponents cqt determine accuracy due fact accuracy cqt often determined whether individual given test provides police confession crime test administered means cases someone cleared charges taking polygraph worsecase scenario gives false confession actually innocent taken account comes determining accuracy another issue due cqt administered liedetection process works people determined deceptive interrogated means polygraph outcome confession independent one another making difficult use confessions sole determiner accuracy methodological problems provide false evidence supports continued use test despite many flaws test could said including test police tool useful might sometimes provide accurate information probability causing undue hardship people actually innocent wasting time process makes unreliable method law enforcement officers considered biased
