incorporated thyroid hormone precursor localize label precisely within thyroid tissue leblond attempted use novel technique autoradiography unfortunately leblonds first attempt use autoradiography failed reason isotope extremely short halflife minutes disintegrated quickly little radioactivity remained detected photographic emulsion leblond moved mcgill university lecturer histology quickly

autoradiographic technique advised physicist pierre demers melt emulsion eastman kodak lantern slides paint directly sections develop emulsion still attached histologic sections resulted tenfold improvement subsequently leblond colleagues developed technique histologic slides dipped directly liquid use thinner sections emulsion coats led advances resolution introduction tritium technical milestone high resolution autoradiography procedure continues used today molecular biologists detect rna molecules situ study localization genes dna sequences leblond used autoradiography introduce radioactive precursors dna examine renewal fate cells several basic tissue types demonstrated first time cells tissues adult body undergo continued renewal using mathematical models modern methods quantitation leblond colleagues estimated remarkable accuracy turnover mitotic rates numerous cell types colleagues made fascinating discoveries resulted introduction time dimension cells tissues
