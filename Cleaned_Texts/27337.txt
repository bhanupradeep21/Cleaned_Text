glycine receptors inhibitory glycine receptors ligandgated chloride channels facilitate fast responses brainstem spinalcord homomeric glycine receptors composed exclusively subunits exhibit normal ion channel electrophysiology sequestered synaptic wildtype glycine receptors thus presumed pentameric heteromers beta subunits either within heteromers believed subunits bind glycine undergo
