paul peter two connected lakes located michigans upper peninsula near wisconsin border vilas county wi gogebic county paul peter kettle lakes type lake formed peter lake larger area acres maximum depth meters paul lake area acres maximum depth lakes part university notre dame environmental research center lakes bogs streams marshes underc located within deciduous coniferous surrounding forest made mostly sugar maple yellow birch balsam two lakes ideal performing whole lake experiments since one lake receive treatments remain control fishing allowed making two connected lakes ideal studying fish populations lakes basins also located within underc meaning outside interference occur lakes dimictic freezing november mixing fall partially mixing paul peter lakes part complex wetland forest ecosystem animal diversity high surrounding area lakes wetlands home amphibians green frogs redbacked salamanders well reptiles common snapping turtles white tailed deer beavers bobcats inhabit surrounding forest variety birds including ospreys hawks bald eagles also found area mosses common given areas wet lakes important native fish species largemouth bass trout added lakes part experiment examining effects hydrated lime trout would later die replaced native largemouth paul peter lakes used multiple significant ecological studies due ideal experimental conditions one experiment found ecosystem collapses predicted monitoring lakes physical biological chemical properties researchers introduced large carnivorous fish peter lake paul used control disrupt ecosystem addition large fish resulted decreasing populations small fish turn caused daphnia populations increase phytoplankton become less abundant collapses significant shifts difficult fix able predict changes going occur crucial preserving threatened ecosystems however resources required sufficiently monitor ecosystems extensive might always paul peter also used experiment examining trophic cascades lake ecosystems researchers hypothesized primary producers would respond strongly nutrient enrichment lakes three trophic levels lakes fourth trophic level paul peter lakes food webs influential species minnows golden shiners fathead minnow small fish feed zooplankton added peter lake largemouth bass removed prior experiment added bass died winter fertilizer added peter lake results peter lake compared west long lake another lake underc dominated larger fish study demonstrated lakes piscivorous fish lower amounts chlorophyll primary production lakes dominated planktivorous fish study also found inverse relationship planktivore biomass biomass daphnia inverse relationship crustacean mean size chlorophyll primary one study found carbon surrounding terrestrial ecosystem largely leaves entering lakes makes significant portion carbon peter paul particulate carbon zooplankton found terrestrial origin carbon surrounding forest supplements carbon produced aquatic plants allowing larger zooplankton fish populations given results study researchers concluded fish made algae fish also partly made maple study tested bacterial response added peter lake keeping primary production low paul lake peter lake fertilized increase primary production allowed researchers determine extent bacteria utilized carbon primary production study found bacteria use autochthonous primary production lake allochthonous terrestrial watershed carbon however bacteria seem use autochthonous carbon allochthonous another study examining source dissolved organic carbon doc performed peter paul lakes peter lake received added nutrients increase primary production lakes received inorganic origin doc examined nutrient addition peter lake color lakes used help analyze results doc terrestrial origin much colored doc originating primary production sources carbon important lakes clear trend observed comparing colorgross primary production percent doc coming lakes primary twenty seven year experiment beginning researchers removed native fish added rainbow trout lakes hydrated lime precipitates organic substances added peter lake increased euphotic zone depth meters hydrated lime later added increased euphotic zone depth meters lakes sediment examined look zooplankton remains researchers found rainbow trout fed mostly daphnia zooplankton content type daphnia dominant peter shifted smaller species addition hydrated lime even though paul lake received change dominant fish species peter lake shift zooplankton species occurred reason shift peter lake occurred increased transparency oxygen euphotic zone depth addition hydrated lime changes made easier rainbow trout see catch another study examined changes thermal structures peter paul lakes dissolved oxygen measured various intervals test effectively estimated mixed layer depth dissolved oxygen measured day time measurements taken could throw mixed layer depth example measurements taken morning would estimate deeper mixed layer depth measurements taken afternoon higher temperatures would estimate shallower mixed layer depths also cause calculations respiration primary production inaccurate since mixed layer depth used winter
