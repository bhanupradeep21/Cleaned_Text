zeroacquaintance situation requires perceiver make judgment target perceiver prior social interaction judgments made using variety cues including brief interactions target video recordings target photographs target observations targets personal environments among others zeroacquaintance studies targets actual personality determined targets selfrating andor ratings close acquaintances target consensus ratings determined consistently perceivers rate targets personality compared raters accuracy ratings determined well perceivers ratings target compare targets selfratings scale targets close acquaintances ratings target zeroacquaintance judgments regularly made daytoday life given judgments tend remain stable even length interaction increases influence important interpersonal outcomes study zeroacquaintance personality judgments developed cleeton knights intent demonstrate futility using physical criteria predict unobservable individual traits order accomplish cleeton knight recruited target participants national fraternities sororities large group close acquaintances organizations could rate eight traits ie individual traits included sound judgment intellectual capacity frankness willpower ability make friends leadership originality impulsiveness target participants cleeton knight asked group strangers rate eight traits target participant viewing target participant distance minutes measuring several objective physical traits target participants cranium size eye width cleeton knight found physical traits unrelated close acquaintances ratings unobservable individual traits however found strangers rating unfamiliar individuals traits reliable strangers tended rate targets personality similarly although ratings inaccurate became apparent raters must using similar indicators make judgements individual traits passini norman found comparable evidence strangers provide similar ratings unobservable personality traits target participant prior acquaintanceship introductory undergraduate psychology course students previous interactions placed groups asked complete personality ratings member group given strangers tended rate target participants personality similarly passini norman posited common observable characteristics must informing judgements year taft demonstrated strangers make judgments personality accurately chance accurately close acquaintances findings went unnoticed twenty years albright kenny malloy revived interest formally coined term zeroacquaintance personality judgments researchers established certain physical appearance variables including attractiveness type dress formal neatness perceived age informed strangers zeroacquaintance personality judgments ratings strangers similar targets selfrating traits sociable responsible ratings target attractiveness informed judgements sociability formality neatness dress informed judgements responsibility consensus zeroacquaintance studies refers degree multiple perceivers target make similar judgments targets personality even momentary interaction multiple perceivers come conclusion aspects persons personality different explanations exist phenomenon one explanation called similar meaning explanation posits consensus arises raters agree meaning information use make personality judgments aspect individual facial expressions posture appears meaning perceiver example smile erect stance might indicator extraversion one five traits fivefactor model personality perceivers therefore raters provide similar extraversion ratings necessarily mean ratings accurate perceivers rated individual similarly stereotypes also influence consensus across perceivers perceivers target individual hold stereotypes target use making personality judgments consensus higher example one gender may stereotypically considered less emotionally stable neuroticism assuming perceivers hold stereotype make similar emotional stability ratings targets gender assume stereotype valid fact common stereotypes may prove invalid use stereotype multiple perceivers result consistent inaccurate ratings high consensus low accuracy worth noting different personality traits show different levels consensus traits five factor model personality conscientiousness extraversion tend show higher levels consensus agreeableness tends demonstrate least patterns findings suggest traits easily judged brief interactions likely agreed upon others example facial expressions often indicate levels extraversion easily detected brief meetings pictures video clips perceivers tend agree traits facial expressions convey therefore consensus tends higher extraversion consensus also result beliefs targets physical attractiveness traits commonly associated attractive individuals example extraversion often associated physical attractiveness perceivers tend agree targets physical attractiveness consensus extraversion generally studies examining differences consensus across big five traits found consensus ratings extraversion tend around compared consensus numbers indicate similarly raters view targets personality higher numbers indicating greater consensus particular trait agreeableness consensus score virtually agreement across raters targets level agreeableness extraversion much consensus targets level extraversion studies also examined differences consensus zeroacquaintance raters raters long acquainted target extraversion consensus ratings seem similar zeroacquaintance longterm acquaintance traits longterm acquaintance ratings tend converge much zeroacquaintance ratings example ratings agreeableness demonstrate consensus estimates longterm acquaintances raters compared zeroacquaintance familiar target individual tend agree personality traits much individuals know target exception extraversion study findings suggest extraversion fairly observable trait person whether know target people interpret social cues related extraversion quite similarly determine perceiver zeroacquaintance context made accurate judgment targets personality perceiver ratings compared targets ratings degree two ratings converge known accuracy peer ratings people frequent contact individual rated also used determine accuracy perceiver ratings target converge peer ratings target accuracy established accuracy achieved perceivers use known good information target make ratings information good actually represents trait rated example smile actually reflective extraversion accuracy increased perceivers use smiles influence extraversion ratings notion known realistic accuracy model david c funder perceivers utilize good information ratings ignore bad irrelevant information accuracy increases mentioned selfratings peerratings target used calculate accuracy fact several researchers suggest best combine selfreports peer reports measuring accuracy selfreport inventory helps eliminate flaws measure increase confidence accuracy measure accurate combined rating usually average peer selfscore correlated zeroacquaintance perceiver ratings determine accuracy termed gold standard personality like consensus accuracy greater traits others fact similar pattern consensus exists extraversion conscientiousness ratings tending accurate agreeableness openness ratings least accurate fivefactor model personality likely due traitrelevant information available perceivers zeroacquaintance settings example photographs information present accurately reflects conscientiousness extraversion cleanliness facial expressions reflects agreeableness sociabilityrelated traits typically found easiest judge raters little acquaintance targets since extraversion largely measures social tendencies makes sense highest consensus accuracy found extraversion ratings peer raters little interaction targets demonstrated validities compared validities stark difference validity suggests agreeableness much harder judge accuracy rater unfamiliar target conscientiousness also demonstrated relatively high accuracy rater unacquainted validity validity coefficient tells us related raters judgments targets ratings personality validity coefficient extraversion fairly high compared validity coefficient indicates absolutely relationship two sets ratings raters acquainted targets rating appears length time actually able observe person doesnt strong influence accuracy behavioral judgments made raters little seconds make judgment target level accuracy four five hours suggests several cues person displayed short window time across ratings time windows accuracy similar results zeroacquaintance also important note zeroacquaintance judgments accurate particular traits easy judge research generally shows greater acquaintance someone target accurate ratings classic study showed big five traits average higher validity acquaintances strangers increase accuracy acquaintances compared later study examined topic extended period time order better test acquaintance effect ratings people asked rate targets multiple points time ratings became accurate similar targets selfratings time got know target better weeks accuracy ratings across big five traits increased demonstrates phenomenon known acquaintance effect time people get know someone better better able estimate targets true personality recent research employing zeroacquaintance situations largely focused traits judged consistently accurately contexts common contexts zeroacquaintance judgments allow observation targets physical appearance information physical attributes generally garnered one two ways observation photographs observation ratings typically come video sound recordings example borkenau liebler asked perceivers view either silent video audio video audio targets entering room sitting reading script perceivers provided accurate judgements extraversion agreeableness audio visual cues conscientiousness accurate visual cues alone interest photographs continued increase recent years given widespread use images social media sites example naumann vazire rentfrow gosling found perceivers make accurate judgments targets targets appear spontaneous strike pose photographs nonexpressive full body photographs specifically perceivers able accurately judge extraversion selfesteem religiosity using nonexpressive full body photograph target struck pose however perceiver able judge extraversion agreeableness emotional stability openness likeability selfesteem loneliness religiosity political orientation degree accuracy recent study exploring accuracy personality judgments selfie profile pictures qiu lu yang qu zhu found perceivers accurately predict openness selfies ratings formed impressions targets emotional positivity zeroacquaintance personality judgments also made artifacts personal belongings social media profiles gosling colleagues found perceivers accurately rate targets personality observing bedrooms offices observing bedrooms perceivers could accurately rate extraversion agreeableness conscientiousness emotional stability openness experience observing offices however perceivers could accurately rate extraversion conscientiousness openness experience researchers also found cues informed rating personality instance neatness informed judgments conscientiousness whereas variety quantity books informed judgements openness experience recently back et al investigated well perceivers could make judgements targets viewing social media profiles either facebook studivz researchers found perceivers could accurately predict extraversion agreeableness conscientiousness openness target simply perusing social media profile personality judgments made zeroacquaintance contexts extremely common daytoday life seen studies referenced previously personality impressions formed extremely brief physical personal world becomes increasingly virtual zeroacquaintance judgments becoming even popular people turn online profiles infer peoples personalities use professional interpersonal contexts judgments important implications influence decision engage individual example employees presented job application picture fictitious future manager zeroacquaintance judgments personality predicted employees willingness work hypothetical furthermore research indicated first personality impressions remain relatively stable time even extent interaction target person increases words first impressions created zeroacquaintance contexts hard change thus predictive outcomes example student impressions instructor first day class shown relatively consistent impressions class concluded thus judgments predicted student course additionally interviewer first impressions interviewees shown influence amount information provided interviewer interview well communication style rapport despite research demonstrating stability zeroacquaintance judgments well accuracy consensus many questions still remain example researchers begun examine different forms zeroacquaintance judgments compare one another words likely one trait may better judged particular context eg photographs different trait may accurately judged via different context eg video recordings research needed order determine exactly traits best judged contexts additionally possible different zeroacquaintance contexts may provide conflicting information regarding perceiver encounters sources information unknown source would emphasized perceivers judgments additionally weight particular perceiver attributes one source another may influenced characteristics perceiver situation future research needed investigate possibility finally role culture demographics zeroacquaintance judgments identified area ripe perceivers different cultures may judge source information different ways additionally sources information eg writing samples portray culture demographics lesser extent others eg photographs may lead important differences judgments made research begun delve questions many remain unanswered httpsenwikipediaorgwikizeroacquaintancepersonalityjudgments
