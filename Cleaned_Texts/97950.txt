reinkes edema swelling vocal cords due fluid edema collected within reinkes first identified german anatomist friedrich b reinke reinkes space gelatinous layer vocal cord located underneath outer cells vocal person speaks reinkes space vibrates allow sound produced phonation reinkes space sometimes referred superficial lamina reinkes edema characterized saclike appearance fluidfilled vocal swelling vocal folds causes voice become deep hoarse therefore major symptom reinkes edema hoarseness similar laryngitis major cause associated reinkes edema smoking fact percent patients diagnosed reinkes edema habitual smokers identified risk factors include overuse vocal cords gastroesophageal reflux disease often cited women men lower voice changes noticeable first cases reinkes edema recorded followed f reinke investigations reinke injected stained glue superficial lamina propria reinkes space mimic reinkes edema considered benign noncancercous polyp protrusion represents benign laryngeal treatment reinkes edema starts elimination associated risk factors smoking gastric reflux hypothyroidism advanced cases may undergo phonosurgery remove fluid vocal list common symptoms reinkes edema characterized saclike appearance vocal edema white translucent fluid causes bulging distension vocal common clinical symptom associated reinkes edema abnormally low pitched voice hoarseness low pitch voice direct result increased fluid reinkes space vibrates lower frequency normal females hz males hoarseness common problem many laryngeal diseases laryngitis described harsh breathy tone voice hoarseness often seen alongside dysphonia condition individual difficulty producing sounds speech swelling vocal cords lowering voice warning signs individual reinkes edema microscopic level examination vocal cords patients reinkes edema show lowered levels collagen elastin extracellular matrix characteristics used diagnose reinkes edema reinkes edema considered benign tumor polyp may become precancerous smoking indicator cancer development leukoplakia manifests white patches vocal smoking gastric reflux hypothyroidism risk factors reinkes edema symptoms reinkes edema considered chronic symptoms develop gradually time depend long individual exposed risk factor case smoking long individual continues habit smoking reinkes edema continue progress true risk factors well untreated gastric reflux overuse voice common professions singers radio smoking number one cause reinkes edema factors include gastroesophageal reflux hypothyroidism chronic overuse voice smoking reflux risk factors may lead additionally combination several risk factors increase likelihood individual developing reinkes edema example individual smokes also gastric reflux would increased susceptibility developing reinkes edema reinkes edema commonly diagnosed middleaged females history smoking aged years older males lower pitched voices females males less likely observe significant changes voice therefore less likely seek treatment females also report physical discomfort due reinkes edema risk reinkes edema increases age also prolonged exposure smoking additionally individuals professions require constant use voice singers teachers radio hosts may increased risk developing disease heavily linked smoking established way screen reinkes edema similarly way prevent reinkes edema avoid smoking adopting nonsmoking lifestyle diagnosed reinkes edema possible stop diseases progression although possible reverse therefore critical maintain nonsmoking lifestyle even surgery fluid reemerge fact many cases surgeons perform surgery without guarantee individual stop vocal cords consist five layers cells order humans produce sound speech vocal folds must readily vibrate two layers vocal cords vibrate reinkes space overlying epithelium fact layers move freely rigid intermediate deep lamina accumulation fluid within reinkes space alters elasticity vocal cord making less stiff gelatinous slows vocal cord vibration results deepened hoarse voice men normally lower voice women change noticeable edema usually occurs vocal cords known bilateral reinkes pathophysiology mechanism reinkes edema well known however chemicals contained within cigarette smoke associated increased vascular permeability blood vessels results fluid leaking reinkes space normally vocal cords surrounded neatly aligned blood vessels however blood vessels become disarranged fragile reinkes addition cigarette smoke create reactive oxygen species alter environment vocal cords tissue analysis reinkes edema shows decreased amounts proteins fibronectin elastin collagens iii extracellular matrix proteins leads overall decreased stiffness tissue layer vibrates slowly produces deeper sounding progression reinkes edema gradual directly related duration exposure risk factors smoking gastric disease progression divided two types pale livid pale type defined glazed appearance vocal cords clear colorless fluid underneath represents early stage disease advanced livid type reinkes edema identified increased amount fluid accompanied fluid color change colorless swelling vocal folds cause balloonedlike appearance known polyp polyps reinkes edema usually benign however may risk cancer patient smoker additionally edema becomes severe patients may experience difficulty breathing due airway reinkes edema often diagnosed ear nose throat ent specialist otorhinolaryngologist otolaryngologist examination vocal folds cords first doctor review patients medical history symptoms hoarseness dysphonia reduced vocal range familial hereditary link reinkes edema doctor need know patient habitual smoker patients history reviewed vocal cords visualized using laryngoscopy technique tube camera endoscope passed nose laryngoscopes rigid flexible flexible laryngoscopes fiber laryngoscopes allow patient produce sound tube placed therefore allows doctor visualize movement vocal use rigid laryngoscopes generally requires general anaesthesia due discomfort involved distracting soft tissues mouth pharynx based results laryngoscopy reinkes edema classified using standardized system set place yonekawa system characterizes disease based yonekawa evaluation needed stroboscopy used examine mucosal waves vocal mucosal waves describe waves produced vibration vocal cords speech stroboscopes produce flashes light timed patients vocal frequency every time light flashed create still frame image vocal cords particular moment time combined produce image wave case reinkes edema structural changes vocal cords result abnormal wave first step treating reinkes edema eliminate control risk factors causing disease includes cessation smoking control gastroesophageal reflux using antacids proton pump inhibitors discontinuation activities cause vocal experiencing hoarseness voice may choose undergo voice therapy improve voices quality cases reinkes edema caused long term usage cigarettes case important make lifestyle changes stop smoking resolve improve edema cessation smoking halt diseases elimination risk factors sufficient improve patients symptoms surgery may required common type surgery performed today reinkes edema called surgical procedures follow microflap technique set place surgery incision made vocal cord using either microscissors carbon dioxide laser flap mucous membrane lifted affected tissue removed using suction flap redraped trimmed appropriate cases reinkes edema bilateral vocal rather unilateral case bilateral edema surgeon must choose whether operate side vocal cord two separate surgeries operate sides single complication associated removing tissue sides single surgery raw cut ends vocal cords may form anterior glottis web two sides grow together continuous complications surgery include tissue scarring due damage vocal ligament incision vocal cord stiffening due oversuctioning superficial lamina propria reinkes surgical microlaryngoscopy associated risks left untreated reinkes edema lead variety longterm complications besides dysphonia impaired sound production speech serious complications airway obstruction due severe inflammation vocal cords risk complications decreased drastically creation new tools laser surgical microlaryngoscopy hirano microflap method developed discuss vocal common procedure used correct reinkes edema vocal stripping often performed without magnification monocular laryngoscope instead binocular scope led major complications vocal ligament scarring women likely men undergo surgery due greater change vocal pitch quality surgery capable restoring voice condition smoking resumed surgery reinkes edema lifelimiting pathology unless tissue becomes recent studies examined role specific cell types reinkes edema including role vocal cord fibroblasts normal tissue spindleshaped fibroblasts produce extracellular matrix proteins collagen elastin recent findings shown morphological change fibroblasts extracted tissue reinkes edema dendriticlike shape several protrusions large populations altered fibroblasts found surrounding areas edema lack normal expression several cluster differentiation cd proteins express additional proteins expressed normal vocal cord cigarette smoke discovered increase prostaglandin expression fibroblasts could explain role cigarette smoke reinkes smoking clear risk factor reinkes edema others investigated explain reinkes edema nonsmokers research suggested role bacterial colonies nonneoplastic lesions reinkes edema one study using pyrosequencing thirtyone fortyfour nonneoplastic lesions sampled found streptococcus pseudopneumoniae bacterial strains dominant bacteria present species streptococcus present every lesion analyzed representing bacteria found specifically within reinkes edema lesions bacteria across vocal fold lesions sequenced smoking gastric reflux vocal abuse widely agreed upon literature risk factors reinkes edema altered bacterial cultures could developed diagnostic tool majority research within last ten years focuses improving surgery reinkes edema due importance reinkes space speech important minimallyinvasive techniques perfected minimize risk complications carbon dioxide laser successfully incorporated surgical technique several lasers investigated use reinkes edema include
