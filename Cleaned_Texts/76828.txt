consists assessment heart rate respiratory effort muscle tone reflex irritability generalized skin color apgar scoring performed one minute five minutes birth scoring ranges indicating severe neonatal distress indicating smooth transition extrauterine newborns transitioning extrauterine life undergo periods reactivity periods divided three stages first stage occurs first minutes life stage infant alert responsive heart rate peaking beats per minute stabilizes baseline rate beats per minute crackles upon auscultation irregular respirations normal finding second stage decrease responsiveness motor activity often manifested sleep period last hours third stage marks second period reactivity period occur anywhere first hours birth lasts anywhere minutes several hours tachycardia tachypnea may present brief periods passing meconium also physiology utero placenta delivers oxygenated blood fetus umbilical vein upon delivery umbilical cord cut cardiovascular system must adapt blood rises removed placenta powerful stimulus infant start breathing breathing sharply increases lungs thus quickly reverting hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction held pulmonary vascular resistance high uterine life lung ventilation also extends far convoluted shrunk pulmonary vessels also contributing quick marked drop pulmonary vascular resistance result much higher proportion right ventricle output flows pulmonary vessels systemic circulation ductus arteriosus detachment placenta causes increase systemic vascular resistance leads increase pressure gradient left left atrium higher pressure right atrium causing foramen ovale close within first minutes birth blood begins flow lefttoright ductus arteriosus causes significant increase output left ventricle increase stroke volume subsequently calcium channel activity increases potassium channel decreases furthering ductal constriction functional closure ductus arteriosus occurs within first hours permanent closure following within weeks lastly cardiac output increases nearly double utero cardiovascular system changes result adaptation fetal circulation patterns adult circulation pattern transition types congenital heart disease symptomatic utero fetal circulation present cyanosis respiratory signs manifestations newborn cries reversal blood flow foramen ovale causes newborn appear mildly cyanotic first days life heart rate newborn beats per minute common heart rate irregular first hours following birth heart sounds variation pitch duration intensity adult blood pressure readings range mm hg systolic mm hg diastolic mean arterial pressure weeks gestation birth within first hour birth may drop mm hg systolic blood delayed cord clamping defined waiting minutes clamp newborns umbilical cord proven beneficial improving hematocrit iron also decreasing anemia benefits last months assessmentsinterventions assessment monitoring vital signs skin color important detecting cardiovascular issues infant apical pulse rate auscultated one full minute newborn calm sleeping irregular heart rate first hours life related crying another outside factor monitored blood pressure taken appropriately sized cuff preferably newborn rest consistent tachycardia evaluated conditions anemia hyperthermia hypovolemia sepsis consistent bradycardia could indication congenital heart block hypoxemia pallor central cyanosis cyanosis hands feet common normal finding also indicate cardiovascular physiology upon birth newborns lungs become center gas exchange variety factors influence newborn respiratory functions factors include chemical mechanical thermal sensory respirations begin fetal aortic carotid chemoreceptors stimulated varying concentrations oxygen carbon dioxide vaginal birth newborns chest compressed birth canal upon delivery negative pressure allows air lungs first cries infant allow alveoli expansion absorption fetal lung fluid temperature changes sensory stimulation contributes respiratory function well manifestations breathing patterns often irregular shallow infants respiration rate breaths per minute preference nasal breathing ribs expands horizontally breath sounds clear equal lungs abdominal breathing normal acrocyanosis normal assessmentsinterventions suctioning nasal oral secretions promotes fluid clearance auscultation lung sounds assess abnormalities pulse oximetry performed determine oxygen saturation monitor signs respiratory distress nasal flaring grunting central physiology birth newborn cut mothers glucose supply begin rely stored fat energy glycogen stores maximal term within
