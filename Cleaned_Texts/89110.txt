need belong fundamental psychological motivation according roy baumeister mark leary human beings need certain minimum quantity regular satisfying social interactions inability meet need results loneliness mental distress strong desire form new several psychologists proposed individual differences peoples motivation belong people strong motivation belong less satisfied relationships tend relatively lonely consumers tend seek opinions others products services also attempt influence others according baumeister leary much human beings done service belongingness argue many human needs documented needs power intimacy approval achievement affiliation driven need belong human culture compelled conditioned pressure belong need belong form attachments universal among humans counters freudian argument sexuality aggression major driving psychological forces believe need belong major psychological drive also believe humans naturally driven toward establishing sustaining relationships belongingness example interactions strangers potential first steps towards developing nonhostile longterm connections satisfy one attachment needs certain people socially deprived exhibit physical behavioral psychological problems stress cultures attachments form universally social bonds easily formed without need favorable settings need belong goaldirected activity people try satisfy certain minimum number social contacts quality interactions important quantity interactions people form social attachments beyond minimal amount experience less satisfaction extra relationships well stress terminating extra relationships people also effectively replace lost relationship partners substituting new relationships social environments example individuals strong family ties could compensate loneliness relationships missing regular contact characterized strong feelings commitment intimacy also fail satisfy need knowing bond exists may emotionally comforting yet would provide feeling full belongingness lack interaction persons belongingness hypothesis proposes two main features first people need constant positive personal interactions people second people need know bond stable mutual concern attachment continue need belong need intimate attachments need connections perception bond important bond individuals need know people care wellbeing love baumeister leary argue much research group bonds interpreted lens belongingness argue plenty evidence suggests social bonds formed easily classic robbers cave study stranger boys randomly grouped two different groups almost immediately group identification strong loyalty developed specific group initially two groups asked compete one another hostility groups however two groups combined form one big group given opportunity bond working together accomplish superordinate goals behaviors emotions accommodated quickly new group attempt understand causes ingroup favoritism researchers formed group minimal insignificant one would expect favoritism would found yet ingroup favoritism appeared researchers agree banding together threat outgroup sharing rewards primary reasons groups form bond easily mere proximity another powerful factor relationship formation like babies form attachments caregivers people develop attachments live near one another suggests proximity sometimes overcomes tendencies bond others similar us positive social bonds form easily fearful circumstances military veterans undergone heavy battle together explained either misattribution interpreting feelings anxious arousal feelings attraction another person reinforcement theory presence another person reduces distress elicits positive responses baumeister leary argue reinforcement theory explanation provides evidence importance belonging needs learned associations create tendency seek company others times threat formation social attachments former rivals great indicator need belong belonging motivations strong able overcome competitive feelings towards people form close attachments one another hesitant breaking social bonds universally people distress protest ending social relationships across cultures age even temporary groups training groups struggle idea group may eventually dissolve group may fulfilled purpose participants want cling relationships social bonds formed one another group members make promises individually collectively stay touch plan future reunions take steps ensure continuity attachment example two people may speak entire year continue exchanging holiday cards people want risk damaging relationship breaking attachment people hesitant breaking social bonds many cases hesitant dissolve even bad relationships could potentially destructive example many women unwilling leave abusive spouses boyfriends excuses ranging liking abuse economic selfinterests important physical unwillingness leave abusive partner whether mentally physically another indicator power need belong reluctant individuals break bonds breaking attachment causes pain deeply rooted need people experience range positive negative emotions strongest emotions linked attachment belongingness empirical evidence suggests individuals accepted welcomed included leads individuals feel positive emotions happiness elation calm satisfaction however individuals rejected excluded feel strong negative emotions anxiety jealousy depression grief fact psychological pain caused social rejection intense involves brain regions involved experience physical positive negative reactions emotion connected status relationship existence social attachment changes way one emotionally responds actions relationship partner emotions potential lack constant positive relationships linked large range consequences people lack belongingness prone behavioral problems criminality suicide suffer increasing mental physical illness based evidence multiple diverse problems caused lack belongingness attachments therefore seems appropriate regard belongingness attachments need rather simply relationships centrally important way people think interpersonal relationships belongingness hypothesis suggests people devote much cognitive thought process interpersonal relationships attachments example researchers found people store information terms social bonds storing information marriage partner opposed work acquaintance people also sort outgroup members basis characteristics traits duties whereas sort ingroup members person categories cognitive processing organizes information person connection opposed strangers researchers group people take turns reading loud found greatest recall words personally spoke well words spoken dating partners close friends cognitive merging self specific people followed need belong flattering words said spouse enhance self positively people always believe nothing bad happen extend thought family emotional implication belongingness positive affect linked increases belongingness negative affect linked decreases belongingness positive emotions associated forming social attachments experience falling love long love mutual unrequited love love without belongingness usually leads disappointment whereas belongingness love leads joy occasions childbirth new employment fraternitysorority pledging associated formation new social attachments surrounded positive emotions forming bonds cause joy especially bond given permanent status wedding weddings signify permanent commitment complete social bond committing spouses need belong positive experiences shared emotions increases attraction others close personal attachments rich network friends high levels intimacy motivation correlated happiness breaking social bonds threats bonds primary sources negative affect people feel anxious depressed guilty lonely lose important relationships social exclusion common cause anxiety anxiety natural consequence separated others examples include

belongingness needs truly met social contact social contact shield people loneliness loneliness matters lack intimacy opposed lack contact another negative affect guilt caused make person want maintain relationship paying attention divorce death two negative events spoil need belong divorce causes distress anger loneliness depression almost everyone death oneself people traumatic stressful events people experience death cause severe depression reaction loss loved one loss attachment person example death spouse marriage problems still elicit extreme sadness loss attachment death linked
