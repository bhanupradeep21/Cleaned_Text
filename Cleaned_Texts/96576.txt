arsine iupac name arsane inorganic compound formula flammable pyrophoric highly toxic pnictogen hydride gas one simplest compounds despite lethality finds applications semiconductor industry synthesis organoarsenic compounds term arsine commonly used describe class organoarsenic compounds formula r aryl alkyl example called triphenylarsine referred arsine standard state arsine colorless
