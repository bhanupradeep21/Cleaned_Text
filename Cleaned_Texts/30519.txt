major organ endocrine system anterior pituitary also called adenohypophysis pars anterior glandular anterior lobe together posterior lobe posterior pituitary neurohypophysis makes pituitary gland hypophysis anterior pituitary regulates several physiological processes including stress growth reproduction lactation proper functioning anterior pituitary organs regulates often ascertained via blood tests measure hormone levels pituitary gland sits protective bony enclosure called sella turcica turkish chairsaddle composed three lobes anterior intermediate posterior lobes many animals lobes
