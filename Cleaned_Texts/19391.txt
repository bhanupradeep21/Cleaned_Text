closedsource hardware development early pandemic review opensource ventilators stated tested peerreviewed systems lacked complete documentation open systems documented either early stages design essentially basically tested author speculated pandemic would motivate development would significantly improve opensource ventilators much work policies regulations funding would needed opensource ventilators achieve medicalgrade number features required invasive mechanical ventilator safely used requirements noninvasive ventilation less strict march open source ventilator ireland osv group initially goal building focus team ireland begin development termed field emergency ventilator fev inspired initial efforts open source medical supplies initially focused developing open ventilators quickly refocusing mainly local production personal protective experiment osv ireland partnered openlung canada developing publishing open source designs via group quickly grew amassing volunteer engineers designers medical professionals goal developing new low resource medical interventions support perceived lack mechanical ventilation equipment globally wellknown bag valve mask bvm quickly became core functional component goal utilizing printed traditionally manufactured components localized assembly systems maximise potential manufacturing capabilities around globe open source
