intention tremor dyskinetic disorder characterized broad coarse lowfrequency hz tremor evident deliberate visuallyguided movement hence name intention tremor intention tremor usually perpendicular direction movement experiencing intention tremor one often overshoots undershoots ones target condition known intention tremor result dysfunction cerebellum particularly side tremor lateral zone controls visually guided movements depending location cerebellar damage tremors either unilateral several causes discovered date including damage degradation cerebellum due neurodegenerative diseases trauma tumor stroke toxicity currently pharmacological treatment established success seen using treatments designed essential patients intention tremors usually complain difficulties activities daily living including drinking cup grabbing utensils eat problems coordination eye object ambulation associated cerebellar signs include nystagmus dysmetria dysdiadochokinesia hypotonia proprioception

fatigue seem result damage part brain tremors instead seem temporary worsening small tremor present every human tremors generally go away persistent intention tremors often caused damage certain regions brain common cause damage andor degeneration cerebellum part brain responsible motor coordination posture balance especially fine motor movements cerebellum damaged person may difficulty executing fine motor movement attempting touch ones nose ones finger one common way cerebellum become damaged development cerebellar common site cerebellar lesions lead intention tremors reported superior cerebellar peduncle fibers carrying information midbrain pass dentate nucleus also responsible linking cerebellum rest alcohol abuse one typical cause damage cerebellum alcohol abuse causes degeneration anterior vermis cerebellum leads inability process fine motor movements individual development intention tremors ms damage occurs due demyelination neuron death produce cerebellar lesions inability neurons transmit tight association damage cerebellum intention tremors often referred cerebellar intention tremors also caused result damage brainstem thalamus structures involved

amplitude mri used locate damage degradation cerebellum may causing intention tremor focal lesions neoplasms tumors hemorrhages demyelination damage may causing dysfunction cerebellum correspondingly intention physical tests easy way determine severity intention tremor impairment physical activity common tests used assess intention tremor fingertonose heeltoshin tests fingertonose test physician individual touch nose finger monitoring irregularity timing control movement individual intention tremors coarse sidetoside movements increase severity finger approaches nose similarly heeltoshin test evaluates intention tremors lower extremities test individual supine position places one heel top opposite knee instructed slide heel shin ankle monitored coarse irregular sidetoside movement heel approaches anklecitation needed important historical elements diagnosis intention tremor secondary symptoms commonly observed dysarthria speech disorder characterized poor articulation slurred speech nystagmus rapid involuntary eye movement especially rolling eyes gait problems abnormality walking postural tremor titubation toandfro movements neck trunk postural tremor may also accompany intention
