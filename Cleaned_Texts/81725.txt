prepulse inhibition ppi neurological phenomenon weaker prestimulus prepulse inhibits reaction organism subsequent strong reflexeliciting stimulus pulse often using startle reflex stimuli usually acoustic tactile stimuli eg via air puffs onto light also used prepulse inhibition high corresponding onetime startle response reduced reduction amplitude startle reflects ability nervous system temporarily adapt strong sensory stimulus preceding weaker signal given warn organism ppi detected numerous species including mice humans although extent adaptation affects numerous systems comfortable measure muscular reactions normally diminished result nervous inhibition deficits prepulse inhibition manifest inability filter unnecessary information linked abnormalities sensorimotor gating deficits noted patients conditions like schizophrenia alzheimers disease people influence drugs surgical manipulations mutations human studies ppi summarised reviews braff et al swerdlow et al
