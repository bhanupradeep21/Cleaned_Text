suprachiasmatic nucleus scn using technique histochemistry yasuhiko ibatas laboratory kyoto prefectural university medicine established quantitative histochemistry suprachiasmatic nucleus scn together shinichi inouye established vitro slice cultures scn early hajime tei yoshiyuki sakaki hitoshi okamura discovered mammalian period gene mice humans also discovered mammalian homolog drosophila gene found lightinducible phase shift circadian clock okamura worked jay dunlap chronobiologist specializing circadian rhythms neurospora show mammalian clocks similar neurospora clocks use induction phase
