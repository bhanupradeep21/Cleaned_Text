dysarthria speech sound disorder resulting neurological injury motor component characterized poor articulation words condition problems effectively occur muscles help produce speech often making difficult pronounce words unrelated problems understanding language dysphasia although person speech subsystems respiration phonation resonance prosody articulation affected leading impairments

experience challenges following examples specific observations include continuous breathy voice irregular breakdown articulation monopitch distorted vowels word flow without pauses articulation problems resulting dysarthria treated speech language pathologists using variety techniques techniques used depend effect dysarthria control articulators traditional treatments target correction deficits rate articulation prosody appropriate emphasis inflection affected eg apraxia speech right hemisphere brain damage etc intensity loudness voice affected eg hypokinetic dysarthrias parkinsons resonance ability alter vocal tract resonating spaces correct speech sounds phonation control vocal folds appropriate voice quality valving airway treatments usually involved exercises increase strength control articulator muscles may flaccid weak overly tight difficult move using alternate speaking techniques increase speaker intelligibility well someones speech understood peers pathologist several skills important learn safe chewing swallowing techniques avoiding conversations feeling tired repeat words syllables order learn proper mouth movements techniques deal frustration speaking depending severity dysarthria another possibility includes learning use computer flip cards order communicate recent techniques based principles motor learning pml lsvt lee silverman voice speech therapy specifically lsvt may improve voice speech function parkinsons aim retrain speech skills building new generalised motor programs attach great importance regular practice peerpartner support selfmanagement regularity practice practice main issues pml treatments may determine likelihood generalization new motor skills therefore effective treatment iscitation needed augmentative alternative communication aac devices make coping dysarthria easier include speech synthesis textbased telephones allow people unintelligible may later stages progressive illness continue able communicate without
