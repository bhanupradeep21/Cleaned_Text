wheat allergy allergy wheat typically presents food allergy also contact allergy resulting occupational exposure like allergies wheat allergy involves immunoglobulin e mast cell response typically allergy limited seed storage proteins wheat reactions restricted wheat proteins others react across many varieties seeds plant tissues wheat allergy rare prevalence adults found study wheat allergy
