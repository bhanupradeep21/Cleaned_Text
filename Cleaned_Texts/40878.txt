planetary oceanography also called astrooceanography study oceans planets moons earth unlike planetary sciences like astrobiology astrochemistry planetary geology began discovery underground oceans saturns moon jupiters moon field remains speculative missions reach oceans beneath rock ice layer moons many theories oceans even ocean worlds celestial bodies solar system oceans made diamond neptune gigantic ocean liquid hydrogen may exist underneath jupiters early geologic histories mars venus theorized large water oceans mars ocean hypothesis suggests nearly third surface mars covered water runaway greenhouse effect may boiled away global ocean venus compounds salts ammonia dissolved water lower freezing point water might exist large quantities extraterrestrial environments brine convecting ice unconfirmed oceans speculated beneath surface many dwarf planets natural satellites notably ocean moon europa estimated twice water volume earths solar systems giant planets also thought liquid atmospheric layers yet confirmed compositions oceans may also exist exoplanets exomoons including surface oceans liquid water within circumstellar habitable zone ocean planets hypothetical type planet surface completely covered extraterrestrial oceans may composed water elements compounds confirmed large stable bodies extraterrestrial surface liquids lakes titan made hydrocarbons instead water however strong evidence subsurface water oceans existence elsewhere solar system bestestablished candidates subsurface water oceans solar system jupiters moons europa ganymede callisto saturns moons enceladus although earth known planet large stable bodies liquid water surface one solar system celestial bodies thought large june nasa scientists reported likely exoplanets oceans may common milky way galaxy based mathematical modeling inner structure gas giants remain poorly understood scientists suspect extreme pressure hydrogen would act supercritical fluid hence likelihood oceans liquid hydrogen deep interior gas giants like oceans liquid carbon hypothesized exist ice giants notably neptune magma oceans exist periods accretion planet natural satellites planet natural satellite completely partly gas giants jupiter saturn thought lack surfaces instead stratum liquid hydrogen however planetary geology well understood possibility ice giants uranus neptune hot highly compressed supercritical water thick atmospheres hypothesised although composition still fully understood study wiktorowicz ingersall ruled possibility water ocean existing though studies suggested exotic oceans liquid diamond mars ocean hypothesis suggests nearly third surface mars covered water though water mars longer oceanic much residing ice caps possibility continues studied along reasons apparent disappearance astronomers think venus may liquid water perhaps oceans billion years global layer liquid water thick enough decouple crust mantle thought present natural satellites titan europa enceladus less certainty callisto magma ocean thought present geysers fumaroles found saturns moon enceladus possibly originating ocean kilometers mi beneath surface ice icy moons may also internal oceans may internal oceans large bodies liquid hydrocarbons thought present surface titan although large enough considered oceans sometimes referred lakes seas space mission initially discovered appeared dry lakebeds empty river channels suggesting titan lost surface liquids might later flybys titan provided radar infrared images showed series hydrocarbon lakes colder polar regions titan thought subsurface liquidwater ocean ice addition hydrocarbon mix forms atop outer crust ceres appears differentiated rocky core icy mantle may harbour liquidwater ocean enough known larger transneptunian objects determine whether differentiated bodies capable supporting oceans although models radioactive decay suggest eris sedna orcus oceans beneath solid icy crusts approximately km june astronomers reported evidence dwarf planet pluto may subsurface ocean consequently may habitable first planets natural satellites outside solar system likely oceans including possible water ocean planets similar earth habitable zone liquidwater belt detection oceans even spectroscopy method however likely extremely difficult inconclusive theoretical models used predict high probability gj b detected transit composed exotic form ice vii making making ocean planet possible candidates merely speculative based mass position habitable zone include planet though little actually known composition scientists speculate may oceanlike models proposed gliese could include surface oceans gliese b speculated ocean hot exomoons orbiting planets particularly gas giants within parent stars habitable zone may theoretically surface oceans terrestrial planets acquire water accretion buried magma ocean go steam atmosphere atmosphere cools collapse surface forming ocean also outgassing water mantle magma happen even planets low percentage mass composed water superearth exoplanets may expected commonly produce water oceans within tens hundreds millions years last major accretionary oceans seas lakes bodies liquids composed liquids water example hydrocarbon lakes titan possibility seas nitrogen triton also considered ruled evidence icy surfaces moons ganymede callisto europa titan enceladus shells floating oceans dense liquid water extrasolar terrestrial planets extremely close parent star tidally locked one half planet magma also possible terrestrial planets magma oceans point formation result giant hot neptunes close star could lose atmospheres via hydrodynamic escape leaving behind cores various liquids suitable temperatures pressures volatile chemicals might exist liquids abundant quantities planets include ammonia argon carbon disulfide ethane hydrazine hydrogen hydrogen cyanide hydrogen sulfide methane neon nitrogen nitric oxide phosphine silane sulfuric acid supercritical fluids although liquids share various properties liquids underneath thick atmospheres planets uranus neptune expected planets composed oceans hot
