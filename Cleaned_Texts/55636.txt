neurodevelopmental disorders group conditions begin produce symptoms childhood development nervous system according american psychiatric association diagnostic statistical manual mental disorders fifth edition published conditions generally appear early childhood usually children start school persist key characteristic disorders negatively impact persons functioning one domains life personal social academic occupational depending disorder deficits caused disorders levels impairment exist spectrum affected individuals experience varying degrees symptoms deficits despite classifies neurodevelopmental disorders six overarching groups disorders commonly comorbid conditions meaning person affected one disorders usually meet criteria second intellectual disabilities ids intellectual development disorder defined deficits general mental affect persons ability process information learn retain information think critically abstractly solve problems ultimately inhibit persons ability adapt surroundings extent individuals may fail meet milestones independent functioning social responsibility one activities daily global developmental delay gdd categorized intellectual disability diagnosed individual fails meet expected developmental milestones several areas intellectual communication disorder autism spectrum disorder asd attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd motor disorders including developmental coordination disorder stereotypic movement disorder tic disorders tourettes syndrome cas apraxia speech specific learning disorders neurodevelopmental research projects examining potential new classifications disorders including multitude neurodevelopmental disorders span wide range associated symptoms severity resulting different degrees mental emotional physical economic consequences individuals turn families social groups development nervous system tightly regulated timed influenced genetic programs prenatal environment significant deviation normal developmental trajectory early life result missing abnormal neuronal architecture temporal spatial complexity developmental trajectory many potential causes neurodevelopmental disorders may affect different areas nervous system different times ages range social deprivation genetic metabolic diseases immune disorders infectious diseases nutritional factors physical trauma toxic prenatal environmental factors neurodevelopmental disorders autism pervasive developmental disorders considered multifactorial syndromes many causes converge specific neurodevelopmental deprivation social

example genetically determined neurodevelopmental disorder trisomy also known syndrome disorder usually results extra chromosome although uncommon instances related chromosomal abnormalities translocation genetic material characterized short stature epicanthal eyelid folds abnormal fingerprints palm prints heart defects poor muscle tone delay neurological development intellectual disabilities delay intellectual less commonly known genetically determined neurodevelopmental disorders include fragile x syndrome fragile x syndrome first described martin bell studying persons family history sexlinked mental rett syndrome another xlinked disorder produces severe functional williams syndrome caused small deletions genetic material chromosome common recurrent copy number variant disorder deletion syndrome formerly digeorge velocardiofacial syndrome followed praderwilli syndrome angelman immune reactions pregnancy maternal developing child may produce neurodevelopmental disorders one typical immune reaction infants children pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated streptococcal another disorder sydenhams chorea results abnormal

one following epidemic strep infectioncitation needed systemic infections result neurodevelopmental consequences occur infancy childhood humans would called primary neurodevelopmental disorder example infections head brain like brain abscesses meningitis encephalitis high risk causing neurodevelopmental problems eventually disorder example measles progress subacute sclerosing panencephalitis number infectious diseases transmitted congenitally either birth cause serious neurodevelopmental problems example viruses hsv cmv rubella congenital rubella syndrome zika virus bacteria like treponema pallidum congenital syphilis may progress neurosyphilis remains untreated protozoa like toxoplasma cause congenital toxoplasmosis multiple cysts brain organs leading variety neurological deficits cases schizophrenia may related congenital infections though majority unknown metabolic disorders either mother child cause neurodevelopmental disorders two examples diabetes mellitus multifactorial disorder phenylketonuria inborn error metabolism many inherited diseases may directly affect childs metabolism neural less commonly indirectly affect child gestation see also teratology child type diabetes produce neurodevelopmental damage effects excess insufficient glucose problems continue may worsen throughout childhood diabetes well type diabetes may preceded onset impaired cognitive nondiabetic fetus also subjected glucose effects mother undetected gestational diabetes maternal diabetes causes excessive birth size making harder infant pass birth canal without injury directly produce early neurodevelopmental deficits usually neurodevelopmental symptoms decrease later phenylketonuria also known pku induce neurodevelopmental problems children pku require strict diet prevent intellectual disability disorders maternal form pku excessive maternal phenylalanine absorbed fetus even fetus inherited disease produce intellectual disability nutrition disorders nutritional deficits may cause neurodevelopmental disorders spina bifida rarely occurring anencephaly neural tube defects malformation dysfunction nervous system supporting structures leading serious physical disability emotional sequelae common nutritional cause neural tube defects folic acid deficiency mother b vitamin usually found fruits vegetables whole grains milk neural tube defects also caused medications environmental causes many interfere folate metabolism thus considered multifactorial another deficiency iodine deficiency produces spectrum neurodevelopmental disorders ranging mild emotional disturbance severe intellectual disability see also congenital iodine deficiency excesses maternal infant diets may cause disorders well foods food supplements proving toxic large amounts instance kl jones dw smith university washington medical school seattle found pattern craniofacial limb cardiovascular defects associated prenatal onset growth deficiency developmental delay children alcoholic mothers called fetal alcohol syndrome significant symptom overlap several entirely unrelated neurodevelopmental brain trauma developing human common cause injuries per year us alone without clear information many produce developmental neurodevelopmental syndromes may subdivided two major categories congenital injury including injury resulting otherwise uncomplicated premature injury occurring infancy childhood common causes congenital injury asphyxia obstruction trachea hypoxia lack oxygen brain mechanical trauma birth process although clear yet strong correlation placenta brain growing number studies linking placenta fetal brain neurodevelopmental disorders diagnosed evaluating presence characteristic symptoms behaviors child typically parent guardian teacher responsible adult raised concerns neurodevelopmental disorders may also confirmed genetic testing traditionally disease related genetic genomic factors detected karyotype analysis detects clinically significant
