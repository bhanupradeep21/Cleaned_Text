kind threat usually harboring kind toxin color also serves inferential cue prime motor interpretation persuasive contrast difference luminance andor color helps make object distinguishable important edge detection serves cue auditory cue sound signal represents incoming sign received ears causing brain hear results receiving processing cues collectively known sense hearing subject research within fields psychology cognitive science neurobiology auditory system humans animals allows individuals assimilate information surroundings represented sound waves sound waves first pass pinnae auditory canal parts ear comprise outer ear sound reaches tympanic membrane middle ear also known eardrum tympanic membrane sets malleus incus stapes vibration stapes transmits vibrations inner ear pushing membrane covering oval window separates middle inner ear inner ear contains cochlea liquidfilled structure containing hair cells cells serve transform incoming vibration electrical signals transmitted brain auditory nerve carries signal generated hair cells away inner ear towards auditory receiving area cortex signal travels fibers several subcortical structures primary auditory receiving area temporal humans use several cues determine location given stimuli mainly using timing difference ears cues allow individuals identify elevation height stimuli relative individual azimuth angle sound relative direction individual facing unless sound directly front behind individual sound stimuli slightly different distance travel reach ear difference distance causes slight delay time signal perceived ear magnitude interaural time difference greater signal comes side head thus time delay allows humans accurately predict location incoming sound cues interaural level difference caused difference sound pressure level reaching two ears head blocks sound waves ear causing less intense sound reach level difference two ears allows humans accurately predict azimuth auditory signal effect occurs sounds high spectral cue monaural single ear cue locating incoming sounds based distribution incoming signal differences distribution spectrum sound waves caused interactions sounds head outer ear entering ear auditory system uses several heuristics make sense incoming cues based properties auditory stimuli usually occur environment cue grouping refers humans naturally perceive incoming stimuli organized patterns based certain rules two sounds start different times likely originated different sources sounds occur simultaneously likely originate source cues originating slowly changing positions usually source two sounds separated space cue location see sound localization helps individual separate perceptually sound moving move continuously erratically jumping sound unlikely come source timbre tone quality tone character sound independent pitch helps us distinguish musical instruments playing notes hearing multiple sounds timbre sound unchanging regardless pitch thus differentiate sounds different sources pitch refers frequency sound wave reaching us although single object could produce variety pitches time likely would produce sounds similar erratic changes pitch likely perceived originating different sources similar gestalt principle good continuation see principles grouping sounds change smoothly remain constant often produced source sound frequency even interrupted noise perceived continuous highly variable sound interrupted perceived one sound presented long interval introduction second one originating different location individuals hear two distinct sounds originating correct location however delay onset first second sound shortened listeners unable distinguish two sounds instead perceive coming location lead sound effect counteracts small disparity perception sound caused difference distance ear source auditory strong interactions visual auditory stimuli since auditory visual cues provide accurate source information location object times minimal discrepancy two however possible disparity information provided two sets cues example visual capture ventriloquism effect occurs individuals visual system locates source auditory stimulus different position auditory system locates occurs visual cues override auditory ones individual perceive sound coming location object seen audition also affect visual perception research
