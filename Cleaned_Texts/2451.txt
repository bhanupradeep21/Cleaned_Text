gonosomal mutation arises later zygote development present small subset either somatic germline cells germline mutation often arises due endogenous factors like errors cellular replication oxidative damage rarely repaired imperfectly due high rate germ cell division occur endogenous mutations prominent sperm spermatocytes go larger number cell divisions throughout males life resulting replication cycles could result dna errors maternal ovum also occur lower rate paternal types mutations occur also tend vary mothers eggs production remain stasis utilized ovulation long stasis period shown

spermatogenesis complete differentiated spermatozoa formed longer capability dna repair thus vulnerable attack prevalent oxidative free radicals cause oxidative dna damage damaged spermatozoa may undergo programmed cell death germline mutation also occur due exogenous factors similar somatic mutations germline mutations caused exposure harmful substances damage dna germ cells damage either
