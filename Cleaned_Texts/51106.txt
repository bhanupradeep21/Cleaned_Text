blue flower colour always associated something unusual desired blue roses especially assumed dream realised blue colour flower petals caused anthocyanins members flavonoid class metabolites diversify three main classes anthocyanin pigments cyaniding type two hydroxyl groups bring responsible red coloration pelargonidin type one hydroxyl group bring responsible orange colour delphinidin type three hydroxyl groups bring responsible violetblue flower fruits main difference structure listed anthocyanins type number hydroxyl groups bring anthocyanin nevertheless monomeric state anthocyanins never show blue colour weak acidic neutral ph mechanism blue colour formation complicated cases presence delphinidin type pigments sufficient great role play also ph formation complexes anthocyanins flavones metal selfassociation correlated anthocyanin concentration concentration higher observe change absorbance maximum increase colour intensity molecules anthocyanins associate together results stronger darker copigmentation stabilizes gives protection anthocyanins complexes copigments colourless slightly yellow colour copigments usually flavonoids flavones flavonols flavanons flavanols polyphenols alkaloids amino acids organic acids efficient copigments flavonols like rutin quercetin phenolic acids like sinapic acid ferulic association copigment anthocyanin causes bathochromic effect shift absorption maximum higher wavelength result observe change colour red phenomenon also called bluing effect diversify two types copigmentation intermolecular intramolecular first type copigment bound anthocyanin noncovalent bond hydrogen bond hydrophobic interaction ionic second type observe covalent acylation glycosyl moiety anthocyanin intramolecular copigmentation stronger effect colour type protective stacking called also sandwich type stacking common mechanism formation blue flower tirantin present clitoria ternatea butterfly pea phacelianin present phacelia campanularia examples pigments intramolecular metal complexation often blue flower colour correlated presence anthocyanins complexes metals ions metalloanthocyanins composed anthocyanins flavones metal ions stochiometric amounts typical metals anthocyanin complexes iron fe magnesium mg aluminium al copper cu potassium k tin sn anthocyanins form complexes metal ions cyanidin delphinidin type least two free hydroxyl groups bring necessary examples metalloanthocyanins commelinin isolated commelina communis contains malonylawobanin delphinidin type flavocommelin copigment magnesium ions stochiometric ratio protocyanin blue pigment cornflower centaurea cyanus composed succinylcyanin anthocyanin malonylflavone copigment iron magnesium anions two calcium ions stabilize complex interesting anthocyanin complex metal ions present red rose fuzzy metal complex pigments blue coloured flowers much often instead metalloanthocyanins find non stoichiometric metal complex pigments stabilized copigmentation pigments show blue colour aqueous solution less stable example kind pigment present hydrangea sepals main anthocyanin result blue flower formation cultivars red pink flowers also present known acidification soil cause change hydrangea flower colour redpink blueviolet explanation phenomenon find molar ratio copigment acylquninic acid anthocyanin much higher blue cells also level ions higher blue flowers additionally ph blue cell around red lower around supramolecule relatively unstable easily fall apart result change component concentration ph conditions explain blue colour hydrangea sepals low vacuolar ph influence flower colour ph theory first concept tried explain mystery blue colour formation flower petals first observation showed cyanine extracted blue cornflower changes colour aqueous solution different ph acidic range pigment red alkaline solution blue leads conclusion increase ph cell vacuole cause increase blue coloration phenomenon observe morning glory ipomoea tricolor japanese blue morning glory ipomoea nil petals flower development observe change flower colour form purple blue morning glory one delphinidin type anthocyanin composition change flower development change colour caused increase ph vacuole coloured cells buds fully matured flowers early stage development acidic ph maintained proton pumps latter stage kh exchanger responsible vacuole anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway well known enzymes characterised formation blue pigments enzymes particularly important roles particular flavonoid dihydroflavonol dfr flavonoid responsible introduction second third hydroxyl group bring dihydrokaempferol dhk naringenin regarded main substrates reaction product reaction dhk dihydromyricetin dhm precursor synthesis delphinidin type anthocyanin enzyme member cytochrome protein family diverse group hemecontaining oxidases catalyse nadph nadhdependent oxidation classified enzyme regarded necessary blue pigment formation dihydroflavonol oxidoreductase catalyses presence nadph stereospecific reduction keto group position dihydroflavonols producing colourless leucoanthocyanidins precursor anthocyanin formation enzyme show substrate specificity respect bring hydroxylation pattern dihydroflavonol therefore influence type formed anthocyanin blue pigment formation necessary enzyme accept dihydromyricetin dhm substrate product dfr reaction dhm following steps pathway converted delphinidin type blue economically important flowers like roses carnations chrysanthemums despite lot efforts possible breed flowers blue petals coloration lack enzyme hence delphinidin type anthocyanin reason blue flower colour possible obtaincitation needed delphinidin accumulating carnations dianthus caryophyllus obtained overexpression petunia dfr cultivars without endogenous dfr activity result cultivars different purple hue flowers roses especially difficult obtain blueviolet flower colour lack unfavourable vacuole ph main obstacles lot cultivars screened choose proper one genetic modification finally flowers violetblue hues obtained overexpression viola regulation endogenous dfr time overexpression iris iris x hollandica dfr result modifications flowers accumulate almost exclusively delphinidin type pigments additionally hybridizers throughout history rose cultivation made several strides toward producing rose varieties colors lavender violet mauve color familiescitation needed colors height fashion especially late industrial revolution made synthetic color pigments inexpensive widely available first time bright shades royal purple mauve blue naturally became extremely popular fashionable colors previously available extremely wealthy people pigments create colors previously scarcecitation needed several classes garden rose created magenta violet flowers time period reflect growing trend popularity previously luxurious rare colorscitation needed notable examples popular historical roses still grown today rosarians include gallica rose cardinal de richelui hybrid perpetual reine des violettes setigera rambler rose veilchenblaucitation needed violet flower colors due complexes cyanidin sugar molecules metal complexes tannins naturally present flower petalscitation needed early new species rose called rosa foetida bicolor introduced world commerce middle east flowers bright shades butter yellow orange velvety blood red introduced new genetic traits serendipitously coincidentally created pathway toward new lavender blue pigments independent delphinidin blue pigment naturally found rosescitation needed pathway involves final stages flavanoid pigment synthesis would normally cause flowers appear yellow orange new species carried small traces unused genes allowed production another type blue pigment called rosacyanin roses evolved stop utilizing favor producing flower fragrances attract pollinatorscitation needed rosacyanin allows roses come delicate mauve lavender true blue shadescitation needed colors seen hybrid tea roses sterling silver blue girl blue moon among others descend yellow roses notably popular yellow hybrid tea rose called peace named commemorate end world war ii used extensively hybridizing fathered original lavender hybrid teascitation needed japanese company suntory produced blue rose named hybridizing advancements
