disk diffusion test also known agar diffusion test test discdiffusion antibiotic susceptibility test discdiffusion antibiotic sensitivity test kb test culturebased microbiology assay used diagnostic drug discovery laboratories diagnostic labs assay used determine susceptibility bacteria isolated patients infection clinically approved antibiotics allows physicians prescribe appropriate antibiotic drug discovery labs especially bioprospecting labs assay used screen biological material eg plant extracts bacterial fermentation broths drug candidates antibacterial activity bioprospecting assay performed paired strains bacteria achieve dereplication provisionally identify antibacterial mechanism diagnostic laboratories test performed inoculating surface agar plate bacteria isolated patients infection antibioticcontaining paper disks applied agar plate incubated antibiotic stops bacteria growing kills bacteria area around disk bacteria grown enough visible called zone inhibition susceptibility bacterial isolate antibiotic semiquantified comparing size zones inhibition databases information known antibioticsusceptible moderately susceptible resistant bacteria way possible identify appropriate antibiotic treating patients although disk diffusion test used differentiate bacteriostatic bactericidal activity less cumbersome susceptibility test methods broth drug discovery labs disk diffusion test performed slightly differently diagnostic labs setting bacterial strain must characterized test extract eg plant microbial extract agar plate therefore inoculated bacterial strain known phenotype often atcc nctc strain disks containing test extract applied zone inhibition sizes used semiquantitative measure antibacterial potency different extracts contain molecules different diffusion characteristics different molecular sizes hydrophilicities etc zone inhibition sizes used purpose dereplication though achieved testing extract paired strains bacteria eg streptomycinsusceptible resistant strains identify streptomycincontaining extracts paired strains eg wild type target overexpressing strains also used identify antibacterial mechanism agar diffusion first used martinus beijerinck study effect auxins bacterial growth however method developed refined standardized many scientists scientific organizations years including george f reddish norman

across agar plate form bacterial lawn obtain uniform growth agar plate streaked swab one direction rotated streaked rotated another streaked using antibiotic disk dispenser disks containing specific antibiotics applied plate must done within minutes inoculation flamesterilized forceps used gently press disk onto agar ensure attached plates incubated overnight usually temperature plates must incubated within minutes applying antibiotic several variations disk diffusion method developed including oxford penicillin cup etest methods used hospital diagnostic well diffusion cylinder diffusion
