either crohns disease ulcerative colitis affect intestines parts gastrointestinal tract causes illness include intestinal pseudoobstruction necrotizing diseases intestine may cause vomiting diarrhoea constipation altered stool blood stool colonoscopy may used examine large intestine persons stool may sent culture microscopy infectious disease may treated targeted antibiotics inflammatory bowel disease immunosuppression surgery may also used treat causes bowel normal thickness small intestinal wall mm large focal irregular asymmetrical gastrointestinal wall thickening ct scan suggests segmental diffuse gastrointestinal wall thickening often due ischemic inflammatory infectious though less common medications ace inhibitors cause angioedema small bowel small intestine consists duodenum jejunum ileum inflammation small intestine called enteritis localised part called duodenitis jejunitis ileitis respectively peptic ulcers also common chronic diseases malabsorption may affect
