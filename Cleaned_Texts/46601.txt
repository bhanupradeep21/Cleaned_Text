slowwave sleep sws often referred deep sleep consists stage three nonrapid eye movement usually lasts minutes takes place first hours initially sws consisted stage percent delta wave activity stage percent delta wave period sleep called slowwave sleep eeg activity synchronized characterised slow waves frequency range hz relatively high amplitude power peaktopeak amplitude greater first section
