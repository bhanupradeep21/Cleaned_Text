cotransporters sglts proteins occur primarily kidneys play important role maintaining glucose balance two known sglts family major transport protein promotes reabsorption glomerular filtration glucose back circulation responsible approximately kidneys glucose mainly expressed kidneys epithelial cells lining first segment proximal convoluted tubule inhibiting gliflozins prevent kidneys reuptake glucose glomerular filtrate subsequently lower glucose level blood promote excretion glucose urine mechanism action cellular level well understood work underway define mechanism prodiuretic great

patients underlying blood sugar control kidney function results decreased kidney reabsorption glucose glucosuria effect increases higher level glucose blood circulation therefore dapagliflozin reduces blood glucose concentration mechanism independent insulin secretion sensitivity unlike many antidiabetic medications functional pancreatic βcells necessary activity medication convenient patients
