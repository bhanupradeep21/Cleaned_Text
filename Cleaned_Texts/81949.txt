acromesomelic dysplasia rare skeletal disorder causes abnormal bone cartilage development leading shortening forearms lower legs hands feet fingers five different genetic mutations implicated disorder treatment individualized generally aimed palliating symptoms example treatment kyphosis lumbar acromesomelic dysplasia amd characterized inhibition growth certain long bones forearms lower disease typically becomes apparent first years forearms lower legs hands feet grow proportionally rest time individuals hard time fully extending arms rotating arms inwards towards body palms facing rotating arms outward palms facing abnormalities cartilage bone development may also cause bones within fingers toes hands feet become sufficiently shorter early childhood individuals may experience progressive abnormal curvature common symptoms include infants amd typically normal birth weight characteristic facial amd extremely rare inherited autosomal recessive genetic autosomal recessive means two copies abnormal gene must present order disease inherited parents gene mutate person genetic studies indicate mutation chromosome amd maroteaux gene codes protein affects bone development natriuretic peptide receptor b receptor hormone ctype natriuretic peptide hormone essential bone amd grebe dysplasia gene located chromosome chromosome codes protein known growth development amd genital anomalies gene located chromosome codes protein known bone morphogenetic protein receptor type diseases determined combination genes certain trait chromosomes received mother dominant genetic disorders happen single copy abnormal gene needed cause certain abnormal gene inherited either parent result gene diagnosis based clinical presentation molecular analysis electropherogram disease diagnosed within first years identification main characteristics key factor diagnosis molecular analysis used examine dna affected person blood sample needed dna extracted automatic dna results show mutated chromosome identify chromosome passed radiograph show abnormal growth plates misshapen bones confirm abnormal development premature fusion regions diaphyses certain long bones meet electropherogram used identify genotypingcitation needed results used compare normal sequence relatives important detailed patient history including parents typically parent carries chromosome amd seems shorter monitoring weight height person affected amd based persons age meeting certain percentile identify issues may causing stunt five types oseboldremondini causes shortness limbs hypoplasia second phalanges fusion remaining phalanges carpal tarsal maroteaux type causes severe dwarfism height type also causes shortening middle distal segments grebe dysplasia causes extreme abnormalities limb joints type amd hands feet affected type primarily affects joints hands feet causing lack grebe dysplasia major effects du pan syndrome causes underdevelopment tissues fibulae feet acromesomelic dysplasia genital anomalies causes shortness limbs stature congenital malformations female genital tract male reproductive five types amd caused gene mutation receiving differences types different genes affected mutated gene type listed pathophysiology sectioncitation needed treatment plans amd persons results vary depending type amd symptoms person therapy may physical therapy aimed help specific example abnormal curvature spine may treated exercises braces casts severe cases corrective important start physical therapy early possible ensure people amd reach full one treatment help person affected amd recombinant human growth hormone recombinant human growth hormones produced pituitary gland help spur growth children used amd patients help muscle bone treatment longterm cure disease help patient grow couple case study showed growth velocity cmyear first year well height improving sd years another case study conducted showed within year patient increase treatment important start puberty patients received treatment seen difference increase prevention amd many options managing symptomscitation needed kyphosis excessive outward curvature spine resulting hunch treatment disease includes taking pain relievers osteoporosis medication osteoporosis helps strengthen bones help prevent spinal lumbar hyperlordosis condition occurs lower back region experiences stress extra weightcitation needed causes lower back become arched creates muscle spasms paincitation needed treatment focuses stretching lower back quads hip flexors strengthening hamstrings glutes abdominal musclescitation needed braces may used help relieve stress pressure lower backcitation needed risk factors taking rhgh risk factors increase risk amd include family history condition child born parents close blood person diagnosed amd normal life disease chances full recovery something person entire abnormal cartilage bone development affect many bones long term effects include joint pain arthritis abnormal curvature spine short stature limbs prevalence amd nearly ten million people world carry mutated gene maroteaux type people entire world affected amd rare less reported amd classified skeletal dysplasia approximately occurs disease affects males females well racial ethnic majority case studies involve patients live pakistan morocco amd primarily begin first years life early neonatal phase affect anyone research study published established new type amd case study exome sequence performed two girls short stature due acromesomelic limb researchers wanted determine protein kinase cgmpdependent type ii gene effect longitudinal growth results showed two homozygous variants nonsense variants alter downstream mitogen activated protein kinase signaling pathway failing phosphorylate craf reduce activation response fibroblast growth factor another research study conducted mice find new treatment people amd maroteaux results showed expressed osteoblasts chondrocytes leading conclusion disruptions growth plate leading cause also found stops activation signaling pathway mekerk pathway growth data showed treatment pharmacological inhibitor mekerk pathway might improve bone data treatment produced promising results showed drug effectively inhibited mekerk study conducted mice could potentially treatment help people diagnosed amdcitation needed research studies conducted see effect rhgh stated treatment section results may vary per person patients seem overall positive effect hormones helps grow centimeters year clinical trials going amd lack knowledge medication treat reverse diseasecitation needed httpsenwikipediaorgwikiacromesomelicdysplasia
