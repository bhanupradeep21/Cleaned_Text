aged less hours begin respond hypoglycemia serum glucose levels mgdl contrasted value adults children older infants approximately mgdl children aged greater hours serum glucose average ranges mgdl mmoll similar whipples triad used identify hypoglycemia children communicate conditions may present time hypoglycemia include following hypoglycemic symptoms divided two main first category symptoms caused low glucose brain called neuroglycopenic second category symptoms caused bodys reaction low glucose brain called adrenergic everyone experiences different symptoms hypoglycemia someone hypoglycemia may symptoms listed symptoms also tend quick important quickly obtain blood glucose measurement someone presenting symptoms hypoglycemia properly identify hypoglycemic glucose main source energy brain number mechanisms place prevent hypoglycemia protect energy supply body adjust insulin production release adjust glucose production liver adjust glucose use body naturally produces hormone insulin organ called insulin helps regulate amount glucose body especially glucagon another hormone involved regulating blood glucose levels thought opposite glucagon helps increase blood glucose levels especially states blood sugar levels fall lownormal range first line defense hypoglycemia decreasing insulin release drop insulin allows liver increase glycogenolysis process glycogen breakdown results production glycogen thought inactive storage form decreased insulin also allows increased gluconeogenesis liver gluconeogenesis process glucose production noncarbohydrate sources supplied muscles blood glucose levels fall normal range additional protective mechanisms work prevent pancreas signaled release glucagon hormone increases glucose production liver kidneys increases muscle fat breakdown supply increased glucagon raise blood sugar levels normal adrenal glands release epinephrine works also increase gluconeogenesis glycogenolysis also decreasing use glucose organs protecting brains glucose hypoglycemia prolonged cortisol growth hormone released continue gluconeogenesis glycogenolysis also preventing use glucose effects cortisol growth hormone far less effective

symptoms explanation neuroglycopenic symptoms adrenergic symptoms terms epidemiology hypoglycemic unawareness occurs type causes hypoglycemia diabetics include following serious illness may result low blood severe disease many organ systems cause hypoglycemia secondary hypoglycemia especially common intensive care unit food drink withheld part treatment sepsis common cause hypoglycemia serious illness lead hypoglycemia many state sepsis body uses large amounts glucose glucose use increased cytokine cytokines protein produced body state stress particularly fighting cytokines may inhibit glucose production decreasing bodys energy finally liver kidneys sites glucose production state sepsis organs may receive enough oxygen leading decreased glucose production due organ causes serious illness may cause hypoglycemia include liver failure kidney liver main site glucose production body liver failure damage lead decreased glucose kidneys also sites glucose production failure glucose production significant enough cause instead kidneys responsible removing insulin body function impaired kidney failure insulin stays circulation longer leading number medications identified may cause hypoglycemia variety moderate quality evidence implicates nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug indomethacin antimalarial low quality evidence implicates lithium used bipolar finally low quality evidence implicates number hypertension medications including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors also called aceinhibitors angiotensin receptor blockers also called arbs βadrenergic blockers also called beta medications low quality evidence include antibiotics levofloxacin trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole progesterone blocker mifepristone antiarrhythmic disopyramide anticoagulant heparin chemotherapeutic person without diabetes accidentally takes medications traditionally used treat diabetes may also cause medications include insulin glinides may occur medical errors healthcare setting pharmacy errors also called iatrogenic individuals take insulin without needing purposefully induce hypoglycemia referred surreptitious insulin use factitious people may use insulin induce weight loss whereas others may due malingering factitious disorder psychiatric demographics affected factitious hypoglycemia include women aged particularly diabetes relatives diabetes healthcare workers history psychiatric classic way identify surreptitious insulin use blood work revealing high insulin levels low cpeptide production glucose blocked misuse alcohol hypoglycemia may brought severalday alcohol binge associated little food cause hypoglycemia multifactorial glycogen becomes depleted state glycogen stores unable repleted due lack food intake compounded inhibition glucose production children primary adrenal failure also called addisons disease may experience hypoglycemia long periods addisons disease associated chronically low levels stress hormone cortisol leads decreased glucose hypopituitarism leading decreased growth hormone another cause hypoglycemia children particularly long periods fasting increased briefly inborn errors metabolism group rare genetic disorders associated improper breakdown storage proteins carbohydrates fatty inborn errors metabolism may cause infant hypoglycemia much less commonly adult disorders related breakdown glycogen called glycogen storage diseases may cause normally breakdown glycogen leads increased glucose levels particularly fasting glycogen storage diseases however glycogen properly brokendown leading inappropriately decreased glucose levels fasting state thus glycogen storage diseases associated hypoglycemia include type type type iii type iv well fanconi organic amino acid acidemias especially involving oxidation fatty acids lead symptom intermittent example combined malonic methylmalonic aciduria propionic isolated methylmalonic primary bcell tumor insulinoma associated tumor located insulinoma produces insulin turn decreases glucose levels causing normal regulatory mechanisms place prevent insulin levels falling states low blood episode hypoglycemia plasma insulin cpeptide proinsulin inappropriately hypoglycemia may occur people nonb cell tumors hepatomas adrenocorticoid carcinomas carcinoid tumors lead state increased insulin specifically increased insulinlike growth factor ii decreases glucose rouxeny gastric bypass weightloss surgery performed stomach associated hypoglycemia called postgastric bypass postprandial although entire mechanism hypoglycemia following surgery fully understood thought meals cause high levels glucagonlike also called hormone increases insulin causing glucose levels antibodies formed insulin leading autoimmune antibodies immune cells produced body normally attack bacteria viruses sometimes attack normal human cells leading autoimmune autoimmune hypoglycemia two possible one instance antibodies bind insulin following release associated meal resulting insulin later time antibodies fall insulin causing insulin functional leading late hypoglycemia meal called late postprandial another mechanism causing hypoglycemia due antibodies formed insulin receptors called insulin receptor antibodies attach insulin receptors prevent insulin breakdown degradation leading inappropriately high insulin levels low glucose low blood sugar may occur healthy neonates aged less hours eaten neonatal period neonate adjusts glucagon epinephrine levels following birth may trigger transient children aged greater hours serum glucose average ranges mgdl mmoll similar adults hypoglycemia
