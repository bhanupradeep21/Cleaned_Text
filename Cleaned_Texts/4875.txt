barrier protect inland villages agricultural lands storm events including tsunamis mangroves trees grow intertidal zone sheltered shores tropics subtropics tree trunks aerial roots sediment provide suitable habitats colonization animals ground trees canopy provide habitat insects reptiles birds mammals mangrove roots hanging water along creeks inlets home variety epibionts encrust sponges barnacles bivalves algae tree trunks within forest also habitat epibionts small encrusting invertebrates barnacles bivalves several species mobile gastropods including periwinkles soft sediment

many gastropods crabs bivalve species typical epifauna infauna consist polychaetes pistol prawns many crabs sipuncula many sesarmid crabs make extensive burrows beneath surface fauna take refuge macrofaunal communities high low intertidal mangroves distinctly different relates prevailing different environmental conditions different periods tidal cover lower shore frequently covered tides upper shore covered occasional high tides high shore substrate dry leaf litter accumulation however deposit feeders abundant frequent inundation low shore also favors presence filter feeders like barnacles oysters tree stems abundance deposit feeders substrate common invertebrates mangrove shore gastropods bivalves low shore gastropods bivalve high shore macrobenthos crabs gastropods ingest sediment food bacteria microalgae meiofauna detritus burrow move modify many physical chemical ways crab burrows provide efficient mechanism exchanging water anoxic substrate overlying water crab burrow inhabited sesarmid crab pistol prawn completely flushed within one hour activities crustaceans single tidal event crabs gastropods major seed predators mangrove forests play important role determining plant community structure mutual relationships sesarmid crabs mangroves mangroves provide suitable habitat crabs crabs reduce competition mangrove plant species selective predation seedlings high seed predation crabs negative influence regeneration mangrove trees grapsid crabs dominate australia malaysia panama gastropods cerithidea scalariformis melampus coeffeus important seed predators florida mangroves detritus feeding invertebrates dominate mangrove fauna grapsid crabs major consumers mangrove leaf litter therefore produce large amounts fecal material rich nutrients energy crabs graze pick organic material surface sediment suggesting using microbial resources nitrogen needs fish predation mangrove invertebrates occurs high tide mangrove shore inundated fishes netted within mangroves high tide showed presence crabs sipuncula stomachs benthic invertebrates mangrove forest play important ecological role burrowing sediment assist flushing toxic substances modifying oxidation status surrounding sediment feeding plant matter assists recycling organic matter produces animal biomass animal biomass source food vertebrate predators eg reptiles birds otters
