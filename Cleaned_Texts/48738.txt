lumbar puncture lp also known spinal tap medical procedure needle inserted spinal canal commonly collect cerebrospinal fluid csf diagnostic testing main reason lumbar puncture help diagnose diseases central nervous system including brain spine examples conditions include meningitis subarachnoid hemorrhage may also used therapeutically conditions increased intracranial pressure pressure skull contraindication due risk brain matter compressed pushed toward spine sometimes lumbar puncture performed safely example due severe bleeding tendency regarded safe procedure postduralpuncture headache common side effect small atraumatic needle procedure typically performed local anesthesia using sterile technique hypodermic needle used access subarachnoid space collect fluid fluid may sent biochemical microbiological cytological analysis using ultrasound landmark may increase lumbar puncture first introduced german physician heinrich quincke reason lumbar puncture may make treat disease outlined chief diagnostic indications lumbar puncture collection cerebrospinal fluid csf analysis csf may exclude neoplastic affecting central nervous system common purpose suspected since reliable tool meningitis lifethreatening highly treatable condition excluded lumbar puncture also used detect whether someone stage stage trypanosoma brucei young infants commonly require lumbar puncture part routine workup fever without due higher rates meningitis older persons infants also reliably show classic symptoms meningeal irritation meningismus like neck stiffness headache way adults age group subarachnoid hemorrhage hydrocephalus benign intracranial hypertension many diagnoses may supported excluded test may also used detect presence malignant cells csf carcinomatous meningitis medulloblastoma csf containing less red blood cells constitutes negative tap context workup subarachnoid hemorrhage example taps positive rbc count lumbar punctures may also done inject medications cerebrospinal fluid intrathecally particularly spinal chemotherapy serial lumbar punctures may useful temporary treatment idiopathic intracranial hypertension iih disease characterized increased pressure csf may cause headache permanent loss vision mainstays treatment medication cases lumbar puncture performed multiple times may improve symptoms recommended staple treatment due discomfort risk procedure short duration additionally people normal pressure hydrocephalus characterized urinary incontinence changed ability walk properly dementia receive relief symptoms removal lumbar puncture performed following situations post spinal headache nausea common complication often responds pain medications infusion fluids long taught complication prevented strict maintenance supine posture two hours successful puncture borne modern studies involving large numbers people procedure person side might decrease intravenous caffeine injection often quite effective aborting spinal headaches headache persistent despite long period bedrest occurs sitting may indicative csf leak lumbar puncture site treated bedrest epidural blood patch persons blood injected back site leakage cause clot form seal risk headache need analgesia blood patch much reduced atraumatic needles used affect success rate procedure although cost difficulty similar adoption remains low ca headaches may caused inadvertent puncture dura contact side lumbar puncture needle spinal nerve root result anomalous sensations paresthesia leg procedure harmless people warned advance minimize anxiety occur serious complications properly performed lumbar puncture extremely include spinal epidural bleeding adhesive arachnoiditis trauma spinal spinal nerve roots resulting weakness loss sensation even paraplegia latter exceedingly rare since level spinal cord ends normally inferior border although slightly lower infants several vertebral spaces proper location lumbar puncture case reports lumbar puncture resulting perforation abnormal dural arteriovenous malformations resulting catastrophic epidural hemorrhage exceedingly procedure recommended epidural infection present suspected topical infections dermatological conditions pose risk infection puncture site patients severe psychosis neurosis back pain authorities believe withdrawal fluid initial pressures abnormal could result spinal

intended path spinal needle spinal needle inserted lumbar vertebrae pushed give enters lumbar cistern wherein ligamentum flavum housed needle pushed second give indicates needle past dura mater arachnoid membrane dura mater exist flush contact one another living persons spine due fluid pressure csf subarachnoid space pushing arachnoid membrane towards dura therefore needle pierced dura mater also traversed thinner arachnoid membrane needle subarachnoid space stylet spinal needle withdrawn drops cerebrospinal fluid collected opening pressure cerebrospinal fluid may taken collection using simple column manometer procedure ended withdrawing needle placing pressure puncture site spinal level selected avoid spinal past patient would lie back least six hours monitored signs neurological problems scientific evidence provides benefit technique described almost identical used spinal anesthesia except spinal anesthesia often done patient seated positioncitation needed upright seated position advantageous less distortion spinal anatomy allows easier withdrawal fluid practitioners prefer lumbar puncture obese patients lying side would cause scoliosis unreliable anatomical landmarks however opening pressures notoriously unreliable measured seated position therefore patients ideally lie side practitioners need measure opening pressurecitation needed reinsertion stylet may decrease rate post lumbar puncture although available clinical settings use ultrasound helpful visualizing interspinous space assessing depth spine skin use ultrasound reduces number needle insertions redirections results higher rates successful lumbar procedure difficult people spinal deformities scoliosis also performed fluoroscopy continuous xray children sitting flexed position successful lying

infants undergoing approaches pain control include topical pain medications anaesthetics lidocaine effective approach pain control infants require lumbar puncture analysis cerebrospinal fluid generally includes cell count determination glucose protein concentrations analytical studies cerebrospinal fluid conducted according diagnostic increased csf pressure indicate congestive heart
