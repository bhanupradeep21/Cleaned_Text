ones language ability determining fluency may challenging task speaker acquiring second language generally thought later life learner approaches study foreign language harder acquire receptive auditory comprehension fluent production speaking skills adults mother tongue already established acquisition second language come slowly less completely ultimately affecting fluency however critical period hypothesis hotly debated topic scholars stating adults fact become fluent acquiring second languagecitation needed instance reading writing skills foreign language acquired easily even primary language acquisition period youth although often assumed young children learn languages easily adolescents reverse fact true older learners fastercitation needed exception rule pronunciation young children invariably learn speak second language nativelike pronunciation whereas learners start learning language older age rarely reach nativelike since childhood critical period widespread opinion
