arthropod leg form jointed appendage arthropods usually used walking many terms used arthropod leg segments called podomeres latin origin may confused terms bones coxa meaning hip pl coxae trochanter femur pl femora tibia pl tibiae tarsus pl tarsi ischium pl ischia metatarsus carpus dactylus meaning finger patella pl patellae homologies leg segments groups difficult prove source much argument authors posit eleven segments per leg recent common ancestor extant modern arthropods eight fewer ancestral leg need complex events successive loss function hoxgene could result parallel gains leg segments arthropods leg segments articulates next segment hinge joint may bend one plane means greater number segments required achieve kinds movements possible vertebrate animals rotational ballandsocket joints base fore hind appendages arthropods may either biramous uniramous uniramous limb comprises single series segments attached endtoend biramous limb however branches two branch

taxon called uniramia believed several groups arthropods evolved uniramous limbs independently ancestors biramous limbs taxon longer used arachnid legs differ insects addition two segments either side tibia patella femur tibia metatarsus sometimes called basitarsus tibia tarsus sometimes called telotarsus making total seven segments tarsus spiders claws end well hook helps webspinning spider legs

crustacean limbs also differ biramous whereas extant arthropods uniramous limbs myriapods millipedes centipedes relatives sevensegmented walking legs comprising coxa trochanter prefemur femur tibia tarsus tarsal claw myriapod legs show variety modifications different groups centipedes first pair legs modified pair venomous fangs called forcipules millipedes one two pairs walking legs adult males modified spermtransferring structures called gonopods millipedes first leg pair males may reduced tiny hooks stubs others first pair may enlarged insects relatives hexapods six legs connected thorax five components order body coxa trochanter femur tibia tarsus single segment except tarsus three seven segments referred tarsomere except species legs lost become vestigial evolutionary adaptation adult insects six legs one pair attached three segments thorax paired appendages segments particular mouthparts antennae cerci derived paired legs segment common ancestor larval insects however extra walking legs abdominal segments extra legs called prolegs found frequently larvae moths sawflies prolegs structure modern adult insect legs great deal debate whether homologous current evidence suggests indeed homologous primitive stage embryological emergence modern insects homologous lepidoptera concepts pervasive current interpretations general legs larval insects particularly endopterygota vary adults mentioned prolegs well true thoracic legs externally visible legs though internal rudiments emerge adult legs final ecdysis examples include maggots flies grubs weevils contrast larvae coleoptera scarabaeidae dytiscidae thoracic legs prolegs insects exhibit hypermetamorphosis begin metamorphosis planidia specialised active legged larvae end larval stage legless maggots example acroceridae among exopterygota legs larvae tend resemble adults general except adaptations respective modes life example legs immature ephemeroptera adapted scuttling beneath underwater stones like whereas adults gracile legs less burden flight young coccoidea called crawlers crawl around looking good place feed settle stay life later instars functional legs species among apterygota legs immature specimens effect smaller versions adult legscitation needed representative insect leg housefly cockroach following parts sequence proximal distal associated leg various sclerites around base functions articular leg attaches main exoskeleton insect sclerites differ considerably unrelated coxa proximal segment functional base leg articulates pleuron associated sclerites thoracic segment species articulates edge sternite well homologies various basal sclerites open debate authorities suggest derive ancestral subcoxa many species coxa two lobes articulates pleuron posterior lobe meron usually larger part coxa meron well developed periplaneta isoptera neuroptera lepidoptera trochanter articulates coxa usually attached rigidly femur insects appearance may confusing example two subsegments odonata parasitic hymenoptera base femur appearance second trochanter insects femur largest region leg especially conspicuous many insects saltatorial legs typical leaping mechanism straighten joint femur tibia femur contains necessary massive bipennate musculature tibia fourth section typical insect leg rule tibia insect slender comparison femur generally least long often longer near distal end generally tibial spur often two apocrita tibia foreleg bears large apical spur fits semicircular gap first segment tarsus gap lined comblike bristles insect cleans antennae drawing ancestral tarsus single segment extant protura diplura certain insect larvae tarsus also singlesegmented modern insects tarsi divided subsegments tarsomeres usually five actual number varies taxon may useful diagnostic purposes example pterogeniidae characteristically fore midtarsi hind tarsi whereas cerylonidae four tarsomeres tarsus distal segment typical insect leg pretarsus collembola protura many insect larvae pretarsus single claw pretarsus insects pair claws ungues singular unguis ungues median unguitractor plate supports pretarsus plate attached apodeme flexor muscle ungues neoptera parempodia symmetrical pair structures arising outside distal surface unguitractor plate present many hemiptera almost usually parempodia bristly setiform species sometimes parempodia reduced size almost unguitractor plate pretarsus expands forward median lobe arolium webspinners embioptera enlarged basal tarsomere front legs containing silkproducing pretarsi members diptera generally paired lobes pulvilli meaning little cushions single pulvillus unguis pulvilli often arolium otherwise median bristle empodium meaning meeting place pulvilli underside tarsal segments frequently pulvilluslike organs plantulae arolium plantulae pulvilli adhesive organs enabling possessors climb smooth steep surfaces outgrowths exoskeleton cavities contain blood structures covered tubular tenent hairs apices moistened glandular secretion organs adapted apply hairs closely smooth surface adhesion occurs surface molecular insects control ungues muscle tension long tendon retractor unguis long tendon insect models locomotion motor control drosophila diptera locusts acrididae stick insects phasmatodea long tendon courses tarsus tibia reaching femur tension long tendon controlled two muscles one femur one tibia operate differently depending leg bent tension long tendon controls claw also bends tarsus likely affects stiffness walking typical thoracic leg adult insect
