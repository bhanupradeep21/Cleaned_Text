animal behaviour stereotypy stereotypic stereotyped behaviour several meanings leading ambiguity scientific stereotypy term group phenotypic behaviours repetitive morphologically identical possess obvious goal behaviours defined abnormal exhibit solely animals subjected barren environments scheduled restricted feedings social deprivation cases arise normal animals natural behaviours may maladaptive involving selfinjury reduced reproductive success laboratory animals confound behavioural stereotypical behaviours thought caused ultimately artificial environments allow animals satisfy normal behavioural needs rather refer behaviour abnormal suggested described behaviour indicative abnormal stereotyped behaviour also refer normal behaviours show low variation example mammalian chewing cycles fish capturing prey using suction feeding highly stereotyped movements may due mechanical constraint skull viper fish bones mechanically linked tight neural control mammalian chewing

factors within captive environment one factors within captive environment may affect establishment stereotypies exploratory behaviours directed outside cage research suggests common stereotypic behaviours seen mice wiregnawing example may originate exploratory behaviours noted mice climb bars cage frequently attempt sniff outside cage putting nose bars cage process mice occasionally bite

stereotypies increases also research suggests persistence stereotypies might due behavioural differences animals stereotypies without one behavioural differences researched higher resistance extinction seen animals exhibit stereotypic behaviours resistance extinction occurs animals unable stop learned response research domesticated dogs shown dogs exhibit common stereotypic behaviours higher resistance extinction simple experimental task dogs correlation suggests stereotypic behaviours dogs may reinforced way early development persisted dogs highly resistant many stereotypies induced confinement example cats pace zoo pregnant sows whose feed restricted bite stalls bars chew without anything laboratory rats mice grooming common activity sleep grooming stereotypies used investigate several animal models anxiety examples stereotypical behaviours include pacing rocking swimming circles excessive sleeping selfmutilation including feather picking excessive grooming mouthing cage bars stereotypies seen many species including primates birds carnivores elephants zoos display stereotypical stereotypic behaviour also common captive giraffes although perform wide range stereotypies predominantly lick inanimate objects may related limitations natural foraging feeding stereotypies well known stabled horses usually developing result confined particularly insufficient exercise colloquially called stable vices present management issue leading facility damage chewing kicking repetitive motion also lead health consequences animal asiatic black bears malayan sun bears also exhibit stereotypies caged common stereotypies species include head throwing jaw stereotypies also seen dogs common stereotypic behaviours dogs include circling light fixation
