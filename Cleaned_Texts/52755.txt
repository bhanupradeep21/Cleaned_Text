important structures plant development buds shoots roots leaves flowers plants produce tissues structures throughout life located tips organs mature tissues thus living plant always embryonic tissues contrast animal embryo early produce body parts ever life animal born hatches egg body parts point grow larger mature however plants animals pass phylotypic stage evolved causes developmental constraint limiting morphological according plant physiologist carl leopold properties organization seen plant emergent properties sum individual parts assembly tissues functions integrated multicellular organism yields characteristics separate parts processes also quite new set characteristics would predictable basis examination separate vascular plant begins single celled zygote formed fertilisation egg cell sperm cell point begins divide form plant embryo process embryogenesis happens resulting cells organize one end becomes first root end forms tip shoot seed plants embryo develop one seed leaves cotyledons end embryogenesis young plant parts necessary begin life embryo germinates seed parent plant begins produce additional organs leaves stems roots process organogenesis new roots grow root meristems located tip root new stems leaves grow shoot meristems located tip branching occurs small clumps cells left behind meristem yet undergone cellular differentiation form specialized tissue begin grow tip new root shoot growth meristem tip root shoot termed primary growth results lengthening root shoot secondary growth results widening root shoot divisions cells addition growth cell division plant may grow cell elongation occurs individual cells groups cells grow longer plant cells grow length cells one side stem grow longer faster cells side stem bends side slower growing cells result directional growth occur via plants response particular stimulus light phototropism gravity gravitropism water hydrotropism physical contact thigmotropism plant growth development mediated specific plant hormones plant growth regulators pgrs ross et al endogenous hormone levels influenced plant age cold hardiness dormancy metabolic conditions photoperiod drought temperature external environmental conditions exogenous sources pgrs eg externally applied rhizospheric origin plants exhibit natural variation form structure organisms vary individual individual plants exhibit additional type variation within single individual parts repeated may differ form structure similar parts variation easily seen leaves plant though organs stems flowers may show similar variation three primary causes variation positional effects environmental effects juvenility variation among parts mature plant resulting relative position organ produced example along new branch leaves may vary consistent pattern along branch form leaves produced near base branch differs leaves produced tip plant difference consistent branch branch given plant given species way new structures mature produced may affected point plants life begin develop well environment structures exposed temperature multiplicity effects plants depending variety factors including size condition plant temperature duration exposure smaller succulent plant greater susceptibility damage death temperatures high low temperature affects rate biochemical physiological processes rates generally within limits increasing temperature juvenility heteroblasty organs tissues produced young plant seedling often different produced plant older example young trees produce longer leaner branches grow upwards branches produce fully grown tree addition leaves produced early growth tend larger thinner irregular leaves adult plant specimens juvenile plants may look completely different adult plants species egglaying insects recognize plant food young transition early late growth forms sometimes called vegetative phase plant structures including roots buds shoots develop unusual locations called adventitious structures common vascular plants adventitious roots buds usually develop near existing vascular tissues connect xylem phloem however exact location varies greatly young stems adventitious roots often form parenchyma vascular bundles stems secondary growth adventitious roots often originate phloem parenchyma near vascular cambium stem cuttings adventitious roots sometimes also originate callus cells form cut surface leaf cuttings crassula form adventitious roots adventitious buds develop places shoot apical meristem occurs tip stem shoot node leaf axil bud left primary growth may develop roots leaves shoots new growth shoot apical meristems produce one axillary lateral buds node stems produce considerable secondary growth axillary buds may destroyed adventitious buds may develop stems secondary growth adventitious buds often formed stem wounded pruned adventitious buds help replace lost branches adventitious buds shoots also may develop mature tree trunks shaded trunk exposed bright sunlight surrounding trees cut redwood sequoia sempervirens trees often develop many adventitious buds lower trunks main trunk dies new one often sprouts one adventitious buds small pieces redwood trunk sold souvenirs termed redwood burls placed pan water adventitious buds sprout form shoots plants normally develop adventitious buds roots extend quite distance plant shoots develop adventitious buds roots termed suckers type natural vegetative reproduction many species eg many grasses quaking aspen canada thistle pando quaking aspen grew one trunk trunks via adventitious bud formation single root system leaves develop adventitious buds form adventitious roots part vegetative reproduction eg piggyback plant tolmiea menziesii motherofthousands kalanchoe daigremontiana adventitious plantlets drop parent plant develop separate clones parent coppicing practice cutting tree stems ground promote rapid growth adventitious shoots traditionally used produce poles fence material firewood also practiced biomass crops grown fuel poplar willow adventitious rooting may stressavoidance acclimation species driven inputs nutrient deficiency another ecologically important function adventitious rooting vegetative reproduction tree species salix sequoia riparian ability plant stems form adventitious roots utilised commercial propagation cuttings understanding physiological mechanisms behind adventitious rooting allowed progress made improving rooting cuttings application synthetic auxins rooting powders use selective basal progress made future years applying research regulatory mechanisms commercial propagation comparative analysis molecular ecophysiological control adventitious rooting hard root vs easy root species adventitious roots buds important people propagate plants via cuttings layering tissue culture plant hormones termed auxins often applied stem shoot leaf cuttings promote adventitious root formation eg african violet sedum leaves shoots poinsettia coleus propagation via root cuttings requires adventitious bud formation eg horseradish apple layering adventitious roots formed aerial stems stem section removed make new plant large houseplants often propagated air layering adventitious roots buds must develop tissue culture propagation plants genetics behind leaf shape development arabidopsis thaliana broken three stages initiation leaf primordium establishment dorsiventrality development marginal meristem leaf primordium initiated suppression genes proteins class knox family shoot apical meristemless class knox proteins directly suppress gibberellin biosynthesis leaf primodium many genetic factors found involved suppression genes leaf primordia asymmetric etc thus suppression levels gibberellin increase leaf primorium initiates growth flower development process angiosperms produce pattern gene expression meristems leads appearance organ oriented towards sexual reproduction flower three physiological developments must occur order take place firstly plant must pass sexual immaturity sexually mature state ie transition towards flowering secondly transformation apical meristems function vegetative
