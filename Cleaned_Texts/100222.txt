mandrillus genus large old world monkeys distributed throughout central southern africa consisting two species sphinx leucophaeus mandrill drill mandrillus originally placed genus papio type baboon closely related genus characterised large builds elongated snouts furrows side stub tails species occupy west central region africa live primarily frugivores consuming meat plants preference sphinx classified vulnerable leucophaeus endangered iucn red list threatened mandrillus genus within tribe papionini turn subfamily cercopithecinae subfamily classified family old world monkeys cercopithecidae within infraorder papionini tribe contains six genera baboons papio macaques macaca crested mangabeys lophocebus whiteeyelid mangabeys cercocebus highland mangabey rungwecebus originally species considered part papio genus forest baboons due superficial similarities size appearance particularly facial however studies conducted analysing anatomical genetic differences current mandrillus papio genera showed differences similarities resulting current taxonomic furthermore studies showed mandrillus closely related white eyed mangabeys diverged relatively recently million years ago unknown species mandrillus develop extremely large muzzles prominent nasal ridges paranasal swelling swelling area adjacent nostrils size colour paranasal swellings correlate male dominance rank size nasal ridges way attracting mandrillus teeth consist two incisors two premolars one canine three molars half upper lower jaw totalling furthermore mandrillus display larger premolars extended canines dental traits better adapted crushing hard objects due large part diet consisting hard dry nuts seeds require greater crushing power use teeth ripping apart rotting wood search insects within shoulder upper arm structures mandrillus monkeys deep scapular broad deltoid plane narrow stable elbow region skeletal features indicate use forelimbs climbing used monkeys climb trees searching ripe fruit aggressive foraging forest floor search mandrillus monkeys developed extremely broad robust ilium rounded tibial shaft development features attributed climbing trees quadrupedal locomotion largest toe separated remaining toes increased grasping power climbing species mandrillus demonstrate great degree sexual dimorphism weight anatomy physical appearance mandrill displays extreme sexual dimorphism weight among primates malefemale weight ratio eight ten years similarly drills one sexually dimorphic primates body weight male growing kg female grows kg sexual dimorphism also displayed growth craniofacial bones males species longer muzzles much larger paranasal swellings longer canines female counterparts study wild drills female muzzles grew length male furthermore males brightly coloured saturated rumps unlike female species also display greatest visual sexual dimorphism within monkeys scale based rating differences physical features genders

march diet consisted mostly fruit pulp seeds whilst fruit scarce season june august great increase consumption insects woody tissue especially also increase variation diet fruitscarce important fruit include limited fruit bush mango irvingia gabonensis african corkwood tree musanga cecropioides grewia coriacea sacoglottis gabonensis xylopia aethiopica invertebrates consumed include crickets ants caterpillars termites rarely mandrillus monkeys eat larger animals rats gazelles presented species genus exhibit great similarities social systems generally form smaller groups however size groups unclear study done drills southwest cameroon found mean group size another recent report stated figure smaller study mandrills done campo reserve cameroon found small groups contain smaller groups stable social structures often join form larger supergroups hundreds largest mandrill supergroups reported contained individuals whilst largest drill supergroups reported contained reports solitary male mandrillus monkeys however occurs social structures social hierarchy mandrillus supergroups groups highly contentious multiple older sources referencing single male units contained male multiple female monkeys smallest common stable social structure however disproved discovery less colourful male mandrillus observations mandrillus leucophaeus social structures unknown due low populations secluded habitats dense hand mandrillus sphinx variety studies social structure done largely captive semifree ranging settings studies wild mandrills current studies mandrills inconclusive present different results various semifree ranging studies conducted report matrilineal social structure stable infant female mandrill supergroup male mandrillus monkeys would disperse group old enough join

mandrill population present year round aligned social structures reported research papers done wild mandrills stable multimale multifemale groups difference social structures mandrillus groups attributed limitations observing wild mandrills differing habitats differing sample male dominance rank linked colouration colour extension rumps greater saturation colour extension correlated higherranking males males higher ranking likely associate females especially sexual skin swelling likely successfully mount dominant adult males practice mate guarding adult females times maximal skin swelling high competitive ability likely successfully due tropical habitat mating season coincides dry season may october birth season coincides wet season november mandrillus genus uses visual vocal forms communication extremely similar identical across species species three identical longrange vocal communications twophase grunts roars twophased grunt low twosyllable continuous sound used exclusively adult males calm group progression mate roars single low single syllable sounds used exclusively males context twophase grunts crowling used infants females group movement foraging call together dispersed also use numerous shortrange vocal sounds various purposes yak grinding teeth used tense situations grunt used aggressive situations screams used escape experiencing fear growl used convey mild alarm kalarm used convey intense alarm girney used species use various facial expressions communicate silent baring teeth positive visual signal conveying peaceful intentions often combined shaking staring openmouthed display aggression frowning bare teeth used encourage submission staring bare teeth communicate aggression fear pouting signals submission relaxed open mouth
