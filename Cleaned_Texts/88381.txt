gastornis extinct genus large flightless birds lived midpaleocene mideocene epochs paleogene period fossils found europe asia north america remains north america originally assigned genus diatryma gastornis species large birds traditionally considered predators small mammals however several lines evidence including lack hooked claws known gastornis footprints studies beak structure isotopic signatures bones caused scientists reinterpret birds herbivores probably fed tough plant material seeds gastornis generally agreed related galloanserae group containing waterfowl gamebirds gastornis first described fragmentary skeleton named gaston planté described studious young man full zeal discovered first fossils clay argile plastique fr formation deposits meudon near discovery notable due

perforations penetrate foot single gastornithid toe bone new jersey described othniel charles marsh classified new genus species barornis regens recognized could considered junior synonym diatryma therefore later additional fragmentary specimens found wyoming assigned new species diatryma ajax also considered synonym g american museum natural history expedition bighorn basin willwood formation wyoming found first nearly complete skull skeleton described gave scientists first clear picture matthew granger stein classified nearly complete specimen yet another new species diatryma description diatryma new european specimens referred genus instead gastornis however initial discovery diatryma soon became clear gastornis similar former could considered junior synonym latter fact similarity recognized early elliott coues debated researchers throughout century meaningful comparisons gastornis diatryma made difficult lemoines incorrect skeletal illustration composite nature discovered early following several authors began recognize greater degree similarity european north american birds often placing order gastornithiformes even family gastornithidae newly recognized degree similarity caused many scientists tentatively accept synonymy pending comprehensive review anatomy consequently correct scientific name genus gastornis known large amount fossil remains clearest

relatives classified together family gastornithidae long considered members order gruiformes however traditional concept gruiformes since shown unnatural grouping beginning late first phylogenetic analysis gastornithid relationships consensus began grow close relatives lineage includes waterfowl screamers study showed gastornithids earlybranching group anseriformes formed sister group members recognizing apparent close relationship gastornithids waterfowl researchers classify gastornithids within anseriform group others restrict name anseriformes crown group formed modern species label larger group including extinct relatives anseriformes like gastornithids name gastornithids therefore sometimes placed order simplified version family tree found agnolin et al reproduced anatoidea

reevaluation fossil published concluded differences specimen bone gastornis species minor considered asian species longstanding debate surrounding gastornis interpretation diet often depicted predator contemporary small mammals famously included early horse however size gastornis legs bird would agile catch fastmoving prey fossils suggest consequently gastornis suspected ambush hunter andor used pack hunting techniques pursue ambush prey gastornis predator would certainly needed means hunting prey dense forest alternatively could used strong beak eating large strong vegetation skull gastornis massive comparison living ratites similar body size biomechanical analysis skull suggests jawclosing musculature enormous lower jaw deep resulting lengthened moment arm jaw muscles features strongly suggest gastornis could generate powerful scientists proposed skull gastornis overbuilt herbivorous diet support traditional interpretation gastornis carnivore used powerfully constructed beak subdue struggling prey crack open bones extract others noted apparent lack predatory features skull prominently hooked beak evidence gastornis specialized herbivore even omnivore sort perhaps used large beak crack hard foods like nuts footprints attributed gastornithids possibly species gastornis described showed birds lacked strongly hooked talons hind legs another line evidence suggesting predatory
