child bone fracture pediatric fracture medical condition bone child person younger age cracked injuries children fracture bone fractures children different adult bone fractures childs bones still growing also consideration needs taken child fractures bone since affect child everyday basis bones support many kinds forces naturally applied forces strong bones break example adolescent jumps trampoline lands hisher feet bones connective tissue adolescents feet usually absorb force flex return original shape however adolescent lands force strong bones connective tissue able support force bones child likely bend break completely softer periosteum stronger fractures common children incomplete fractures fractures greenstick torus buckle fracturescitation needed fracture involves bend one side bone partial fracture side name analogy green ie fresh wood similarly breaks outside bent subnanostructure cortical bone may provide one possible explanation greenstick fractures children contrary adults bone tissue low ratio mature immature enzymatic crosslinks children bone tissue potential explanation presence greenstick fractures fracture occurs metaphyseal locations resemble torus base pillar architectural terms acute angulation cortex noted opposed usual curved surface caused impaction usually result force acting longitudinal axis bone typically consequence fall outstretched arm mainly involve distal radial metaphysis word torus derived latin word torus meaning swelling protuberancecitation needed bone becomes curved along longitudinal incomplete fracture thin crack bone doesnt go way bonecitation needed bone fractured one placecitation needed fracture two places bonecitation needed bone fractures two places crushed corner fracture buckethandle fracture fragmentation distal end one femurs loose piece appearing bone margins osseous density paralleling term buckethandle fracture used loose bone rather wide distal end making end crescent types fractures characteristic child abuserelated fracture doesnt penetrate skincitation needed fracture resulting ends bone penetrating skin pose increased risk infectioncitation needed fracture bone cracks completely pieces line upcitation needed fracture bone cracks completely two pieces pieces move alignment type fracture might require surgery make sure pieces aligned castingcitation needed even though symptoms vary widely experiencing bone fracture common fracture symptoms include children generalized disorders renal diseases cystic fibrosis diabetes mellitus growth hormone deficiency osteogenesis imperfecta disorders neuromuscular disorders children cerebral palsy spina bifida arthrogryposis higher risk fracture combination joint stiffness poor children general greater risk high activity levels children riskprone behaviors even greater million child abuse neglect cases reported every year thirtyfive every hundred cases physical abuse bone fractures sometimes part physical abuse children knowing symptoms bone fractures physical abuse recognizing actual risks physical abuse help forward prevention future abuse astoundingly abuse fractures dealt correctly potential lead death fracture patterns abuse fractures common abuse fractures growing part long bone shaft separated part bone fractures humeral shaft long bone shoulder elbow ribs scapula outer end clavicle vertebra multiple fractures varying age bilateral fractures complex skull fractures also linked abuse fractures varying ages occur thirteen percent differences bone structure child adult differences important correct evaluation treatment fractures childs bones heal faster adults thicker stronger active dense fibrous membrane periosteum covers surface periosteum blood vessels supply oxygen nutrition bone cells stronger thicker periosteum children causes better supply oxygen nutrients helps faster remodeling fractured bones periosteum children causes rapid union fractured bones increased potential childs fractures heal quickly significantly reduced due thickness strength childs periosteum thickness also drawbacks small displacement periosteum thickness strength make fracture periosteum difficult growth plates areas bones bones children growth plates open helps manage childs fracturescitation needed bone fracture types differ depending age sex child changes bones time cause variance pattern number bone fracture injuries probability bone fractures children increases small child injuries likely minimal child doesnt speed mass cause serious age increases mass speed resulting serious fractures age girls usually fracture bone twelve boys age also girls statistically fewer fractures boys half boys onefourth girls likely fracture childhood wrist also likely part body injured sport activities increase fractures children increase well especially boys participate either wrestling football much like bone types different stages childhood varying bone fracture injuries infants children adolescents vary careful evaluation best treatment child child experiences fracture pain able easily move fractured doctor emergency care contacted immediately cases even though child pain still able move medical help must sought decrease pain bleeding movement physician put splint fractured area treatment fracture follows simple rule bones aligned correctly prevented moving place bones specific treatment applied depends severe fracture open closed fracture specific bone involved fracture hip fracture treated differently forearm fracture different treatments different general treatments common fractures follows fractures heal successfully repositioned simple plaster fiberglass cast commonly cast brace allows limited movement nearby joints acceptable treatment consists aligning bone bones gentle steady pulling action pulling may transmitted bone bones metal pin bone skin tapes preliminary treatment used preparation secondary treatment used orthopedic surgeon assigns restore fractured bone original function method positions bones exact location risk infection complications procedure involves orthopedist performing surgery bone align bone fragments followed placement special screws metal plates outer surface bone fragments also held together running metal rods marrow center treatment also requires surgery orthopedist pins screws placed fractured bone fracture site orthopedic surgeon repositions bone fragments pins screws connected metal bar bars outside skin holds bones proper position heal external fixation device removed appropriate time fractures children generally heal relatively fast may take several weeks growth plate fractures heal without lasting rarely bridging bone may form across growth plates causing stunted growth andor cases bridging bone may need surgically growth plate fracture may also stimulate growth causing longer bone corresponding bone therefore american academy orthopaedic surgeons recommends regular followup least year growth plate httpsenwikipediaorgwikichildbonefracture
