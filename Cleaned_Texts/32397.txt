prosopometamorphopsia visual disorder characterized altered perceptions faces facial features distorted variety ways including drooping swelling discoloration shifts position prosopometamorphopsia distinct prosopagnosia characterised inability recognise faces cases prosopometamorphopsia reported scientific half reported cases features sides face appear distorted half cases distortions restricted one side face left right condition called hemiprosopometamorphopsia generally faces tend appear distorted person affected suffer condition able recognise faces normally perceive strangely disfigured facial hallucinations usually described ugly prominent eyes described faces cartoonlike quality faces known perceived contorted displaced example one patient described persons face nose deviated side mouth laying diagonal one eyebrow higher prosopometamorphopsia may either involve perceptions whole face one side face usually right hemisphere definitive cause prosopometamorphopsia still relatively unknown however several potential theories expressed literature area generally condition associated damage abnormalities various brain areas temporal occipital parietal frontal development prosopometamorphopsia recorded manifestation epilepsy hyperactivity core distributed face areas without lesions may connected causation functional imaging studies humans identified area fusiform gyrus selectively activated stimulation exposed faces called fusiform face area another area known activated face stimuli superior temporal sulcus sts region particularly active process facial expressions especially expressive features related eyes therefore suggested prominent eyes typical feature facial perceptions distortions recorded accordance increased activity would cause overrepresentation eyes within sts rather fusiform face studies however found stimulation posterior midfusiform face selective regions patient medicationresistant epilepsy resulted perceptions consistent facial metamorphoses patient noted experimenters face started study found perceived distortions correlated signal changes patients ffa sts prosopometamorphopsia considered face hallucination included umbrella complex visual unlike forms hallucinations peduncular hallucinosis charles bonnet syndrome prosopometamorphopsia predominate particular time day constant however patients charles bonnet syndrome noted descriptions form perceptual distortion along others macropsia micropsia alteration perceived object size palinopia spatial temporal varieties polyopia classified category termed facial distortions occur either hallucinated perceptions true nonhallucinated attributed structural brain changes functional disorders like epilepsy migraine eye antidepressants citalopram antipsychotic quetiapine recorded unable facilitate improvements valproic acid initially used treat woman hallucinated dragonlike faces alleviated symptoms entirely however went develop auditory hallucinations side subsequently prescribed rivastigmine instead reduced auditory hallucinations reduced visual symptoms woman previous study treated intravenous heparin infusion coumadization period days enabled alleviation visual symptoms almost type treatment may vary depending cause facial distortions one study reported woman developed prosopometamorphopsia initially developed severe migraines blurred vision mainly right visual hemifield confused state visual disturbances persisted long migraine subsided several hours later described left half peoples faces place would see distortions irrespective whether faces familiar unknown however able visualise faces familiar people mind without distortions also report perceiving distortions stimuli faces demonstrated patterns year first assessments discovered woman left hemisphere lesion resulted distortions left half faces exposed unilateral aspect defect suggests early stages face processing occurs parallel mechanisms across hemispheres right hemisphere integrates information results unitary face another study examined woman suffered sudden onset nausea dizziness blurred central part faces especially nose mouth described shape claimed noses looked narrow lengthened toward mouth looked small rounded regardless whether faces familiar found impairments visuoperceptual performances cognitive psychiatric impairments brain mri revealed infarction right medial temporooccipital lobe including parahippocampal gyrus complement ffa woman suffered lifelong history seeing faces morph dragonlike faces reported hallucinating similar faces several times initially would recognise actual faces would become black grew long pointy ears protruding snout displayed reptilelike skin large protruding eyes bright colours would see faces coming towards several times day objects like electric sockets also hallucinations dark previously suffered recurrent headaches passage hallucinations see movements corner eyes zoopsia saw large ants crawling hands mri brain showed minor whitematter abnormalities near lentiform nucleus semioval center visual perceptions experienced attributed unusual electrophysiological activity regions brain specialised face colour ventral occipitotemporal woman reported begun seeing facial perceived peoples faces would change look like caricatures perception worsened time history epilepsy childhood suffered concussion several years condition though medical evidence seizure found distortions reported occasionally would experience pixelated vision like television static mentioned symptoms occurred several times week event lasting minutes hours httpsenwikipediaorgwikiprosopometamorphopsia
