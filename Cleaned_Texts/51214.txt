blood donation occurs person voluntarily blood drawn used transfusions andor made biopharmaceutical medications process called fractionation separation whole blood components donation may whole blood specific components directly apheresis blood banks often participate collection process well procedures follow today developed world blood donors unpaid volunteers donate blood community supply countries established supplies limited donors usually give blood family friends need transfusion directed donation many donors donate several reasons form charity general awareness regarding demand blood increased confidence oneself helping personal friend relative social pressure despite many reasons people donate enough potential donors actively donate however reversed disasters blood donations increase often creating excess supply later discarded countries allow paid donation people paid cases incentives money paid time work people also blood drawn future use autologous donation donating relatively safe donors bruising needle inserted may feel faint potential donors evaluated anything might make blood unsafe use screening includes testing diseases transmitted blood transfusion including hiv viral hepatitis donor must also answer questions medical history take short physical examination make sure donation hazardous health often donor donate varies days months based component donate laws country donation takes place example united states donors must wait days eight weeks wholeblood donations seven days platelet apheresis twice per sevenday period plasmapheresis amount blood drawn methods vary collection done manually automated equipment takes specific components blood components blood used transfusions short shelf life maintaining constant supply persistent problem led increased interest autotransfusion whereby patients blood salvaged surgery continuous alternatively selfdonated prior needed generally notion donation refer giving ones self though context become somewhat acceptably idiomatic charles richard drew american surgeon medical researcher researched field blood transfusions developing improved techniques blood storage applied expert knowledge developing largescale blood banks early world war ii allowed medics save thousands lives allied forces prominent african american field drew protested practice racial segregation donation blood lacked scientific foundation resigned position american red cross maintained policy needed blood donations divided groups based receive collected allogeneic also called homologous donation donor gives blood storage blood bank transfusion unknown recipient directed donation person often family member donates blood transfusion specific directed donations relatively rare established supply replacement donor donation hybrid two common developing case friend family member recipient donates blood replace stored blood used transfusion ensuring consistent supply person blood stored transfused back donor later date usually surgery called autologous blood used make medications made allogeneic donations donations exclusively used blood sometimes collected using similar methods therapeutic phlebotomy similar ancient practice bloodletting used treat conditions hereditary hemochromatosis polycythemia vera blood sometimes treated blood donation may immediately discarded used transfusion manufacturingcitation needed actual process varies according laws country recommendations donors vary according collecting world health organization gives recommendations blood donation developing countries many followed example recommended testing requires laboratory facilities trained staff specialized reagents may available expensive developing event donors come donate allogeneic blood sometimes called blood drive blood donor session occur blood bank often set location community shopping center workplace school house donors typically required give consent process meet certain criteria weight hemoglobin levels requirement means minors donate without permission parent countries answers associated donors blood name provide anonymity others united states names kept create lists ineligible potential donor meet criteria deferred term used many donors ineligible may allowed donate later blood banks united states may required label blood therapeutic donor accept donations donors blood others australian red cross blood service accept blood donors hemochromatosis genetic disorder affect safety donors race ethnic background sometimes important since certain blood types especially rare ones common certain ethnic historically united states donors segregated excluded race religion ethnicity longer standard donors screened health risks could make donation unsafe recipient restrictions controversial restricting donations men sex men msm risk transmitting uk excluding northern ireland reduced blanket ban msm donors narrower restriction prevents msm donating blood sex men within past similar change made us late food drug administration uk us reduced restrictions three fda announced new policies easing restrictions gay bisexual men donating updated guidelines stipulate men monogamous relationships men recently sex individuals report sex people hiv positive sex new partner engaged anal sex still barred blood autologous donors always screened recipient safety problems since donor person receive since donated blood may given pregnant women women childbearing age donors taking teratogenic birth defectcausing medications deferred medications include acitretin etretinate isotretinoin finasteride donors examined signs symptoms diseases transmitted blood transfusion hiv malaria viral hepatitis screening may include questions risk factors various diseases travel countries risk malaria variant disease vcjd questions vary country country example blood centers qu√©bec rest canada poland many places defer donors lived united kingdom risk donors united kingdom restricted vcjd risk blood transfusion united donor also examined asked specific questions medical history make sure donating blood hazardous health donors hematocrit hemoglobin level tested make sure loss blood make anemic check common reason donor accepted hemoglobin levels blood donations american red cross females males anyone higher lower hemoglobin level pulse blood pressure body temperature also evaluated elderly donors sometimes also deferred age alone health addition age weight height important factors considering eligibility donors example american red cross requires donor pounds kg whole blood platelet donation least pounds kg males least pounds kg females power red donations double red safety donating blood pregnancy studied thoroughly pregnant women usually deferred six weeks donors blood type must determined blood used transfusions collecting agency usually identifies whether blood type b ab donors rh type screen antibodies less common antigens testing including crossmatch usually done transfusion type negative often cited universal refers red cell whole blood transfusions plasma platelet transfusions system reversed ab positive universal platelet donor type ab positive ab negative universal plasma donor blood tested diseases including tests used highsensitivity screening tests actual diagnosis made test results later found false positives using specific false negatives rare donors discouraged using blood donation purpose anonymous std screening false negative could mean contaminated unit blood usually discarded tests positive exceptions autologous donations donor generally notified test donated blood tested many methods core tests recommended world health organization reported countries surveyed use basic tests blood variety tests transfusion transmitted infections often used based local requirements additional testing expensive cases tests implemented additional tests include infectious diseases west nile sometimes multiple tests used single disease cover limitations test example hiv antibody test detect recently infected donor blood banks use antigen hiv nucleic acid test addition basic antibody test detect infected donors cytomegalovirus special case donor testing many donors test positive virus hazard healthy recipient harm recipients weak immune two main methods obtaining blood donor frequent simply take blood vein whole blood blood typically separated parts usually red blood cells plasma since recipients need specific component transfusionscitation needed amount blood donated one session generally called unit defined countries like canada follow others set rules sometimes variation even among different agencies within country example whole blood donations united states ml eu must ml countries smaller units india uses singapore japan historically donors peoples republic china would donate ml though larger ml donations become common particularly northern china heavier case additional ml blood may collected separately testing method draw blood donor separate using centrifuge filter store desired part return rest donor process called apheresis often done machine specifically designed purpose process especially common plasma platelets red blood direct transfusions vein used blood may taken artery case blood stored pumped directly donor recipient early method blood transfusion rarely used modern phased world war ii problems logistics doctors returning treating wounded soldiers set banks stored blood returned civilian blood drawn large arm vein close skin usually median cubital vein inside elbow skin blood vessel cleaned antiseptic iodine prevent skin bacteria contaminating collected also prevent infections needle pierced donors needle gauge used minimize shearing forces may physically damage red blood cells flow tourniquet sometimes wrapped around upper arm increase pressure blood arm veins speed process donor may also prompted hold object squeeze repeatedly increase blood flow veincitation needed common method collecting blood donors vein container amount blood drawn varies millilitres millilitres depending country millilitres blood usually stored flexible plastic bag also contains sodium citrate phosphate dextrose adenine combination keeps blood clotting preserves storage chemicals sometimes added processing plasma whole blood used make plasma transfusions also processed medications using process called fractionation development dried plasma used treat wounded world war ii variants process still used make variety apheresis blood donation method blood passed apparatus separates one particular constituent returns remainder donor usually component returned red blood cells portion blood takes longest replace using method individual donate plasma platelets much frequently safely donate whole combined donor giving plasma platelets donationcitation needed platelets also separated whole blood must pooled multiple donations three ten units whole blood required therapeutic plateletpheresis provides least one full dose donationcitation needed platelet donation blood drawn patient platelets separated blood components remainder blood red blood cells plasma white blood cells returned patient process completed several times period two hours collect single plasmapheresis frequently used collect source plasma used manufacturing medications much like plasma whole blood plasma collected time plateletpheresis sometimes called concurrent plasma apheresis also used collect red blood cells usual single donation commonly known double reds collect white blood cells donors usually kept donation site minutes donating since adverse reactions take place immediately blood centers typically provide light refreshments orange juice cookies lunch allowance help donor needle site covered bandage donor directed keep bandage several hot climates donors advised avoid dehydration strenuous exercise games alcohol hours donationcitation needed donated plasma replaced red blood cells replaced bone marrow circulatory system slower rate average days healthy adult males one study range days replacement rates basis frequently donor donate bloodcitation needed plasmapheresis plateletpheresis donors donate much frequently lose significant amounts red cells exact rate often donor donate differs country country example plasmapheresis donors united states allowed donate large volumes twice week could nominally donate litres gallons year whereas donor japan may donate every week could donate litres gallons iron supplementation decreases rates donor deferral due low hemoglobin first donation visit subsequent donations ironsupplemented donors higher hemoglobin iron stores hand iron supplementation frequently causes diarrhea constipation epigastric abdominal discomfort longterm effects iron supplementation without measurement iron stores donors screened health problems would put risk serious complications donating firsttime donors teenagers women higher risk one study showed donors adverse reaction reactions minor study donations found one donor longterm united states blood bank required report death might possibly linked blood donation analysis reports october september evaluated six events found five deaths clearly unrelated donation remaining case found evidence donation cause hypovolemic reactions occur rapid change blood pressure fainting generally worst problem process similar risks forms phlebotomy bruising arm needle insertion common concern one study found less donors number less common complications blood donation known occur include arterial puncture delayed bleeding nerve irritation nerve injury tendon injury thrombophlebitis allergic donors sometimes adverse reactions sodium citrate used apheresis collection procedures keep blood clotting since anticoagulant returned donor along blood components collected bind calcium donors blood cause reactions tend cause tingling lips may cause convulsions seizure hypertension serious donors sometimes given calcium supplements donation prevent side apheresis procedures red blood cells returned done manually donor receives blood different donor transfusion reaction take place manual apheresis extremely rare developed world risk automated procedures safe whole blood final risk blood donors equipment properly cases equipment comes direct contact blood discarded reused equipment significant problem china blood plasma donors may exposed hiv shared collected blood usually stored blood bank separate components short shelf lives storage methods keep platelets extended periods time though studied longest shelf life used platelets seven red blood cells rbc frequently used component shelf life days refrigerated relatively rare longterm storage applications extended freezing blood mixture glycerol process expensive requires extremely cold freezer plasma stored frozen extended period time typically given expiration date one year maintaining supply less american red cross states united states someone needs blood every two seconds someone needs platelets every thirty consistent demand blood type one type blood stock guarantee another type blood banks may units stock lack others ultimately causing patients need units specific blood types delayed canceled additionally every year increase around transfusions without increase donors balance well growing population elderly people need transfusions future without predicted increase reflect growing numbers supported blood donations red cross increased totaling units hospitals need donations increased blood donations tend always high demand numerous accounts repeatedly stating periodic shortages however trend disrupted national disasters trend demonstrates people donating catastrophes arguably donations needed compared periods without reported every national disaster surplus donations surplus consisted one notable examples pattern september attacks study observed compared four weeks september estimated increase donations firsttime donors first week attack average donations firsttime donors attack increased donations repeat donors increased donations per week initially donations estimated around increased donations september therefore first week attack overall estimated increase donations compared average weekly donations made four weeks prior attack increases donations observed blood donation centers beginning day blood donations average first weeks following number donations fell estimated donations first week donations second fourth weeks despite substantial increase donors rate firsttime donors would become repeat donors limited storage time means difficult stockpile blood prepare disaster subject discussed length september attacks united states consensus collecting disaster impractical efforts focused maintaining adequate supply blood centers us often difficulty maintaining even threeday supply routine transfusion world health organization recognizes world blood donor day june year promote blood donation birthday karl landsteiner scientist discovered abo blood group
