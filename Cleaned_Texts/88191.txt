halogravity traction hgt type traction device utilized treat spinal deformities congenital spine deformities cervical instability basilar invagination used prior surgical treatment reduce difficulty following surgery need dangerous device works applying weight spine order stretch straighten patients capable remaining somewhat active using wheelchair walker whilst undergoing treatment research suggests hgt safe treatment even improve patients nutrition respiratory functioning however patients may experience side effects headaches neurological complications halo device invented doctors working riancho los amigos work published paper entitled halo spinal skeletal traction fixation clinician pierre stagnara utilized device develop halogravity halogravity traction works straightening stretching compressed relies viscoelastic properties vertebrae means vertebrae stretch time doctors apply weight spine gradually increase time slowly straightening stretching patients undergoing procedure typically spend entire course treatment usually three eight weeks hospital usually halogravity traction first step treatment plan child severe spinal deformity following procedure common surgical operation spinal fusion surgery performed afterward permanently mend utilized operation reduce need dangerous operation reduce risk damage soft tissues nerves surround spine addition hgt also found reduce risk complications following perform halotraction therapy surgeon use six ten small pins attach halo made metal ring patients doctors typically leave one two centimeters distance halo patients head common older patients given eight pins younger patients given prior pin placement patients may undergo hair removal required successful treatment help reduce risk pin infection hair getting caught pin scalp pins placed forehead bones prevent head moving pin placement determined using ct scan chosen area cleaned betadine swabs usually two three pins placed frontal occipital areas pins placed occipital area placed one centimeter behind auricle ear pins placed anterior head likely placed one centimeter sides eyebrow avert potential damage supraorbital supratrochlear nerves potential muscle damage parietal placements generally avoided skull around area generally softer risks pins puncturing temporal artery typically pins tightened torque equivalent age child using torque wrench adults withstand tighter torques children whilst operation performed child given general infant children significantly less torque required tighten pins allows pins placed areas could placed older afterward halo attached pulley system attached patients bed walker springtype pulleys typically used allow patient selfregulate weight applied pulley improves safety springbased hgt devices also cheaper easier build methods common patients begin procedure pounds weight pulley next weeks clinicians add weight pulley slowly straighten patients spine time eventually weight greater patients body weight may doctors monitor movements strength take xrays patient track progress adjust amount weight pulley system based results patients undergo cranial nerve testing spine reached optimal position spinal fusion surgery performed whilst undergoing procedure patients encouraged remain active possible activities lowimpact play walking standing increase benefits halotraction therapy however patients limited leaving traction short time span leave activities repositioning changing clothes daily medical care showering using toilet baby shampoo required used bathing purposes shampoos could contain chemicals react negatively metal halo patients required utilize special bed sleeping whilst traction ending treatment patient required avoid strenuous activities months spine muscles still need recover patients may wear orthopedic vest halo halogravity traction found almost completely patients undergone procedure report greater ability stand upright increased appetite improved body improve respiratory functioning relieving pressure lungs caused deformed patients often gain weight improved nutrition following may occur since hgt correct issues associated spinal deformities exercise comorbid metabolic disorders gastrointestinal malformations issues associated malnutrition low weight hgt lead weight gain correcting combination surgical release hgt may improve flexibility spine lead spinal patients may experience pain pins usually caused loosening pins remedied tightening patients may experience infections site pins applied infections typically treated antibiotics one rare serious complication procedure development intracranial abscesses due septic contamination pin patients experience headaches around area pins applied short halo attached common patients recover pain less halo therapy leave small lesions skin pins first removed typically turn scabs days patients undergone procedure also small scars foreheads scars typically fade traction applied greater tolerable amount patient may feel cervical pain cranial nerve lesions nausea dizziness side effects treated lowering level weight patients may suffer motor paresis application device typically present patients preexisting spinal cord generally hgt cause neurological side effects due slow progression traction spine adjusts slowly time result consequences generally limited children less likely adolescents adults experience neurological side effects due softness flexibility spine well low erbs palsy identified rare neurological side effect one study published journal studies health technology informatics found extremely rare cases hgt could induce erbs palsy ulnar nerve paralysis median nerve palsy cases seven cases identified study patients fully recovered within months treatment likelihood developing erbs palsy due hgt associated weight another study published journal spinal disorders techniques found patients may experience erbs palsy sensory loss treatment however none patients experienced side effects reported study permanent neurological one clinical study published biomed research international found hgt resulted reduced bone density among patients however little research investigated potential side effect found evidence support patients bone conditions fibrous dysplasia osteogenesis imperfecta may unsuitable treatment pins capable safely applied osteoporosis considered contraindication sometimes may prevent treatment however doctors may avert complications utilizing pins lower absolute contraindications halogravity traction include presence stenotic segment intradural extradural lesion lesions skull sites pin lesion tumor spine severe skull deformity spine research conducted hgt found mostly effective average correction rate hgt shown sagittal curves coronal one study patients published journal spine deformity found average correction rate coronal curves according cohort study conducted subjects investigating efficacy halo traction therapy found improvement rate spine found coronal curvature improvement adolescents adults kyphosis improved rate adolescents afterward spinal surgery performed people undergone procedure greater chance one study conducted patients either scoliosis kyphosis kyphoscoliosis found improvement occurred within first weeks treatment according study spinal curve improved first two weeks decreased weeks studies found similar results one study conducted patients found improvement occurred within first another study patients found mean improvement occurred first three much research utilized evidence efficacy hgt criticized lack control group small sample research suggested hgt leads statistically insignificant paul sponseller orthopedic surgeon johns hopkins university claims study use traction treatment severe spinal deformity research found statistically significant difference main coronal curve correction vs operative time blood loss total complication rate vs however data showcase people undergone hgt required surgical resection study patients severe spinal deformities treated spinal surgery mean correction degrees found patients undergone hgt prior operation mean correction found patients treated hgt researchers concluded difference statistically significant therefore hgt used general treatment issues reserved specific research suggests hgt may less effective forms traction halofemoral traction halopelvic hgt also found require lengthy hospital stays many patients dislike study paul sponsellor found patients undergone hgt spent almost twice amount time hospitalized received hgt significantly safer forms traction less likely produce significant complications blood neurological side effects spine stiffness hgt also allows patients remain social active whilst forms traction severely restrict reasons lead hgt becoming standard preoperative treatment patients severe spinal httpsenwikipediaorgwikihalogravitytractiondevice
