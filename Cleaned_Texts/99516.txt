privacy concerns soft privacy thus relevant thirdparty cloud service many privacy concerns center including risk unauthorized access data leakage sensitive information disclosure privacy one solution proposed privacy issues around cloud computing health care use access control giving partial access data based users role doctor family etc another solution applicable wireless technology moves data cloud usage differential differential privacy system typically encrypts data sends trusted service opens access hospital institutions strategy often used prevent data leakage attacks works adding noise data changes values slightly real underlying information accessed security questions study sensors concluded differential privacy techniques involving additional noise helped achieve mathematicallyprecise guaranteed adding noise data default prevent devastating privacy breaches commonwealth massachusetts group insurance commission released anonymous health records hiding sensitive information addresses phone numbers despite attempt hiding personal information providing useful database privacy still correlating health databases public voting databases individuals hidden data could rediscovered without differential privacy techniques encrypting data adding noise possible link data may seem related autonomous cars raise concerns location tracking sensorbased vehicles achieve full autonomy cars would need access massive database information surroundings paths take interaction others weather many circumstances need accounted leads privacy security questions data stored shared type data stored lot data potentially sensitive could used maliciously leaked hacked additionally concerns data sold companies data help predict products consumer would like need could undesirable data may expose health conditions alert companies advertise said customers locationbased spam terms legal aspect technology rules regulations governing parts cars areas laws left unwritten oftentimes many current laws vague leaving rules open interpretation example federal laws dating back many years ago governing computer privacy extended cover phones arose extended apply computer

handling sensitive health data possible solution use differential privacy add noise mathematical data leaked information may accurate using cloud important consumers businesses provides cheap source virtually unlimited storage space one challenge cloud storage faced search functions typical cloud computing design would encrypt every word enters cloud user wants search keyword specific file stored cloud encryption hinders easy fast method search cant scan encrypted data search term anymore keywords encrypted encryption ends doubleedged sword protects privacy introduces new inconvenient one performance solution lies modifying search method documents indexed entirely rather keywords search method also changed searching term gets encrypted matched encrypted keywords without deencrypting data case privacy achieved easy search words match encrypted files however new issue arises takes longer time read match encrypted file decrypt whole thing police authorities also benefit reading personal information mobile data useful privacy infringements potential surveillance cases often concern united states several cases reached supreme court instances authorities used gps data track suspects locations monitored data long periods time practice limited supreme court case riley v california unanimously decided prevent warrantless searches mobile data mobile privacy also issue realm spam calls effort reduce calls many people taken advantage apps promise help block spam problem apps many known collect personal phone data including callers phone honeypot call detail records cdrs call recordings although information necessary creating blacklists spam apps dont always prioritize privacy collection data typically smallscaled apps varying budget degrees differential privacy always top mind differential privacy rather ignoring privacy concerns often expensive dataset needed construct good algorithm achieves local differential privacy much larger basic vpns used create
