mate preferences humans refers one human chooses chooses mate another human reasoning see evolutionary psychology mating men women observed different criteria makes good ideal mate gender differences potential mates socioeconomic status also seen noticeable effect especially developing areas social status humans choosing mate opposite sex females place high preference mate physically ties idea women discriminate men hypothesized fitness cues physically attractive man higher fitness better genes women attracted masculine traits greater sexual dimorphism eg strong jawline muscular body taller height indeed men masculine tend higher number sexual hypothesis suggests secondary sexual characteristics low waisttochest ratio masculine facial features eg strong jawline larger brow ridge muscular reliable indicators mate quality hormones cause development ie testosterone suppress immune system immunosuppression male would susceptible diseases pathogens however male good enough condition weather negative effects would indicative women selected men mates good genes like men preference lower waisttohip ratio whr measure linked female bodily women tend attracted men broader shoulders relatively narrow waists waisttochest ratio ratio changed distribution android fat torso makes characteristic vshape related levels testosterone also correlated higher perceived dominance crossculturally however waisttochest ratio significance differs crosscultural study across urban rural settings britain malaysia found bmi waisttohip ratio also play roles rating male physical attractiveness urban settings participants would place larger importance wcr minor importance bmi significant importance whr rural settings bmi however found important factor deciding physical fluctuating asymmetry fa deviation perfect bilateral symmetry organism symmetrical organism better handling developmental stress arising environmental stress genetic problems developmental along

mating preference affected fa males ability willingness provide resources highly desirable females evolutionary past would demonstrated ability provide food shelter protection modern day humans cues high resource acquisition presented different ways crossculturally females show increased preference economic resources males males marry certain age tend earn significantly males age females often choose mates young amount resources actually possess may small therefore females seek traits indicative potential resource acquisition ability good education ambition career potential male becomes unemployed lazy female far likely discontinue relationship fact even clothing act cue sexual selection females willing engage relationships men wearing high status age another trait sexually selected females studies consistently found females tend select mates roughly years older even applies older men much likely financially secure along career thus able provide greater economic resources female future offspring wellknown fact men assign greater salience attractiveness potential mate considering mating preference women first factor shown impact mating preference males waist hip ratio whr relationship waist circumference hip circumference suggested marker age reproductive status also found women whr rated attractive youthful fertile healthy compared whrs furthermore current research also found women whr normal weight rated attractive whereas whr underweight rated youthful attractive extension whr research showed impact breast hip size upon attractiveness women large breasts small hips rated attractive women small breasts small hips well finding women large hips rated less attractive irrespective breast size skin found honest indicator sex hormones may indicate levels fertility study directly examines relationship individual acne levels hormones could potentially indicate low fertility therefore guiding attractiveness mate preference skin condition attractiveness link corroborated research found skin colour skin homogeneity facial adiposity fat deposited around face predict female attractiveness therefore mate preference skin tone also found honest indicator youthfulness well research showing first links estradiol female facial redness woman reaches peak ovulatory cycle facial redness increases research would suggest male mate preference would guided individuals skin tone looking women redder facial skin tones indicate peak fertility optimal opportunity reproductive success males show preference neotenous youthful looking features women big small nose full features act signal fertility caused high estrogen low testosterone result evolution features deemed highly attractive would indicate higher chance successful reproduction male mate preference neoteny shown research men asked morph images female faces ideal face achieved chastity deemed highly desirable across cultures however extent importance shows importance chastity males evolutionary sense linked paternal certainty contraception way ensure woman inseminated another man idea parental investment common humans animal kingdom derives fact across species imbalance amount time parent invests offspring parental investment acts determinant offspring survival accessing investment important sex provide much pi theory states sex invests time raising offspring limiting sex selective choosing mate sex thus invests time competing courting sexual selection limiting sex stronger larger disparity pi sexes parental investment relatively equal humans meaning selectiveness similar male investment means males also selective thus female ornaments evolved address parental investment explain interest ability provide resources since parental investment longterm mating similar therefore selectiveness females use signs male parental investment assess whether men willing invest children mating preferences confined longterm relationships men women developed separate sexual strategies used shortterm longterm mate gain psychological adaptations mate guarding sexual jealousy biological adaptations men testes size indicate polygamy present evolutionary preferred certain situations short term mating forms larger part male sexual strategy largely due pi men willing engage intercourse sooner preferring larger number partners however feminist anthropological research shown higher parental investment females consistently explain unidirectional gender difference males willing pursue sexual intercourse multiple mates research sarah hrdy shown female apes seek sexual relations many mates accumulate resources male mates invest resources given female apes offspring may one male apes offspring thus opposing trends gender differences mating strategies across various species despite similar gender differences parental investment across species gender differences mating preferences humans tendency male humans willing engage intercourse sooner

also taken instance egalitarian cultures less age difference men women relationships indicating role social power status differences influencing gender differences age preference men preferring younger mates women preferring older mate preference changes depending strategy used searching longterm mate women often tend emphasise resources short term potential mates physical attractiveness weighed heavily good indicator desirable study conducted shackleford schmitt buss four dimensions found seem predict compatible two people theyre looking longterm relationship survey given people different cultures across continents islands four dimensions four dimensions found imply individuals considering relationship weigh importance two sides dimension long term relationship example higher person scores love vs statusresources scale person extroverted emphasis place love person scoring lower would introvert place emphasis statusresources analogous reasoning applies three dimensions first named concept higher valued end continuum secondnamed lower end negative scores indicate direction value concept several gender differences observed study instance men seemed rate love vs statusresources higher importance relation women meaning men place emphasis mutual love women place emphasis women rated three dimensions higher importance majority cases saw women rate dependablestable vs good lookshealth higher implying stable personality desirable women physically attractive educationintelligence vs desire homechildren also rated higher showing similar educational background political views important home life small number cases women rank sociability vs similar religion higher pleasing disposition important sharing religious sum men appear value physical attractiveness health want home life children longterm mates whereas women appear value maturity dependability education social status financial stability research attempted assess individual
