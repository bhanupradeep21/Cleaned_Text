adolescent idiopathic scoliosis rather common disorder spine starts abnormally curving sideways scoliosis age years disorder generally occurs growth spurt happens right teens curvature progressive meaning gets worse however rare since common variant scoliosis show mild curvature since cases ais mild teens condition typically dont show obvious signs pain symptoms associated ais consist physical features would typically present teenager without condition include asymmetry waist shoulders legs latter involving length prominence shoulder blades abnormal walking leaning towards one side body constant basis tilting pelvis elevation external signs include visual physical discomfort clothes certain patients ais dont go develop health complications due fact cases condition usually nonprogressive andor mild moderate severity develop complications usually part smaller group ais patients severe cases common health complications among group patients abnormalities involve lungs bilateral reduction lung volume abnormalities usually result impairments respiratory function ranging mild complications associated severe scoliosis include internal intrathoracic organ displacement disruption appropriate rib back pain common complications sometimes experienced patients nonsevere cases patients severe cases patients extremely severe cases ais usually cobb angle dont typically live long generally die cause disorder teens generally unknown although thought caused genetic environmental teens disorder family history ais although dont known genetic cause gene mutation identified mainpartial culprit various genetic variants described medical literature capable increasing ones susceptibility developing adolescent idiopathic genes include study done genomewide linkage scans performed patients families adolescent idiopathic scoliosis segregated familial trait scans narrowed ais loci families locus chromosome genetic testing found different polymorphisms gene patients located inside genomic region consisted exons gene authors study noted mutations gene usually involved charge syndrome lateonset scoliosis one common associated features snps authors believed decrease functional protein growth spurt occurs adolescence predisposed individuals spinal curvature disrupting normal growth patterns turning abnormal study done evidence found sexlinked genetic cause ais performing genomewide association study idiopathic scoliosis patients authors found snps locus specifically located gene associated higher chance developing adolescent scoliosis moreover genetic variants shown increase risk ais significantly women barely men also found genetic variants increased risk ais also reduced risk earlyonset hair loss participants involved japanese study done found snp associated increased risk developing adolescent idiopathic another study chinese done supported snp question called snp located area kb gene intergenic area also happened close separate gene called authors separate japanese study done created animal models relating gene said animal models consisted zebrafishes made overexpression three genes overexpression found cause earlyonset scoliosis zebrafish used chinese study found another snp gene associated condition participants included ais patients healthy control subjects patients control subjects han chinese ancestry risk allele different japanese study done researchers found snp associated increased risk ais said snp found gene located chromosome snp associated increased length trunk people primarily european chinese study done found evidence association three snps intronic regions gene ais snp known increases risk ais gene located aforementioned gene risk allele adolescent idiopathic scoliosis normal allele c studied ais patients han chinese study done group researchers performed exomewide association study europeanamerican patients severe adolescent idiopathic scoliosis found snp seen strongly associated condition said patients features seen associated scoliosis risk allele included short stature lowerthanaverage plasma levels high body mass index researchers leading study decided animal model simulate effects mutation engineering zebrafish homozygous tandem duplications genes said zebrafish developed vertebral thoracical deformities short body chinese study done patients ais recruited genomewide association study researchers leading said study found snp gene necessarily involved patients ais involved severity scoliosis patients homozygous allele aa genotype tended milder scoliosis patients homozygous g allele position gg genotype latter group patients likely suffer severe scoliosis moreover patients aa genotype likely successful results brace treatment gg study done researchers wholeexome sequencing caucasian patients severe adolescent idiopathic scoliosis caucasian control subjects order find rare rare genetic mutations might deleterious involved ais list mutations considered rare researchers consisted coding variants absent dbsnp database caused insertions deletions frameshift splicesite missense rare mutations genes found ais patients control subjects alike following list consists specifically mutations found gene mutations listed three previously described associated marfan syndrome rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized marfanoid habitus joint hypermobility cardiac problems study mentioned also detected mutations people used study study done single chinese family familial adolescent idiopathic scoliosis researchers found missense mutation gene affected members performing whole exome said genetic variant wasnt found ais patients control subjects another chinese study participants study chinese different study done researchers genomewide copy number variant screening patients ais control subjects consisted healthy control subjects previous bipolar disorder study patients previous congenital clubfoot study following list consists cnvs found participants condition diagnosed use following diagnostic adolescent idiopathic scoliosis considered diagnostic option patient said patient must ages years treatment mild cases ais less cobb angle usually consists regular physical checkups done clinical environment monitor curvature purpose checkups able detect possible progression earlyon well use methods schroths method stretching treatment moderate cases ais cobb angle usually consists usage bracing spine usually doesnt change curvature rather prevents progressing progressing severe case treatment severe cases ais cobb angle consists corrective surgery usually involves bone grafts insertion proper spinal instrumentation latter treatment methods dont high postsurgical complication condition affects teens treatment required teenagers condition even smaller portion die due severe curvature related ais common form idiopathic scoliosis accounting around postsurgical complications common among men coexisting health conditions ais appears common among living northern although mild curvature affects females males equally incidencewise severe curvatures tend affect female teens male
