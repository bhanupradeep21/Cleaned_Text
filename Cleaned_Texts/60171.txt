integrative agnosia subdisease agnosia meaning lack integrating perceptual wholes within knowledge integrative agnosia assessed several experimental tests efron shape test determines specificity disease integrative disease often caused brain trauma producing medial ventral lesions extrastriate affecting region brain produces learning impairments inability integrate parts spatial distances producing visual images short longterm symptoms generally include memory learning impairments inability integrate parts coherently big range severity disease often symptoms shown patient vary well ambiguous general symptoms may patients often treated respective symptoms appear critical conditions causes integrative agnosia include stroke traumatic brain injury alzheimers disease anoxic episode following myocardial infarction progressive multifocal cases integrative agnosia appear medial ventral lesions extrastriate cortex integrative agnosia better able identify inanimate animate items indicates processes lead accurate perceptual organization visual information impaired attributed importance perceptual updating stored visual knowledge particularly important classes stimuli many perceptual neighbors andor stimuli perceptual features central stored representations patients also show tendency process visual stimuli initially global rather local although grouping local elements perceptual wholes impaired patients remain sensitive holistic visual determining whether patient form agnosia integrative agnosia efron shape test performed poor score efron shape test indicate form agnosia opposed integrative agnosia good score efron shape test poor score figureground segmentation test overlapping figures test indicate integrative agnosia patient integrative agnosia find hard group segment shapes especially overlapping animate items segment objects high internal detail however patient understand basic coding one treatment thought effective repeated exposure particular face object impaired perception may reorganized memory leading improvement tests imagery relative tests perception key factor type treatment successful regular consistent exposure lead improvements long run results may seen right away eventually case study patient named hja discussed analyzed jane riddoch glyn w humphreys case study done specifically symptoms one person diagnosed integrative agnosia generalizations made directly results conclusions disease whole also diagnosed like many people diagnosed integrative agnosia hja diagnosed disease suffering stroke surgical procedure operating room patient underwent several experiments verify specific type agnosia hja showed top half visual deficits entire visual field right left eyes lower visual fields showed normal patterns first experiment patient showed tactile presentation object helped hja significantly identifying object object presented visually patient struggled showed difficulty objects used common everyday objects patient always used descriptive terminology identify object instead single word term however hja showed ability copy objects match two objects pictures physical second experiment showed hja able identify figures better presented silhouette patients integrative agnosia also tend show symptom patient lacks local information figures support global information explains lack confidence naming object hja also shows trouble discriminating figures significant others meaningless stimuli turn explain patient distinguish overlapping third experiment showed patient able give important information object even though previously could identify object visually memory patient intact despite visual deficits fourth final section experiments patient shows lack visual color knowledge structures given specific object impaired hja uses technique drawing memories shows patients visual perceptions memories containing prior knowledge altered integrative agnosia following second case study also performed jane riddoch glyn w humphreys hja subject case study determine effects integrative agnosia visual spatial shortterm memory first group experiments riddoch humphreys tested patients visual spatial perceptual capabilities first asked draw bedroom using visual capabilities comparing drawing memory rather visual specific date repeated test one year later results showed patients integrative agnosia problems accurately recalling spatial information longterm memory addition hja asked assess spatial locations cities familiar stroke evidence inability assess spatial distances supported correct diagnosis integrative hja asked compare images human faces able point specific facial features however asked make sidebyside comparisons several celebrities faces unable make comparisons person without integrative agnosia able integrating features perceptual representation hand patient well asked determine angle degrees hands clock patient simply make global judgment based hands clock judgments made based perception local parts comparison features face second group experiments patient hja tested ability manipulate images assess information using spatial memory complete pattern tasks patient performed series tasks moscovitch letter manipulation task brooks matrix task compass directions task patient proved able receive spatial material well shortterm memory manipulating materials without reference frame patient still able make global processes identify shapes single lines letters lacked ability process configurations perceptual representations respective tasks visually holding image seconds patient able process spatial pattern transfer image onto paper accurately tasks hja given showed parts specifically failed integrate patents perception spatial elements without point reference reference point hja able integrate last set experiments hja tested ability reproduce visual stimuli reproduce possible impossible figures evidence suggested patient ability maintain global information order draw items reiterated difficulty maintaining local elements spatial relations last experiment experiment difficult hja visually significantly impaired drawing impossible figures provided spent significant amount time control elderly population used experiment processing information able transform onto paper patient demonstrated lack representation local parts reproducing concluded tasks performed well hja included tasks involving ranges imagerybased tasks accurately make judgments global representations angles clock maintained visual patterns interstimulus intervals mentally rotating letters manipulating two elements image contrast impairment gauged lack ability recalling spatial layouts judging spatial directions judging relative positions objects brooks matrix test compass direction task reproducing abstract patterns reproducing possible impossible figures due impairment identified patient intact imagery visual shortterm memory made apparent spatial relations test due integrative agnosia patients take information topdown manner using stored knowledge retrieve objects perceptual properties much difficult patients use bottomup method perceiving visual stimulus
