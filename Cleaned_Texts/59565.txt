handwriting movement analysis study analysis movements involved handwriting drawing forms important part graphonomics became established international workshop handwriting movement analysis nijmegen netherlands would become first continuing series international graphonomics conferences first graphonomics milestone thomassen keuss van galen grootveld handwriting historically considered widest taught motor skill also one first often motor skill children learn elementary school takes years practice maturing person mastered adult handwriting skill handwriting considered movement leaves visible trace ink paper product also considered movement process understanding handwriting product complete handwriting process understood therefore handwriting movement researched since measurement techniques became available however recording processing handwriting movements within reach interested studying handwriting movements three components required devices capture handwriting movements laboratory computers store process movement data computer software enables researcher specific experimental paradigms without need program untested custom software handwriting movement analysis
