although projectiles commonly used human conflict projectile use organisms humans relatively rare projectiles used terrestrial animals liquids among invertebrates number examples velvet worms squirt slimy adhesive fluid glands sides head use trap prey spitting spiders scytodes spit venomous sticky fluid traps victims also poisons bombardier beetle unusual using violent exothermic chemical reaction launch boiling noxious chemical spray rapid burst pulses special glands abdomen accompanied popping sound anthia oogpister beetle fire formic acid attackers probably extracting formic acid ants eats devilrider stick insects anisomorpha fire terpenes glands metathorax cause intense burning irritation eyes mouth potential predators wood ants spray acid attackers type planthopper madagascar able flick small balls honeydew attracts day geckos feed honeydew whose presence may deter predators approaching sapsucking termites north american subfamily nasutitermitinae project sticky fluid nozzle heads use fontanellar gun accurately range many centimeters even though termite blind possibly using auditory olfactory cues instead number vertebrates also use liquid projectiles archerfish squirt water mouth dislodge invertebrates overhanging branches diptodactyline geckos fire black pale yellow sticky fluid glands tail distance meter good aim fluid musky unpleasant odour although toxic may discourage predators particular big arthropods prey spitting cobra squirt venom forwardfacing holes aims victims eyes spitting venom may cause blindness mangshan pitviper also reported spit venom bird uses liquid projectiles defense southern giant petrel produces stomach oil made wax esters triglycerides stored proventriculus projectile vomited predators petrels fulmar also squirt oils mouths defense squirt oils accuracy distance meters oil mats feathers birds together destroys waterproofing abilities oiled birds may die chilling drowning although fulmars seem able remove oil preening birds ranging gulls seaeagles died squirted species penguin expel liquid feces projectile manner distance cm believed brooding season penguins sitting nests avoid leaving nests thereby leaving eggs open predation thus maintain clean nest evolved ability project among mammals skunks eject noxious fluid glands near anus foul smelling cause skin irritation gets eyes temporary blindness feels threatened camel bring stomach contents along saliva project towards threat distract surprise bother new world tarantulas dense covering hairs called urticating hairs abdomen sometimes use protection species urticating hairs kick hairs flicked air target using back pairs legs fine hairs barbed designed irritate lethal small animals rodents symptoms range burning itch minor rash lethal simply deterrent humans cause irritation eyes nose skin dangerously lungs airways inhaled cases tarantula hairs caused permanent damage human eyescitation needed urticating hairs grow back replaced moult another invertebrate antlion also makes use solid projectiles antlion lies bottom sloping pit digs sand small prey slip pit loose substrate prey crawls slopes pit antlion throws sand prey may dislodge send back gastropods cone snails modified radula tooth stored radular sac end proboscis acting like harpoon harpoon venomous assists cone snail paralyze kill prey eating number vertebrate species also make use solid projectiles among birds hornbill uses projectile motion eat food hornbills beak typically contacts tip short tongue swallow food hornbill instead throws food tip long bill backwards one example solid projectile use among mammals california ground squirrel known distract predators rattlesnake gopher snake locating nest burrows kicking sand wild female african elephant also observed throw various materials interfering orcas observed throw seal prey using tail flukes apparent play primates including humans throw objects rocks sticks feces projectiles primates known throw humans certain perhaps japanese although rhesus chimpanzee named santino swedish zoo observed stockpile stones used missiles chameleons frogs lungless salamanders tongues act like tethered projectile frogs tongue attached front mouth rotates attachment flips thus top tongue rest becomes bottom extended chameleons tongue contracts tapered hyoid bone eventually slipping projecting forward high speed lungless salamanders use similar method however tongue underlying hyoid bone project contrast chameleons whose hyoid remains fixed fleshy portion tongue salamanders chameleons movement fast requires much mechanical power muscle alone provide instead muscles slowly preload elastic elements connective tissue recoil release stored energy much higher order retract tongues great distances tongue muscles chameleons perforated zdisks allowing sarcomere shorten far greater distances pistol shrimp claw pistollike feature made two parts joint allows hammer part move backward rightangled position released snaps part claw emitting enormously powerful wave bubbles capable stunning larger fish breaking seed pods orange jewelweed projectile seeds ripe explode pods lightly touched seed pods scotch broom also burst open often audible crack projecting seeds parent plant similarly fruit sandbox tree burst open disperse seeds reaction violent injure nearby people plants dogwood bunchberry white mulberry also fling pollen flowers peat mosses known explosively launch hatthrowing fungi fire spore capsules cannonball fungi genus sphaerobolus stellatus artillery
