estrogen receptors ers group proteins found inside cells receptors activated hormone estrogen two classes er exist nuclear estrogen receptors erα erβ members nuclear receptor family intracellular receptors membrane estrogen receptors mers gper erx gqmer mostly g proteincoupled receptors article refers former er activated estrogen er able translocate nucleus bind dna regulate activity different genes ie dnabinding transcription factor however also additional functions independent dna hormone receptors sex steroids steroid hormone receptors ers androgen receptors ars progesterone receptors prs important sexual maturation gestation two different forms estrogen receptor usually referred α β encoded separate gene respectively hormoneactivated estrogen receptors form dimers since two forms coexpressed many cell types receptors may form erα αα erβ ββ homodimers erαβ αβ estrogen receptor alpha beta show significant overall sequence homology composed five domains designated ab f listed n

fourteenth chromosome respectively ers widely expressed different tissue types however notable differences expression ers regarded cytoplasmic receptors unliganded state visualization research shown small fraction ers reside cytoplasm er constitutively erα primary transcript gives rise several alternatively spliced variants unknown ers helix domain plays crucial role determining interactions coactivators corepressors therefore respective agonist antagonist effect different ligands may differ affinity alpha beta isoforms estrogen receptor subtype selective estrogen receptor modulators preferentially bind either α βsubtype receptor addition different estrogen receptor combinations may respond differently various ligands may translate tissue selective agonistic antagonistic ratio α β subtype concentration proposed play role certain concept selective estrogen receptor modulators based ability promote er interactions different proteins transcriptional coactivator corepressors furthermore ratio coactivator corepressor protein varies different consequence ligand may agonist tissue coactivators predominate antagonistic tissues corepressors dominate tamoxifen example
