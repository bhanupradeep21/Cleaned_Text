ischemia ischaemia restriction blood supply tissue muscle group organ body causing shortage oxygen needed cellular metabolism keep tissue ischemia generally caused problems blood vessels resultant damage dysfunction tissue ie hypoxia microvascular also implies local hypoxia part body resulting constriction vasoconstriction thrombosis embolism ischemia causes insufficiency oxygen also reduced availability nutrients inadequate removal metabolic wastes ischemia partial poor perfusion total blockage inadequate delivery oxygenated blood organs must resolved either treating cause inadequate delivery reducing oxygen demand system needs example patients myocardial ischemia decreased blood flow heart prescribed medications reduce chronotrophy ionotrophy meet new level blood delivery supplied stenosed vasculature adequate signs symptoms ischemia vary occur anywhere body depend degree blood flow example clinical manifestations acute limb ischemia summarized six ps include pain pallor pulseless paresthesia paralysis without immediate intervention ischemia may progress quickly tissue necrosis gangrene within hours paralysis late sign acute arterial ischemia signals death nerves supplying extremity foot drop may occur result nerve damage nerves extremely sensitive hypoxia limb paralysis ischemic neuropathy may persist revascularization may cardiac ischemia may asymptomatic may cause chest pain known angina pectoris occurs heart muscle myocardium receives insufficient blood frequently results atherosclerosis longterm accumulation cholesterolrich plaques coronary arteries western countries ischemic heart disease common cause death men women major cause hospital large small intestines affected ischemia blockage blood flow large intestine colon called ischemic ischemia small bowel called mesenteric brain ischemia insufficient blood flow brain acute chronic acute ischemic stroke neurological emergency typically caused blood clot blocking blood flow vessel chronic ischemia brain may result form dementia called vascular sudden brief episode symptoms lasting minutes ischemia affecting brain called transient ischemic attack tia often called tias warning future strokes approximately tia patients serious stroke within one inadequate blood supply limb may result acute limb ischemia chronic limb threatening ischemia reduced blood flow skin layers may result mottling uneven patchy discoloration skin kidney ischemia loss blood flow kidney cells several physical symptoms include shrinkage one renovascular acute renal progressive acute pulmonary disease high mortality rate high failure treat could cause chronic kidney need renal ischemia vascular disease involving interruption arterial blood supply tissue organ extremity untreated lead tissue death caused embolism thrombosis atherosclerotic artery trauma venous problems like venous outflow obstruction lowflow states cause acute arterial ischemia aneurysm one frequent causes acute arterial ischemia causes heart conditions including myocardial infarction mitral valve disease chronic atrial fibrillation cardiomyopathies prosthesis thrombi prone thrombi may dislodge may travel anywhere circulatory system may lead pulmonary embolus acute arterial occlusion causing oxygen blood supply distal embolus decrease suddenly degree extent symptoms depend size location obstruction occurrence clot fragmentation embolism smaller vessels degree peripheral arterial disease traumatic injury extremity may produce partial total occlusion vessel compression shearing laceration acute arterial occlusion may develop result arterial dissection carotid artery aorta result iatrogenic arterial injury eg inadequate flow blood part body may caused following ischemia results tissue damage process known ischemic cascade damage result buildup metabolic waste products inability maintain cell membranes mitochondrial damage eventual leakage autolyzing proteolytic enzymes cell surrounding restoration blood supply ischemic tissues cause additional damage known reperfusion injury damaging initial ischemia reintroduction blood flow brings oxygen back tissues causing greater production free radicals reactive oxygen species damage cells also brings calcium ions tissues causing calcium overloading result potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias also accelerates cellular selfdestruction restored blood flow also exaggerates inflammation response damaged tissues causing white blood cells destroy damaged cells may otherwise still early treatment essential keep affected organ viable treatment options include injection anticoagulant thrombolysis embolectomy surgical revascularization partial amputation anticoagulant therapy initiated prevent enlargement thrombus continuous iv unfractionated heparin traditional agent condition ischemic limb stabilized anticoagulation recently formed emboli may treated catheterdirected thrombolysis using intraarterial infusion thrombolytic agent eg recombinant tissue plasminogen activator tpa streptokinase urokinase percutaneous catheter inserted femoral artery threaded site clot used infuse drug unlike anticoagulants thrombolytic agents work directly resolve clot period direct arteriotomy may necessary remove clot surgical revascularization may used setting trauma eg laceration artery amputation reserved cases limb salvage possible patient continues risk embolization persistent source chronic atrial fibrillation treatment includes longterm oral anticoagulation prevent acute arterial ischemic decrease body temperature reduces aerobic metabolic rate affected cells reducing immediate effects hypoxia reduction body temperature also reduces inflammation response reperfusion injury frostbite injuries limiting thawing warming tissues warmer temperatures sustained may reduce reperfusion injury ischemic stroke times treated various levels statin therapy hospital discharge followed home time attempt lower risk adverse
