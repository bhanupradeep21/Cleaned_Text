atelectasis partial collapse closure lung resulting reduced absent gas exchange usually unilateral affecting part one condition alveoli deflated little volume distinct pulmonary consolidation filled liquid often referred informally collapsed lung although accurately usually involves partial collapse ambiguous term also informally used fully collapsed lung caused common finding chest xrays radiological studies may caused normal exhalation various medical conditions although frequently described collapse lung tissue atelectasis synonymous pneumothorax specific condition cause atelectasis acute atelectasis may occur postoperative complication result surfactant deficiency premature babies leads infant respiratory distress syndrome term uses combining forms atel ectasis greek ἀτελής incomplete ἔκτασις extension may signs symptoms may common misconception pure speculation atelectasis causes fever study postop patients followed serial chest xrays temperature measurements showed incidence fever decreased incidence atelectasis recent review article summarizing available published evidence association atelectasis postop fever concluded clinical evidence supporting common cause postsurgical atelectasis characterized splinting ie restricted breathing abdominal surgery atelectasis develops people undergoing general anesthesia surgical another common cause pulmonary tuberculosis smokers elderly also increased risk outside context atelectasis implies blockage bronchiole bronchus within airway foreign body mucus plug wall tumor usually squamous cell carcinoma compressing outside tumor lymph node tubercle another cause poor surfactant spreading inspiration causing surface tension highest tends collapse smaller alveoli atelectasis may also occur suction along sputum air withdrawn lungs several types atelectasis according underlying mechanisms distribution alveolar collapse resorption compression microatelectasis contraction atelectasis relaxation atelectasis also called passive atelectasis pleural effusion pneumothorax disrupts contact parietal visceral risk factors associated increased likelihood development atelectasis include type surgery thoracic cardiopulmonary surgeries use muscle relaxation obesity high oxygen lower lung segments factors also associated development atelectasis include age presence chronic obstructive pulmonary disease asthma type anesthetic early uk aviation medicine condition acceleration atelectasis given name hunter lung due prevalence pilots transonic fighter jet hawker hunter used oxygen clinically significant atelectasis generally visible chest xray findings include lung opacification andor loss lung volume postsurgical atelectasis bibasal pattern chest ct bronchoscopy may necessary cause

alveolar collapse known absorption usually associated accumulation blood fluid air within pleural cavity mechanically collapses lung frequent occurrence pleural effusion caused congestive heart

patients cystic fibrosis pneumonia mucolytic agents acetylcysteine nac used nebulized treatment works reducing mucous viscosity elasticity breaking disulfide bonds mucoproteins within mucus complex thus facilitating mucus postsurgical atelectasis treated physiotherapy focusing deep breathing encouraging coughing incentive spirometer often used part breathing exercises walking also highly encouraged improve lung inflation people chest deformities neurologic conditions cause shallow breathing long periods may benefit mechanical devices assist breathing primary treatment acute massive atelectasis correction underlying cause blockage removed coughing suctioning airways often removed bronchoscopy antibiotics given infection chronic atelectasis often treated antibiotics infection
