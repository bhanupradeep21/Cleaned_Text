sodium nitroprusside snp sold brand name nitropress among others medication used lower blood may done blood pressure high resulting symptoms certain types heart failure surgery decrease used continuous injection onset nearly immediate effects last ten available generic common side effects include low blood pressure cyanide serious side effects include generally recommended pregnancy due concerns side high doses recommended ten works increasing nitric oxide levels blood increases cgmp levels cells causes dilation blood sodium nitroprusside discovered early found useful medicine world health organizations list essential sodium nitroprusside light sensitive needs shielded light prevent sodium nitroprusside intravenously infused cases acute hypertensive effects usually seen within nitric oxide reduces total peripheral resistance venous return thus decreasing preload afterload used severe congestive heart failure combination effects act increase cardiac output situations cardiac output normal effect reduce blood sometimes also used induce hypotension reduce bleeding surgical procedures also fda tga mhra medication extremely beneficial use medical patients effects medication directly stop second stops infused due metabolism drug rapid inactivation thiocyanate conversion drug stops compound also used treatment aortic valve oesophageal myocardial pulmonary respiratory distress syndrome ergot adverse effects incidence common unknown frequency serious sodium nitroprusside used compensatory hypertension eg due arteriovenous stent coarctation used patients inadequate cerebral circulation patients near death used patients vitamin deficiency anaemia severe renal disease patients conditions associated higher cyanidethiocyanate ratio eg congenital lebers optic atrophy tobacco amblyopia treated sodium nitroprusside great use patients acute congestive heart failure associated reduced peripheral resistance also use hepatically impaired individuals also recommended use cases preexisting use pregnant women advised although available evidence suggests may safe provided maternal ph cyanide levels closely evidence suggests sodium nitroprusside use critically ill children may safe even without monitoring cyanide known drug interactions pharmacodynamic nature possible antihypertensive drugs reduce threshold dangerous hypotensive effects due cyanogenic nature overdose may particularly dangerous treatment sodium nitroprusside overdose includes haemodialysis ineffective removing cyanide body used remove thiocyanate produced cyanide detoxified reaction sulfurdonor thiosulfate catalysed enzyme absence sufficient thiosulfate cyanide ions quickly reach toxic hydroxocobalamin administered reduce risk thiocyanate toxicity induced result breakdown nitric oxide sodium nitroprusside potent vasodilating effects arterioles venules arterial venous whereas nitrates exhibit selectivity veins eg sodium nitroprusside breaks circulation release nitric oxide binding oxyhaemoglobin release cyanide methaemoglobin nitric activates guanylate cyclase vascular smooth muscle increases intracellular production cgmp cgmp activates protein kinase g activates phosphatases inactivate myosin light myosin light chains involved smooth muscle contraction result vascular smooth muscle relaxation allow vessels mechanism similar phosphodiesterase inhibitors
