hawthorne effect type human behavior reactivity individuals modify aspect behavior response awareness effect discovered context research conducted hawthorne western electric plant however scholars think descriptions original research involved workers made electrical relays hawthorne works western electric plant cicero illinois lighting study conducted workers experienced series lighting changes productivity said increase almost change lighting turned another study associated elton mayo ran series changes work structure implemented eg changes rest periods group five women however methodologically poor uncontrolled study permit firm conclusions one later interpretations landsbergerwho suggested novelty research subjects increased attention could lead temporary increases workers interpretation dubbed hawthorne effect term hawthorne effect coined henry analyzing hawthorne studies conducted hawthorne works western electric factory cicero outside chicago hawthorne works commissioned study determine workers would become productive higher lower levels light workers productivity seemed improve changes made slumped study ended suggested productivity gain occurred result motivational effect workers interest shown effect observed minute increases illumination lighting studies light intensity altered examine effect worker productivity industrial occupational psychology organizational behavior textbooks refer illumination studies discussing hawthorne occasionally rest studies although illumination research workplace lighting formed basis hawthorne effect changes maintaining clean work stations clearing floors obstacles even relocating workstations resulted increased productivity short periods thus term used identify type shortlived increase one studies researchers chose two women test subjects asked choose four workers join test group together women worked separate room course five years assembling telephone relays output measured mechanically counting many finished relays worker dropped chute measuring began secret two weeks moving women experiment room continued throughout study experiment room supervisor discussed changes productivity variables changing variable usually increased productivity even variable change back original condition however said natural process human adapting environment without knowing objective experiment occurring researchers concluded workers worked harder thought monitored individually researchers hypothesized choosing ones coworkers working group treated special evidenced working separate room sympathetic supervisor real reasons productivity increase one interpretation mainly due elton six individuals became team team gave wholeheartedly spontaneously cooperation experiment second relay assembly test room study whose results significant first experiment purpose next study find payment incentives would affect productivity surprising result productivity actually decreased workers apparently become suspicious productivity may boosted justify firing workers later study conducted elton mayo w lloyd warner group fourteen men put together telephone switching equipment researchers found although workers paid according individual productivity productivity decreased men afraid company would lower base rate detailed observation men revealed existence informal groups cliques within formal groups cliques developed informal rules behavior well mechanisms enforce cliques served control group members manage bosses bosses asked questions clique members gave responses even untrue results show workers responsive social force peer groups control incentives management richard nisbett described hawthorne effect glorified anecdote saying got anecdote throw away researchers attempted explain effects various interpretations j g adair warned gross factual inaccuracy secondary publications hawthorne effect many studies failed find argued viewed variant ornes experimental demand effect adair hawthorne effect depended participants interpretation situation implication manipulation checks important social sciences experiments advanced view awareness observed source effect participants interpretation situation critical participants interpretation situation interact participants goals possible explanations hawthorne effect include impact feedback motivation towards experimenter receiving feedback performance may improve skills experiment provides feedback first research demand effect also suggests people may motivated please experimenter least conflict may also suspicious purpose therefore hawthorne effect may occur usable feedback change motivation parsons defined hawthorne effect confounding occurs experimenters fail realize consequences subjects performance affect subjects ie learning effects permanent skill improvement feedbackenabled adjustments suit current goals key argument studies workers dropped finished goods chutes participants access counters work mayo contended effect due workers reacting sympathy interest observers discuss study demonstrating experimenter effect management effect management make workers perform differently feel differently suggested much hawthorne effect concerned workers feeling free control group rather supervised experimental manipulations important convincing workers feel way conditions special fiveperson work group really different conditions shop floor study repeated similar effects micasplitting clark sugrue review educational research reported uncontrolled novelty effects cause

researchers involved investigating whether workers performance could predicted prehire testing hawthorne study showed performance workers little relation ability fact often bore inverse relation test scores braverman argued studies really showed workplace system bureaucratic formal organisation weberian model system informal group relations interpretation mayo followers rather system power class antagonisms discovery blow hoping apply behavioral sciences manipulate workers interest economists steven levitt john list long pursued without success search base data original illumination

evaluation hawthorne effect continues present despite criticisms however phenomenon often taken account designing studies also developed ways avoid instance case holding observation conducting field study distance behind barrier twoway mirror using unobtrusive greenwood bolton greenwood interviewed participants experiments found participants paid significantly various medical scientists studied possible trial effect clinical trial effect clinical postulate beyond attention observation may factors involved slightly better care slightly better complianceadherence selection bias latter may several mechanisms physicians may tend recruit patients seem better adherence potential lesser likelihood future loss followup inclusionexclusion criteria trials often exclude least comorbidities although often necessary prevent confounding also means trials may tend work healthier patient subpopulations despite observer effect popularized hawthorne experiments perhaps falsely identified see discussion popularity plausibility observer effect theory led researchers postulate effect could take place second level thus proposed secondary observer effect researchers working secondary data survey data various indicators may impact results scientific research rather effect subjects primary observer effect researchers likely idiosyncrasies influence handle data even data obtain secondary sources one researchers may choose seemingly innocuous steps statistical analyses end causing significantly different results using data eg weighting strategies factor analytic techniques choice estimation addition researchers may use software packages different default settings lead small significant fluctuations finally data researchers use may identical even though seems example oecd collects distributes various socioeconomic data however data change time researcher downloads australian gdp data year may slightly different values researcher downloads australian gdp data years later idea secondary observer effect floated nate breznau thus far relatively obscure although little attention paid phenomenon scientific implications evidence effect may seen recent studies assign
