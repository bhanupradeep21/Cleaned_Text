administered heparin thought reduce risk laminitis decreasing blood coagulability thus blood clot formation capillaries specific causes colic best managed certain drugs include surgery poses significant expense risks including peritonitis formation adhesions complications secondary general anesthesia injury upon recovery horse may require euthanasia dehiscence infection incisional site additionally surgical cases may develop postoperative ileus requires medical however surgery may required save life horse colics require surgical section intestine significantly damaged may need removed resection healthy parts reattached together anastomosis horses may intestines removed still function normally without needing special case colics requiring surgery survival rates best improved quick recognition colic immediate surgical referral rather waiting see horse improves increases extent intestinal survival rates higher surgical cases require resection anastomosis large intestinal colic surgeries due volvulus large colon volvuluses discharged non strangulating small intestinal lesions strangulating intestinal lesions small intestinal surgical cases require second surgery large intestinal cases horses survive colic surgery high rate return athletic function according one study approximately horses discharged returned work returned better adhesions scar tissue various organs normally attached within abdomen may occur whenever abdominal surgery performed often seen secondary reperfusion injury ischemic bowel intestinal injury causes neutrophils move serosa mesothelium lost body attempts repair using fibrin collagen leading adhesion formation adjacent tissues either fibrinous fibrous adhesions may encourage volvulus attachment provides pivot point force tight turn two adjacent loops attached leading partial obstruction reason clinical signs vary silent lesions acute encouraging future colics including intestinal obstruction requiring surgery risk generally adhesions form within first two months following adhesions occur commonly horses small intestinal disease surgical colics foals requiring enterotomy resection anastomosis develop septic prevention adhesions begins good surgical technique minimize trauma tissue thus reparative responses body several drugs substances used try prevent adhesion formation preoperative use dmso free radical scavenger potassium penicillin flunixin meglumine may given thick intestinal lubricant often applied gi tract intraoperatively decrease trauma handling surgeon provide physical barrier intestine adjacent intestinal loops abdominal organs shown double survival rate horses use standard hyaluraonan also used produce physical intraperitoneal unfractionated heparin sometimes used since decreases fibrin formation thus may decrease fibrinous omentectomy removal omentum quick simple procedure also greatly decreases risk adhesions since omentum one organ commonly adheres abdomen usually lavaged copiously abdomen sutured closed antiinflammatories given laparoscope may used postsurgery look break adhesions however risk additional adhesions forming encouraging motility postsurgery also useful decreases contact time adhesioninduced colic poor prognosis survival rate one small amounts food usually introduced soon possible surgery usually within encourage motility reduce risk ileus formation often horses stall rested short bouts hand walking encourage intestinal incision site carefully monitored dehiscence complete failure incision leading spillage abdominal contents incision horse allowed turnout incision healed usually days stall rest abdominal bandages sometimes used help prevent risk incisional infection doubles time required postoperative care dehiscence may lead intestinal herniation reduces likelihood return athletic therefore antibiotics given days surgery temperature constantly monitored help assess infection present antibiotics used longterm due risk antimicrobial incision usually takes months reach strength intestinal healing following resection anastomosis much faster rate strength incision healed adequately horse turned small area another months light exercise added improve tone strength abdominal musculature weight loss pounds common colic surgery secondary decreased function gastrointestinal tract muscle atrophy occurs horse weight often rapidly replaced draft horses tend difficulty postsurgery often anesthesia longer period time since greater amount gastrointestinal tract evaluate increased size places pressure musculature lead muscle damage miniature horses fat ponies increased risk hepatic lipidosis serious complication incidence colic reduced restricted access simple including sugars feeds excessive molasses providing clean feed drinking water preventing ingestion dirt sand using elevated feeding surface regular feeding schedule regular deworming regular dental care regular diet change substantially content proportion prevention heatstroke horses bolt feed risk colic several management techniques may used slow rate feed consumption supplementing previously mentioned form pysllium fiber may reduce risk sand colic highrisk area supplement forms given one week per month available wherever equine feed purchased turnout thought reduce likelihood colic although recommended horse receive ideally hours grazing time
