human βglobin gene locus university amsterdam subsequently phd institution piet borst surface antigen genes trypanosomes joined harold varmuss lab university california san francisco since faculty position rockefeller university de lange received vilcek prize biomedical breakthrough prize life sciences worth million research became correspondent royal netherlands academy arts titia de lange attended university amsterdam received bachelors masters degree also earned phd university amsterdam working netherlands cancer accepted postdoctoral fellowship position university california san francisco de lange started lab rockefeller currently leon hess professor well director anderson center cancer research rockefeller breakthrough prize life sciences research telomeres illuminating protect chromosome ends role genome instability cancer mapping complex molecules loops strands together protects addition making headway revealing structure dna research implications understanding

amsterdam worked mentor richard flavell national institute medical research completed masters thesis focused dna translocation γβthalassemia rare form research identified patient γβthalassemia dna translocation caused inactivation βglobin de lange spoke highly lab saying first saw science really done vibrant competitive international lab lot fun made stay de lange started gain interest telomeres earning phd netherlands cancer telomeres gradually became major focus research receiving phd de lange completed postdoctoral fellowship university california san francisco harold varmuss lab working ucsf de lange continued work telomeres de lange discovered sperm cells telomeres several kilobase pairs longer somatic also found tumor cells also significantly shorter research significant

gradually shortened round dna replication dna sequence fully chromosome ends threatened various pathways dnadamage signaling pathways involving atm atr kinase well doublestrand break repair pathways nonhomologous end joining homologydirected rockefeller university research focused identifying proteins associated telomeres role protecting telomeres processes dna first several years dedicated long

protecting chromosome six shelterin subunits shelterin subunits proteins associate telomeres differ proteins meeting criteria accumulating areas beside chromosome ends function limited telomeres present telomeres throughout cell shelterin allows telomeres essentially hidden dna damage surveillance without safeguarding chromosome ends inappropriately processed dna repair pathways telomeres would mistaken damaged titia de langes research proven invaluable area telomere research led greater understanding cancer development well genome research catalyzed research important role telomeres
