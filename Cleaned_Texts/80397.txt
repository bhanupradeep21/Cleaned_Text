monoclonal antibody mab rarely called moab antibody produced cell lineage made cloning unique white blood cell subsequent antibodies derived way trace back unique parent cell monoclonal antibodies monovalent affinity binding epitope part antigen recognized antibody contrast polyclonal antibodies bind multiple epitopes usually made several different antibodysecreting plasma cell lineages bispecific monoclonal antibodies also engineered increasing therapeutic targets one monoclonal antibody two epitopes possible produce monoclonal antibodies specifically bind almost suitable substance
