antigenantibody interaction antigenantibody reaction specific chemical interaction antibodies produced b cells white blood cells antigens immune reaction antigens antibodies combine process called agglutination fundamental reaction body body protected complex foreign molecules pathogens chemical toxins blood antigens specifically high affinity bound antibodies form antigenantibody complex immune complex transported cellular systems destroyed deactivated first correct description antigenantibody reaction given richard j goldberg university wisconsin came known goldbergs theory antigenantibody several types antibodies antigens antibody capable binding specific antigen specificity binding due specific chemical constitution antibody antigenic determinant epitope recognized paratope antibody situated variable region polypeptide chain variable region turn hypervariable regions unique amino acid sequences antibody antigens bound antibodies weak noncovalent interactions electrostatic interactions hydrogen bonds van der waals forces hydrophobic principles specificity crossreactivity antigenantibody interaction useful clinical laboratory diagnostic purposes one basic application determination abo blood group also used molecular technique infection different pathogens hiv microbes helminth parasites immunity developed individual exposed antigens called adaptive acquired immunity contrast immunity developed birth innate immunity acquired immunity depends upon interaction antigens group proteins called antibodies produced b cells blood many antibodies specific particular type antigen thus immune response acquired immunity due precise binding antigens antibody small area antigens antibody molecules actually interact complementary binding sites called epitopes antigens paratopes antibody fab fragment antigenbinding region formed aminoterminal end light heavy chains immunoglobulin polypeptide region called variable v domain composed amino acid sequences define type antibody binding affinity antigen combined sequence variable light chain vl variable heavy chain vh creates three hypervariable regions vl roughly residues respectively variable part thus regions may part paratope part antibody recognizes binds antigen rest v region hypervariable regions called framework regions v domain four framework domains namely antibodies bind antigens weak chemical interactions bonding essentially noncovalent electrostatic interactions hydrogen bonds van der waals forces hydrophobic interactions known involved depending interaction noncovalent bonds antibody antigen also mediated interfacial water molecules indirect bonds contribute phenomenon crossreactivity ie recognition different related antigens single antigen antibody interact high affinity binding much like lock dynamic equilibrium exists binding example reaction reversible one expressed ab antibody concentration ag antigen concentration either free abag bound abag state equilibrium association constant ka therefore represented kon koff association dissociation rate constants respectively reciprocally equilibibrium dissociation constant kd antibodyantigen binding kinetic described rate equation secondorder reversible reaction however equations applicable single epitope binding ie one antigen one antibody since antibody necessarily two paratopes many circumstances complex binding occurs multiple binding equilibrium summed equilibrium c concentration free ligand r represents ratio concentration bound ligand total antibody concentration n maximum number binding sites per antibody molecule antibody overall strength binding antibody antigen termed avidity antigen since antibodies bivalent polyvalent sum strengths individual antibodyantigen interactions strength individual interaction single binding site antibody target epitope termed affinity avidity affinity judged dissociation constant interactions describe lower dissociation constant higher avidity affinity stronger normally antibodies detect differentiate molecules outside body produced inside body result cellular activities self molecules ignored immune system however certain conditions antibodies recognise self molecules antigens triggers unexpected immune responses results different autoimmune diseases depending type antigens antibodies involved conditions always harmful sometimes deadly exact nature antibodyantigen interaction autoimmune disease yet antigenantibody interaction used laboratory techniques serological test blood compatibility various pathogenic infections basic abo blood group determination useful blood sophisticated applications include enzymelinked immunospot elispot immunofluorescence soluble antigens combine soluble antibodies presence electrolyte suitable temperature ph form insoluble visible complex called precipitation reaction used qualitative quantitative determination antigen antibody involves reaction soluble antigen soluble antibodies form large interlocking aggravated called occurs two distinct stages firstly antigen antibody rapidly form antigenantibody complexes within seconds followed slower reaction antibodyantigen complexes forms lattices precipitate special ring test useful diagnosis anthrax determination adulteration acts antigenantibody reaction antibodies crosslink particulate antigens resulting visible clumping particle two types namely active passive used blood tests diagnosis enteric httpsenwikipediaorgwikiantigenantibodyinteraction
