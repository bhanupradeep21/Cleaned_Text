complications prolonged standing conditions may arise standing walking running prolonged periods many complications come prolonged standing work day repeated several times week many jobs require prolonged standing retail staff baristas bartenders assembly line workers security staff engineers catering staff library assistants hair stylists laboratory basic physiological change occurs body prolonged standing sudden stand supine position increased pooling blood legs decreases venous return decreased cardiac output ultimately causes systolic blood pressure fall hypotension hypotension may lead subject faint symptoms hypotension standing requires energy source needed exact measures prevalent complications however european studies report one third one half workers spend least four hours per working time average workday eight hours standing one estimate united kingdom stated million people stand long periods time without proper posture often referred neutral spine slouching improper posture nonneutral spine slouching often described improper posture movement rigidity spine especially cervical thoracic regions relation parts body varicose veins veins become enlarged twisted especially within legs ankles feet affected standing gravity pulls blood downwards lower part body body mechanisms vasoconstriction valves veins assist pumping blood blood pumped body valves within veins prevent blood flowing backwards extensive prolonged standing valves become weak eventually fail happens blood longer prevented flowing backward gravity pull blood back individuals legs ankles feet forces veins expand balloon accommodate extra blood valves veins work best concert accompanying muscle contractions force blood continue moving leg standing muscles constantly strained weakens muscles therefore strength contractions varicose veins also associated chronic heart circulatory disorders hypertension well complications related pregnancy prolonged standing increases risk hospitalization varicose among working age population one five hospitalizations varicose veins result prolonged standing prolonged standing leads impeded blood flow stasis veins lower limbs cause varicose veins standing prolonged periods lead certain cardiovascular disorders study krause et al authors examined relationship standing work progression carotid atherosclerosis men standing long periods change distribution blood extremities turn causes blood pool reduces circulating blood plasma volume leading hemodynamic changes impact body authors reported long periods standing work significantly associated atherosclerotic progression study provides evidence hemodynamic changes standing influence progressions carotid atherosclerosis authors also found men carotid stenosis ischemic heart disease greater risk progression atherosclerosis atherosclerosis lead coronary artery disease carotid artery disease peripheral artery disease standing places significant pressure joint hips knees ankle feet without significant movement reduces normal lubrication cushioning synovial joints causing tear combined effect pressure tearing cause extensive amounts pain make difficult move muscles kept constant stress position quickly become exhausted result pain swelling lower back legs ankles occupational safety health administration osha stated muscle fatigue musculoskeletal disorders account worker injury considerable research conducted extent muscle injuries concluded expected reduced breaks availability chairscitation needed research shown body experiences muscle fatigue standing five hours fatigue persists minutes end work day according electronic measurements perception fatigue subjective necessarily correlate experimental indicators fatigue walking standing six hours per day linked preterm births low birth weights well high blood pressure researchers found working hours week associated slower rates fetal growth also found average negative effects working weeks systematic review karakolis found sitstand workstations reduce worker productivity three reviewed studies found increased productivity workers used sit stand stations four reported impact productivity workers one reported mixed results real prevention standing ways mitigate time spent standing workplace experts suggest move around change positions throughout day best sit one position minutes stand one position prolonged sitting workplace required desired individuals gradually transition significant periods transitioning sitting standing individuals might experience musculoskeletal discomfort fatigue body adapts companies design workstations conducive good health workstations allow workers choose several working positions move easily additionally workers able adjust height workstations fit body size helpful aspects workstations footrests elbow rests seats workers sit need choice footwear change impact prolonged standing shoes support foot shockabsorbing cushions fit foot well shoes flat heels higher cm change shape foot also special insoles shoes used soft mats chairs available additionally floors work area metal concrete best cork rubber covered floors floors slippery training education important components avoiding complications standing employees trained ergonomics experience less muscle discomfort productivity using sitstand work stations workers floor mat antifatigue mats used prevent complication associated prolonged standing study university loughborough conducted george havenith lucy e dorman shown discomfort sensations show statistically significant improvements related mat use proper floor mats also used reduce stress feet knees antifatigue matting recommended launderable matting preferredcitation needed study investigating effects different standing conditions assembly workers showed using mats shoes insoles perceived comfortable workers without standing hard best shoes walking standing day
