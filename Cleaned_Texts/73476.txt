anatomy atlas superior first cervical vertebra spine located neck bone named atlas greek mythology atlas bore weight heavens first cervical vertebra supports however term atlas first used ancient romans seventh cervical vertebra due suitability supporting greek mythology atlas condemned bear weight heavens punishment rebelling zeus ancient depictions atlas show globe heavens resting base neck sometime around anatomists decided call first cervical vertebra scholars believe switching designation atlas seventh first cervical vertebra renaissance anatomists commenting point man burden shifted shoulders headthat man true burden physical load rather atlas topmost vertebra axis vertebra forms joint connecting skull spine atlas axis specialized allow greater range motion normal vertebrae
