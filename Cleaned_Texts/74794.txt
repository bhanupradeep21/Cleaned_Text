artificial organ human made organ device tissue implanted integrated human interfacing living tissue replace natural organ duplicate augment specific function functions patient may return normal life soon replaced function related life support often example replacement bones joints found hip replacements could also considered artificial implied definition device must continuously tethered stationary power supply stationary resources filters chemical processing units periodic rapid recharging batteries refilling chemicals andor cleaningreplacing filters would exclude device called artificial thus dialysis machine successful critically important life support device almost completely replaces duties kidney artificial organ constructing installing artificial organs extremely researchintensive expensive process initially may entail many years ongoing maintenance services needed natural use artificial organ humans almost always preceded extensive experiments initial testing humans frequently limited either already facing death exhausted every treatment possibility artificial arms legs prosthetics intended restore degree normal function amputees mechanical devices allow

improve mental health implantable machine performs function thymus exist however researchers able grow thymus reprogrammed fibroblasts expressed hope approach could one day replace supplement neonatal thymus researchers ucla developed artificial thymus although yet implantable capable performing functions true artificial thymus would play important role immune system would use blood stem cells produce cells would help body fight infections would also grant body ability eliminate cancer cells since people become old thymus dont work well artificial thymus would good choice replace old notfunctioningwell thymus idea using cells fight infections around time recently idea using cell source artificial thymus proposed know key creating consistent safe supply cancerfighting cells would control process way deactivates cell receptors transplanted cells except cancerfighting receptors said dr gay crooks scientist also found cells produced artificial thymus carried diverse range cell
