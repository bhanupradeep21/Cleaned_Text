isoniazid also known isonicotinic acid hydrazide inh antibiotic used treatment active tuberculosis often used together rifampicin pyrazinamide either streptomycin latent tuberculosis often used may also used atypical types mycobacteria avium kansasii usually taken mouth may used injection common side effects include increased blood levels liver enzymes numbness hands serious side effects may include liver inflammation acute liver unclear use pregnancy safe use breastfeeding likely pyridoxine may given reduce risk side isoniazid works part disrupting formation bacterias cell wall results cell isoniazid first made world health organizations list essential world health organization classifies isoniazid critically important human isoniazid available generic isoniazid often used treat latent active tuberculosis infections persons isoniazidsensitive mycobacterium tuberculosis infection drug regimens based isoniazid usually effective persons adhere prescribed treatment however persons isoniazidresistant mycobacterium tuberculosis infection drug regimens based isoniazid high rate isoniazid approved prophylactic therapy following populations isoniazid used alone combination rifampin treatment latent tuberculosis part fourdrug regimen treatment active drug regimen typically requires daily weekly oral administration period three nine months often directly observed therapy dot isoniazid widely used treatment mycobacterium avium complex part regimen including rifampicin evidence suggests isoniazid prevents mycolic acid synthesis avium complex although bactericidal avium complex greatly potentiates effect rifampicin introduction macrolides led use greatly decreasing however since rifampicin broadly underdosed avium complex treatment effect may worth recommended women active tuberculosis pregnant breastfeeding take isoniazid preventive therapy delayed giving nursing mothers excrete relatively low nontoxic concentration inh breast milk babies low risk side effects pregnant women infants breastfed mothers taking inh take vitamin pyridoxine form minimize risk peripheral nerve vitamin used prevent isoniazidinduced deficiency neuropathy people risk factor pregnancy lactation hiv infection alcoholism diabetes kidney failure people liver dysfunction higher risk hepatitis caused inh may need lower levels liver enzymes bloodstream frequently checked daily alcohol drinkers pregnant women iv drug users people chronic liver disease severe kidney dysfunction peripheral neuropathy hiv infection since likely develop hepatitis people taking isoniazid experience

magnetic resonance people taking isoniazid acetaminophen risk acetaminophen toxicity isoniazid thought induce liver enzyme causes larger amount acetaminophen metabolized toxic isoniazid decreases metabolism carbamazepine thus slowing clearance body people taking carbamazepine carbamazepine levels monitored necessary dose adjusted possible isoniazid may decrease serum levels ketoconazole longterm treatment seen simultaneous use rifampin isoniazid isoniazid may increase amount phenytoin body doses phenytoin may need adjusted given isoniazid may increase plasma levels theophylline cases
