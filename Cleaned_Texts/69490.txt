classification peripheral nerves peripheral nervous system pns groups nerves two main groups somatic autonomic nervous together two systems provide information regarding location status limbs organs remainder body central nervous system cns via nerves ganglia present outside spinal cord somatic nervous system directs voluntary movements skeletal muscles subdivided afferent efferent neuronal flow autonomic nervous system divided primarily sympathetic parasympathetic nervous systems third system enteric nervous system receiving less british scientist john newport langley first coined term autonomic classifying connections nerve fibers peripheral nerve previous researchers utilized different terms sympathetic nerves winslow et al describe way neurons one part body brought sympathetic reactions another part body well ganglionic nerves ganglionic nervous system livingstone et al ganglionic conversion voluntary involuntary movements supposedly made peripheral nerves ganglionic nerves among langley stated choice autonomic intended imply special degree independence cells hand rather demarcate clear departure previous nomenclature hypothesis incorporating much previous research largely distinct langley rejected sympathetic nerves possessed particular relationship sympathies aptly pointed presence ganglial nerves spinal cord cranium made ganglionic connections peripheral nerves pointless misleading term instead noted sympathetic neurons innervated entire body tended opposing functions autonomic neurons tectal bulbosacral regions latter two tectal bulbosacral grouped together form parasympathetic system tended respond like manner various langley also mentions enteric nervous system writing third grouping largely fallen discussion modern practice much original nerve classification done langley gaskell extension based pharmacological responses nerves throughout body well gross anatomical similarities example adrenaline demonstrated elicit bodily effects direct electrical stimulation sympathetic neurons classes drugs likewise elicited responses contained parasympathetic sympathetic nervous systems responsiveness particular lead systems association fight flight response humans although oversimplification roles played two distinct classifications supported differences location ganglionic since time langleys unified proposal divisions remained relatively parasympathetic nervous system known regulate unconscious activities body maintain homeostasis sympathetic nervous system controls responses external stimuli involuntary functions langley also described enteric nervous system although received minimal attention modern textbooks tend mention sympathetic parasympathetic pathways context autonomic nervous system nerve classifications autonomic nervous system created traditional methodologies remained mostly unchanged last however modern perspectives placed emphasis developmental molecular mechanisms systems attention paid elements gene expression development features overall functions neurons classification sacral outflow parasympathetic particular come scrutiny isabel espinosamedina working lab french researcher jeanfrançois brunet ibens identified several transcription factors within preganglionic neurons lower lumbar sacral regions essential transcription factors identified within portions spinal cord coexpressed developing genomic similarity lumbrasacral region rest spinal cord lead conclusion sacral region spinal cord may actually part sympathetic nervous effect revision produces simple bisection autonomic nervous system wherein cranium solely parasympathetic spinal cord solely researchers field challenged assertion publication lab german researcher wilfrid jänig claims reclassification would among arguments made jänig et al disagreement developmental research approach taken espinosamedina jänig et al argue many measured gene markers espinosamedina expressed transiently lumbrasacral region assist migration differentiation nerves necessarily share expression similarities neighboring sympathetic spinal nerves alone make nerves anything spinal furthermore jänig et al state reclassification would contradict information opposing actions pelvic ganglias parasympathetic sympathetic disregarding current debate changing sacral outflow parasympathetic sympathetic divisions two systems fairly straightforward sympathetic system encompasses peripheral nerves synapse along thoracolumbar region spine roughly vertebrae whereas parasympathetic system covers peripheral nerve synapses vertebrae regions addition number cranial noticed description slight overlap divisions lowest region thoracic spine well throughout lumbar spine overlap result directly opposing functions sympathetic
