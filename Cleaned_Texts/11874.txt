seymouria extinct genus seymouriamorph early permian north america although amphibians biological sense seymouria welladapted life land many reptilian many fact seymouria first thought primitive primarily known two species seymouria seymouria type species baylorensis robust specialized though fossils found hand seymouria sanjuanensis abundant widespread smaller species known multiple wellpreserved fossils including block six skeletons found cutler formation new pair fully grown skeletons tambach formation germany fossilized lying next first half century seymouria considered one oldest primitive known paleontologists noted general body shape resembled early reptiles captorhinids certain adaptations limbs hip skull also similar early reptiles rather species modern extinct amphibians known time stronglybuilt limbs backbone also supported idea seymouria primarily terrestrial spending little time however fossilized tadpoles discovered discosauriscus close relative seymouria group seymouriamorpha shows seymouriamorphs including seymouria larval stage lived water therefore making seymouria true reptile rather amphibian closely related though longer considered primitive reptile seymouria still important transitional fossil documenting acquisition reptilelike skeletal features prior evolution amniotic egg characterizes amniotes reptiles mammals fossils

nearly complete skeleton noted desmospondylus anomalus taxon recently named fragmentary limbs vertebrae likely represented juvenile even embryonic individuals likewise english paleontologist dms watson noted conodectes dubious genera named edward drinker cope back likely synonymous robert broom argued genus referred conodectes since name published alfred romer objected noting name seymouria popular within scientific community time seymouria generally seen early reptile part evolutionary grade known cotylosaurs also included many stoutbodied permian reptiles reptilelike tetrapods many

since true reptiles amniotes lost otic notch forcing tympanum stapes shift downwards towards quadrate bone jaw joint hand thin sensitive structure seymourias stapes specialization nonamniote tetrapods thick stapes better suited reinforcing skull rather inner ear seymouria baylorensis retains cochlear recess located behind rather vestibule anterior semicircular canal likely encompassed cartilaginous

seymouria baylorensis seymouria sanjuanensis distinguished based several differences shape connections different bones skull example downturned flange bone otic notch sometimes termed tabular horn otic process much welldeveloped baylorensis sanjuanensis former species acquires triangular shape seen side extends downwards extensively towards rear sanjuanensis postfrontal bone contacts parietal bone means obtuse wedgelike suture connection two bones completely straight baylorensis authors argued postparietals baylorensis smaller sanjuanensis specimens sanjuanensis example tambach lovers also small postparietals addition tambach lovers quadratojugal bone similar baylorensis rather sanjuanensis combination features species specimens may indicate two species part continuous lineage rather two divergent evolutionary paths likewise differences relating proportions rear skull may considered artifact fact sanjuanensis specimens fully grown prior discovery tambach lovers adult members nevertheless several traits still clearly differentiated two species lacrimal bone front eyes occupies front edge orbit baylorensis conversely specimens sanjuanensis branch lacrimal extends small distance orbit sanjuanensis much rear edge orbit formed chevronshaped postorbital bone rectangular baylorensis shape lacrimal postorbital sanjuanensis closely corresponds condition seymouriamorphs condition baylorensis unique toothbearing maxilla bone forms side snout also distinctively unique baylorensis sanjuanensis maxilla low many sharp closely spaced teeth extending along length condition similar seymouriamorphs however baylorensis taller snout teeth generally much larger less numerous less homogenous palate generally similar two species although ectopterygoids triangular baylorensis rectangular romer among first authors discuss biological implications seymourias skeleton argued robust limbs wideset body supported idea strong terrestrial animal sprawling gait however also noted permian trackways generally support idea terrestrial tetrapods time period bellydraggers instead strong enough keep bodies ground paleontologists around time romer assumed seymouria reptilian amniote mode reproduction eggs laid dry land protected elements amnion white elaborated biological implications noted presence otic notch reduces jaw strength lowering amount surface area jaw muscles attach within cranium addition skull would fragile due presence large incision whole found unlikely seymouria capable tackling large active prey nevertheless sites muscle attachment palate welldeveloped contemporaneous amphibians white extrapolated seymouria mostly carnivorous generalist omnivore feeding invertebrates small fish perhaps even plant material may even cannibalistic according white also drew attention unusual swollen vertebrae would facilitated lateral sidetoside movement prohibit torsion twisting backbone would beneficial since seymouria lowslung limbs wide topheavy body would otherwise vulnerable torsion walking may also explain presence trait captorhinids diadectomorphs cotylosaurs perhaps swollen vertebrae interim strategy prevent torsion would later supplanted strong hip muscles later reptiles rather undeveloped hip muscles seymouria line hypothesis nevertheless vertebrae inefficient defending torsion speed faster brisk walk seymouria probably quickmoving although white considered seymoria quite competent land also discussed lifestyles supposed seymouria also good swimmer since erroneously estimated animal deep powerful tail similar modern crocodilians however also noted would vulnerable semiaquatic aquatic predators seymouria fossils common terrestrial deposits result habitat preferences berman et al supported hypothesis tambach formation preserved seymouria fossils also completely lacking aquatic animals also pointed welldeveloped wrist ankle bones tambach lovers supportive terrestrial affinities despite strong musculature forelimbs romer white found little evidence burrowing adaptations seymouria authors argued favor sexual dimorphism existing seymouria others unconvinced hypothesis white argued specimens seymouria baylorensis chevrons bony

sexual differentiation reported turtles crocodilians based also supported idea seymouria females gave birth largeyolked eggs land turtles vaughn later found correlation chevron acquisition certain skull proportions seymouria sanjuanensis proposed examples sexual however berman reisz elberth criticized methodologies white vaughn argued whites observations probably unrelated sex animals supported fact cutler formation specimens chevrons first appeared fifth tail vertebra although possible genital size variable among males extent impacting skeleton likely explanation differences white observed caused individual skeletal variation evolutionary divergence factor unrelated sexual dimorphism likewise agreed skull proportions supported vaughn proposal dimorphism present seymouria fossils though disagreed linked sex using fossil considered female whites discovery fossilized larval seymouriamorphs shown seymouria likely aquatic larval stage debunking earlier hypotheses seymouria laid eggs
