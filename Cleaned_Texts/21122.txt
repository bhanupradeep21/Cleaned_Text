first subjected chemical analysis french chemist anselme payen obtained agar marine algae gelidium beginning late century agar began used solid medium growing various microbes agar first described use microbiology german microbiologist walther hesse assistant working robert kochs laboratory suggestion wife fanny agar quickly supplanted gelatin base microbiological media due higher melting temperature allowing microbes grown higher temperatures without media newfound use microbiology agar production quickly increased production centered japan produced worlds agar world war however outbreak world war ii many nations forced establish domestic agar industries order continue microbiological around time world war ii approximately tons agar produced production worldwide increased dramatically approximately tons since production agar fluctuated due unstable sometimes overutilized seaweed agar consists mixture two polysaccharides agarose agaropectin agarose making mixture agaropectin makes agarose linear polymer made repeating units agarobiose disaccharide made dgalactose agaropectin heterogeneous mixture smaller molecules occur lesser amounts made alternating units dgalactose lgalactose heavily modified acidic sidegroups sulfate glucuronate agar exhibits hysteresis mixed water solidifies forms gel k called gel point melts k melting hysteresis agar occurs due difference gel point melting point property lends suitable balance easy melting good gel stability relatively high since many scientific applications require incubation temperatures close human body
