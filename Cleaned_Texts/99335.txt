social neuroscience interdisciplinary field devoted understanding relationship social experiences biological systems humans fundamentally social species rather solitary homo sapiens create emergent organizations beyond range dyads families groups cities civilizations cultures regard studies indicate various social influences including life events poverty unemployment loneliness influence health

mediates social biological underpinnings social cognition investigated social cognitive neuroscience traditional neuroscience many years considered nervous system isolated entity largely ignored influences social environments humans many animal species live fact recognize considerable impact social structures operations brain body social factors operate individual continuous interplay neural

considered one major problem areas neurosciences century applies concepts methods biology develop theories social processes behavior social behavioral sciences social neuroscience capitalizes biological concepts methods inform refine theories social behavior uses social behavioral constructs data advance theories neural organization throughout century social biological explanations widely viewed incompatible advances recent years led development new approach synthesized social biological sciences new field social neuroscience emphasizes complementary relationship different levels organization spanning social biological domains eg molecular cellular system person relational collective societal use multilevel analyses foster understanding mechanisms underlying human mind

eg reward system drug addiction addition quantitative metaanalyses important move beyond idiosyncrasies individual studies neurodevelopmental investigations contribute understanding brainbehavior two popular forms methods used social neuroscience fmri eeg fmri cost efficient high spatial resolution however low temporal resolution therefore best discover pathways brain used social experiments fmri low temporal resolution timing read oxygenated blood levels pool parts brain activated need oxygen thus blood takes time travel part brain activated reverse provides lower ability test exact timing activation social experiments eeg best used researcher trying brain map certain area correlates social construct studied eegs provide high temporal resolution low spatial resolution timing activation accurate hard pinpoint exact areas brain researchers narrow locations areas also create lot noise recently researchers using tms best way discover exact location process brain mapping machine turn parts brain allows researchers test part brain used social events however machine expensive rarely used note methods provide correlations brain mapping social events apart tms con social neuroscience research must interpreted correlations cause decreased content validity example experiment participant task test social theory part brain activated impossible form causality anything else room thoughts person could triggered response hard isolate variables experiments selfreports important also help decrease chances voodoo correlations correlations high look like correlation exists two factors actually error design statistical measures another way avoid con use tests hormones infer causality example people given oxytocin placebos test differences social behavior people using scrs also help isolate unconscious thoughts conscious thoughts bodys natural parasympathetic response outside world tests devices help social neuroscientists discover connections brain used carry everyday social activities primarily psychological methods include performancebased measures record response time andor implicit association observational measures preferential looking infant studies selfreport measures questionnaire neurobiological methods grouped together ones measure external bodily responses electrophysiological methods hemodynamic measures lesion methods bodily response methods include gsr also known skin conductance response scr facial emg eyeblink startle response electrophysiological methods include singlecell recordings eeg erps hemodynamic measures instead directly measuring neural activity measure changes blood flow include pet fmri lesion methods traditionally study brains damaged via natural causes strokes traumatic injuries tumors neurosurgery
