genetics origin species book ukrainianamerican evolutionary biologist theodosius dobzhansky regarded one important works modern synthesis one earliest book popularized work population genetics biologists influenced appreciation genetic basis book dobzhansky applied theoretical work sewall wright study natural populations allowing address evolutionary problems novel way time dobzhansky implements theories mutation natural selection speciation throughout book explain habits populations resulting effects genetic book explains evolution depth process time accounts diversity life earth study evolution present greatly neglected time dobzhansky illustrates evolution regarding origin nature species time history deemed mysterious expanding potential progress made darwins theory natural selection organisms produced survive variations give competitive advantage best chance surviving procreating main element lacking theory mechanism would allow organisms pass favorable variations lacking mechanism theory evolution faced competition theories neolamarckism environment acted directly organisms changing structures darwin know monk gregor mendel already working experiments would explain inheritance terms units heredity call mendelian genetics rediscovered several scientists initially increased confusion dutch botanist hugo de vries developed theory called mutationism variations inconsequential could lead species change instead new species formed large first geneticists tended support mutationism group theoretical geneticists particularly ronald fisher j b haldane sewall wright showed mendels laws could explain continuous variation biological characteristics natural selection could act cumulatively giving rise large changes work provided theoretical framework incorporating genetics theory many biologists fell two camps geneticists mostly worked laboratory naturalists studied natural populations field museums put much effort taxonomy contributed concepts essential understanding evolution naturalists introduced biological species concept definition species community reproductively isolated occupies distinctive ecological also recognized species polytypic variations time space behavior change function give rise evolutionary two groups used different methods terminology difficult communicate often battling scarce academic resources often scornful paleontologist george gaylord simpson put paleontologists believed geneticist person shut room pulled shades watched small flies disporting milk bottles thought studying nature meanwhile naturalists like man undertakes study principles internal combustion engine standing street corner watching motor cars whiz book began series lectures columbia university october november dobzhansky decided attend summer meeting genetics society america woods hole massachusetts geneticist leslie dunn learned invited dobzhansky give series lectures columbia sent invitation april within month suggested lectures springboard writing general treatise evolutionary genetics dobzhansky enthusiastic may wrote back proposing title genetics origin species envisioned two parts part containing data sources evolutionary change part ii containing discussion interactions leading race species lectures received dobzhansky returned pasadena december columbia university press accepted proposal book pace writing helped riding accident february crushed knee rendering immobile april able send manuscript dunn reading manuscript dunn persuaded university revive jesup lectures series involved notable lecturers past backdated dobzhanskys lectures became first series columbia university biological series also revived genetics origin species published october became volume three main editions published significant changes dobzhansky considered genetics evolutionary process fourth edition one much changed needed new genetics origin species two main points make first speciation genuine problem must explained theory evolution nature single population organisms separated small variations instead natural world divided species limited range variability second point variations explained principles edition divided nine chapters whose contents described first chapter short outline main points book evolutionary theory must account variations level individual also populations species must explain reproductive isolation occur goal explain using genetic principles verified xxix second chapter argues mutations occur frequently random direction small effect affect features organisms vary beneficial lethal sufficient provide raw material natural xxix third chapter dobzhansky demonstrates mutations observed laboratory also occur nature acted natural selection thus nothing intrinsically different process new species dobzhansky continues theme continuity laboratory nature chapter showing variations structure arrangement number chromosomes occur laboratory nature shows chromosomal translocation rearrangement parts chromosomes accounts racial differences datura stramonium jimsonweed chromosomal inversion reversal segment basis differentiation drosophila also points effects demonstrate chromosome parts xxx established sources natural variation mutations chromosomal rearrangements dobzhansky considers shapes preserves variation first edition book considers genetic drift important natural selection example argued drift reason racial variations observed partula land snail variations adaptive advantage argued variations called microgeographic race nonadaptive variation always controlled selection need know size population predict evolutionary xxxi sixth chapter discusses evidence natural selection experiments laboratory observations nature considered examples camouflage industrial melanism moths arthropods evolve darker pigmentation exposed environment lot soot refuted mendelian misconceptions effectiveness natural selection also rejected strict selectionism seventh chapter dobzhansky discusses polyploidy condition common plants organism two complete sets humans diploid one set mother father discusses case histories raphanobrassica hybrid radish cabbage example cataclysmic speciation exception general rule speciation slow isolating mechanism prevents members two different species successfully producing offspring dobzhansky invented xxxiii eighth chapter discusses role speciation views sufficiently original publish journal article although previous authors recognized importance isolation reasons entirely different george romanes thought isolation cause change whereas dobzhansky sees two competing effects isolation reduces rate formation harmful gene combinations also restricts scope genetic variation thus species remains near given peak fitness landscape find new adaptive dobzhansky presents classification isolating mechanisms main division hybrid sterility discusses next chapter mechanisms prevent organisms mating include geographic ecological isolation two populations changed sufficiently physiological isolating mechanisms prevent mating remain distinct even longer physically isolated isolation end continuous process includes division races involves multiple chapter isolating mechanisms dobzhansky deplores appallingly insufficient attention geneticists devoted isolating mechanism studied sterility hybrid organisms devotes ninth chapter particularly detailed analysis literature work drosophila pseudoobscura species fruitfly dobzhansky able identify populations species identical sets genes dobzhansky used experimental breeding laboratories gardens also surveys related species nature help support aspects organic evolution data book show different genetic mutations chromosomal changes observed experiments vital book illustrate transition laboratory greater field genetics drosophila enabled researchers gain deeper understanding scientific knowledge heredity expanded contributed areas biology focusing opportunities constraints research organism persuasive accounts chromosomal genetics drosophila eventually evolved genetics natural populations results experiments support theory modern evolutionary experiments dobzhansky discovers mutation genes leads evolution within specific species adaptations play large role genetic drift known genes mutations influence genetic drift particular environment mutations result external influences within surrounding environment especially organism inhabits area harsh living conditions organism adapt environment order better suit needs organism successfully adapts higher survival reproduction rates therefore higher chance genes passed offspring specific genes alleles passed future generations continue trend modern evolution dobzhansky presents dobzhansky said natural mutation aided variation lead change acted upon natural mutations thought relatively rare variations even considered harmful since organisms overall genetic makeup result natural selection damaging mutations weeded wild populations assumed mutations result evolution said relatively slow process one dobzhanskys major contributions book show view slowmoving evolution incorrect analyzing chromosome structure wild populations drosophila pseudoobscura dobzhansky discovered surprising amount undiscovered variability variations could observed outward appearance individual organisms dobzhansky suggested preservation extensive variation would allow populations evolve rapidly environmental conditions change book landmark evolutionary synthesis presented union mendelian genetics darwinian genetics origin species polyploidy considered type mutation polyploid cells chromosome number twice haploid number effects polyploidy two different species causes hybridization even greater natural selection environment produces reproductive success benefits species speciation process evolution new biological species formed dobzhansky studied specifics sexual physiological behavioral isolating mechanisms drosophila pseudoobscura drosophila paulistrorum like many studies dobzhanskys work reproductive isolation aimed studying process evolution bringing samples population back laboratory dobzhansky showed could vary environmental conditions produce changes frequency inversion patterns observed changing seasons field dobzhansky concluded seasonal fluctuations result natural selection work temperature acting selecting agent masterful studies provided concrete support theory natural selection time illustrating fruitfulness combining field laboratory work study adaptive evolution occurs dominance survival competing genes within species caused increasing frequency alleles whose phenotypic effects selfishly promote reproduction also believed new species could arise single mutations must isolated others species time geography habitat breeding genetics origin species provided outline synthesis genetics evolution enthusiastically
