processing described sciences concerned gathering manipulating storing retrieving classifying recorded according atkinsonshiffrin memory model multistore model information firmly implanted memory must pass three stages mental processing sensory memory shortterm memory longterm example working memory model includes central executive phonologic loop episodic buffer visuospatial sketchpad verbal information longterm memory visual information sternberg sternberg central executive like secretary brain decides needs attention respond central executive leads three different subsections first phonological storage subvocal rehearsal phonological loop sections work together understand words put information memory hold memory result verbal information storage next subsection visuospatial sketchpad works store visual images storage capacity brief leads understanding visual stimuli finally episodic buffer section capable taking information putting longterm memory also able take information phonological loop visuospatial sketchpad combining longterm memory make unitary episodic representation sternberg sternberg order work sensory register takes via five senses visual auditory tactile olfactory taste present since birth able handle simultaneous processing eg food taste smell see general learning benefits occur developed process pattern recognition sensory register large capacity behavioral response short seconds within model sensory store short term memory working memory limited capacity sensory store able hold limited amounts information limited amounts time phenomenon similar picture taken flash brief moments flash goes flash seems still however soon gone way know sternberg sternberg short term memory holds information slightly longer periods time still
