lithobates rana commonly known wood frog frog species broad distribution north america extending boreal forest north southern appalachians several notable disjunct populations including lowland eastern north carolina wood frog garnered attention biologists freeze tolerance relatively great degree terrestrialism ranid interesting habitat associations peat bogs vernal pools uplands relatively longrange movements ecology conservation wood frog attracted research attention recent years often considered obligate breeders ephemeral wetlands sometimes called vernal pools imperiled species breed wood frog proposed official state amphibian new wood frogs range mm length females larger adult wood frogs usually brown tan rustcolored usually dark eye individual frogs capable varying color conant
