bochdalek hernia one two forms congenital diaphragmatic hernia form morgagni hernia bochdalek hernia congenital abnormality opening exists infants diaphragm allowing normally intraabdominal organs particularly stomach intestines enter thoracic cavity majority people affected lung resulting lung compression lifethreatening bochdalek hernias occur commonly posterior left side versus right side bochdalek hernias type hernia first described mccauley subsequently studied named czech pathologist vincenz alexander bochdalek normal bochdalek hernia cases symptoms often observable simultaneously babys birth symptoms bochdalek hernia include difficulty breathing fast respiration increased heart rate baby appears cyanosis bluetinted skin also another way identify baby bochdalek hernia look chest immediately birth baby bochdalek hernia may appear one side chest cavity larger andor abdomen seems caved symptoms rarely develop symptoms occur may vague related gastrointestinal may include pain signs bowel likely bochdalek hernias formed throughout growth process organ construction fetal development fetal development diaphragm formed seventh tenth week also time esophagus stomach intestines formed therefore bochdalek hernia forms either malformation diaphragm intestines become locked chest cavity construction diaphragm although factors contribute bochdalek hernia take variables account bochdalek hernias along morgagni hernias multifactor conditions meaning many reasons multiple variables contribute malformations example case could genetic environmental conditions add probability birth one way determine baby fact bochdalek hernia would pediatrician perform physical infant chest xray also done examine abnormalities lungs also diaphragm intestine addition doctor also take blood test drawing arterial blood check determine well baby breathing ability breathe chromosomal test done testing blood also performed determine whether problem genetic doctors also take ultrasound heart echocardiogram evaluate health heartcitation needed different pathways treatment available first step treatment includes babys admission nicu neonatal intensive care preferred path treatment bochdalek hernia babies admitted nicu placed mechanical ventilator help breathing rarely hernia small enough noticed likely asymptomatic right side chest infant stabilized using medical treatments mechanical ventilation alternate pathway involves putting infants temporary heartlung bypass machine called ecmo stands extracorporeal membrane ecmo allows oxygen regulated blood pumps blood throughout entire body normally machine used stabilize babys condition preferred stabilize infant prior surgery minimize complications possible treatment baby stable state improved diaphragm fixed misplaced organs relocated correct position either done via primary repair remaining diaphragm stretched cover hole abdominal muscle split used stretch hole last option goretex patch higher risks later infection although various treatments bochdalek hernias guarantee baby since baby must go previous treatments babys hospital stay usually longer normal newborn average infants born bochdalek hernia stay hospital infant needing go ecmo longer stay likely worse outcome one stabilized without ecmocitation needed disorder diagnosed adult remain without symptoms specific treatment symptomatic surgery may carried open closed bochdalek hernia lifethreatening condition approximately newborns born bochdalek hernia immediately high infants born bochdalek hernia high mortality rate due respiratory infants bochdalek hernia lungs diaphragm digestive system forming time bochdalek hernia permits abdominal organs invade chest cavity rather remain diaphragm correct position puts infant critical condition foreign bodies chest cavity compress lungs impairing proper development causing pulmonary since lungs infants suffering bochdalek hernia fewer alveoli normal lungs bochdalek hernias lifethreatening conditions due respiratory like lungs intestines may also trouble developing correctly intestines trapped within thoracic cavity lungs intestines may receiving amount blood need stay healthy function properlycitation needed individualized prognosis infants depends several factors including infant born amount herniation thoracic cavity whether liver thorax well malformations including heart best outcomes fetus diagnosed prenatally delivered tertiary hospital ecmo different centers manage differently different outcomes families temporarily relocate cdh surgical center choice bochdalek hernias make diaphragmatic hernia cases appear spontaneously adults one every births every babies born bochdalek hernia likely another birth defect caused hernia twenty percent children born bochdalek hernia also congenital heart defect addition infants born condition may also abnormalities five sixteen percent infants chromosomal cases leftsided hernias bochdalek hernias ratio males females words bochdalek hernias common men useful way remember localization hernia vs morgagni bochdalek back left posterolateral localization
