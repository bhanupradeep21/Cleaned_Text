cognitive biology emerging science regards natural cognition biological based theoretical assumption every single cell continually engaged systematic acts cognition coupled intentional behaviors ie sensorymotor say organism sense stimuli environment respond accordingly cognitive explanation natural cognition may manifest organism constrained biological conditions genes survive one generation since darwinian theory species every organism evolving common root three elements cognitive biology required study cognition one species organism useful contrast comparison study another species cognitive ii useful proceed organisms simpler complex cognitive iii greater number variety species studied regard understand nature cognitive science endeavors explain human thought conscious mind work cognitive biology focused fundamental process cognition organism past several decades biologists investigated cognition organisms mounting evidence suggests even bacteria grapple problems long familiar cognitive scientists including integrating information multiple sensory channels marshal effective response fluctuating conditions making decisions conditions uncertainty communicating conspecifics others honestly deceptively coordinating collective behaviour increase chances survival without thinking perceiving humans would act basic cognition arguably simple stepbystep process organism senses stimulus finds appropriate response repertoire enacts response however biological details basic cognition neither delineated great many species sufficiently generalized stimulate investigation lack detail due lack science dedicated task elucidating cognitive ability common biological organisms say science cognitive biology yet science presented several published thoughts
