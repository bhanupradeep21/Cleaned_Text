encoding specificity principle general principle matching encoding contexts information recall assists retrieval episodic memories provides framework understanding conditions present encoding information relate memory recall introduced thomson tulving suggested contextual information encoded memories affect retrieval process person uses information stored memory necessary information accessible accessibility governed retrieval cues cues dependent encoding pattern specific encoding pattern may vary instance instance even nominally item encoding depends context conclusion drawn recognitionmemory series psychological experiments undertaken continued work showed context affects ability recall information context may refer context information encoded physical location surroundings well mental physical state individual time encoding principle plays significant role concept contextdependent memory concept statedependent memory examples use encoding specificity principle include studying room exam taken recall information intoxicated easier intoxicated ebbinghaus pioneer research memory noted associations items aids recall information thus internal context list matters look connection helps us combine items meaningful units started lot research lists toberemembered tbr words cues helped tulving osler made participants memorise list tbr words absence presence cue words cue words facilitated recall present input output memorising recalling words concluded specific retrieval cues aid recall information relation tbr words stored time words tulving thomson studied effect change context tbr adding deleting replacing context words resulted reduction level recognition performance context changed even though available information remained context led encoding specificity semantics always play role encoding specificity memory rather depends upon context encoding early research shown semantically related cues effective retrieving word provided semantic cue encoded along target word semantically related word present time encoding efficient cuing recall target laboratory study subject presented unrelated word pair able recall target word much accuracy prompted unrelated word matched time encoding presented semantically related word available time recall task people benefit equally weakly related cue word strongly related cue word provided weakly related word present regardless semantic relatedness paired words participants effectively recalled target words primed prompted many following experiments employed method modeled thomson tulvings however slight variations allowed researchers discover individual findings following table shows importance priming word pairs achieve enhanced recall words encoded modeled table multiple
