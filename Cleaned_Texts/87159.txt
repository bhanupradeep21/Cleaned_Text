factor v leiden variant mutated form human factor v one several substances helps blood clot causes increase blood clotting hypercoagulability due mutation protein c anticoagulant protein normally inhibits proclotting activity factor v able bind normally factor v leading hypercoagulable state ie increased tendency patient form abnormal potentially harmful blood factor v leiden common hereditary hypercoagulability prone clotting disorder amongst ethnic named dutch city leiden first identified rogier maria bertina direction laboratory pieter hendrick despite increased risk venous thromboembolisms people one copy gene found shorter lives general autosomal dominant genetic disorder incomplete penetrance symptoms factor v leiden vary among individuals individuals gene never develop thrombosis others recurring thrombosis age years variability influenced number gene chromosome mutations person presence gene alterations related blood clotting circumstantial risk factors

estrogenlike drugs taken menopause increases risk developing dvt pe healthy women taking ocps three fourfold increased risk developing dvt pe compared women take ocp women factor v leiden take ocps

functions cofactor allow factor xa activate prothrombin resulting enzyme thrombin thrombin turn cleaves fibrinogen form fibrin polymerizes form dense meshwork makes majority clot activated protein c natural anticoagulant acts limit extent clotting cleaving degrading factor vcitation needed factor v leiden autosomal dominant genetic condition exhibits incomplete penetrance ie every person mutation develops disease condition results factor v variant easily degraded activated protein c gene codes protein referred mutation single nucleotide polymorphism snp located exon missense substitution amino acid r amino acid q changes proteins amino acid arginine glutamine depending chosen start position nucleotide variant either position also affects amino acid position variant either together general lack nomenclature standard variance means snp referred several ways since amino acid normally cleavage site activated protein c mutation prevents efficient inactivation factor v factor v remains active facilitates overproduction thrombin leading generation excess fibrin excess excessive clotting occurs disorder almost always restricted clotting may cause deep vein thrombosis dvt venous clots break clots travel right side heart lung block pulmonary blood vessel cause pulmonary embolism extremely rare disorder cause formation clots arteries lead stroke heart attack though ministroke known transient ischemic attack common given disease displays incomplete dominance homozygous mutated allele heightened risk events detailed versus heterozygous suspicion factor v leiden cause thrombotic

anticoagulants routinely recommended people heterozygous factor v leiden unless additional risk factors present given event single occurrence deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism people factor v leiden warrants temporary anticoagulant treatment generally lifelong addition temporary treatment anticoagulant enoxaparin lovenox may required periods particularly high risk thrombosis major people homozygous factor v leiden heterozygous factor v leiden additional thrombophilia however considered lifelong oral anticoagulation studies found percent caucasians north america factor v leiden data indicated prevalence factor v leiden greater among caucasians minority one study also suggested factor mutation segregates populations significant caucasian admixture rare genetically distant percent patients present deep vein thrombosis dvt pulmonary embolism condition risk developing clot blood vessel depends whether person inherits one two copies factor v leiden mutation inheriting one copy mutation parent heterozygous increases fourfold eightfold chance developing clot people inherit two copies mutation homozygous one parent may times usual risk developing type blood considering risk developing abnormal blood clot averages per year general population presence one copy factor v leiden mutation increases risk two copies mutation may raise risk high unclear whether individuals increased risk recurrent venous thrombosis percent people factor v leiden two copies defective gene homozygous individuals severe clinical condition presence acquired risk factors venous smoking use estrogencontaining combined forms hormonal contraception recent increase chance individual factor v leiden mutation develop dvtcitation needed women factor v leiden substantially increased risk clotting pregnancy estrogencontaining birth control pills hormone replacement form deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism also may small increased risk preeclampsia may small increased risk low birth weight babies may small increased risk miscarriage stillbirth due either clotting placenta umbilical cord fetus fetal clotting may depend whether baby inherited gene influences clotting system may placental note many women go one pregnancies difficulties others may repeatedly pregnancy complications still others may develop clots within weeks becoming pregnantcitation needed
