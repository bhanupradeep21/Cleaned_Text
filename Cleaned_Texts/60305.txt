germfree organisms multicellular organisms microorganisms living organisms raised using various methods control exposure viral bacterial parasitic known microbiota introduced germfree organism usually referred gnotobiotic organism however technically speaking germfree organisms also gnotobiotic status microbial community due lacking microbiome many germfree organisms exhibit health deficits defects immune system difficulties energy typically germfree organisms used study microbiome careful control outside contaminants germfree organisms generated variety different means common practice shared many form sterilization step followed seclusion surrounding environment prevent contamination germfree poultry typically undergo multiple sterilization steps still egg lifestage involve either washing
