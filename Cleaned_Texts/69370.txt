techniques jumping library clone composed two stretches dna usually located many kilobases away stretch dna located two ends deleted series biochemical manipulations carried start cloning technique chromosome jumping chromosome hopping first described collins time cloning techniques allowed generation clones limited size cytogenetic techniques allowed mapping clones small region particular chromosome resolution around therefore major gap remained resolution available technologies methods available mapping larger areas technique extension chromosome walking allows larger steps along chromosome steps length n kb desired high molecular weight dna necessary isolated partially digested frequentcutting restriction enzyme mboi bamhi next obtained fragments selected size around n kb length dna must ligated low concentration favour ligation circles rather formation multimers dna marker amber suppressor trna gene supf included time point within covalently linked circle allow selection junction fragments circles subsequently fully digested second restriction enzyme ecori generate large number fragments fragments ligated vectors λ vector selected using dna marker introduced earlier remaining fragments thus represent library junction fragments jumping next step screen library probe represents starting point desired chromosome hop ie determining location genome interrogated clones obtained final selection step consist dna homologous probe separated dna marker another dna sequence originally located n kb away thus called generating several libraries different n values eventually entire genome mapped allowing movement one location another controlling direction value n original technique chromosome jumping developed laboratories collins weissman yale university new laboratories poustka lehrach european molecular biology laboratory heidelberg collins weissmans described encountered early limitations main concern avoiding noncircularized fragments two solutions suggested either screening junction fragments given probe adding second sizeselection step ligation separate single circular clones monomers clones ligated multimers authors also suggested markers λ cos site antibiotic resistance genes considered instead amber suppressor trna gene facilitate selection junction clones poustka suggested full digestion rarecutting restrictions enzymes noti used first step library construction instead partial digestion frequently cutting restriction enzyme would significantly reduce number clones millions thousands however could create problems circularizing dna fragments since fragments would long would also lose flexibility choice end points one gets partial digests one suggestion overcoming problems would combine two methods ie construct jumping library dna fragments digested partially commonly cutting restriction enzyme completely rare cutting restriction enzyme circularizing plasmids cleaved enzymes several combination libraries completed zabarovsky et proposed new approach construction jumping libraries approach included use two separate λ vectors library construction partial fillingin reaction removes need selectable marker fillingin reaction worked destroying specific cohesive ends resulting restriction digests dna fragments nonligated noncircularized thus preventing cloning vectors energyefficient accurate manner furthermore improved technique required less dna start also produced library could transferred plasmid form making easier store replicate using new approach successfully constructed
