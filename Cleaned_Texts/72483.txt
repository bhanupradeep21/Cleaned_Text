scathophaga stercoraria commonly known yellow dung fly golden dung fly one familiar abundant flies many parts northern hemisphere common name suggests often found feces large mammals horses cattle sheep deer wild boar goes distribution stercoraria likely influenced human agriculture especially northern europe north scathophaga integral animal kingdom due role natural decomposition dung fields also important scientific world due short life cycles susceptibility experimental manipulations thus contributed significant knowledge animal scathophaga stercoraria sexually dimorphic average lifespan one two months adult males bright goldenyellow orangeyellow fur front legs females little duller color pronounced greenbrown tinges brightly colored fur front legs adults range mm length males generally larger physical features separate stercoraria populations vary greatly due part range locations species generally located cooler temperate regions including north america asia europe may also favor higher altitudes pyrenees swiss adults mainly prey smaller insects mostly diptera also consume nectar dung additional sources energy laboratory setting adult stercoraria live solely drosophila females spend time foraging vegetation visit dung pats mate oviposit dung surface males females attracted dung scent approach dung pats males spend time dung waiting females feeding insects visit dung blow flies absence prey yellow dung fly may turn cannibalism larvae coprophagous relying dung scathophaga stercoraria breeds dung many large mammals generally prefers fresh cattle dung operational sex ratio pats malebiased competition high females small limited precopulatory copulation lasts minutes male attempts guard female males males females often mate multiple reproductive success depends variety factors including sperm competition nutrition environmental females paired accessory glands supply lubricants reproductive system secrete proteinrich egg shells sperm received large structure called bursa copulatrix stored structure called spermatheca scathophaga species three spermathecae one pair one singlet narrow duct connects bursa sperm stored spermathecae days weeks even years sperm several males stored males two projections paralobes used hold onto female copulation paralobes intromittent organ aedeagus transfers sperm females bursa copulation sperm directly deposited spermstoring organs ejaculation occurs bursa copulatrix females actively move sperm spermathecae using muscular spermathecal invagination pump sperm transit gives females level control much sperm enters system example cryptic female choice although current results inconclusive regarding whether females cryptically selecting better phenotypic match female may benefit variable sperm fertilizing offspring adaptations advantageous females benefit able control sperm successful fertilizing eggs females may aware sperm better suited offspring simply able control proportion sperm multiple mates maximize possibility optimal phenotypic match advantage multiple males sperm reach eggs rather one copulation females prefer lay eggs small hills dung surface avoiding depressions pointed areas survival strategy aims prevent desiccation drowning eggs placed greatest chance many studies studied many manifestations sexual conflict including postmating sexual selection yellow dung fly sperm competition occurs female mates multiple males males sperm direct competition fertilize eggs sperm mix quickly reach females stores goal males displace sperm males much possible larger males tend longer copulation times greater rates sperm displacement fertilization success males secondary mates increased body size relative first male traits body size testis size sperm length variable well heritable stercoraria males larger sperm may advantageous greater propulsion along females spermathecal duct resulting higher fertilization success rates competition among males high females mating multiple males largest testes also success terms proportion sperm fertilize females eggs resulting male offspring would similar advantage positive correlation found sperm length males
