obstetrics gestational age measure age pregnancy taken beginning womans last menstrual period corresponding age gestation estimated accurate method available methods include adding days known duration since fertilization possible vitro fertilization obstetric ultrasonography popularity using measure pregnancy largely due convenience menstruation usually noticed generally convenient way discern fertilization implantation occurred gestational age contrasted fertilization age takes date fertilization start date gestation different approaches defining start pregnancy definition unusual saying women become pregnant two weeks sex definition pregnancy calculation gestational age also relevant context abortion debate beginning human personhood according american college obstetricians gynecologists main methods calculate gestational age gestational age also estimated calculating days ovulation estimated related signs ovulation tests adding days complete listing methods given following general rule official gestational age based actual beginning last menstrual period unless methods gives estimated date differs variability method case difference probably explained variability example gestational age based beginning last menstrual period weeks firsttrimester obstetric ultrasonography gives estimated gestational age weeks sd variability estimate thereby giving variability weeks difference weeks tests larger sd variability ultrasonography estimate indicating gestational age estimated ultrasonography used official gestational estimated due date edd established rarely changed determination gestational age accurate earlier following diagrams estimating gestational age obstetric ultrasound various target parameters gestational sac diameter crownrump length crl biparietal diameter bpd fertilization conceptional age also called embryonic age later fetal age time fertilization usually occurs within day ovulation turn occurs average days beginning preceding menstruation also considerable variability interval prediction interval ovulation days menstruation even average woman mean lmptoovulation time reference group representing women prediction interval lmptoovulation actual variability gestational age estimated beginning last menstrual period without use additional method mentioned previous section substantially larger uncertainty menstrual cycle gave rise pregnancy example menstruation may scarce enough give false appearance earlier menstruation gave rise pregnancy potentially giving estimated gestational age approximately one month large also vaginal bleeding occurs first trimester may mistaken menstruation potentially giving estimated gestational age low gestational age used example forcitation needed mean pregnancy length estimated days gestational age timed first day last menstrual period days retrospectively estimated obstetric ultrasound measurement fetal biparietal diameter bpd second algorithms take account variables whether first subsequent child mothers race age length menstrual cycle menstrual regularity order standard reference point normal pregnancy duration assumed medical professionals days weeks gestational age furthermore actual childbirth certain probability occurring within limits estimated due date study singleton live births came result childbirth standard
