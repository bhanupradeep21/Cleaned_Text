biotechnology use living organisms develop useful products biotechnology often used pharmaceutical manufacturing notable examples include use bacteria produce things insulin human growth hormone examples include use transgenic pigs creation hemoglobin use humans amongst earliest uses biotechnology pharmaceutical manufacturing use recombinant dna technology modify escherichia coli bacteria produce human insulin performed genentech prior development technique insulin extracted pancreas glands cattle pigs farm animals generally efficacious treatment diabetes animalderived insulin indistinguishable human insulin may therefore produce allergic genentech researchers produced artificial genes two protein chains comprise insulin molecule artificial genes inserted plasmids among group genes activated lactose thus insulinproducing genes also activated lactose recombinant plasmids inserted escherichia coli bacteria induced produce molecules either chain chain b human two protein chains combined produce insulin molecules prior use recombinant dna technology modify bacteria produce human growth hormone hormone manufactured extraction pituitary glands cadavers animal growth hormones therapeutic value humans production single years supply human growth hormone required fifty pituitary creating significant shortages scientists genentech produced human growth hormone inserting dna coding human growth hormone plasmid implanted escherichia coli bacteria gene inserted plasmid created reverse transcription mrna found pituitary glands complementary dna haeiii type restriction enzyme acts restriction sites noncoding codon complementary dna human growth hormone used produce dna fragment base pairs includes coding sequences amino acids chemically synthesized dna adaptor fragment containing atg initiation produced codons first amino acids human growth hormone two dna fragments combined form syntheticnatural hybrid use entirely synthetic methods dna production produce gene would translated human growth hormone escherichia coli would exceedingly laborious due significant length amino acid sequence human growth hormone however cdna reverse transcribed mrna human growth hormone inserted directly plasmid inserted escherichia coli bacteria would translate regions gene translated humans thereby producing prehormone containing extra amino might difficult remove prior development fda approval means produce human blood clotting factors using recombinant dna technologies human blood clotting factors produced donated blood inadequately screened hiv thus hiv infection posed significant danger patients hemophilia received human blood clotting factors reports indicate percent patients hemophilia exposed factor viii concentrates seropositive hiv western blot assay may patients hemophilia first human blood clotting factor produced significant quantities using recombinant dna technology factor ix produced using transgenic chinese hamster ovary cells lacking map human genome researchers obtained known sequence rna factor ix examining amino acids factor ix microsequencing highly purified factor ix yielded sufficient amino acid sequence construct oligonucleotide known sequence factor ix rna used search gene coding factor ix library dna found human liver since known blood clotting factors produced human unique oligonucleotide homologous factor ix mrna synthesized labeled resultant probe used screen human liver doublestranded cdna library complete twostranded dna sequences relevant cdna contained coding sequence coohterminal eleventh codon entire sequence cdna used find remaining dna sequences comprising factor ix gene searching dna x chromosome genomic library human xxxx chromosome prepared screened factor ix cdna probe hybridizing recombinant phage isolated plaquepurified dna isolated restriction mapping southern analysis dna sequencing permitted identification five recombinant phagecontaining inserts overlapped common sequences coded entire factor ix plasmids containing factor ix gene along plasmids gene codes resistance methotrexate inserted chinese hamster ovary cells via transfection transfection involves insertion dna eukaryotic cell unlike analogous process transformation bacteria transfected dna ordinarily integrated cells genome therefore usually passed subsequent generations via cell division thus order obtain stable transfection gene confers significant survival advantage must also transfected causing cells integrate transfected dna genomes increase population cells integrate dna eliminated case study growth increasing concentrations promoted survival stably transfected cells diminished survival cells chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected produced significant quantities factor ix shown substantial coagulant properties though lesser degree factor ix produced human blood specific activity recombinant factor ix measured basis direct measurement coagulant activity specific activity recombinant factor ix unitsmg compared unitsmg measured plasmaderived factor fda approved factor viii produced using transgenic chinese hamster ovary cells first blood clotting factor produced using recombinant dna technology recombinant dna techniques also employed create transgenic farm animals produce pharmaceutical products use humans instance pigs produce human hemoglobin created blood pigs could employed directly transfusion humans hemoglobin could refined employed manufacture blood bristolmyers squibb manufactures paclitaxel using penicillium raistrickii plant cell fermentation pcfcitation needed transgenic yeast used produce artemisinin well number insulin httpsenwikipediaorgwikibiotechnologyinpharmaceuticalmanufacturing
