stanford marshmallow experiment study delayed gratification led psychologist walter mischel professor stanford study child offered choice one small immediate reward two small rewards waited period time time researcher left child room single marshmallow minutes returned eat marshmallow reward either another marshmallow pretzel stick depending childs preference followup studies researchers found children able wait longer preferred rewards tended better life outcomes measured sat educational body mass index life replication attempt sample diverse population times larger original study showed half effect original study replication suggested economic background rather willpower explained predictive power marshmallow test challenged first experiment delayed gratification conducted walter mischel ebbe b ebbesen stanford university purpose study understand control delayed gratification ability wait obtain something one wants develops children research conducted time done delayed rewards areas time perspective delay resistance psychological many studies conducted area human social behavior authors hypothesized increased salience reward would turn increase amount time children would able delay gratification wait since rewards presented front children reminded waiting attention reward right front supposed make wait longer larger reward children led room empty distractions treat choice either two animal cookies five pretzel sticks placed researchers let children know could eat treat waited minutes without giving temptation would rewarded second mischel ebbesen observed children covered eyes hands rested heads arms found similar techniques averting eyes reward objects many seemed try reduce frustration delay reward generating diversions talked sang invented games hands feet even tried fall asleep waiting one successfully children used participants experiment consisting boys girls participants attended bing nursery school stanford university children ranged age three years six months five years eight months median age four years six months three subjects disqualified experiment unable understand instructions choices given experimenters procedures conducted two experimenters opaque cake tin presented table experimental room cake tin five pretzels two animal cookies two chairs front table one chair empty cardboard box near chair empty cardboard box four battery operated toys floor experimenter pointed four toys child could play toys experimenter asked child sit chair demonstrated toy briefly friendly manner said would play toys later experimenter placed toy cardboard box sight child experimenter explained child needed leave room child ate pretzel experimenter would return room instructions repeated child seemed understand completely experimenter left room waited child eat pretzel repeated procedure four times experimenter returned experimental room opened cake tin reveal two sets rewards form edibles five pretzels two animal crackers experimenter asked child two preferred child chose experimenter explained child could either continue wait preferred reward experimenter returned child could stop waiting bringing back experimenter child stopped waiting child would receive less preferred reward forgo preferred one depending condition childs choice preferred reward experimenter picked cake tin along either nothing one rewards experimenter returned either soon child signaled results indicated exact opposite originally predicted instead rewards serving cue attend possible delayed rewards rewards served increase childrens frustration ultimately decreased delay gratification results seemed indicate thinking reward enhances ability delay gratification rather focusing attention future following study conducted mischel ebbesen zeiss generally recognized stanford marshmallow experiment due use marshmallows preferred reward building information obtained previous research regarding selfcontrol mischel et al hypothesized activity distracts participant reward anticipating increase time delay gratification expected overt activities internal cognitions fantasies would help selfdistraction distraction also hypothesized subject would able take frustrative nature situation convert one psychologically less aversive test expectations researchers contrived three settings test participants overt activity covert activity activity predicted overt covert activities delay gratification increase activity setting would decrease assess childrens ability understand instructions given experiment asked three comprehension questions tell get eat wait come back want make come back ring bell bring back get three distinct experiments conducted multiple differing conditions participants consisted children boys

table sight child experiment think food rewards given children experiment three separate experiments demonstrate number significant findings effective delay gratification depends heavily cognitive avoidance suppression reward objects waiting delivered additionally children thought absent rewards difficult delay gratification reward items directly front conversely children experiment waited reward visibly present able wait longer attain preferred reward stanford marshmallow experiment important demonstrated effective delay achieved merely thinking something want rather depends suppressive avoidance mechanisms reduce frustration frustration waiting desired reward demonstrated nicely authors describing behavior children made quiet songshid head arms pounded floor feet fiddled

relaxed proceeded fall sound asleep followup studies mischel found unexpected correlations results marshmallow experiment success children many years first followup study showed preschool children delayed gratification longer selfimposed delay paradigm described years later parents adolescents significantly second followup study showed ability delay gratification also correlated higher sat paper mischel contributed reports similar experiment time relating ability delay order receive cookie age reaction time gono go brain imaging study sample original stanford participants reached

rochester smaller n altered experiment dividing children two groups one group given broken promise marshmallow test conducted unreliable tester group second group fulfilled promise marshmallow test reliable tester group reliable tester group waited four times longer min unreliable tester group second marshmallow authors argue calls question original interpretation selfcontrol critical factor childrens performance since selfcontrol predict ability wait strategic waiting makes sense prior marshmallow experiment stanford walter mischel shown childs belief promised delayed rewards would actually delivered important determinant choice delay later experiments take factor account control individual variation beliefs reliability reporting correlations life studies mischel colleagues conducted stanford order establish trust experimenter would return beginning marshmallow test children first engaged game summoned experimenter back ringing bell actual waiting portion experiment start children clearly understood experimenter would keep promise participants original studies bing school stanford university appeared doubt would receive reward waiting chose wait desirable reward however mischels earlier studies showed many situations children certain would receive delayed situations waiting delayed rewards may adaptive response watts duncan quans conceptual yielded mostly statistically insignificant correlations behavioral problems significant correlation achievement tests age effects lower original experiment reduced controlling early cognitive ability behavior family
