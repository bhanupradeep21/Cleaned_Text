dinocephalian south africa comparing features tapinocaninus discussed tapinoceohalinae cladistic analysis rubidge et al found synapomorphy two expanded heels incisor thus discovery tapinocaninus considered primitive species known several skulls specimens found lacking post cranial skeleton large animal measuring length snout classic regression formulas using circumference humerus femur bones

tapinocaninus distinguished laterally facing fovea base neural spine feature primitive therapsids another ancestral trait clade also includes presence intercentra cervical vertebrae tapinocaninus vertebrae cervicals dorsals lumbars sacrals caudals long neural spine extends way caudal vertebral structure suggests tapinocaninus short tails similar anomodonts contrast presence two sacral vertebrae tapinocaninus differs therapsids moschops ribs present along entire vertebral column cervical region ribs shortened flat longest ribs present middorsal region dorsal ribs barrel shaped

description tapinocaninus drawn various skulls nmqr nmqr nmqr roz dinocephalian heterodont dentition consisting incisors canines post canines maximum five incisor teeth present premaxilla display talon heel morphology singular canine first tooth maxilla bone curved backward heel following canine post canine teeth characterized pointed crowns small lingually situated heels dentition indicates animals likely herbivore researchers suggest forelimb posture tapinocaninus intermediate sprawling upright posture suggested upright standing sphenacodonts sprawled theriodont theraspids intermediate posture explained long bones addition shape positioning humerus medially inflected femur postural stance would also supportive tapinocaninus larger body additionally presence intercentra anterior dorsal vertebrae medial directed zygapophyses tapinocaninus suggests less undulatory locomotion compared heterodont dentition indicates teeth morphologically differentiated tapinocaninus includes
