coelurus sɪˈljʊərəs silureəs genus coelurosaurian dinosaur late jurassic period midlate kimmeridgian faunal stage million years ago name means hollow tail referring hollow tail vertebrae greek κοῖλος koilos hollow οὐρά oura tail although name linked one main divisions theropods coelurosauria historically poorly understood sometimes confused betterknown contemporary ornitholestes like many dinosaurs studied early years paleontology confusing taxonomic history several species named later transferred genera abandoned one species currently recognized valid type species c fragilis described othniel charles marsh known one partial skeleton found morrison formation wyoming united states small bipedal carnivore elongate legs coelurus described othniel charles american paleontologist naturalist known bone wars edward drinker time described interpreted vertebrae back tail found location type specimen new genus species camptonotus dispar later renamed camptosaurus camptonotus already use cricket marsh impressed hollow interiors thinwalled vertebrae characteristic gave type species name coelurus fragilis thought new genus animal large wolf probably coelurus would prove

fitting betterknown clades cretaceous along several generalized coelurosaurians compsognathids ornitholestes proceratosaurus multiple placements around base phylogenetic analysis conducted rauhut smith et al found coelurus closely related compsognathids oliver rauhut proposed coeluridae composed coelurus plus others since found compsognathids group however work published phil senter following
