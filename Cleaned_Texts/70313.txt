sweat glands also known sudoriferous sudoriparous glands latin sudor small tubular structures skin produce sweat sweat glands type exocrine gland glands produce secrete substances onto epithelial surface way duct two main types sweat glands differ structure function secretory product mechanism excretion anatomic distribution distribution across species ceruminous glands produce ear wax mammary glands produce milk ciliary glands eyelids modified apocrine sweat generally sweat glands consist secretory unit produces sweat duct carries sweat away secretory coil base set deep lower dermis hypodermis entire gland surrounded adipose sweat gland types secretory coils surrounded contractile myoepithelial cells function facilitate excretion secretory secretory activities gland cells contractions myoepithelial cells controlled autonomic nervous system circulating hormones distal apical part duct opens skins surface known sweat gland receives several nerve fibers branch bands one axons encircle individual tubules secretory coil capillaries also interwoven among sweat number active sweat glands varies greatly among different people though comparisons different areas ex axillae vs groin show directional changes certain areas always active sweat glands others always according henry grays estimates palm around sweat glands per back hand per forehead per breast abdomen forearm per back legs per finger pads sweat glands pores somewhat irregularly spaced epidermal ridges pores ridges though sweat tends spill thick epidermis palms soles causes sweat glands become spirally nonprimate mammals eccrine sweat glands palms soles apocrine glands cover rest body though effective humans temperature regulation exception prosimians ratio follicles apocrine glands versus follicles eccrine glands hairs body humans hairs overall distribution sweat glands varies among primates rhesus patas monkeys chest squirrel monkey palms soles stumptailed macaque japanese monkey baboon entire domestic animalswhich apocrine glands base hair follicle eccrine glands foot pads snout apocrine glands like humans produce odorless oily milky secretion evolved evaporate cool rather coat stick hair odorcausing bacteria grow eccrine glands foot pads like palms soles humans evolve cool either rather increase friction enhance grip dogs cats apocrine glands specialized structure function located eyelids molls glands ears ceruminous glands anal sac clitoral hood circumanal eccrine sweat glands everywhere except lips ear canal prepuce glans penis labia minora clitoris ten times smaller apocrine sweat glands extend deeply dermis excrete directly onto surface proportion eccrine glands decreases clear secretion produced eccrine sweat glands termed sweat sensible perspiration sweat mostly water contain electrolytes since derived blood plasma presence sodium chloride gives sweat salty taste total volume sweat produced depends number functional glands size surface opening degree secretory activity regulated neural hormonal mechanisms men sweat women eccrine sweat glands working maximum capacity rate perspiration human may exceed three liters per dangerous losses fluids electrolytes occur eccrine glands three primary functions apocrine sweat glands found armpit areola around nipples perineum anus genitals ear eyelids secretory portion larger eccrine glands making larger overall rather opening directly onto surface skin apocrine glands secrete sweat pilary canal hair follicle puberty apocrine sweat glands hormonal changes puberty cause glands increase size begin substance secreted thicker eccrine sweat provides nutrients bacteria skin bacterias decomposition sweat creates acrid apocrine sweat glands active times stress sexual mammals including humans apocrine sweat contains pheromonelike compounds attract organisms within species study human sweat revealed differences men women apocrine secretions human sweat glands classified either apocrine eccrine characteristics glands termed larger eccrine glands smaller apocrine secretory portion narrow portion similar secretory coils eccrine glands well wide section reminiscent apocrine apocrine found armpits perianal region ducts opening onto skin presumed developed puberty eccrine comprise axillary glands apoeccrine glands secrete sweat eccrine apocrine glands thus playing large role axillary apoeccrine glands sensitive cholinergic activity though also activated via adrenergic like eccrine glands continuously secrete thin watery specialized sweat glands including ceruminous glands mammary glands ciliary glands eyelids sweat glands nasal vestibulum modified apocrine ceruminous glands near ear canals produce cerumen earwax mixes oil secreted sebaceous mammary glands use apocrine secretion produce sweat glands used regulate temperature remove waste secreting water sodium salts nitrogenous waste urea onto skin main electrolytes sweat sodium though amount small enough make sweat hypotonic skin eccrine sweat clear odorless composed water also contains nacl fatty acids lactic acid citric acid ascorbic acid urea uric acid ph ranges hand apocrine sweat ph contains water proteins carbohydrate waste material lipids steroids sweat oily cloudy viscous originally gains odor upon decomposition bacteria apocrine glands sebaceous glands open hair follicle apocrine sweat mixed apocrine eccrine sweat glands use merocrine secretion vesicles gland released sweat via exocytosis leaving entire cell originally thought apocrine sweat glands use apocrine secretion due histological artifacts resembling blebs cell surface however recent electron micrographs indicate cells use merocrine apocrine eccrine sweat glands sweat originally produced glands coil isotonic blood plasma rate sweating low salt conserved reabsorbed glands duct high sweat rates hand lead less salt reabsorption allow water evaporate skin via osmosis increase evaporative secretion sweat occurs myoepithelial cell cells surrounding secretory glands eccrine sweat increases rate bacterial growth volatilizes odor compounds apocrine sweat strengthening latters acrid normally certain number sweat glands actively producing sweat stimuli call sweating sweat glands activated producing eccrine apocrine sweat glands participate thermoregulatory directly controlled hypothalamus thermal sweating stimulated combination internal body temperature mean skin eccrine sweat glands stimulation occurs via activation acetylcholine binds glands muscarinic emotional sweating stimulated stress anxiety fear pain independent ambient temperature acetylcholine acts eccrine glands adrenaline acts eccrine apocrine glands produce emotional sweating occur anywhere though evident palms soles feet axillary sweating palms soles thought evolved fleeing reaction mammals increases friction prevents slipping running climbing stressful gustatory sweating refers thermal sweating induced ingestion food increase metabolism caused ingestion raises body temperature leading thermal sweating hot spicy foods also leads mild gustatory sweating face scalp neck capsaicin compound makes spicy food taste hot binds receptors mouth detect warmth increased stimulation receptors induces thermoregulatory unlike deodorant simply reduces axillary odor without affecting body functions antiperspirant reduces eccrine apocrine antiperspirants classified drugs cause proteins precipitate mechanically block eccrine sometimes apocrine sweat metal salts found antiperspirants alters keratin fibrils ducts ducts close form horny plug main active ingredients modern antiperspirants aluminum chloride aluminum chlorohydrate aluminum zirconium chlorohydrate buffered aluminum apocrine glands antiperspirants also contain antibacterial agents trichlorocarbanilide hexamethylene tetramine zinc salts dissolved ethanol mixed essential oils high eugenol thymol thyme clove oils antiperspirants may also contain diseases sweat glands include sweat gland tumors adenolipomas lipomas associated eccrine sweat many diseases cause sweat gland dysfunction httpsenwikipediaorgwikisweatgland
