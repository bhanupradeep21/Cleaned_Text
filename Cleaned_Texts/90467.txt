skin flora also called skin microbiota refers microbiota communities microorganisms reside skin typically human skin many bacteria around species upon human skin nineteen found superficial layers epidermis upper parts hair follicles skin flora usually nonpathogenic either commensal harmful host mutualistic offer benefit benefits bacteria offer include preventing transient pathogenic organisms colonizing skin surface either competing nutrients secreting chemicals stimulating skins immune however resident microbes cause skin diseases enter blood system creating lifethreatening diseases particularly immunosuppressed major nonhuman skin flora batrachochytrium dendrobatidis chytrid nonhyphal zoosporic fungus causes chytridiomycosis infectious disease thought responsible decline amphibian estimate number species present skin bacteria radically changed use ribosomal rna identify bacterial species present skin samples direct genetic material previously identification depended upon microbiological culture upon many varieties bacteria grow hidden staphylococcus epidermidis staphylococcus aureus thought cultural based research dominant however ribosomal rna research finds common species make skin however skin variety provides rich diverse habitat bacteria come four phyla actinomycetota bacillota pseudomonadota bacteroidota needed three main ecological areas sebaceous moist dry propionibacteria staphylococci species main species sebaceous areas moist places body corynebacteria together staphylococci dominate dry areas mixture species betaproteobacteria flavobacteriales dominant ecologically sebaceous areas greater species richness moist dry ones areas least similarity people species spaces fingers spaces toes axillae umbilical cord stump similarly

undisturbed community excellent part skin microbiome navel umbilicus moist microbiome high humidity contains large amount especially bacteria favors moist conditions belly button biodiversity project began north carolina state university early two initial groups volunteers given sterile cotton swabs asked insert cotton swabs navels turn cotton swab around three times return cotton swab researchers contained ml phosphate saline researchers north carolina state university led jiri grew samples culture bacterial colonies large enough photographed pictures posted belly button biodiversity projects

predict every strain bacteria microbiome navel could predict strains would prevalent strains bacteria would quite rare found navel microbiomes contained prevalent types bacteria staphylococcus corynebacterium actinobacteria clostridiales bacilli many different types rare types rare organisms discovered inside navels volunteers including three types archaea two found one volunteer claimed

biodiversity project ongoing taken swabs project designed aim countering misconception bacteria always harmful humans war actuality strains bacteria beneficial human another projects goals foster public interest working concert human microbiome project belly button biodiversity project also studies connections human microbiomes factors age sex ethnicity overall skin microflora commensals mutualistic pathogens often three depending upon strength persons immune research upon immune system gut lungs shown microflora aids immunity development however research started upon whether case pseudomonas aeruginosa example mutualistic bacterium turn pathogen cause disease gains entry circulatory system result infections bone joint gastrointestinal respiratory systems also cause dermatitis however p aeruginosa produces antimicrobial substances pseudomonic acid exploited commercially mupirocin works staphylococcal streptococcal infections p aeruginosa also produces substances inhibit growth fungus species candida krusei candida albicans torulopsis glabrata saccharomyces cerevisiae aspergillus also inhibit growth helicobacter important antimicrobial actions noted removing p aeruginosa skin use oral topical antibiotics may inversely allow aberrant yeast colonization another aspect bacteria generation body odor sweat odorless however several bacteria may consume create byproducts may considered putrid humans contrast flies example may find attractiveappealing several examples skin creates antimicrobial peptides cathelicidins control proliferation skin microbes cathelicidins reduce microbe numbers directly also cause secretion cytokine release induces inflammation angiogenesis reepithelialization conditions atopic dermatitis linked suppression cathelicidin rosacea abnormal processing cathelicidin cause inflammation psoriasis linked selfdna created cathelicidin peptides causes autoinflammation major factor controlling cathelicidin vitamin superficial layers skin naturally acidic ph due lactic acid sweat produced skin ph mutualistic flora staphylococci micrococci corynebacterium propionibacteria grow transient bacteria gramnegative bacteria like escherichia pseudomonas gram positive ones staphylococcus another factor affecting growth pathological bacteria antimicrobial substances secreted skin enhanced acidic alkaline conditions bacteria cease attached skin readily shed observed skin also swells alkaline conditions opens allowing bacterial movement activated immune system skin produces cellmediated immunity microbes dermatophytes skin one reaction increase stratum corneum turnover shed fungus skin surface skin fungi trichophyton rubrum evolved create substances limit immune response shedding skin general means control buildup flora upon skin surfacecitation needed microorganisms play role noninfectious skin diseases atopic rosacea damaged skin cause nonpathogenic bacteria become diversity species skin related later development acne vulgaris common skin condition characterised excessive sebum production pilosebaceous unit inflammation affected areas typically colonised propionibacterium acnes member commensal microbiota even without high populations p acnes linked acne vulgaris although certain strains strongly associated acne others healthy skin relative population p acnes similar acne current treatment includes topical systemic antibacterial drugs result decreased p acnes colonisation andor potential probiotic treatment includes use staphylococcus epidermidis inhibit p acnes growth epidermidis produces succinic acid shown inhibit p acnes lactobacillus plantarum also shown act antiinflammatory improve antimicrobial properties skin applied topically also shown effective reducing acne lesion individuals atopic dermatitis shown increase populations staphylococcus aureus lesional nonlesional atopic dermatitis flares associated low bacterial diversity due colonisation aureus following standard treatment bacterial diversity seen increasecitation needed current treatments include combinations topical systemic antibiotics corticosteroids diluted bleach potential probiotic treatments include using commensal skin bacteria epidermidis inhibit aureus growth atopic dermatitis flares population levels epidermidis shown increase attempt control aureus low gut microbial diversity babies associated increased risk atopic infants atopic eczema low levels bacteroides high levels bacillota bacteroides antiinflammatory properties essential see gut microbiota psoriasis vulgaris typically affects drier skin sites elbows knees dry areas skin tend high microbial diversity fewer populations sebaceous study using swab sampling techniques show areas rich bacillota mainly streptococcus staphylococcus actinomycetota mainly corynebacterium propionibacterium associated another study using biopsies associate increased levels bacillota actinomycetota healthy however studies show individuals affected psoriasis lower microbial diversity affected areas treatments psoriasis include topical agents phototherapy systemic current research skin microbiotas role psoriasis inconsistent therefore potential probiotic treatments rosacea typically connected sebaceous sites skin skin mite demodex folliculorum produce lipases allow use sebum source food therefore high affinity sebaceous skin sites although part commensal skin microbiota patients affected rosacea show increase folliculorum compared healthy individuals suggesting bacillus oleronius demodex associated microbe typically found commensal skin microbiota initiates inflammatory pathways whose starting mechanism similar rosacea populations epidermidis also isolated pustules rosacea patients however possible moved demodex areas favour growth demodex shown transport bacteria around current treatments include topical oral antibiotics laser current research yet show clear mechanism demodex influence rosacea potential probiotic treatments skin microbes potential source infected medical devices human skin host numerous bacterial fungal species known harmful known beneficial vast majority unresearched use bactericidal fungicidal soaps
