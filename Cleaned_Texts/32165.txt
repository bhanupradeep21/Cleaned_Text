internal pacemaker activity considering healthy heart main pacemaker collection cells border atria vena cava called sinoatrial node heart cells ability generate electrical activity independent external stimulation result cells node spontaneously generate electrical activity subsequently conducted throughout heart resulting regular heart rate absence external stimuli sinoatrial pacing contributes maintain heart rate range beats per minute time two branches autonomic nervous system act complementary way increasing slowing heart rate context vagus nerve acts sinoatrial node slowing conduction thus actively modulating vagal tone accordingly modulation mediated neurotransmitter acetylcholine downstream changes ionic currents calcium heart vagus nerve plays crucial role heart rate
