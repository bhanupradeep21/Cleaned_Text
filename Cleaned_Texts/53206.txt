carcinoid syndrome paraneoplastic syndrome comprising signs symptoms occur secondary neuroendocrine tumors formerly known carcinoid syndrome caused neuroendocrine tumors often found gut releasing biologically active substances blood causing symptoms flushing diarrhea less frequently heart failure vomiting carcinoid syndrome occurs approximately neuroendocrine advancedwell developed neuroendocrine biologically active substances released tumors cause symptoms carcinoid substances act vessels produce symptoms carcinoid less common symptoms include malabsorption leading pellagra fatigue muscle loss cognitive late complications may include mesenteric retroperitoneal fibroses carcinoid syndrome occurs secondary neuroendocrine tumors occur mostly gut less commonly lungs may also occur places body pancreas kidneys neuroendocrine tumors produce several biologically active substances mainly amines substances known secreted tumors exact effect contribution carcinoid syndrome common substances found released contribute syndrome include serotonin histamine tachykinins kallikrein prostaglandins greatest contribution appearing symptoms carcinoid syndrome result action substances largely blood biologic substances often metabolized inactivated liver process known first pass metabolism carcinoid syndrome often occurs patients neuroendocrine tumor metastasized liver allows substances bypass first pass neuroendocrine tumors arising bronchi may associated manifestations carcinoid syndrome without liver metastases biologically active products reach systemic circulation passing liver metabolized tryptophan metabolism altered carcinoid syndrome neuroendocrine tumors shift conversion tryptophan serotonin normal high increased amounts serotonin lead increased gut motility causing diarrhea seen carcinoid increased amounts serotonin also cause flushing seen main symptom carcinoid tryptophan also needed niacin synthesis cause pellagra associated carcinoid pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors metastases histamine release kallikrein metabolism vasoactive mediators flushing symptoms carcinoid carcinoid crisis extreme exacerbation carcinoid syndrome results excessive release amines neuroendocrine tumors largely result stressful procedures anesthesia surgery radiation treatment symptoms carcinoid crisis include flushing hypotension arrhythmia carcinoid heart disease result valvular damage related vasoactive substances released neuroendocrine tumor reaching right side mainly affects right side heart unless anomalous circulation ie patent foramen ovale lungs metabolize substances released tumor similar liver initial tissue injury around valves plaque develop fibrosis occur possibly mediated excess certain degree clinical suspicion useful initial test urine levels acid end product serotonin metabolism chromogramin glycoprotein released neuroendocrine tumors used detect nonsecreting imaging studies largely focused abdomen pelvis neuroendocrine tumors causing carcinoid syndrome largely arise ct mri utilize radioactive somatostatin analogues pentetreotide used localize pet scan also used find primary tumor bronchoscopy biopsy performed evidence pulmonary patients serotonin elevated upper limit normal echocardiogram recommended evaluation carcinoid heart conditions similar carcinoid syndrome considered treatment carcinoid syndrome focused controlling proliferation primary tumor symptomatic control symptoms somatostatin analogues octreotide analogues help control growth tumor associated symptoms carcinoid patients whose symptoms refractory initial doses increasing dose switching another analogue pasireotide may patients continue refractory mtor inhibitors tph inhibitor telotristat ethyl may useful controlling diarrhea associated carcinoid syndrome peptide directed radiotherapy prrt another alternative treatment patients failed somatostain analogue method uses radioactive somatostatin analogues target tumor therapies effective metastatic disease studies limited month time cytoreductive surgery performed chemically may also control symptoms starting around months post procedure lasting long also procedures target liver directly radiofrequency ablation radioembolization deliver targeted therapy directly liver special especially useful patients liver important aspect treating carcinoid heart disease detecting presence echocardiography likely color treatment consists treatment patients heart failure definitive treatment surgical valve repair disease progression difficult ascertain disease metastasize anywhere body small identify current technology markers condition chromogranina imperfect indicators disease incidence neuroendocrine tumors us lies somewhere per people appears increasing incidence carcinoid syndrome per people people neuroendocrine appear variance gender however patients african american ethnicity appear affected carcinoid syndrome carcinoid syndrome affect animals similarly similarly humans carcinoid syndrome due neuroendocrine tumors arise mainly bowel also common signs animals include vomiting diarrhea weight loss symptoms common humans flushing hypotension
