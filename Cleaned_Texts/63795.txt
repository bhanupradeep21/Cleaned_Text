chlortalidone effective hydrochlorothiazide prevention heart attack common adverse effects include low blood potassium low blood sodium high blood sugar dizziness erectile adverse effects may include gout low blood magnesium high blood calcium allergic reactions low blood reviews found chlortalidone hydrochlorothiazide similar risk adverse reviews found chlortalidone higher may used pregnancy less preferred works completely clear believed involve increasing amount sodium water lost chlortalidone patented came medical use world health organizations list essential available generic commonly

effective hydrochlorothiazide lowering blood pressure two drugs similar trials chlortalidone high blood pressure found lower doses chlortalidone eg mg daily allhat study maximal blood pressure lowering effect higher doses lower chlortalidone thiazide diuretics effective lowering high blood pressure persons chronic kidney disease although risk adverse effects chlortalidone used treat enlargement left ventricle heart works chiefly lowering blood pressure thereby reducing systemic vascular resistance evidence chlortalidone superior hydrochlorothiazide reducing mass left ventricle heart persons enlargement left ventricle chlortalidone superior angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors angiotensin ii receptor blockers inducing regression enlargement left ventricle main pumping chamber chlortalidone reduces edema swelling increasing urinary salt water excretion lowering intravascular hydrostatic pressure thereby lowering transcapillary pressure see starling equation edema may caused either increased hydrostatic pressure reduced oncotic pressure blood vessels edema due increased hydrostatic pressure may result serious cardiopulmonary disease reduces glomerular perfusion kidney kidney injury disease may reduce glomerular excretion salt water kidney due relatively benign conditions menstrualrelated fluid retention adverse effect dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers commonly cause swelling feet lower legs edema due decreased oncotic pressure may result leaking blood proteins glomeruli injured result diminished synthesis blood proteins damaged liver regardless cause chlortalidone may reduce severity edema reducing intravascular volume thereby reducing intravascular hydrostatic chlortalidone decreases mineral bone loss promoting calcium retention kidney directly stimulating osteoblast differentiation bone mineral cochrane review found tentative evidence thiazide exposure associated reduced risk hip secondary analysis data allhat study found chlortalidone reduced risk hip pelvis chlortalidone reduces amount calcium excreted urine reducing risk calcium oxalate kidney people multiple episodes calcium oxalate kidney stones chlortalidone lowers risk another episode kidney chlortalidone effective hydrochlorothiazide lowering urine calcium levels therefore probably chlortalidone reduces endolymph volume reduces hydrostatic pressure inner ear chambers elevated endolymph pressure inner ear thought cause ménières disease endolymphatic hydrops synthesis evidence multiple small lowquality studies indicates chlortalidone thiazide diuretics effective ménières chlortalidone thiazide medication key component treatment nephrogenic diabetes insipidus nephrogenic diabetes insipidus occurs kidney unable concentrate urine inadequate response vasopressindependent removal free water renal tubular filtrate blocking sodium ion resorption distal convoluted tubule chlortalidone induces increase excretion sodium ion urine natriuresis giving chlortalidone simultaneously restricting dietary sodium intake causes mild hypovolemia low intravascular volume induces isotonic reabsorption solute proximal renal tubule reducing solute delivery renal collecting tubule renal medullary collecting duct reduced delivery solute collecting tubule medullary collecting duct allows increased water resorption higher concentration urine leads reversal nephrogenic diabetes insipidus means independent reviews found similar risk reviews found higher risk side frequency severity adverse effects much reduced chlortalidone used lower doses eg mg per day chlortalidone reduces reabsorption sodium chloride primarily inhibition symporter apical membrane distal convoluted tubule cells although chlortalidone often referred thiazidelike diuretic unlike thiazide diuretics addition inhibition symporter also strongly inhibits multiple isoforms carbonic chlortalidones diuretic effect also due inhibition carbonic anhydrase proximal chronic exposure chlortalidone decreases glomerular filtration rate chlortalidones diuretic effect diminished persons kidney impairment increasing delivery sodium distal renal tubule chlortalidone indirectly increases potassium excretion via sodiumpotassium exchange mechanism ie apical romkna channels coupled basolateral nak atpases result low blood concentration potassium chloride well mild metabolic alkalosis however diuretic effect chlortalidone affected acidbase balance person treated uncertainty mechanism blood pressurelowering effect occurs chronic exposure initially diuretics lower blood pressure decreasing cardiac output reducing plasma extracellular fluid volume eventually cardiac output returns normal plasma extracellular fluid volume return slightly less normal reduction peripheral vascular resistance maintained thus resulting overall lower blood pressure reduction intravascular volume induces elevation plasma renin activity aldosterone secretion contributing potassium loss associated thiazide diuretic therapy chlortalidone slowly absorbed gastrointestinal tract oral ingestion long halflife therefore prolonged diuretic action results continued diuretic effects despite skipped dose prolonged action chlortalidone despite missing doses may account higher efficacy chlortalidone compared shorter halflife medication hydrochlorothiazide chlortalidone
