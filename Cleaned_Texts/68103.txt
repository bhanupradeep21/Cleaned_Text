observe microbial life form fruiting bodies moulds book micrographia made drawings studies coined term louis pasteur exposed boiled broths air vessels contained filter prevent particles passing growth medium also vessels without filter air allowed via curved tube dust particles would settle come contact broth boiling broth beforehand pasteur ensured microorganisms survived within broths beginning experiment nothing grew broths course pasteurs experiment meant living organisms grew broths came outside spores dust rather spontaneously generated within broth thus pasteur refuted theory spontaneous generation supported germ theory robert koch established microorganisms cause disease found blood cattle infected anthrax always large numbers bacillus anthracis koch found could transmit
