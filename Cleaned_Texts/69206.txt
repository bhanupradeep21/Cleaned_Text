erotic plasticity degree ones sex drive changed cultural social someone high erotic plasticity sex drives affected situational social cultural influences whereas someone low erotic plasticity sex drive relatively rigid unsusceptible change since social psychologist roy baumeister coined term two studies directly assessing erotic plasticity completed female erotic plasticity hypothesis states women higher erotic plasticity men therefore sex drives socially flexible responsive men factors religion culture education greater effect womens sexual behaviors men hand remain relatively rigid puberty still affected factors women theorised possess weaker sex drive may readily accept substitutes alternate forms satisfaction baumeister theorized weaker motivations tend lead greater plasticity however lower sex drive necessarily imply sex less important women females lower capacity become aroused rather baumeisters supports notion women less willing engage sex male according baumeister culture woman raised affects sexual attitudes behaviours would affect man raised culture factors politics cultural societal views sexual behaviours would play role multinational study lippa found women variable sex drives suggesting sexuality malleable influenced society another study showed south korean women higher median age first intercourse lower rates premarital sex greater disapproval premarital south korea strong genderbased sexual double standards women expected passive virgins marriage therefore baumeister theorized cultural norms affected womens attitudes behaviours men another study showed female male hispanic immigrants united states less likely engage vaginal oral anal sex hispanics born raised united condom use unaffected whether person immigrant suggesting upbringing acculturation significant impact engaging sexual activity would protect sex baumeister predicted acculturation process adopting behaviour patterns attitudes surrounding culture greater effect sexual behaviours attitudes female immigrants however study conducted benuto meana one two studies conducted erotic plasticity supporting evidence examining acculturation college students american college nonamerican background acculturation effect sexual behaviours attitudes men women numerous potential methodological flaws study indicated may produced contradictory data women trying appear socially desirable responses see social desirability bias participants acculturated catholic nuns successful fulfilling vows celibacy willing commit promises sexual abstinence male clergy suggesting women easily adapt high nonpermissive study older unmarried adults found highly religious less likely recently sex compared nonreligious unmarried however effect stronger women suggesting stronger influence womens sexual behaviour church attendance religiosity also associated lower odds reporting masturbation among one possible explanation higher levels spirituality religiosity associated higher levels sex guilt women one study even suggests differs amongst women different culture religious eurocanadian women reported significantly higher levels sexual desire less sex guilt eastern asian example two societal pressures religion culture interacting shape sexuality finally farmer colleagues found unreligious women likely engage unrestricted premarital intercourse behaviour religious women difference demonstrated religious nonreligious religiosity also affect whether adolescents choose abstain sexual conduct commitment religion friends similar commitments stronger impact girls factors family members disapproval adolescent sexual behaviour also play significant role heritability amount differences individuals product genetics according female erotic plasticity theory sexual behaviours men heritable stronger biological component driving behaviours study examining adult twins sweden found lower genetic component engagement samesex behaviours women shared environment also played larger role womens samesex behaviours mens although unique environmental factors roughly hand study australian twins bailey dunne martin found concordance sexual behaviour male mz twins female mz another twin study showed male identical twins likely female identical twins begin sex shared environment plays greater role genetics risky sexual behaviours adolescent baumeisters prediction states women greater inconsistencies attitudes towards sexual behaviours whether actually engage said behaviours wives likely husbands report changed great deal habits ideas expectations sex years even husbands reported spouses changed wives another example condom use women past demonstrated difficulty expressing desire use however study woolf maisto found trend declining suggesting traditional gender roles culture may although female erotic plasticity theory states mens womens sexuality different evidence suggests mens sexuality affected sociocultural factors although religious commitment family members stances adolescent sexual behaviours significant impact females choice abstain lesser extent affects males choice also fact male clergy successful maintaining vows celibacy suggests degree erotic plasticity college education associated increase variety sexual men women asian males females consistently report conservative sexual attitudes hispanic according meredith chivers straight women physically aroused greater variety erotic images men physical arousal match subjective similar results found study showed consensual nonconsensual sex scenes men women neither men women reported

concept sexual orientation sexuality rigid rather change time according lisa diamond developer concept women generally tend fluid sexuality study lesbian bisexual unlabeled women found tendency changing sexual identities behaviour studies shown well greater fluidity among lesbians compared homosexual men however heterosexual men women equally stable orientation bisexual men women similarly often sexual orientation sexual orientation identity distinguished impact accurately assessing sexual identity whether sexual orientation able change sexual orientation identity change throughout individuals life may may align biological sex sexual behavior actual sexual sexual orientation stable unlikely change vast majority people research indicates people may experience change sexual orientation likely women american psychological association distinguishes sexual orientation innate attraction sexual orientation identity may change point persons women remained relationships maletofemale transsexuals maintained heterosexual identity yet reported changes sexual lives aramburu alegr√≠a women reported relationships longer included sexual activity others reported things still changing according lippa heterosexual women high sex drives tend attracted women men whereas heterosexual men high sex drives associated attraction either women men suggesting greater plasticity womens lesbians likely gay men engage heterosexual sex suggesting greater variability research done people gender variation transgender people little known erotic plasticity transsexuals sexual

baumeister provided three applications theory erotic plasticity sex sex differences erotic plasticity change therapists approach providing sex therapy men women baumeister found cognitive therapy would better approach female patients sexual responses behaviours influenced things mean therefore working womens interpretations understanding responses behaviours would greatest benefit physiological therapy hormone therapy would therefore best male patients since focus would body mans cognitions also someone high erotic plasticity less sexual selfknowledge selfunderstanding someone low erotic plasticity since behaviours tastes susceptible change knowledge could useful helping someone perhaps confused sexual identity finally prospects successful sex therapy may better women men men develop problem low plasticity make difficult allow significant change puberty useful applications erotic plasticity sex therapy include women place much consideration family peer relationships internal external pressures may affecting sexual identity religious influences cultural norms baumeisters theory female erotic plasticity met criticism argue baumeister makes causal inferences correlational research discussing education affects men women also criticized use extreme groups support predictions people least two posited alternate explanations erotic plasticity paper janet shibley hyde amanda durik argued sociocultural explanation could used explain erotic firstly education affect mens womens sexual behaviour differently instead increases womens power therefore women greatest amount education nearly equal power men hand women least educated least power relative men comparing sexual behaviours educated least educated men women found education actually increased prevalence many sexual activities sexes including oral sex anal sex sex partner differences men women much smaller educated group least educated group shibley hyde durik speculate educated women better communicating desires enough selfconfidence also may perform greater variety sexual activities greater exposure ideas commitment learning shibley hyde durik also asserted religion greater effect womens sexual behaviours group less power case women shape behaviour like group power case men therefore women pay attention conform religious teachings since culture must adapt back claim presenting evidence nonreligious women men similar prevalence sexual activities minus masturbation contrary conservative protestant men women differed significantly sexual behaviours also argued modern sexual double standard restrictive female sexuality male sexuality claimed extramarital sex tolerated women past still less acceptable women men therefore different gender roles exert powerful influences mens womens behaviour sexuality finally claim greater evidence attitudebehaviour inconsistency women result high erotic plasticity mens greater interpersonal power although women may example intention using condoms negative attitudes towards anal sex men may use greater power desire differs partner wants benuto argues heightened fluidity sociocultural influences two components erotic plasticity actually stand opposition although scientific evidence exists womens sexual behaviours indeed fluid mens benuto argues nothing society would encourage women engage samesex behaviour hypothesizes based properties epq scale benuto erotic plasticity may unitary construct like baumeister initially proposed perhaps may multiple plasticities composed different constructs constructs include sociocultural influences locus control changes sexual attitudes time finally possible heightened attitudebehaviour inconsistency women could either due powerlessness women women wanting
