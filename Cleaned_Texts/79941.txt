adamantinasuchus extinct genus notosuchian crocodylomorph named late cretaceous adamantina formation brazil known one fossil holotype ufrjdg collected william nava hence specific name navae fossil consists partial skull fragmentary limb bones broken vertebrae found kilometres mi southwest town marilia near reservoir dam adamantinasuchus approximately centimetres long nose tail would weighed adamantinasuchuss skull quite well preserved right anterior part present along right posterior part cranium crushed left side skull altogether missing right lower jaw also preserved along many teeth skull small millimetres long around millimetres high elliptical orbits large almost long rostrum might suggest animal premaxilla covered grooves ridges making ornamented bone entire fossil anterior end premaxillae come together short triangular projection pointing ventrally another pointing dorsally would connected cartilaginous septum separating two external nares although preserved premaxilla bears two incisiform teeth one caniniform tooth led place sphagesaurid group crocodyliforms since also differentiated teeth although cladogram suggests disputed maxillary dentition appears bear theory bears seven molariform teeth varying sizes maxilla mostly triangular long anteroposterior base ventral side thin crest covers border dental alveoli towards posterior end maxilla elongated forms long suture jugal beneath large orbits two large foramina posterior end maxilla three small foramina anterior end close premaxillarymaxillary border another foramen nasal bone incompletely preserved curves around ventrally slightly sculptured towards anterior end nasal projects back far enough contact frontal bone thin short blade prefrontal triangular left right prefrontals preserved although left prefrontal fragmentary prefrontal frontal bones form sinuous suture although fully interdigitating one prefrontals outer surface smooth possibly due contact palpebral bone preserved lacrimal bone small distinguishing features contacts nasal prefrontal frontal bones frontal weakly convex middle anterior posterior area flattened although parietal bone preserved interdigitating suture parietal frontal still present crest across bone medial postorbital fragmentary evident squarish posterolateral frontal bone rather curving downwards jugal thin triangular transversal section three branches outer surface smooth large foramen anterior section bone close thin crest medial portion comes slender edge jugal arched medially curving laterally away orbit widest behind long suture maxilla tapering bladelike portion posterior end postorbital bar almost vertical oval crosssection quadratojugal behind laterotemporal fenestra slender lower jaw whole laterally compressed curved anteroposteriorly narrow ventral surface convex jaw forms halfmoon shape mandibular fenestra elliptical excavate dentary noticeably rather remaining angular surangular dorsal end dentary extends posteriorly around part surangular outer surface dentary entirely smooth surangular triangular crosssection tallest anterior portion lateral projection extends partially cover mandibular fenestra posterior end surangular closer cylindrical angular medially excavated mandibular fenestra forms vertical contact zone dentary posterior end vertically expanded upwards form narrow blade dentary carries three teeth preserved portion closely resemble teeth noticeably heterodont adamantinasuchus mixture incisiform caniniform molariform teeth first two teeth premaxilla incisiform small pointed conical bear small grooves third premaxillary tooth caniniform much larger incisiform teeth though similar conical shape tip points slightly backwards crown bears small grooves seven maxillary teeth molariform though vary greatly size first three last two much smaller two middle ones half size overall maxillary teeth one deep root oval crosssection slight constriction crown teeth flattened obliquely produce spatulate shape outer surfaces maxillary teeth smooth bear grooves whereas inner surfaces covered denticles grow smaller towards tip tooth two large central molariform teeth second set denticles around base inner surface tooth three teeth preserved dentary one contacts maxillary tooths inner surface outer surface denticles tooths outer surface perfectly match inner surface maxillary tooth forming chisel contact surface grinding cutting humeri entirely missing holotype radius ulna present poorly preserved straight cylindrical diaphysis radius visible small fraction ulna however enough show bowed typically crocodyliform radiuss proximal extremity wider distal extremity ulnas proximal portion also wide three times thickness diaphysis metacarpals phalanges also preserved showing laterally expanded extremities phalanges femora partially preserved femur quite robust expanded head fourth trochanter forms rugose crest stopping slight torsion diaphysis tibia poorly preserved diaphysis straight cylindrical fibulas diaphysis oval crosssection expands towards flattened distal end proximal end adamantinasuchuss teeth seem quite well adapted omnivorous diet since heterodont welldeveloped molariform teeth might like chimaerasuchus included plants diet insufficient preservation quadrate articular bones tell whether jaw capable backandforth movements necessary chewing plants relative lack wear molariform teeth suggest probably capable dorsoventral biting motions chewing mainly ate softer food plants teeth also wider laterally anteroposteriorly might made backandforth chewing motions difficult impossible therefore probable adamantinasuchus mainly carnivorous scavenger small corpses since incisiform caniniform teeth would useful seizing prey pulling strips flesh carcass molariform teeth could chewed cladogram modified connor et al uruguaysuchus libycosuchus malawisuchus candidodon mariliasuchus pakasuchus adamantinasuchus simosuchus
