carcinoma tonsil type squamous cell carcinoma tonsil common site squamous cell carcinoma oropharynx comprises malignancies tumors frequently present advanced stages around patients present metastasis cervical lymph reported complaints include sore throat otalgia dysphagia patients may complain feeling presence lump throat approximately patients present node neck main risk factors developing carcinoma tonsil include tobacco smoking regular intake high amount alcohol also linked human papilloma virus hpv type risk factors include poor maintenance oral hygiene genetic predisposition leading inclination towards development throat cancer immunocompromised states post solidorgan transplant chronic exposure agents asbestos perchloroethylene certain occupations radiation therapy dietary early lesions usually asymptomatic patients presenting advanced stage disease comprises around important signs include lump neck palpated weight people may also present fatigue symptomcitation needed primary tumor readily discernible signs symptoms grow within tonsillar capsule difficult notice anything suspicious examination tonsil slight enlargement development firmness around area carcinoma may occur one sites deep within tonsillar crypts may accompanied enlargement tonsil affected tonsil grows oropharyngeal space making noticeable patient form neck mass mostly jugulodigastric region tonsils consist rich network lymphatics carcinoma may metastasize neck lymph nodes many cystic extension tumor skull mediastinum occur additional symptoms include painful throat dysphagia otalgia due cranial nerve involvement foreign body sensation bleeding fixation tongue infiltration deep muscles trismus pterygoid muscle involved parapharyngeal spacecitation needed hand tumor may also present deep red white fungating wound growing outwards breaking skin surface central ulceration woundlike ulcer fails heal nonhealing leading bleeding throat pain associated symptomscitation needed biopsy lesion may show three signs gritty texture firmness cystification owing keratinization fibrosis necrosis cervical lymphadenopathy may presentcitation needed smoking alcohol abuse major risk viral causes recently taken consideration one risk factors viruses epsteinbarr virus ebv majorly involved causing nasopharyngeal carcinoma human papilloma virus included category chewing betel nut areca catechu quid directly associated cause oral also stated fda poisonous plant data base us food drug administration unbalanced diet deficit fruits vegetables shown increase risk metastasis regional lymphnodes common tonsil rich supply lymphatics giving way tumor cells metastasis lymph nodes commonly lymph nodes neck cause lymphydenopathy cervical lyphydenopathy ipsilateral patients bilateral fewer carcinoma tonsil usually spreads cervical lymph node levels ii iii iv v retropharyngeal lymph nodescitation needed fourth edition classification head neck tumors subdivides squamous cell carcinoma tonsil two types hpv positive negative hpv positive tumors arise deep lymphoid tissue tonsillar crypts nonkeratinizing hand hpv negative tumors develop tonsillar surface epithelium hence keratinizing metastasis common tonsillar carcinoma largely depends stage cancer route cancer cells metastasize cancer cells may spread adjacent structures lymphatics distant locations body producing secondary tumorscitation needed tumor may spread locally soft palate pillars base tongue pharyngeal wall hypopharynx may invade pterygoid muscles mandible resulting pain trismus parapharyngeal space may also get patients initial cervical node involvement time presentation jugulodigastric lymph nodes first occurrence distant metastasis varies extensively ranging clinical studies factors influencing incidence distant metastasis arecitation needed records male patients tonsillar carcinoma seen veterans administration medical center hines illinois reviewed establish incidence site distant metastasis patients histological diagnosed proven cases tonsillar carcinoma patients autopsied patients reported distant metastasis squamous cell carcinoma common reported cell type cases lymphoepithelioma highest incidence distant common anatomical sites incidence distant metastasis include lung liver bones thorough investigation organs highly recommended treatment well followupscitation needed first step diagnosing tonsil carcinoma obtain accurate history patient physician also examine patient indicative physical signs tests maybe conducted depending progress disease doctor feels need forcitation needed tests include fine needle aspiration blood tests mri xrays pet scan staging tumor mass based tnm staging based tumor mass n staging based extent spread cancer lymph nodes finally stage indicates cancer spread beyond head neck notcitation needed basis deciding stage depends physical examination imaging tumorcitation needed stage decided assessment lymph nodescitation needed based examination entire body finally stage decided concluding results referring following chart treatment tonsil carcinoma includes following early radiosensitive tumors treated radiotherapy along irradiation cervical nodes radiation uses highenergy xrays electron beams radioactive isotopes destroy cancer cellscitation needed induction chemotherapy treatment adapted shrinking tonsil tumor given prior treatments hence term induction therapy completed patient asked rest evaluated period time patient given chemoradiation therapy combination chemotherapy radiation completely destroy tumor radiation chemotherapy unable destroy tumor surgical intervention excision tonsil done early superficial lesions large lesions invade bone require wide surgical excision hemimandibulectomy neck dissection commando surgery may combined pre post operative radiation chemotherapy may given adjunct surgery radiationcitation needed prognosis determined various factors stage human papilloma virus hpv status lymph infiltration cancer cells spread cancer cells beyond lymph node capsule margins tumor extent metastasis many factors unique individual patient may affect chances success treatment factors determining prognosis tonsillar carcinoma tonsillar carcinoma either hpv related hpv unrelated shown cases hpv positive better prognosis hpv negative oropharyngeal cancercitation needed stage cancer presents affects type definitive treatment chance cure recurrence cancer survival rate patient generally patient presents late due lack definitive symptoms early stages disease nearly three fourths patients present stage iii stages oropharyngeal cancer stage carcinoma situ stage indicates good prognosis patients stage survive long period without requirement intensive treatment although patient must cease smoking increase risk developing new cancercitation needed stage ii patients presenting stage receive successful treatment showing good prognosis modes treatment stage include chemotherapy surgery radiation therapy chemoradiation main treatment stage radiation targeting tumor cervical lymph nodes surgical removal tumor lymphadenectomy cervical neck lymph nodes also taken main treatment method instead radiation remaining cancer cells post surgery treated chemoradiationcitation needed stage iii iva stage cancer cells metastasize local tissues cervical lymph nodes treatment used cases chemo radiation remaining cancer cells post chemoradiation surgically removed lymphadenectomy may also done treatment chemoradiation cancer cells infiltrated cervical lymph nodes another method treatment includes first surgical removal tumor well cervical lymph nodes followed chemoradiation radiation decrease chances recurrencecitation needed stage ivb stage cancer already undergone distant metastasis hence showing poor prognosis treatment includes chemotherapy cetuximab radiation may used aid relieving symptoms arising cancer also prevent development complications nearly half patients anterior pillar lesions three fourths patients tonsillar fossa lesions nodal metastasis time presentation metastasis cancer cells cervical lymph nodes diminishes chance cure specially evidence metastasis cancer cells beyond lymph node capsule though data indicates metastasis cancer cells outside lymph node capsule bad prognosis hpvunrelated oropharynx cancer hpvrelated oropharynxcitation needed extension tumor base tongue reduces chances cure drastically also increases chances recurrence spread cancer cells local structures like tissues vessels large nerves lymphatics worsens patients prognosiscitation needed study analyzed survival rate hpvrelated oropharynx carcinoma hpvunrelated oropharynx carcinoma study revealed based hpv status patient stage iii stage iv oropharynx carcinoma discrepancy survival three years survival hpv positive also hpv negative cancerscitation needed httpsenwikipediaorgwikitonsilcarcinoma
