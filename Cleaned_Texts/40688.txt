gas gangrene also known clostridial bacterial infection produces tissue gas gangrene deadly form gangrene usually caused clostridium perfringens bacteria cases gas gangrene reported yearly united myonecrosis condition necrotic damage specific muscle tissue often seen infections c perfringens myriad soilborne anaerobic bacteria bacteria cause myonecrosis specific exotoxins microorganisms opportunistic general enter body significant skin breakage gangrenous infection soilborne bacteria common combat injuries soldiers well century nonsterile field surgery basic nature care severe projectile causes myonecrosis include envenomation snakes genus bothrops family viperidae ischemic necrosis caused vascular blockage eg diabetes type ii tumours block hoard blood supply disseminated intravascular coagulation thromboses gas gangrene cause myonecrosis muscle tissue death gas production sepsis progression toxemia shock often rapid easily noticed large blackened sores form well

gasproducing bacteria symptoms clostridium species produce toxins exhibit higher degrees virulence bacterial clostridium infections usually opportunistic occur individuals serious preexisting medical conditions however clostridium infections also known occur healthy individuals four species clostridium clostridium botulinum clostridium perfringens clostridium tetani clostridium sordelli responsible human infections since clostridium obligate anaerobe taxon bacterium infects hypoxic tissues become anaerobic due restricted blood flow degradation blood vessels atherosclerosis immunocompromised individuals exhibit higher susceptibility infection higher mortality ratescitation needed members clostridium genus exhibit plethora virulence factors common virulence factors associated gas gangrene include alpha toxin theta toxin c perfringens causes infections produces toxinscitation needed c perfringens alpha toxin widely associated gas gangrene main virulence factor whilst invading host alpha toxin associated hemolysis thus restricting blood flow towards area infection surrounding circulatory system collapses neutrophils monocytes eosinophils basophils reach target areas infection hemolytic activity alpha toxin produces anaerobic environment essential proliferation bacteria alpha toxin also exhibits ability infiltrate surrounding cellular tissue cause cascade aberrant biochemical activitycitation needed theta toxin also employed c perfringens virulence factor theta toxin also promotes vascular degradation counterpart alpha toxin plateletactivation factor employed triggers acute inflammatory response nearby inflammatory response leads constriction surrounding arteries promotes anaerobic environment c perfringens growth pathophysiologycitation

layers skin unlike anaerobic infections discharge infections often purulent filled pus instead discharge often described sweetly putrid dishwater pus much thinner normal pus due lysis neutrophils type white blood cell caused lecithinases toxins released clostridium soilborne anaerobes particularly welladapted surviving harsh conditions often scarcity nutrition competition resources numerous species

easytooverlook diagnosis bacterial infections mostly exhibit symptoms early diagnosis gas gangrene rarely occurs ambiguous symptoms contribute poorer prognosis diagnostic methods treatment usually debridement excision amputation necessary many cases watersoluble antibiotics penicillin alone effective penetrate ischaemic muscles sufficiently effective penicillin effective c perfringens gas gangrene occurs regions abdominal cavity patient treated hyperbaric chamber contains pressurized oxygenrich atmosphere oxygen saturates infected tissues thereby prevents growth obligately anaerobic
