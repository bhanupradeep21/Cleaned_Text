nuclear receptors transcription factors induce transcription target genes binding specific dna sequences promoter two isoforms erα erβ er mediates biological effects level gene regulation interacting sitespecific dna coregulatory proteins classical mechanism activation ers depends ligand binding nuclear hormone receptors receptors dimerize bind estrogen response elements eres located promoters estrogenresponsive nevertheless basic scientific research shows estrogens xenoestrogens may also exert actions nonnuclear steroid hormone receptors eg membrane ers nonsteroid receptors eg neurotransmitter receptors serotonin receptor dopamine receptor norepinephrine receptor orphan receptors eg aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr enzymatic pathways involved steroid biosynthesis andor metabolism numerous mechanisms converge upon endocrine reproductive several reports suggest xenoestrogens clinically significant mimic effects endogenous estrogen directly indirectly implicated

qualitatively compared exposure estrogens xenoestrogens may also easily assessed fish reptiles birds measuring vitellogenin vtg plasma levels example expression egg yolk precursor protein vitellogenin measured escreen test juvenile brown trout usually vitellogenin produced female fish estrogendependent nevertheless synthesis protein males young fish also occur xenoestrogens also affect hepatic receptors activate hence frequently used biomarker exposure estrogen active substances environment measurement vitellogenin levels male juvenile several stable cell lines possible induce specific estrogenrelated proteins example human breast cancer cell line protein strongly upregulated estrogen induction protein detected already one hour estrogen given compound acting estrogen added cells possible generate estrogenresponsive reporter cell line introducing situable cell line specific dna sequences induce transcription target genes readily measurable protein socalled reporter gene eg firefly luciferase vitro reporter gene assays detecting estrogen receptor er activation bioassays form group socalled calux chemically activated luciferase expression bioassays systems exemplified
