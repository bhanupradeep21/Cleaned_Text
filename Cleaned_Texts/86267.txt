evolutionary biology inclusive fitness one two metrics evolutionary success defined w hamilton individuals child carries one half individuals genes defined one offspring equivalent siblings child carry onequarter individuals genes offspring equivalent similarly cousins child individuals genes offspring equivalent genes point view evolutionary success ultimately depends leaving behind maximum number copies population prior hamiltons work generally assumed genes achieved number viable offspring produced individual organism occupied however overlooked wider consideration genes success clearly case social insects vast majority individuals produce offspring hamilton showed mathematically members population may share ones genes gene also increase evolutionary success indirectly promoting reproduction survival individuals also carry gene variously called kin theory kin selection theory inclusive fitness theory obvious category individuals close genetic relatives concerned application inclusive fitness theory often straightforwardly treated via narrower kin selection theory hamiltons theory alongside reciprocal altruism considered one two primary mechanisms evolution social behaviors natural species major contribution field sociobiology holds behaviors dictated genes therefore passed future generations may selected organism evolves although described seemingly anthropomorphic terms ideas apply living things describe evolution innate learned behaviors wide range species including insects small mammals humans beldings ground squirrel provides example ground squirrel gives alarm call warn local group presence predator emitting alarm gives location away putting danger process however squirrel may protect relatives within local group along rest group therefore effect trait influencing alarm call typically protects squirrels immediate area lead passing copies alarm call trait next generation squirrel could leave reproducing case natural selection increase trait influences giving alarm call provided sufficient fraction shared genes include genes predisposing alarm synalpheus regalis eusocial shrimp also example organism whose social traits meet inclusive fitness criterion larger defenders protect young juveniles colony outsiders ensuring youngs survival genes continue passed future inclusive fitness generalized strict kin selection requires shared genes identical descent inclusive fitness limited cases kin close genetic relatives involved context sociobiology hamilton proposed inclusive fitness offers mechanism evolution altruism claimed leads natural selection favor organisms behave ways correlate maximizing inclusive fitness gene gene complex promoting altruistic behavior copies others helping others survive ensures genes passed hamiltons rule describes mathematically whether gene altruistic behavior spread population gardner et al suggest hamiltons rule applied multilocus models done point interpreting theory rather starting point suggest one use standard population genetics game theory methodologies derive condition social trait interest favored selection use hamiltons rule aid conceptualizing result concept serves explain natural selection perpetuate altruism altruism gene complex genes influences organisms behavior helpful protective relatives offspring behavior also increases proportion altruism gene population relatives likely share genes altruist due common descent formal terms complex genes arises hamiltons rule rbc specifies selective criteria terms cost benefit relatedness trait increase frequency population hamilton noted inclusive fitness theory predict species necessarily evolve altruistic behaviors since opportunity context interaction individuals primary necessary requirement order social interaction occur first place hamilton put altruistic selfish acts possible suitable social object available sense behaviours conditional start hamilton words whilst inclusive fitness theory specifies set necessary criteria evolution altruistic traits specify sufficient condition evolution given species primary necessary criteria include existence gene complexes altruistic traits gene pool mentioned especially suitable social object available hamilton noted paul sherman contributed much research ground squirrels mentioned gives fuller discussion hamiltons latter point understand species pattern nepotism two questions individuals behavior must considered reproductively ideal socially possible formulation inclusive fitness hamilton suggested mathematical way answering suggest answer depends demography particularly spatial component dispersal temporal component mortality ecological circumstances affecting demography consistently make socially possible nepotism elaborated according reproductively ideal example dispersing advantageous usually separates relatives permanently many birds nice gross robertson rare occasions nestmates kin live proximity preferentially cooperate similarly nepotism elaborated among relatives infrequently coexisted populations species evolutionary history animals life history characteristics stearns warner volume usually preclude existence certain relatives kin usually unavailable rare coexistence kin occasion preferential treatment example reproductives generally die soon zygotes formed many temperate zone insects unusual individual survives interact offspring expected behave parentally sherman underlining occurrence sibling cannibalism several underlines point inclusive fitness theory understood simply predict genetically related individuals inevitably recognize engage positive social behaviors towards genetic relatives species appropriate traits gene pool individuals typically interacted genetic relatives natural conditions evolutionary history social behavior potentially elaborated consideration evolutionarily typical demographic composition grouping contexts species thus first step understanding selection pressures upon inclusive fitness shaped forms social behavior dawkins gives simplified illustration families genetic relatives happen go around groups fact provides useful rule thumb kin selection care individual often see dawkins evidence variety including social suggests contextual cues familiarity often significant proximate mechanisms mediating expression altruistic behavior regardless whether participants always fact genetic relatives nevertheless evolutionarily stable since selection pressure acts typical conditions rare occasions actual genetic relatedness differs normally encountered see sherman inclusive fitness theory thus imply organisms evolve direct altruism towards genetic relatives many popular treatments however promote interpretation illustrated recent review many misunderstandings persist many cases result conflating coefficient relatedness proportion shared genes short step intuitively animals tend altruistic toward share lot genes misunderstandings dont crop occasionally repeated many writings including undergraduate psychology field social psychology within sections describing evolutionary approaches altruism park misunderstandings inclusive fitness implications study altruism even amongst professional biologists utilizing theory widespread prompting prominent theorists regularly attempt highlight clarify one recent example attempted clarification west et al original papers inclusive fitness theory hamilton pointed sufficiently high relatedness favour altruistic behaviours could accrue two discrimination limited dispersal hamilton huge theoretical literature possible role limited dispersal reviewed platt bever west et al well experimental evolution tests models diggle et al griffin et al k√ºmmerli et al however despite still sometimes claimed kin selection requires kin discrimination oates wilson silk furthermore large number authors appear implicitly explicitly assumed kin discrimination mechanism altruistic behaviours directed towards relatives huge industry papers reinventing limited dispersal explanation cooperation mistakes areas seem stem incorrect assumption kin selection indirect fitness benefits require kin discrimination misconception despite fact hamilton pointed potential role limited dispersal earliest papers inclusive fitness theory hamilton hamilton hamilton

chapter extended must distinguished greenbeard effect greenbeard effect act gene several closely linked genes greenbeard effect originally thought experiment hamilton publications inclusive fitness although hadnt yet observed today observed species rarity probably due susceptibility cheating whereby individuals gain trait confers advantage without altruistic behavior normally would occur via
