difficulty defining measuring intelligence nonhuman animals makes subject difficult study scientifically birds general birds relatively large brains compared head size visual auditory senses well developed species though tactile olfactory senses well realized groups birds communicate using visual signals well use calls song testing intelligence birds therefore usually based studying responses sensory stimuli corvids ravens crows jays magpies etc psittacines parrots macaws cockatoos often considered intelligent birds among intelligent animals general pigeons finches domestic fowl birds prey also common subjects intelligence studies bird intelligence studied several attributes abilities many studies birds quail domestic fowl pigeons kept captive conditions however noted field studies limited unlike apes birds crow family corvids well parrots psittacines shown live socially long developmental periods possess large forebrains hypothesized allow greater cognitive counting traditionally considered ability shows intelligence anecdotal evidence suggested crows count researchers need cautious however ensure birds merely demonstrating ability subitize count small number

suggest associative learning negatively correlated reversal words birds learned first association quickly slower learn new association upon reversal authors conclude must tradeoff learning association adapting new bebus et al also showed reversal learning correlated neophobia birds afraid novel environment previously set researchers faster reversal inverse correlation less neophobic birds performed better associative learning task measured statistically significant opposite results found guido et showed neophobia milvago chimango bird prey native south america negatively correlated reversal words neophobic birds slower reversal learning researchers suggested modern explanation discrepancy since birds living near urban areas benefit less neophobic feed human resources detritus also benefit flexible learners since human activity fluctuates perhaps low neophobia coevolved high reversal learning therefore personality alone might insufficient predict associative learning due contextual differences bebus et al found correlation baseline hormone levels associative learning according study low baseline levels corticosterone cort hormone involved stress response predicted better associative contrast high baseline levels cort predicted better reversal summary bebus et al found low neophobia statistically significant low baseline cort levels predicted better associative learning abilities inversely high neophobia high baseline cort levels predicted better reversal learning addition reversal learning personality hormone levels research suggests diet may also correlate associative learning performance bonaparte et al demonstrated highprotein diets zebra finches correlated better associative researchers showed highdiet treatment associated larger head width tarsus length body mass treated subsequent testing researchers showed highdiet larger headtotarsus ratio correlated better performance associative learning researchers used associative learning correlate cognition support nutritional stress development negatively impact cognitive development turn may reduce reproductive one way poor diet may affect reproductive success song learning according developmental stress hypothesis zebra finches learn songs stressful period development ability learn complex songs reflects adequate contradicting results kriengwatana et found low food diet zebra finches prior nutritional independence birds able feed enhanced spatial associative learning impaired memory effect neophobia also failed find correlation physiological growth associative though bonaparte et al focused protein content whereas kriengwatana et al focused quantity food results seem contradictory research conducted clarify relationship diet associative learning associative

show memory following associative learning opposed learning vary ecological lifestyle associative learning correlates age australian magpies according mirville et study researchers initially wanted study effect group size learning however found group size correlated likelihood interaction task associative learning instead found age played role performance adults successful completing associative learning task less likely approach task initially inversely juveniles less successful completing task likely approach therefore adults larger groups likely individuals complete task due increased likelihood approach succeed though may seem universally beneficial fast learner madden et al suggested weight individuals affected whether associative learning researchers studied common pheasants showed heavy birds performed well associative tasks increased probability survival four months old released wild whereas light birds performed well associative tasks less likely researchers provide two explanations effect weight results perhaps larger individuals dominant benefit novel resources smaller individuals simply higher survival rate compared smaller individuals due bigger food reserves difficulty predators kill increased motility alternatively ecological pressures may affect smaller individuals differently associative learning might costly smaller individuals thus reducing fitness leading maladaptive additionally madden et al found slow reversal learning groups correlated low survival researchers suggested tradeoff hypothesis cost reversal learning would inhibit development cognitive abilities according bebus et al negative correlation associative learning reversal perhaps low reversal learning correlates better survival due enhanced associative learning madden et al also suggested hypothesis note skepticism since could show negative correlation associative reversal learning found bebus et al research veit et al show associative learning modified ncl nidopallium
