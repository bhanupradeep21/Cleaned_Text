restenosis recurrence stenosis narrowing blood vessel leading restricted blood flow restenosis usually pertains artery large blood vessel become narrowed received treatment clear blockage subsequently become renarrowed usually restenosis artery blood vessel possibly vessel within organ restenosis common adverse event endovascular procedures procedures frequently used treat vascular damage atherosclerosis related narrowing renarrowing restenosis blood vessels include vascular surgery cardiac surgery stent used restenosis occurs called instent restenosis occurs following balloon angioplasty called postangioplasty restenosis pars diagnostic threshold restenosis isr pars restenosis occurs procedure followup imaging way initially detect compromised blood flow symptoms may also suggest signal restenosis confirmed imaging instance coronary stent patient develops restenosis may experience recurrent chest pain angina minor major heart attack myocardial infarction though may report important patient comply followup screenings clinician follows thorough clinical assessment also important note cases restenosis lead clinical symptoms surgery widen unblock blood vessel usually longlasting beneficial effect patient however cases procedure cause narrowing vessel restenosis angioplasty also called percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ptca commonly used treat blockages coronary peripheral arteries limbs balloon inserted narrowing smashes cholesterol plaques atherosclerosis artery walls thus widening size lumen increasing blood flow however action damages artery walls respond using physiological mechanisms repair damage see physiology stent mesh tubelike structure often used conjunction angioplasty permanently hold open artery allowing unrestricted blood flow support weakness artery wall called aneurysm artery react stent perceive foreign body respond mounting immune system response leads narrowing near inside stentcitation needed damage blood vessel wall angioplasty triggers physiological response divided two stages first stage occurs immediately tissue trauma thrombosis blood clot forms site damage hinders blood flow accompanied inflammatory immune responsecitation needed second stage tends occur months surgery result proliferation cells media smooth muscle wall vessel also known neointimal hyperplasia vessel restenosis typically detected angiography also detected duplex ultrasound imaging late loss synonymous restenosis literally means loss lumen procedure intended open vessel measures either percent relative absolute change minimum luminal diameter mld months following vascular procedure implantation stentgraft late loss one metric useful determining effectiveness vascular interventions clinical trials either individual patient group patientscitation needed late loss part terminology describing outcomes vascular interventions instance implantation stentgraft first provide acute gain lumen diameter words immediate gain lumen size implanted stent opens vessel however time bodys inflammatory immune response described causes section reacts stentgraft via smooth muscle proliferation etc literally pushes stentgraft back narrowing vessel losing least percentage previously gained late losscitation needed net gain lumen diameter difference acute gain late loss measure stentgraft percent diameter restenosis percent diameter stenosis measure observed individual patients typically calculated difference minimal minimum luminal diameter mld target reference vessel diameter rvd divided rvd multiplied get percentage stenosis important measure needed calculate binary restenosis see binary restenosis section rvd typically calculated averaging mld healthy part vessel proximal distal vessel controversy accuracy observing lesion mld since many atherosclerotic lesions may create uneven hills valleys within lumen making true mld difficult obtain estimate research indicates calculating area stenosis also valid measure actual vessel stenosis compared diameter stenosis alone requires additional analysis tracing lumen border must performed however computer programs available automatically perform function may helpful obtain percent diameter area percent stenosis especially since two percentages may always correlate occlusion blocking blood flow vessel considered percent diameter stenosis binary restenosis traditionally defined reduction percent diameter stenosis also known binary term binary means patients placed groups stenosis stenosis binary restenosis epidemiological method analyzing percent diameter stenosis observing individual patient also performing statistical techniques group patients determine averages descriptive measures central tendency predictive variablecitation needed first stage restenosis administering antiplatelet drugs called iibiiia inhibitors immediately surgery greatly reduces chance thrombosis occurringcitation needed drugeluting stents coated pharmaceuticals inhibit tissue growth thus reduce risk restenosis scartissue cell proliferation widely stents reduce occurrence restenosis clinical studies showing incidence rate restenosis occurs without stent usually treated angioplastycitation needed treatment also used restenosis occurs either proximal distal end stentcitation needed restenosis occurs within stent also known instent stenosis may treated repeated angioplasty insertion another stent inside original often drugeluting past years isr increasingly treated drugcoated balloon dcb balloon coated anticancer drugs prevent restenosis balloon avoids need double layer metal used instent restenosis treated another stent within original stent additionally dcb treatment leave implant body designed faster drug delivery alternative treatments include brachytherapy intracoronary radiation radiation kills cells inhibits tissue growth similar patient undergoing cancer rates restenosis differ devices eg stentgrafts balloon angioplasty etc location procedure ie centrally located heart coronary artery peripheral vessels popliteal artery leg pudendal artery pelvis carotid artery neckcitation needed cardiac procedures balloon angioplasty without stent implantation associated high incidence restenosis rates ranging majority patients need angioplasty within study india comparing coronary
