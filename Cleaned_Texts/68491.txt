zoological field ethology dominance hierarchy formerly colloquially called pecking order type social hierarchy arises members animal social groups interact creating ranking system dominant higherranking individual sometimes called alpha submissive lowerranking individual called beta different types interactions result dominance depending species including ritualized displays aggression direct physical source needed social living groups members likely compete access limited resources mating opportunities rather fighting time meet individuals sex establish relative rank higherranking individuals often gaining access resources mates based repetitive interactions social order created subject change time dominant animal challenged subordinate one dominance individuals preferential access resources another based coercive capacity based strength threat intimidation compared prestige persuasive capacity based skills abilities dominant animal one whose sexual feeding aggressive behaviour patterns subsequently occur relatively little influence group subordinate animals opposite behaviour submissive relatively easily influenced inhibited group many animal societies individuals position dominance hierarchy corresponds opportunities hierarchically social animals dominant individuals may exert control others example herd feral goats large male dominant maintains discipline coherence flock leads group shares leadership foraging expedition mature shegoat normally outlast succession dominant however earlier work showed leadership orders goats related age sheep position moving flock highly correlated social dominance definite study show consistent voluntary leadership birds dominant individuals preferentially select higher perches put best position detect avoid predators well display dominance members suggested decisiontaking actions group commonly dissociated social given benefits costs possessing high rank within hierarchical group certain characteristics individuals groups environments determine whether individual benefit high rank include whether high rank gives access valuable resources mates food age intelligence experience physical fitness influence whether individual deems worthwhile pursue higher ranking hierarchy often comes expense conflict hierarchy results interactions group dynamics sharing resources group size composition affect dominance decisions highranking individuals example large group many males may difficult highestranking male dominate mating opportunities mate sharing likely exist opportunities available subordinates reduce likelihood challenge dominant male mating longer allornothing game sharing enough placate subordinates another aspect determine dominance hierarchies environment populations kenyan vervet monkeys highranking females higher foraging success food resources clumped food distributed throughout area lose advantage subordinate females acquire food less risk encountering dominant benefit highranking individuals increased foraging success access food resources times water shortage highestranking vervet females greater access subordinates females water tree holes chacma baboons highranking males first access vertebrate prey caught group yellow baboons dominant males feed longer without many bird species dominant individuals higher rates food intake species include darkeyed juncos oystercatchers dominant individuals groups fill first fill quickly spend less time foraging reduces risk predation thus increased survival increased nutrition decreased primates wellstudied group high rank brings reproductive success seen metaanalysis study determined higher status increased reproductive success amongst men vary type subsistence foraging horticulture pastoralism agriculture contradicts egalitarian hypothesis predicts status would affect reproductive success amongst foragers amongst highranking bonnet macaque males access fertile females consequently partake matings within group one population three males responsible matings population males often vary rank rank improves gain exclusive time fertile females rank decreases get less many primates including bonnet macaques rhesus monkeys offspring highranking individuals better fitness thus increased rate survival likely function two factors first highranking males mate highranking females assuming high rank correlated higher fitness fighting ability trait conferred offspring second factor higherranking parents probably provide better protection offspring thus ensure higher survival amongst rhesus macaques higherranking males sired offspring though alpha male never one sire offspring instead highranking top male complex relationship rank reproduction species likely explained fact rhesus macaques queue rather fight dominance meaning alpha male necessarily strongest attractive rodents highestranking male frequently sires offspring pattern found carnivores dwarf mongoose dwarf mongoose lives social system one dominant pair dominant female produces almost offspring living group dominant male first access oestrus period red deer males experienced winter dominance resulting greater access preferred foraging sites higher ability get maintain larger harems mating many monogamous bird species dominant pairs tend get best territories turn promote offspring survival adult health dunnocks species bird experiences many mating systems sometimes individuals form group one dominant male achieves mating monogynous bee species melipona subnitida queen seeks maintain reproductive success preventing workers caring cells pushing hitting using antennae workers display aggression towards males claiming priority cells males try use place costs high rank hierarchical group offset benefits common costs highranking individuals higher metabolic rates higher levels stress great tits pied flycatchers highranking individuals experience higher resting metabolic rates therefore need consume food order maintain fitness activity levels subordinates groups energetic costs defending territory mates resources consuming cause highranking individuals spend time activities lose body mass long periods dominance therefore physical condition decreases longer spend partaking highenergy activities lose rank function wild male baboons highestranking male also known alpha experiences high levels testosterone glucocorticoid indicates highranking males undergo higher levels stress reduces fitness reduced health longevity occurs two hormones immunosuppressant activity reduces survival presents opportunities parasitic infestation health risks reduced fitness due alpha position results individuals maintaining high rank shorter periods time overall reduced health longevity physical strain costs interpersonal complementarity hypothesis suggests obedience authority reciprocal complementary processes predicts one group members behaviours elicit predictable set actions group members friendly behaviours predicted met friendly behaviours hostile behaviours predicted reciprocated similar hostile behaviours individual acts dominant authoritative manner group behaviour tends prompt submissive responses group members similarly group members display submissive behaviour others feel inclined display dominant behaviours return tiedens fragale found hierarchical differentiation plays significant role liking behaviour groups individuals prefer interact group members whose power status behaviour complements say group members behave submissively talking someone appears control better liked similarly individuals display dominant behaviours eg taking charge issuing orders liked interacting docile subservient subordinate offers number benefits subordination beneficial agonistic conflicts rank predicts outcome fight less injury occur subordinate individuals avoid fighting higherranking individuals would win large percentage time knowledge pecking order keeps parties incurring

baboons high levels testosterone stress long period time lead decreased fitness lowestranking males also high stress levels suggesting beta males gain fitness avoiding stress receiving benefits moderate mating tactics savanna baboons correlated age older subordinate males form alliances combat higherranking males get access fighting dominant males risky behavior may result defeat injury even death bighorn sheep however subordinates occasionally win fight female father lambs born population sheep live large flocks dominance hierarchies often restructured breeding burying beetles social

topranking alpha females observed produce subordinate animals engage number behaviors order outweigh costs low rank dispersal often associated increased mortality subordination may decrease potential benefits leaving group red fox shown subordinate individuals given opportunity desert often due risk death low possibility would establish dominant members new animal decisions regarding involvement conflict defined interplay costs benefits agonistic behaviors initially developed game theory study optimal strategies pairwise conflict grounded false assumption animals engaged conflict equal fighting ability modifications however provided increased focus differences fighting capabilities animals raised questions evolutionary development differences believed determine outcomes fights intensity animal decisions submit continue fighting influence aggression threats fighting strategies individuals engaged conflict proven integral establishing social hierarchies reflective dominantsubordinate asymmetries individuals categorized three types expected individual emerges triumphant rewarded dominant status demonstrated physical superiority however costs incurred defeated

female queen ability suppress critically important reproductive hormones male female subdominants subdominant males appears luteinizing hormone testosterone suppressed females appears suppression involves entire suppression ovarian cycle suppression reduces sexual virility behavior thus redirects subdominants behavior helping queen though mechanisms accomplished debated former research suggests primer pheromones secreted queen cause direct suppression vital reproductive hormones functions however current evidence suggests secretion pheromones act suppress reproductive function rather queens extremely high levels circulating testosterone cause exert intense dominance aggressiveness colony thus scare molerats research shown removal queen colony allows reestablishment

bedding subdominants reproductive function continue suppressed instead however found subdominants quickly regained reproductive function even presence queens bedding thus concluded primer pheromones seem play role suppressing reproductive glucocorticoids signaling molecules stimulate fight flight response may implicated dominance hierarchies higher ranking individuals tend much higher levels circulating glucocorticoids subdominant opposite two core hypotheses attempt explain first suggests higher ranking individuals exert energy thus need higher levels glucocorticoids mobilize glycogen energy supported fact food availability low cortisol levels increase within dominant second suggests elevated stress hormones result social factors particularly hierarchy transition perhaps resulting
