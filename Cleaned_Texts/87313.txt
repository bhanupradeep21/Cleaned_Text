thoracic diaphragm simply diaphragm ancient greek διάφραγμα romanized diáphragma lit partition sheet internal skeletal humans mammals extends across bottom thoracic cavity diaphragm important muscle separates thoracic cavity containing heart lungs abdominal cavity diaphragm contracts volume thoracic cavity increases creating negative pressure draws air high oxygen consumption noted many mitochondria capillaries present skeletal term diaphragm anatomy created gerard refer flat structures urogenital diaphragm pelvic diaphragm diaphragm generally refers thoracic diaphragm humans diaphragm slightly right half higher superior left half since large liver rests beneath right half diaphragm also speculation diaphragm lower side due hearts presence mammals diaphragms vertebrates

smaller inferior vena cava passes caval opening quadrilateral opening junction right middle leaflets central tendon margins tendinous surrounded tendons opening stretched open every time inspiration occurs however argument caval opening actually constricts inspiration since thoracic pressure decreases upon inspiration draws caval blood upwards toward right atrium increasing size opening allows blood return heart maximizing efficacy lowered thoracic pressure returning blood heart aorta pierce diaphragm rather passes behind left right cruscitation needed several structures pierce diaphragm including left phrenic nerve pierces central tendon greater lesser least thoracic splanchnic nerves pierces bilateral crura lymphatic vessels pierce throughout diaphragam especially behind diaphragm primarily innervated phrenic nerve formed cervical nerves central portion diaphragm sends sensory afferents via phrenic nerve peripheral portions diaphragm send sensory afferents via intercostal subcostal nerves needed arteries veins diaphragm supply drain blood diaphragm receives blood branches internal thoracic arteries namely pericardiacophrenic artery musculophrenic artery superior phrenic arteries arise directly thoracic aorta lower internal intercostal arteries inferior phrenic arteries supply diaphragm drains blood brachiocephalic veins azygos veins veins drain inferior vena

descends inferiorly phrenic nerve follows accounting circuitous route upper cervical vertebrae around pericardium finally innervate diaphragm diaphragm main muscle respiration functions breathing inhalation diaphragm contracts moves inferior direction enlarging volume thoracic cavity reducing intrathoracic pressure external intercostal muscles also participate enlargement forcing lungs expand words diaphragms movement downwards creates partial vacuum thoracic cavity forces lungs expand fill void drawing air process cavity expansion happens two extremes along intermediary forms lower ribs stabilized central tendon diaphragm mobile contraction brings insertion central tendon towards origins pushes lower cavity towards pelvis allowing thoracic cavity expand downward often called belly breathing central tendon stabilized lower ribs mobile contraction lifts origins ribs towards insertion central tendon works conjunction muscles allow ribs slide thoracic cavity expand laterally upwards diaphragm relaxes moves superior direction air exhaled elastic recoil process lung tissues lining thoracic cavity assisting function muscular effort called forced exhalation involves internal intercostal muscles used conjunction abdominal muscles act antagonist paired diaphragms contraction diaphragm dysfunction wellknown factor associated various complications patients prolonged respiratory failure difficulties weaning mechanical ventilation extended hospitalization increased morbidity studies reported thin diaphragm leads greater lung compliance contribute respiratory

adopts lower position within bodys core addition primary role breathing diaphragm also plays secondary role strengthening posture core especially evident deep breathing generally lower position increases intraabdominal pressure serves strengthen lumbar source needed key real core stabilization maintain increased iap going normal breathing cycles diaphragm performs breathing function lower position facilitate higher better source needed therefore persons diaphragm position lower general deep breathing assists strengthening core period aid strength training forms athletic endeavour reason taking deep breath adopting deeper breathing pattern typically recommended lifting heavy weights existence membrane separating pharynx stomach traced widely among chordates thus model organism
