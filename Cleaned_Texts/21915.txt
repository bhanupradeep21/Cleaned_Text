decreased dna methylation plant gene encodes nucleosome remodeler facilitates dna methylation gene described extensively arabidopsis thaliana also maize protein described similar chromatin remodeling since dna methylation occurs mostly transposable elements thought crucial function silencing tes required dna methylation highly heterochromatin transposable therefore often silences transposable elements mutation arabidopsis thaliana embryo mutants also described epigenetic link salicylic acid production thaliana single copy gene explored maize unlike thaliana maize two copies gene maize double mutant embryo lethal however studies using heterozygote mutant maize genome function quite important httpsenwikipediaorgwikidecreaseindnamethylationi
