milkalkali syndrome mas also referred calciumalkali syndrome third common cause milkalkali syndrome characterized elevated blood calcium levels metabolic alkalosis acute kidney milkalkali syndrome caused excessive intake calcium absorbable alkali sources calcium alkali include dietary supplements taken prevention osteoporosis hyperparathyroidism antacids taken peptic ulcer common acute symptoms milkalkali syndrome include nausea vomiting dry mouth confusion lethargy distaste left untreated milkalkali syndrome may lead kidney failure even signs symptoms milkalkali syndrome develop days several months following initial ingestion absorbable calcium however severity signs symptoms milkalkali syndrome largely dependent upon duration quantity calcium alkali acute milkalkali syndrome characterized several biochemical alterations mainly alkalosis hypochloremia hypokalemia acute phase milkalkali syndrome cope syndrome first symptoms toxicity nausea vomiting anorexia headache dizziness vertigo apathy weakness confusion irritability dry mouth repulsion individuals chronic milkalkali syndrome burnett syndrome symptoms may include muscle aches psychosis tremor polyuria producing large volumes dilute urine polydipsia intense thirst pruritus itchy sensation skin band keratopathy abnormal calcifications abnormal calcium deposits often collect metastatically body including throughout periarticular tissue subcutaneous tissue central nervous system liver kidneys adrenal bones ingestion calcium alkali continued neurologic symptoms memory loss personality changes lethargy stupor coma persistently develop time result extreme hypercalcemia electrolyte people milkalkali syndrome commonly show signs renal dysfunction hallmark symptom milkalkali syndrome early stages disease several lab test results elevated blood urea nitrogen bun elevated creatinine illustrative azotemia kidney histologically kidneys individuals milkalkali syndrome shown complete glomerulus hyalinization thickening bowmans capsule tubular atrophy vascular changes diffuse lymphocytic laboratory tests measuring serum bicarbonate ph vitamin parathyroid hormone pth show signs milkalkali syndrome specifically bicarbonate ph would elevated vitamin pth would milkalkali syndrome caused ingesting excessive amounts calcium usually form dietary supplements calcium carbonate commonly taken prevent treat osteoporosis absorbable alkali found antacid presently consumption extensively large amounts calcium carbonate replaced overingestion milk products milk bicarbonate prominent cause mas excessive consumption calcium generally means taking g calcium carbonate every attributed greater availability overthecounter calcium carbonate supplements treat osteoporosis dyspepsia well growing awareness among consumers potential health benefits calcium calcium carbonate also often prescribed people chronic kidney disease prevention secondary hyperparathyroidism people receiving prolonged corticosteroid therapy may lead bone loss putting higher risk calcium overconsumption developing drugs reported associated development mas include thiazide diuretics cause increased reabsorption calcium kidneys resulting hypovolemia lead contraction angiotensinconverting enzyme ace inhibitors nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids also drugs associated mas decrease glomerular filtration rate gfr thus reduce calcium taking medications aluminum hydroxide magnesium hydroxide absorbable alkali also contribute mas already consume large amount pregnant individuals increased risk developing mas due hyperemesis cause hypovolemia enhanced gastrointestinal calcium absorption result higher levels prolactin placental lactose signaling resulting calcium carbonate also commonly used pregnant individuals treat acid reflux putting risk overconsumption calcium developing mechanism milkalkali syndrome develops ingesting much calcium absorbable alkali still unclear however well known mas usually associated triad symptoms include hypercalcemia alkalosis acute kidney general milkalkali syndrome starts excess calcium levels body hypercalcemia causes bodys ph increase become alkaline resulting metabolic alkalosis ultimately contributes decrease renal factors involved development hypercalcemia include excess intestinal absorption calcium saturation bones buffering capacity calcium decreased renal excretion abnormal vitamin underlying kidney disease risk factor mas even people healthy kidneys develop healthy individual calcium levels high kidneys decrease production calcitriol active vitamin reducing hydroxylation calcidiol inactive vitamin lower calcitriol levels means lower rate calcium absorption small intestine eventually offsets elevated calcium however excessive ingestion calcium g per day reported cause calcium levels high renal calcitriol suppression control resulting net calcium absorption ultimately causes hypercalcemia affects kidneys multiple ways altogether contributes prolonged hypercalcemia decrease glomerular filtration rate gfr via vasoconstriction reduce creatinine clearance eventually cause renal hypercalcemia also causes natriuresis blocking nakcl cotransporter nkcc medullary thick ascending limb loop henle leading increased sodium excretion followed water excretion leads additionally hypercalcemia decrease reabsorption water kidneys collecting ducts suppressing antidiuretic hormone adh receptors contributing hypercalcemia also results lower parathyroid hormone pth levels via negative feedback loop calciumsensing receptors pth gland activated elevated calcium levels inhibit pth production thus decreasing renal reabsorption hypovolemia leads metabolic alkalosis increase blood ph stimulating bicarbonate reabsorption order maintain extracellular summary symptoms alkalosis net result overconsumption absorbable alkali hypercalcemiainduced hypovolemia impaired glomerular filtration alkalosis turn increases calciumreabsorption distal tubules nephron thus exacerbating hypercalcemia altogether result cycle hypercalcemia alkalosis renal injury characteristic prior official diagnosis milkalkali syndrome causes hypercalcemia must ruled causes hypercalcemia include elevated vitamin levels hyperthyroidism hyperparathyroidism physical symptoms vertigo confusion apathy nausea vomiting anorexia tremors psychosis myalgia polyuria abnormal calcifications renal calcifications pruitus could observed people lab work lab work must done diagnose milkalkali syndrome lab workup includes serum calcium levels parathyroid hormone pth phosphorus creatinine blood urea nitrogen bun magnesium vitamin levels primary hyperparathyroidism diagnosis made looking past medical history laboratory studiescitation needed electrocardiograms ecg ecg also used diagnose mas following findings related hypercalcemia could appear radiology chest xrays help exclude malignancy sarcoidosis evaluating increasing education people clinicians surrounding milkalkali syndrome help prevent recent years people become aware benefits calcium access leading consequential rise cases milkalkali syndrome crucial people educated healthcare providers hypercalcemia develop hallmark symptoms monitor often unknown person calcium come many different dietary sources addition self unfortunately lead intake amounts calcium exceeds recommended doses causing harmful particularly persons degree renal disease supplementation calcium easily result deadly hypercalcemia generally daily intake less grams calcium considered prior starting calcium supplementation recommended discuss individualized calcium requirements person person begins calcium supplementation regimen educated common signs symptoms hypercalcemia milkalkali syndrome well reverse syndrome discontinuing offending agent seeking medical mild cases mas intervention needed withdraw offending agent person stop taking calcium supplements alkali agents taking rapidly corrects hypercalcemia alkalosis severe cases hospitalization may required manage syndrome withholding calcium initiating iv fluids saline correct initial rate infusion generally around mlh people experiencing edema adjusted maintain urine output mlh however rate variable depending individuals age renal status comorbidities severity furosemide used treat hypercalcemia induces caliuresis excreting calcium urine standard practice adequate rehydration electrolyte monitoring used avoid alkalosis renal kidney failure advanced treatment required namely chronic calcimimetic agents may necessary eg cinacalcetcitation needed mild cases milkalkali syndrome full recovery expected reduction renal function reversible however severe cases chronic permanent kidney failure death may long term consumption large amounts calcium supplementation associated milkalkali syndrome also linked adverse cardiovascular outcomes found supplementation calcium lead increased risk myocardial infarction vascular early years discovery milkalkali syndrome prevalence disease among people treated sippys treatment varied wide range attributed differing amounts alkali absorbed among people mortality rate people milkalkali syndrome found use milk alkali treat gastric ulcers greatly contributed development milkalkali syndrome people incidence milkalkali syndrome greatly diminished true cause gastric ulcers identified drugs antacids developed treat heartburn acidreducing drugs like antagonists proton pump new drugs replaced sippys diet treatment peptic ulcers however incidence milkalkali syndrome increased since due increased osteoporosis awareness preventative routine use calcium consumption calcium supplementation todays society mostly prevent osteoporosis aided resurgence milkalkali sparked conversation changing name milkalkali syndrome calcium alkali syndrome accurately reflects cause currently milkalkali syndrome third common cause people hospitalized high blood calcium hyperparathyroidism regards populations risk shift conditions demographic time previously milkalkali syndrome predominantly seen amongst males ulcers new treatments peptic ulcers arose change causation hypercalcemia presently individuals higher risk developing milkalkali syndrome pregnant postmenopausal individuals milkalkali syndrome illness
