gitelman syndrome gs autosomal recessive kidney tubule disorder characterized low blood levels potassium magnesium decreased excretion calcium urine elevated blood frequent hereditary saltlosing tubulopathy gitelman syndrome caused diseasecausing variants alleles gene gene encodes thiazidesensitive sodiumchloride cotransporter also known ncc ncct tsc found distal convoluted tubule diseasecausing variants lead loss ncc function ie reduced transport sodium chloride via ncc effect electrolyte imbalance similar seen thiazide diuretic therapy causes pharmacological inhibition ncc gitelman syndrome formerly considered subset bartter syndrome distinct genetic molecular bases disorders identified affected individuals may symptoms symptomatic individuals present symptoms almost identical patients thiazide diuretics given affected transporter target clinical signs gitelman syndrome include high blood ph combination low levels chloride potassium magnesium blood decreased calcium excretion contrast people gordons syndrome affected gitelman syndrome generally low normal blood pressure individuals affected gitelman syndrome often complain severe muscle cramps weakness numbness thirst waking night urinate salt cravings abnormal sensations chondrocalcinosis weakness expressed extreme fatigue though cravings salt common severe cravings sour foods eg vinegar lemons sour figs noted persons severe symptoms seizures tetany paralysis abnormal heart rhythms prolonged qt interval detected cases sudden cardiac death reported due low potassium levels quality life decreased gitelman phenotypic variations observed among patients probably result differences genetic background may depend particular amino acid ncct protein mutated study rivieramunoz et al identified subset individuals gitelman syndrome severe phenotypic expression clinical manifestations observed group neuromuscular manifestations growth retardation ventricular arrhythmias patients mostly male found least one allele splice defect gitelman syndrome caused diseasecausing variants alleles gene encodes ncc sodiumchloride cotransporter sodiumchloride cotransporter protein made amino acids transmembrane large number diseasecausing variants throughout gene reported including missense nonsense frameshift splicesite intronic mutations transporter protein already sodiumchloride cotransporter protein located cell membrane participates control ion homeostasis distal convoluted tubule nephron thus loss ncc function reduces sodium chloride reabsorption distal convoluted tubule lead lower blood pressure loss ncc function several effects loss shown lead shorter distal convoluted tubule least therefore functions distal convoluted tubule might perturbed well one possible reasons magnesium reabsorption reduced patients often leading low level magnesium secondly processes distal convoluted tubule altered well instance transcellular calcium reabsorption increased suggested result putative basolateral exchanger apical calcium furthermore continued action basolateral nakatpase might create electrical gradient favourable reabsorption divalent cations secondary active transport another mechanism might responsible decreased magnesium another effect inactivated sodiumchloride cotransporter subsequent activation reninangiotensin aldosterone system raas raas activation byproduct failure distal convoluted tubule reabsorbing electrolytes specifically sodium chloride leading cellular dehydration raas attempts compensate dehydration resulting low serum blood patients symptoms fit diagnosis gitelman syndrome genetic defect gene found cases different genetic defect sometimes identified although cases remain diagnosis gitelman syndrome confirmed eliminating common pathological sources hypokalemia metabolic complete metabolic panel cmp basic metabolic panel bmp used evaluate serum electrolyte levels electrolyte measurement aldosterone levels done via pathognomonic clinical markers include low serum levels potassium sodium chloride magnesium blood result urinary urinary fractional excretion potassium high inappropriately normal context hypokalaemia high levels urinary sodium chloride observed clinical indicators include elevated serum renin aldosterone bloodstream metabolic alkalosis symptomatic features syndrome highly variable ranging asymptomatic mild manifestations weakness cramps severe symptoms tetany paralysis symptom severity multifactorial phenotypic expression varying amongst individuals within family genetic testing another measure identifying underlying mutations cause pathologic symptoms disease mode testing available select one pathogenic variant found regular diagnostics screening introns workup exclude differential diagnosis electrolyte abnormalities many diseases genetic nongenetic give symptoms similar gitelman syndrome following examples well examples differ classic gitelman syndrome treat symptoms related electrolyte abnormalities supplementation often needed dietary modification high salt diet incorporated potassium magnesium supplementation normalize blood levels mainstay large doses potassium magnesium often necessary adequately replace electrolytes lost diarrhea common side effect oral magnesium make replacement mouth difficult dividing dose times day better severe deficits potassium magnesium require intravenous replacement aldosterone antagonists spironolactone eplerenone epithelial sodium channel blockers amiloride also suggested possible treatments decrease urinary wasting potassium however consensus expert statement warns drugs used caution gitelman syndrome possible side effects eg aggravated sodium asymptomatic individuals gitelman syndrome monitored without medical patients early onset disease infants children indomethacin drug choice utilized treat growth indomethacin study blanchard et al shown increase serum potassium levels decrease renin concentration adverse effects indomethacin include decrease glomerular filtration rate gastrointestinal therefore drugs also used caution gitelman cardiac evaluation promoted prevention dysrhythmias monitoring qt interval medications extend prolong qt interval macrolides antihistamines agonists avoided patients prevent cardiac estimates prevalence gitelman syndrome range people depending ratio
