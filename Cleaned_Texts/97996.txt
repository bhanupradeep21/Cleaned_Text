implementation intention selfregulatory strategy form ifthenplans lead better goal attainment well create useful habits modify problematic behaviors subordinate goal intentions specifies portions goaldirected behavior basic formulation implementation intentions address everyday situations person could respond effectively sustainably towards goal eg improving personal relationship technique acknowledges fact troubles defining concrete attainable goals well plans often trouble identifying situation action would effective attaining goal though ifthenplans create habits key difference technique creates habits consciously ifthenplan creates new habit turn improves users life one several aspects concept implementation intentions introduced psychologist peter studies conducted gollwitzer earlier show use implementation intentions result higher probability successful goal attainment predetermining specific desired goaldirected behavior response particular future event concept implementation intentions originated research goal striving throughout late developing research suggests correlations intentions behavior modest intentions account variance strong intentions strongly intend x observed often realized weak intentions past behavior still tended better predictor persons future behavior compared goal intentions research also suggested weak intentionbehavior relation result people good intentions failing act inspired growing body research help determine ways peoples good intentions could made effective accomplishing desired goals emerging research proposed notion successful goal attainment part attributable manner goal setting criteria framed example person perform better set goals challenging specific compared goals challenging vague known goalspecificity emerging research also suggested goalproximity effect wherein proximal goals lead better performance distal strategy implementation intentions developed basis findings people generally positive intentions often fail act question ensure set goal intentions reliably lead desired goaldirected behaviors subsequent attainment goals implementation intentions offer practical solution problem achieving ones goals requires certain goaldirected behaviors instituted people often unsuccessful either initiating maintaining behaviors problems initiating maintaining goaldirected behavior addressed using implementation intention process ifthen plan specific approach compared goal intentions goal intention may phrased following way want reach x implementation intentions hand much specific seek connect future critical situation opportunity goal attainment specific goaldirected behavior thereby leading could called automatization goal attainment often phrased following way situation x arises perform response goal intentions general abstract implementation intentions much concrete procedural formed concrete plan involving specific situation situation becomes mentally represented activated leading better perception attention memory concerning critical situation result chosen goaldirected behavior thenpart plan performed automatically efficiently without conscious effort automatization behavior response future situation cue removes hesitation deliberation part decision maker critical situation arises also effect freeing cognitive resources mental processing tasks also avoiding goalthreatening distractions competing goals also assumed implementation intention set continue operating nonconsciously process called strategic automaticity strength commitment related plan set goal important implementation intention effect peoples behavior without commitment implementation intention hardly effect goaldirected behavior phase model action use implementation intention takes place postdecisional phase implemental mindset volition driving force action follows predecisional phase deliberative mindset motivation driving force setting implemental mindset person already committed goal implementation intention good strategy reach goal usually user first collects list issues addressed minor rather frequent actions examples person comes home starts watching tv tired enough sleep result household chores get postponed weekend done palpable disdain solution could get home immediately clean room minutes get tired early afternoon spend noon break desk could use physical activity walk nearest shop buy snack thensentence applied strictly whenever ifclause fulfilled without exception user deliberate whether exception justified adds cognitive burden thus detrimental attaining goals ifthenplans revised time occurs example changes subjects everyday life reduced amount ifsituations provoke thenreaction new plans drawn intention technique direct user clearly defined short actions improve situation long run reduce burden decisionmaking clause never mention goal problematic behavior actively prompting individuals make plans increases likelihood following effective planning prompts guide people consider act upon facilitating plan creation helps increase followthrough several reasons first helps people consider logistic obstacles develop specific tactics navigate around second process helps reduce likelihood someone underestimate time required third plan creation helps people remember lastly formation action plan serves commitment act research shows breaking commitments generates plans particularly effective made commitments another todd rogers katherine l milkman leslie k john michael norton suggest following situations use planning prompts effective implementation intentions successful helping individuals achieve targeted specific goals years indicated survey research implementation intentions help increase voter turnout study david w nickerson todd rogers found voters highsalience election likely vote received implementation intentions phone call facilitating creation voting voters contacted implementation intentions phone script asked three questions facilitate planmaking time would vote would going voting place would immediately prior voters contacted via phone script percentage points likely vote receive planning prompts also increase likelihood individuals get flu shots study conducted katherine l milkman john beshears james j choi david laibson brigitte c madrian randomly assigned employees midwestern company received mailing prompted write date time would get flu shot remaining employees received letter clinic information received planmaking letter percentage points likely get flu implementation intentions found particularly effective unpleasant goal pursuits healthpromotion eg balanced nutritious diet diseaseprevention eg daily exercise behaviors may significant immediate costs longterm rewards women set goal performing breast selfexamination next month actually induced form implementation intention compared women induced form implementation study investigating effect implementation intentions weight loss obese women ages either instructed create specific implementation intentions regarding dieting exercise eg eat upcoming week exercise upcoming week simply attend health diet stressrelated group meetings women asked create specific implementation intentions lost average kg compared attended weekly group meetings average lost kg another example study sought increase consumption fruits vegetables youngadult population participants created ifthen implementation intentions significantly increased reported fruit vegetable intake half portion per day course one week compared participants made global less specific implementation intentions consumed portions per schweiger gallo keil gollwitzer rockstroh mcculloch published another study conducted address effectiveness implementation intentions regulating emotional two studies required disgust study fear study eliciting stimuli viewed participants subject three different selfregulation instructions disgust selected almost universally considered basic emotion applicable literature fear selected anxiety disorders panic disorders phobias common affect life many people participants reported intensity elicited emotions rating experienced arousal group two implementation intention participants succeeded reducing disgust fear reactions compared two groups results support idea selfregulation using simple goal intentions run problems immediate strong emotional reactivity downregulated whereas implementation intentions appear effective tool selfregulation implementation intentions inhibit automatic activation stereotypical beliefs prejudicial recent study use implementation intentions applied interactions new acquaintances well interracial interactions notion interactions new acquaintances laden anxiety also decrease interest desire longterm contact study found implementation intentions actually increased interest sustained contact anxiety provoking interactions also led closer interpersonal distance anticipation interracial interactions results also suggest anxiety reduced means implementation intentions rather implementation intentions shielded individuals negative effects anxiety social earlier developments concept suggest implementation intentions cause mental representation anticipated situation become highly activated therefore easily accessible stronger relationship cue future situation predetermined behavior response greater success initiating desired goaldirected behavior since components future behavior predetermined eg association relationship said cue behavior become automatic time action initiation becomes immediate efficient require conscious intent condensed explanation implementation intentions automate action contemporary developments concept look initiatory aspects implementation intentions look also longerterm phenomenon behavior maintenance related implementation intentions research suggests implementation intentions result association cue behavior act planning future actually serves foundation phenomenon experiment conducted papies et al investigated rate goal completion means implementation intentions also learning cuebehavior association initially approaches led rate goal completion week later effect implementation intentions maintained lends evidence notion implementation intentions rely complex mechanisms simple cuebehavior associations believed case earlier large amount research conducted implementation intentions better understand questions relating initiation goal unfortunately prior study shielding ongoing goal striving neglected research one study regarding question reported achtziger gollwitzer sheeran shown study implementation intentions even assist people shield goal striving unwanted thoughts feelings cravings junk food distracting thoughts two field experiments concerning dieting study performance sports study shown significant positive influence implementation intentions protecting ongoing goal striving participants formed implementation intentions successful longterm dieting well concentration performance tennis match focus ifthenplans prevention distracting thoughts efficient accomplishment cognitive motivational emotional barriers goal striving studies run everyday situations outside artificial laboratory possess high external validity thus display importance meaningfulness implementation intentions everyday life reported theodore powers colleagues implementation intentions seem negative effect performance
