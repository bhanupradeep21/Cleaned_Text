malabsorption state arising abnormality absorption food nutrients across gastrointestinal gi tract impairment single multiple nutrients depending abnormality may lead malnutrition variety normally human gastrointestinal tract digests absorbs dietary nutrients remarkable efficiency typical western diet ingested adult one day includes approximately g fat g carbohydrate g protein l fluid required

malabsorption may ensue abnormality involves single step absorptive process primary lactase deficiency disease process limited proximal small intestine selective malabsorption single nutrient may occur however generalized malabsorption multiple dietary nutrients develops disease process extensive thus disturbing several digestive absorptive processes occurs coeliac disease extensive involvement small depending nature disease process causing malabsorption extent gastrointestinal symptoms may range severe subtle may even totally absent diarrhea weight loss flatulence abdominal bloating abdominal cramps pain may present although diarrhea common complaint character frequency stools may vary considerably ranging watery stools per day less one voluminous puttylike stool latter causing patients complain constipation hand stool mass invariably increased patients steatorrhea generalized malabsorption normal gday unabsorbed nutrients contribute stool mass mucosal fluid electrolyte secretion also increased diseases associated mucosal inflammation coeliac disease addition unabsorbed fatty acids converted hydroxyfatty acids colonic flora well unabsorbed bile acids impair absorption induce secretion water electrolytes colon adding stool mass weight loss common among patients significant intestinal malabsorption must evaluated context caloric intake patients compensate fecal wastage unabsorbed nutrients significantly increasing oral intake eliciting careful dietary history patients suspected malabsorption therefore crucial excessive flatus abdominal bloating may reflect excessive gas production due fermentation unabsorbed carbohydrate especially among patients primary secondary disaccharidase deficiency lactose intolerance sucrose intolerance malabsorption dietary nutrients excessive fluid secretion inflamed small intestine also contribute abdominal distention bloating prevalence severity character abdominal pain vary considerably among various disease processes associated intestinal malabsorption example pain common patients chronic pancreatitis pancreatic cancer crohns disease absent many patients coeliac disease postgastrectomy

steatorrhea impaired calcium vitamin absorption chelation calcium unabsorbed fatty acids resulting fecal loss calcium may contribute calcium deficiency prolonged secondary hyperparathyroidism may develop prolonged malnutrition may induce amenorrhea infertility impotence edema even ascites may reflect hypoproteinemia associated protein losing enteropathy caused lymphatic obstruction extensive
