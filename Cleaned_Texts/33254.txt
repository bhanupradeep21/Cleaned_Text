gray horse grey horse coat color characterized progressive depigmentation colored hairs coat gray horses black skin dark eyes unlike equine dilution genes genes lead depigmentation gray affect skin eye gray horses may born base color depending color genes present white hairs begin appear shortly birth become progressively prevalent horse ages white hairs become intermingled hairs colors graying occur different quickly one horse slowly another adults gray horses eventually become completely white though retain intermixed light dark hairs stages graying vary widely horses develop dappled pattern period time others resemble roan uniform intermixing light dark hairs age gray horses particularly heterozygous gray gene may develop pigmented speckles addition white coat pattern colloquially called fleabitten gray gray horses appear many breeds though color commonly seen breeds descended arabian ancestors breeds large numbers graycolored horses include thoroughbred arabian american quarter horse welsh pony breeds high prevalence gray include percheron andalusian lipizzaner people unfamiliar horses may refer gray horses white however gray horse whose hair coat completely white still black skin except markings white birth dark eyes discern gray horse white horse white horses usually pink skin sometimes even blue eyes young horses hair coats consisting mixture colored gray white hairs sometimes confused roan horses carry dilution genes may also confused white gray gray classified coat color breed registries genetically may correct call depigmentation pattern dominant thus horse needs one copy gray allele heterozygous gray color homozygous gray horse one carrying two gray alleles always produce gray foals gray common many breeds today one horse carries mutation graying vast majority lipizzaners gray majority andalusian horses many breeds french draft horse percheron boulonnais often gray well gray also found among welsh ponies thoroughbreds american quarter horses breeds common ancestry arabian horse particular gray thoroughbreds descend horse named alcocks arabian gray born gray coat color makes gray also affects spotting patterns pintos leopard complex horses appaloosas effects wash contrast markings patterns sometimes colloquially described ghosting gray foal may born color however bay chestnut black base colors often seen horse matures grays white hairs begin replace base birth color usually white hairs first seen muzzle eyes flanks occasionally birth usually age one year time white hairs replace birth color changing patterns white dark hairs many informal names rose gray salt pepper iron gray dapple gray horse ages coat continues lighten often pure white horses develop pigmented reddishbrown speckles otherwise white hair coat horses often called fleabitten gray different breeds individuals within breed take differing amounts time gray thus graying used approximate age horse except broadest terms young horse never white coat unless true white horse horse teens usually completely grayed one must also careful confuse small amount gray hairs may appear older horses late teens twenties reflect gray gene never cause complete graying horse change hair color means gray horse appear different color time sometimes resulting need change color noted breed registry times people traveling gray horses pure white hair coat encountered problems nonhorseoriented officials police officers border guards unclear horse papers saying gray horse front appears complicate matters skin eyes may colors influenced factors white markings certain white spotting patterns dilution genes gray gene g autosomal dominant simple terms horse even one copy gray allele regardless coat color genes present always become gray also means gray horses must least one gray parent gray horse homozygous gg meaning gray allele parents always produce gray offspring matter color genetics parent however gray horse heterozygous gg meaning inherits one copy recessive gene g animal may produce offspring gray depending genetics parent mendelian inheritance principles genetic testing possible determine whether horse homozygous heterozygous gray gene affect skin eye color grays typically dark skin eyes opposed unpigmented pink skin white researchers uppsala university sweden identified genetic mutation governs graying process study revealed gray horses carry identical mutation traced back common ancestor lived least two thousand years discovery gray linked single animal provides example humans cherrypicked attractive mutations domestic gray controlled single dominant allele gene regulates specific kinds stem cells homozygous grays turn white faster likely develop melanomas less prone develop fleabitten speckling heterozygous researchers suggest pigmented speckles fleabitten gray well intense reddishbrown colored areas called blood markings may caused loss inactivation gray allele somatic cells would explain speckles common heterozygous grays identification gray mutation great interest medical research since mutation also enhances risk melanoma horses studies suggested many grays years age form growth rate depends type many slowgrowing time many develop malignant study gray genetics pointed molecular pathway may lead tumour development neighboring gene overexpressed melanomas gray horses carrying lossoffunction mutation asip agouti signaling protein higher incidence melanoma implying increased receptor signaling promotes melanoma development gray studies indicate many melanomas become malignant though studies found much lower rates one case many people unfamiliar horses refer gray horse white however white horses pink skin blue eyes horse dark skin dark eyes white hair coat gray however gray horse underlying homozygous cream base coat color may born rosypink skin blue eyes nearwhite hair cases dna testing may clarify genetics horse grays intermediate stages graying may confused roan rabicano heavily fleabitten grays may also confused roans however roans easily distinguishable grays roan consists individual white hairs dark base coat usually head legs horse darker rest body rabicanos also intermixed white hairs primarily body dark head gray horses head often first area lighten especially around eyes muzzle also roans lighten age grays always varnish roan another unusual coloration sometimes seen appaloosa horses like gray change age unlike gray horse become progressively lighter pure white varnish roans created action leopard complex within breeds appaloosa seldom seen elsewhere dilution genes create dun cream pearl silver dapple champagne coloring may occasionally result confusion gray horses particular type dun hair coat known blue dun grullo mouse dun appear solid gray however color caused dun gene acting black base coat horses dun hairs color intermingling white dark hairs also dun horses get lighter age horses light cream color also grays usually cremello perlino smoky cream horses colors produced action cream gene however gray parent passes gene hairs turn white like gray another creamcolored dilution pearl gene barlink factor may also create lightcoated horses similarly champagne gene lighten coat color often producing dappling light colors confused gray spite name silver dapple gene nothing graying dilution gene acts black coat diluting coat dark brown mane flaxen shade horses express silver dapple gene gray gene born color lighten however one parent passes gray gene gray gene dominant throughout history gray
