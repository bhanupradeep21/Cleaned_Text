warkalania extinct genus australian meiolaniid turtle oligocene early miocene riversleigh queensland meiolaniids known elaborate headcrests long horns warkalania possesses short horns form somewhat continuous ridge across back head known species genus warkalania carinaminor oldest named meiolaniid turtle australia although presence meiolaniids riversleigh fauna known basis fragmentary remains since least first diagnostic remains discovered neville pledge form partial skull strata dating late oligocene early miocene remains described eugene gaffney michael archer arthur white new genus meiolaniid turtle named warkalania carinaminor holotype specimen qmf right squamosal bone including tympanic cavity various scales area discovered pancake site queensland additional material also reported qmf left squamosal may belonged individual type specimen referred specimens include various skull bones including parietals quadrate bone squamosal least one genus name warkalania combines word warka meaning turtle gaffney colleagues attribute closer specified australian aboriginal language queensland region lania suffix lania common component names meiolaniid turtles also used meiolania gaffneylania niolamia meaning term however interpreted differently various authors partly due lack etymology given description miolania description warkalania word translated butcher latin lanius researchers point owens description megalania argue suffix actually derived greek word roam species name w carinaminor hand simply translates small ridge reference fact genus didnt possess large horns skull warkalania highly ankylosed entirely obscuring sutures individual skull bones consequently gaffney colleagues describe skull largely basis contacts overlying scutes alphabetically labeled individual scale areas separated presence shallow grooves similar ninjemys niolamia different raised ridges individuals meiolania platyceps one referred specimens preserves scale x located central portion skull scales g likely covering back frontal bones front parietal bones scale x similar size scale meiolania platyceps lord howe island bears kind conical protrusion surface though smaller later species single scale x present scales g paired appear meet respective opposite along midline actual contact g might also preserved however appears much weaker scale contacts animal much like meiolania scale lies relatively flat skull rather notably convex niolamia roof cranial cavity appears primarily composed parietal bones contribution supraoccipital bones includes region would contain remnants synotic tectum region however well enough preserved show differences turtles typically rather uniform anatomy one key features sets warkalania apart meiolaniids shape horns meiolaniids known series horns located side back skull described horns scales b c scale horn located furthest back three c closest eyes meiolaniid turtles horn c either conical case meiolania specimens flat warkalania meanwhile element forms horizontal ridge continues onto horn b second horn protrudes side horn c still relatively short ridgelike difference meiolaniids noticeable horn larger conical meiolania taking appearance similar cows horn specimens small horn cores almost approaching size seen warkalania none quite small ninjemys niolamia also show different horn shape share flattening warkalania though lesser degree two taxa horn appears much like spine extends far beyond rest head horn furthest back three incompletely known preserved elements suggest approximately size shape horn b specimen showing acute others showing blunter edges slightly larger meiolania stands stark contrast area ninjemys niolamia unlike derived forms two genera horns much pronounced preceding scales point form massive shelves back head horns warkalania also form somewhat shelf nearly pronounced overall gives skull warkalania less ornate appearance compared elaborate crests neiolamia ninjemys distinctive bulllike horns meiolania gaffney colleagues found warkalania shared several features horns meiolania including size horns fact b horns dont project laterally relatively flattened scales considering characters synapomorphies concluded warkalania closest relative meiolaniato exclusion ninjemys later corroborated additional including phylogenetic tree recovered sterli et al

riversleigh confidently assigned genus due lack overlapping may may belong warkalania least one fragment horn seems indicate second meiolaniid also present initially attributed indetermined species later assigned meiolaniidae indet warkalania oldest named genus meiolaniid turtle australia oligocene older remains present form isolated bones identifiable indetermined
