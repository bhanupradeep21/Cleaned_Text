polylinker contains many unique restriction sites restriction sites mcs first cleaved restriction enzymes pcramplified target gene also digested enzymes ligated vectors using dna ligase target dna sequence inserted vector specific direction desired restriction sites may used subcloning another vector necessarycitation needed cloning vectors may use topoisomerase instead ligase cloning may done rapidly without need restriction digest vector insert topo cloning method linearized vector activated attaching topoisomerase ends topoactivated vector may accept pcr product ligating ends pcr product releasing topoisomerase forming circular vector another method cloning without use dna digest ligase dna recombination example used gateway cloning gene cloned cloning vector called entry clone method may conveniently introduced variety expression vectors selectable marker carried vector allow selection positively transformed cells antibiotic resistance often used marker example betalactamase gene confers resistance penicillin group betalactam antibiotics like ampicillin vectors contain two selectable markers example plasmid ampicillin kanamycin resistance shuttle vector designed maintained two different organisms may also require two selectable markers although selectable markers resistance zeocin hygromycin b effective different cell types auxotrophic selection markers allow auxotrophic organism grow minimal growth medium may also used examples used corresponding auxotrophic strains another kind selectable marker allows positive selection plasmid cloned gene may involve use gene lethal host cells pardpare typically works disrupting removing lethal gene cloning process unsuccessful clones lethal gene still remains intact would kill host cells therefore successful clones selected reporter genes used cloning vectors facilitate screening successful clones using features genes allow successful clone easily identified features present cloning vectors may laczα fragment α

promoters presence promoter necessary screening techniques bluewhite selection used cloning vectors without promoter rbs cloned dna sequence sometimes used example cloning genes whose products toxic e coli cells promoter rbs cloned dna sequence also unnecessary first making genomic cdna library clones since cloned genes normally subcloned appropriate expression vector expression required vectors designed transcription heterologous protein expressed example vitro mrna production vectors called transcription vectors may lack sequences necessary polyadenylation termination therefore may used protein production large number cloning vectors available choosing vector may depend upon number factors size insert copy number cloning method large insert may stably maintained general cloning

plasmids may preferably used certain circumstances example protein cloned gene toxic plasmids contain bacteriophage origin replication may used generate singlestranded dna called phagemids examples pbluescript series cloning vectors bacteriophages used cloning λ phage upper limit amount dna packed phage maximum kb therefore allow foreign dna inserted phage dna phage cloning vectors may need nonessential genes deleted example genes lysogeny since using phage λ cloning vector involves lytic two kinds λ phage vectors insertion vector replacement vector insertion vectors contain unique cleavage site whereby foreign dna size kb may inserted replacement vectors cleavage sites flank region containing genes essential lytic cycle region may deleted replaced dna insert cloning process larger sized dna kb may also lower size limit dna packed phage vector dna small properly packaged phage property used selection vector without insert may small therefore vectors insert may selected cosmids plasmids incorporate segment bacteriophage λ dna cohesive end site cos contains elements required packaging dna λ particles apt origin replication ori replicate plasmid normally used clone large dna fragments insert size kb cloned bacterial artificial chromosome bac bacs maintained e coli copy number per bacs based f plasmid another artificial chromosome called pac based phage yeast artificial chromosome used vectors clone dna fragments mega base size useful cloning larger dna fragments required mapping genomes human genome project contains telomeric sequence autonomously replicating sequence features required replicate linear chromosomes yeast cells vectors also contain suitable restriction sites clone foreign dna well genes used selectable markers human artificial chromosome may potentially useful gene transfer vectors gene delivery human cells tool expression studies determining human chromosome function carry large dna fragment upper limit size practical
