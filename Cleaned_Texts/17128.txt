combined hormonal contraceptives also associated decreased risk endometrial ovarian colorectal common sideeffects combined hormonal contraceptives include headache nausea breast tenderness breakthrough bleeding vaginal ring use include additional sideeffects including vaginal irritation vaginal discharge contraceptive skin patch use also include sideeffect skin irritation around patch breakthrough bleeding within first months generally harmful often resolves persistent contradictory research exists effects combined hormonal contraceptives weight gain clinical studies shown women
