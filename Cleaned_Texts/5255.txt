fuzzytrace theory ftt theory cognition originally proposed valerie f reyna charles draws upon dualtraceclarification needed conceptions predict explain cognitive phenomena particularly memory reasoning theory used areas cognitive psychology human development social psychology explain instance false probability medical decision risk perception estimation biases fallacies decision ftt initially proposed attempt unify findings memory reasoning domains could predicted explained earlier approaches cognition development eg information processing one challenges statistical independence memory reasoning memory background facts problem situations often unrelated accuracy reasoning findings called rethinking memoryreasoning relation ftt took form dualprocess theory linking basic concepts psycholinguistic gestalt theory memory reasoning specifically ftt posits people form two types mental representations past event called verbatim gist traces gist traces fuzzy representations past event eg bottomline meaning hence name fuzzytrace theory whereas verbatim traces detailed representations past event although people capable processing verbatim gist information prefer reason gist traces rather verbatim implies example even people capable understanding ratio concepts like probabilities prevalence rates standard presentation health riskrelated data choice decision situations usually governed bottomline meaning eg risk high risk low outcome bad outcome good rather actual importantly ftt memoryreasoning independence explained terms preferred modes processing one performs memory task eg retrieval verbatim traces relative one performs reasoning task eg preference reasoning gist similar approach applied human suggested human vision two types processing one aggregates local spatial receptive fields one parses local receptive field people used prior experience gists decide process dominates perceptual decision work attempted link gestalt theory psychophysics ie independent linear filters theory developed fuzzy image used information processing technology edge ftt posits two types memory processes verbatim gist therefore often referred dual process theory memory according ftt retrieval verbatim traces recollective retrieval characterized mental reinstatement contextual features past event whereas retrieval gist traces nonrecollective retrieval fact gist processes form representations events semantic features rather surface details latter property verbatim processes memory domain ftts notion verbatim gist representations influential explaining true memories ie memories events actually happened well false memories ie memories events never following five principles used predict explain true false memory phenomena principle parallel storage asserts encoding storage verbatim gist information operate parallel rather serial fashion instance suppose person presented word apple red color one hand according principle parallel storage verbatim gist traces verbatim features target item eg word apple presented red printed boldface italic first letter presented lowercase gist features eg word type fruit would encoded stored simultaneously via distinct pathways conversely verbatim gist traces stored serial fashion gist features target item word type fruit would derived verbatim features therefore formation gist traces would depend encoding storage verbatim traces latter idea often assumed early memory however despite intuitive appeal serial processing approach research suggests encoding storage gist traces depend verbatim ones several studies converged finding meaning target items encoded independently even prior encoding surface form ankrum example found participants presented familiar word eg apple brief period milliseconds able identify word apple better letters contain letter l similar principle parallel storage retrieval verbatim gist traces also occur via dissociated pathways according principle dissociated retrieval recollective nonrecollective retrieval processes independent consequently principle allows verbatim gist processes differentially influenced factors type retrieval cues availability form representation connection tulvings encoding specificity principle items actually presented past better cues verbatim traces items similarly items presented past preserve meaning presented items usually better cues gist traces suppose example subjects experiment presented word list containing several dog breeds poodle bulldog greyhound doberman beagle collie boxer mastif husky terrier recognition test words poodle spaniel chair presented according principle dissociated retrieval retrieval verbatim gist traces depend therefore different types test probes might serve better cues one type trace another example test probes poodle targets studied items better retrieval cues verbatim traces gist whereas test probes spaniel related distractors nonstudied items related targets better retrieval cues gist traces verbatim chair hand would neither better cue verbatim traces gist traces presented related dogs verbatim gist processes dependent factors affect one process would also affect direction however several experiments showing example differential forgetting rates memory surface details memory bottomline meaning past favor notion dissociated retrieval verbatim gist case forgetting rates experiments shown time verbatim traces become inaccessible faster rate gist traces brainerd reyna instance found delay drives true recognition rates supported verbatim gist traces false recognition rates supported gist suppressed verbatim traces opposite directions namely true memory decays time false memory increases principle opponent processes describes interaction verbatim gist processes creating true false memories whereas true memory supported verbatim gist processes false memory supported gist processes suppressed verbatim processes words verbatim gist processes work opposition one another comes false suppose example one presented word list lemon apple pear citrus recognition test items lemon target orange related distractor fan unrelated distractor shown case retrieval gist trace fruits supports acceptance test probes lemon true memory orange false memory whereas retrieval verbatim trace lemon supports acceptance test probe lemon addition retrieval exclusory verbatim trace saw words lemon apple pear citrus suppresses acceptance false related items orange operation known recollection neither verbatim gist traces retrieved one might accept test probe basis response bias principle plays key role ftts explanation experimental dissociations true false memories eg variable affects one type memory without affecting produces opposite effects time exposure word study number repetitions shown produce specifically true memory follows monotonically increasing function plotted presentation duration false memory rates exhibit invertedu pattern plotted function presentation duration similarly repetition monotonically related true memory true memory increases function number repetitions nonmonotonically related false memory repetition produces invertedu relation false memory retrieval phenomenologies spontaneous mental experiences associated act remembering first systematically characterized e k strong early strong identified two distinct types introspective phenomena associated memory retrieval since termed recollection remembrance familiarity whereas former characterized retrieval associated recollection past experiences latter lacks association two forms experiences illustrated everyday expressions remember recollection seems familiar familiarity ftt retrieval verbatim traces often produces recollective phenomenology thus frequently referred recollective however one feature ftt recollective phenomenology particular one type memory process posited dualprocess theories memory instead ftt posits retrieval gist traces also produce recollective phenomenology circumstances gist resemblance false item memory high compelling gives rise phenomenon called phantom vivid false memory deemed true principle developmental variability dual processes posits verbatim gist processes show variability across lifespan specifically verbatim gist processes shown improve early childhood young regarding verbatim processes older children better retrieval verbatim traces younger children although even young children able retrieve verbatim information chance level instance source memory accuracy greatly increases memory nonsense words ie words without meaning neppez shown increase gist processes also improve age example semantic clustering free recall increases meaning connection across words sentences shown improve particular notion gist memory improves age plays central role ftts prediction age increases false memory counterintuitive pattern called developmental regarding old age several studies suggest verbatim memory declines early late adulthood gist memory remains fairly stable experiments indicate older adults perform worse tasks require retrieval surface features studied items relative younger addition results measurement models quantify verbatim gist processes indicate older adults less able use verbatim traces recall younger people try remember past events eg birthday party last dinner often commit two types errors errors omission errors commission former known forgetting latter better known false memories false memories separated spontaneous implanted false memories spontaneous false memories result endogenous internal processes meaning processing implanted false memories result exogenous external processes suggestion false information outside source eg interviewer asking misleading questions research first suggested younger children susceptible suggestion false information however research since indicated younger children much less likely form false memories older children moreover opposition common sense true memories stable false ones studies shown false memories actually persistent true according ftt pattern arises false memories supported memory traces less susceptible interference forgetting gist traces traces suppress also support true memories verbatim traces ftt model false memories rather model explains memory reacts higher reasoning process

advanced cognition relies distinction intuition analysis depends kind representation used process information mental representations described ftt categorized either gist verbatim representations generally adults display called fuzzy processing meaning rely least precise gist representations necessary make decision despite parallel processing gist verbatim representations processes increase

different reasoning problems way problems share underlying ftt posits people presented statistical information extract representations gist information qualitatively well exact verbatim information quantitatively gist encoded often basic categorical distinction risk risk however situations choices decision level uncertainty risk another level precision would required eg low risk high illustration principle found ftts explanation common framing effect framing effects occur linguistically different descriptions equivalent options lead inconsistent choices famous example risky choice framing task asian disease task requires participants imagine country face disease expected kill people choose among two programs combat disease subjects presented options framed either gains lives saved losses lives lost possible options well categorical gists posited encoded ftt displayed commonly found people prefer sure option options framed gains program risky option framed losses program despite fact expected values programs equivalent contrast normative point view would indicate respondents prefer sure option positive frame also prefer sure option negative explanation effect according ftt people tend operate simplest gist permitted make decision case framing question gain frame presents situation people prefer gist people saved possibility saved one could saved conversely possibility people dying one dying preferable option people surely critical tests conducted provide evidence support explanation favor theoretical explanations ie prospect theory presenting modified version task eliminates mathematically redundant wording eg program b would instead indicate program b adopted probability people saved ftt predicts case elimination additional gist explicit possible

communicating risk information identical effects risktaking behavior even pertinent displays different findings predicted ftt related models suggest people reason basis simplified representations rather literal information like people clinicians apply cognitive heuristics fall systematic errors affect decisions everyday life research shown patients physicians difficulty understanding host numerical concepts especially risks probabilities often implies problems numeracy mathematical example physicians patients demonstrate great difficulty understanding probabilities certain genetic risks prone errors despite vast differences medical though traditional dual process theory generally predicts decisions made computation superior made intuition ftt assumes opposite intuitive processing sophisticated capable making better decisions increases expertise accompanied reliance intuitive gistbased reasoning rather literal verbatim ftt predicts simply educating people statistics regarding risk factors hinder prevention efforts due low prevalence hiv cancer example people tend overestimate risks consequently interventions stressing actual numbers may move people toward
