peritrophic matrix prefix peri meaning around trophic referring nutritionfood peritrophic membrane semipermeable noncellular structure surrounds food bolus organisms midgut although often found peritrophic matrixes found seven different phyla peritrophic matrix serves several functions including improvement digestion protection mechanical chemical damage serving barrier infection peritrophic matrix composed regularly arranged chitin microfibrils matrix mass species specific proteins embedded proteoglycan peritrophic matrix also includes small pores allow passage small molecules matrix thus due size limitations pores reach maximum size nm larger unwanted materials taken feeding trapped excreted along type formation peritrophic matrix thought ancestral method found majority organisms produce peritrophic matrix type formation peritrophic matrix secreted entire midgut formed simply delamination surface midgut type formation usually occurs response feeding also produced continually formed response feeding single matrix secreted midgut epithelium matrix surrounds food bolus later excreted along unwanted materials present food bolus digestion formed continually insect family acrididae locusts multiple peritrophic matrixes secreted surround food bolus creating peritrophic envelope food bolus present peritrophic matrixes secreted rapidly passed type ii formation peritrophic matrix considered derived technique found families diptera dermaptera embioptera lepidoptera orders type ii formation peritrophic matrix produced specialized group cells present proventriculus anterior type ii formation continuous process carried regardless presence absence food bolus thus peritrophic matrix secreted unbroken concentric sleeve like structure although peritrophic matrix secreted continually presence food bolus significantly increases rate production addition presence food bolus stimulates production multiple matrices surround bolus following secretion primary peritrophic matrix subsequent matrices secreted underneath first matrix create layered peritrophic many organisms primary function peritrophic matrix improve digestion following feeding food bolus surrounded peritrophic matrix effectively isolating midgut epithelium isolation creates two distinct compartments within midgut endoperitrophic space ectoperitrophic space compartmentalization midgut provides three general advantages prevention nonspecific binding undigested material epithelium wall conservation concentration enzymes substrates rapid removal indigestible prevention nonspecific binding particularly important increases efficiency absorption process filtering undigested material would otherwise block access midgut epithelium due small pore size matrix small molecules broken enzymes already effectively absorbed come contact midgut epithelium remaining materials undigested food unwanted molecules kept within matrix broken enzymes concentrating enzymes food substrate within endoperitrophic space significantly decreases time required digestion midgut addition since enzymes small enough easily move peritrophic matrix rarely lost matrix along contents still endoperitrophic space excreted counterflow fluid ectoperitrophic space also helps recycle enzymes thus maximizing presence peritrophic matrix significantly simplifies excretion process rather continually sift mixture digestible unwanted molecules digestible molecules quickly broken enzymes removed matrix absorbed digestive process completed unwanted molecules kept confined within endoperitrophic space excreted along although peritrophic matrix thin layer compounds type matrixes reach maximum thickness µm type ii matrixes reach maximum thickness µm withstand mechanical pressure strains capacity expand prevents food bolus rupturing delicate epithelial layer assisting passage food gut much like indigestible molecules present food bolus many toxins large pass small pores peritrophic matrix example insects resistant insecticide ddt shed large amounts toxin peritrophic matrix addition smaller toxins bind specific surface proteins present peritrophic matrix binding particularly important bloodfeeding insects heme groups components hemoglobin oxygen carrying protein present vertebrate blood act strong oxidizers insects although oxidizing agent safe vertebrates damaging insects however heme groups ingested blood meal bind proteins peritrophic matrix enabling insects safely feed organisms take food often infected pathogens bloodfeeding insects also depend peritrophic matrix filter disease agents often large fit matrix pores benefit particular thought important driving force evolution peritrophic matrices many insects feeding foods low pathogen levels lack ability produce peritrophic matrix trend highlighted mosquitoes bloodfeeding female mosquitoes produce peritrophic matrix nectarfeeding males significant trend also observed type peritrophic matrix produced bloodfeeding insects capable transmitting disease majority bloodfeeding insects good disease vectors produce type matrix comparison bloodfeeding insects produce type ii matrix provides impenetrable barrier pathogens rarely disease vectors many pathogens large fit small pores peritrophic matrix thus evolved specialized mechanisms evading filtered matrix since type peritrophic matrixes secreted response presence food bolus midgut pathogens simply invade epithelial cells matrix excreted many helminth microfilaria arboviruses arthropod borne viruses transmitted mosquito infective form able immediately invade mosquito however pathogens malaria protozoan must first develop infective stage within midgut invading tissues pathogens secrete chitinase proteinase enzymes dissolve chitin
