clinical death medical term cessation blood circulation breathing two criteria necessary sustain lives human beings many occurs heart stops beating regular rhythm condition called cardiac arrest term also sometimes used resuscitation research stopped blood circulation historically proven irreversible cases prior invention cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr defibrillation epinephrine injection treatments century absence blood circulation vital functions related blood circulation historically considered official definition death advent strategies cardiac arrest came called clinical death rather simply death reflect possibility postarrest resuscitation onset clinical death consciousness lost within several seconds dogs measurable brain activity measured stop within irregular gasping may occur early time period sometimes mistaken rescuers sign cpr clinical death tissues organs body steadily accumulate type injury called ischemic injury tissues organs body survive clinical death considerable periods blood circulation stopped entire body heart least minutes injury spinal cord limiting detached limbs may successfully reattached hours blood circulation warm temperatures bone tendon skin survive long brain however appears accumulate ischemic injury faster organ without special treatment circulation restarted full recovery brain minutes clinical death normal body temperature usually brain damage later brain death results longer intervals clinical death even heart restarted blood circulation successfully restored brain injury therefore chief limiting factor recovery clinical death although loss function almost immediate specific duration clinical death nonfunctioning brain clearly dies vulnerable cells brain neurons hippocampus fatally injured little minutes without oxygen however injured cells actually die hours delayed death prevented vitro simple drug treatment even minutes without areas brain viable human neurons recovered grown culture hours clinical brain failure clinical death known due complex series processes called reperfusion injury occur blood circulation restored especially processes interfere blood circulation recovery control processes subject ongoing research laboratory resuscitation pioneer peter safar discovered reducing body temperature three degrees celsius restarting blood circulation could double time window recovery clinical death without brain damage minutes minutes induced hypothermia technique beginning used emergency combination mildly reducing body temperature reducing blood cell concentration increasing blood pressure resuscitation found especially effective allowing recovery dogs minutes clinical death normal body temperature practically brain addition drug treatment protocol reported allow recovery dogs minutes clinical death normal body temperature lasting brain cooling treatment alone permitted recovery minutes clinical death normal temperature brain laboratory conditions normal body temperature longest period clinical death cat complete circulatory arrest survived eventual return brain function one reduced body temperature therapeutic hypothermia clinical death slows rate injury accumulation extends time period clinical death survived decrease rate injury approximated rule states rate biochemical reactions decreases factor two every reduction temperature result humans sometimes survive periods clinical death exceeding one hour temperatures prognosis improved clinical death caused hypothermia rather occurring prior swedish woman anna bågenholm spent minutes trapped ice survived near full recovery core body temperature said emergency medicine nobody dead warm animal studies three hours clinical death survived temperatures near purpose cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr cardiac arrest ideally reversal clinically dead state restoration blood circulation breathing however great variation effectiveness cpr purpose blood pressure low manual resulting tenminute average extension yet cases patients regaining consciousness cpr still full cardiac absence cerebral function monitoring frank return consciousness neurological status patients undergoing cpr intrinsically uncertain somewhere state clinical death normal functioning state patients supported methods certainly maintain enough blood circulation oxygenation sustaining life stopped heartbeat breathing cardiopulmonary bypass customarily considered clinically dead parts body except heart lungs continue function normally clinical death occurs machines providing sole circulatory support turned leaving patient state stopped blood circulation certain surgeries cerebral aneurysms aortic arch defects require blood circulation stopped repairs performed deliberate temporary induction clinical death called circulatory arrest typically performed lowering body temperature stopping heart lungs state called deep hypothermic circulatory arrest low temperatures patients tolerate clinically dead state minutes without incurring significant brain longer durations possible lower temperatures usefulness longer procedures established controlled clinical death also proposed treatment exsanguinating trauma create time surgical death historically believed event coincided onset clinical death understood death series physical events single one determination permanent death dependent factors beyond simple cessation breathing clinical death occurs unexpectedly treated medical emergency cpr initiated united states hospital code blue declared advanced cardiac life support procedures used attempt restart normal heartbeat effort continues either heart restarted physician determines continued efforts useless recovery impossible determination made physician pronounces legal death resuscitation efforts stop clinical death expected due terminal illness withdrawal supportive care often resuscitate dnr code order place means resuscitation efforts made physician nurse may pronounce legal death onset clinical deathcitation needed patient working heart lungs determined brain dead pronounced legally dead without clinical death occurring however courts reluctant impose determination religious objections family members jesse koochin similar issues also raised case mordechai dov brody child died court could resolve conversely case marlise muñoz hospital refused remove
