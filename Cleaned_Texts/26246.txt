naegleria fowleri colloquially known braineating amoeba species genus naegleria belongs phylum percolozoa technically classified shapeshifting amoeboflagellate rather true amoeba freeliving microorganism primarily feeds bacteria become pathogenic humans causing extremely rare sudden severe usually fatal brain infection known naegleriasis primary amoebic meningoencephalitis typically found warm freshwater bodies ponds badly managed pools rivers hot warm water discharge industrial power geothermal well poorly maintained minimally chlorinated swimming pools residual chlorine levels

even treatment fatality rate greater new treatments miltefosine antiparasitic drug inhibits pathogen via disrupting cell survival signal pathway used cases mixed key factor effective treatment speed diagnosis naegleriasis rare often considered likely diagnosis therefore clinical laboratorys identification microorganism may first time amoebic etiology considered rapid identification help avoid

diagnosis initiation recommended therapy successful treatment pam rare treatment attempted correct diagnosis relies rapid recognition microorganism medical technologists pathologists critical medical technologists consistently provide timely csf evaluation explore diagnosis pam look amoebae setting meningitis especially pakistan number reported cases surpassed global total due insufficient
