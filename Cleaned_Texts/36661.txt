early pregnancy bleeding also called first trimester bleeding refers vaginal bleeding weeks gestational bleeding significant hemorrhagic shock may concern shock increased loss consciousness chest pain shortness breath shoulder common causes early pregnancy bleeding include ectopic pregnancy threatened miscarriage pregnancy miscarriages occur weeks gestation causes include implantation bleeding gestational trophoblastic disease polyps cervical tests determine underlying cause usually include speculum examination ultrasound treatment depends underlying tissue seen cervical opening pregnancy intrauterine fetal heart sounds watchful waiting generally antid immune globulin usually recommended occasionally surgery women bleeding first trimester weeks gestational bleeding second trimester weeks gestational age less realize pregnant ectopic pregnancy occurs differential diagnosis depends whether bleeding occurs first trimester second third trimesters obstetric causes first trimester bleeding include following obstetric causes secondthird trimester bleeding include following causes early pregnancy bleeding include following early pregnancy bleeding usually maternal source rather fetal one maternal source may disruption vessels decidua lesion cervix vagina earlier stages pregnancy cervix vulnerable bleeding new blood vessels vasa praevia rare condition result bleeding fetoplacental circulation vasa praevia happens often umbilical cord grows way directly enters membrane therefore blood vessels unprotected umbilical cord placental tissue rupture lead another common source bleeding due abnormal development embryo common early fetal abnormality abnormal number chromosomes causing loss pregnancy initial assessment vaginal bleeding early pregnancy must first consider hemodynamic stability degree pain bleeding hemodynamically unstable individual would necessitate immediate transfer emergency department important recognize women may suffer significant blood loss signs hemodynamic instability initial evaluation early pregnancy bleeding involves history physical relevant history includes determining gestational age fetus characterizing bleeding bleeding least heavy menstrual bleeding associated clots tissue lightheadedness pelvic discomfort associated increased risks ectopic pregnancy spontaneous discomfort middle abdomen closely associated spontaneous abortion discomfort side abdomen closely associated ectopic pregnancy risk factors ectopic pregnancy spontaneous abortion also physical examination includes assessing vital signs performing abdominal pelvic examination signs hemodynamic instability peritonitis require emergent pelvic examination may reveal nonobstetric causes bleeding bleeding vagina cervix may also show visible products conception suggestive incomplete person stable pelvic exam unrevealing transvaginal ultrasonography andor serial measurement hcg generally recommended assess fetal location reviewed

shared decisionmaking mother incomplete abortion watchful waiting recommended method individuals complete process spontaneously within four women decide expectant management may experience days bleeding longer completion time compared surgical management serious complications watchful waiting effective medical management entails mg oral mifepristone mifeprex followed hours later mcg vaginally administered bed rest progesterone therapy shown increase likelihood viable ectopic pregnancy treated methotrexate therapy surgery typically intramuscular injection mg per methotrexate given
