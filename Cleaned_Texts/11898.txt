nasogastric intubation medical process involving insertion plastic tube nasogastric tube ng tube nose esophagus stomach orogastric intubation similar process involving insertion plastic tube orogastric tube abraham louis levin invented ng tube nasogastric tube also known ryles tube commonwealth countries john alfred ryle nasogastric tube used feeding administering drugs oral agents activated charcoal drugs minimal quantities liquid syringe used injection tube continuous feeding gravity based system employed solution placed higher patients stomach accrued supervision required feeding tube often connected electronic pump control measure patients intake signal interruption feeding nasogastric tubes may also used aid treatment lifethreatening eating disorders especially patient compliant eating cases nasogastric tube may inserted force feeding patients practice may highly distressing patients healthcare nasogastric aspiration suction process draining stomachs contents via tube nasogastric aspiration mainly used remove gastrointestinal secretions swallowed air patients gastrointestinal obstructions nasogastric aspiration also used poisoning situations potentially toxic liquid ingested preparation surgery anaesthesia extract samples gastric liquid analysiscitation needed tube used continuous drainage usually appended collector bag placed level patients stomach gravity empties stomachs contents also appended suction system however method often restricted emergency situations constant suction easily damage stomachs lining nonemergency situations intermittent suction often applied giving benefits suction without untoward effects damage stomach liningcitation needed suction drainage also used patients undergone pneumonectomy order prevent anesthesiarelated vomiting possible aspiration stomach contents aspiration would represent serious risk complications patients recovering surgery types nasogastric tubes include ng tube inserted must measured tip patients nose loop around ear roughly cm xiphoid process tube marked level ensure tube inserted far enough patients stomach many commercially available stomach duodenal tubes several standard depth markings example cm cm cm cm distal end infant feeding tubes often come cm depth markings end plastic tube lubricated local anesthetic xylocaine gel may used addition nasal vasoconstrictor andor anesthetic spray may applied insertion inserted one patients anterior nares treatment mg iv midazolam greatly reduces patient tube directed straight towards back patient moves nasal cavity throat tube enters oropharynx glides posterior pharyngeal wall patient may gag situation patient awake alert asked mimic swallowing given water sip straw tube continues inserted patient swallows tube past pharynx enters esophagus easily inserted stomach tube must secured place prevent moving several ways secure ng placement one method least invasive tape tape positioned wrapped around ng tube onto patients nose prevent dislodgementcitation needed another securement device nasal bridle device enters one nare around nasal septum nare secured place around nasogastric tube two ways bridle put place one method according australian journal otolaryngology performed physician pull material nares tied ends shortened prevent removal method device called applied medical technology amt bridle device uses magnet inserted nares connects nasal septum pulled one side tied technology allows nurses safely apply several studies proven use nasal bridle prevents loss ng

measuring concentration enzymes trypsin pepsin bilirubin confirm correct placement ng tube enzyme testing becomes practical allowing measurements taken quickly cheaply bedside technique may used combination ph testing effective less harmful replacement xray tube remain place tube position check recommended feed least per day smaller diameter fr less adults nasogastric tubes appropriate longterm feeding avoid irritation erosion nasal mucosa tubes often guidewires facilitate insertion feeding required longer period time options placement peg tube consideredcitation needed function ng tube properly placed used suction maintained flushing may done flushing small amounts saline air using flushing larger amounts saline water air assessing air circulate one lumen tube stomach lumen two techniques flushing compared latter use nasogastric intubation contraindicated patients moderatetosevere neck facial fractures due increased risk airway obstruction improper tube placement special attention necessary insertion circumstances order avoid undue trauma esophagus also greater risk patients bleeding disorders particularly resulting distended submucosal veins lower third esophagus known esophageal varices may easily ruptured due friability also gerdgastro esophageal reflux diseasecitation needed alternative measures orogastric intubation considered circumstances patient incapable meeting nutritional caloric needs extended time period usually hourscitation needed minor complications include nose bleeds sinusitis sore throatcitation needed sometimes significant
