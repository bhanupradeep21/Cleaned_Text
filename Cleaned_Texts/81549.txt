dental dam rubber dam thin mm square sheet usually latex nitrile used dentistry isolate operative site one teeth rest mouth sometimes termed kofferdam german designed united states sanford christie barnum used mainly endodontic fixed prosthodontic crowns bridges general restorative treatments purpose prevent saliva interfering dental work eg contamination oral microorganisms root canal therapy keep filling materials composite dry placement curing prevent instruments materials inhaled swallowed damaging mouth dentistry use rubber dam sometimes referred isolation moisture dental dams also used safer oral technique used apply dental dam selected according tooth requiring treatment several techniques used including single tooth isolation multiple tooth isolation split dam technique dental dam prepared punching one holes dental dam sheet enable isolation appropriate number teeth required dental procedure dental dam applied tooth anchored place using metal flexible plastic clamp chosen according tooth area applied clamp ideally fit snugly around tooth along margin gingiva stabilising dental dam preventing contamination working area due saliva ingresscitation needed individuals may experience subjective discomfort due tight sensation dam clamp therefore topical anaesthetic liquid gel may applied gingiva operators discretion prior applying dental prior use rubber

developed metal clamps anchors dam around selected tooth clamps available various shapes sizes designed fit different tooth structures several treatments dental dam applied dental restorations endodontic treatments including root canal therapy fissure sealants preparation dental crown dental implant veneer placements ongoing controversy use efficacy rubber dam among dental practitioners may routinely employ use others may applied selective treatments whereas many others avoid application altogether although use rubber dam considered standard care studies showed large number dental practitioners utilise procedures standard defined reasonable standard supported set rubber dam many elements involves use specific tools accessories usually consist materials may used assist setting

usually depends clinician preference difficult clinical cases standard dental clamp needs adapted one efficient method using carved gypsum cast described nce using rubber dam dental procedures provide multiple advantages rubber dam provide clean dry operating field away substances saliva blood important dental procedures bonding ability adhesives cements heightened clean dry field away possible contamination order maximum adhesive strength restorative materials dentin enamel environment contaminated leading poor bonding materials success longevity restoration update using rubber dam possible isolate one teeth clinicians visibility tooth greatly improved due increase contrast rubber dam around tooth teeth whilst time retracts soft tissues lips tongue cheeks reduces mirror foggingallowing clinician focus solely restorative site lead procedure also even though commonly said rubber dam takes much time apply many ways reduce time needed procedure isolate tooth reduces ability patient communicate clinician beneficial talkative patients sometimes hinder efficiency treatment instead allow time clinician focus task hand order procedure take less timecitation needed cochrane review suggests use rubber dam isolation method provides chance dental restorations last longer disregarding fact lowquality evidence still proof twoyear period comparing restorations done using rubber dams versus cotton roll isolation rubber dam group lower risk failure risk ratio compared cotton roll isolation however research needed varying restorative additionally rubber dam act infection control barrier reduce risk crosscontamination infection case patient may contagious disease rubber dam decreases chance splatter microbial content patient cough spread microbes caused pressure triplex tube syringe used deliver air water rubber dam also protect patients airways eliminate chance decreases possibility patient accidentally swallowing inhaling restorative instruments tooth fragments debris happened past occur patient must always admitted hospital chest xray necessary order discover inhalant may whether may potentially need removed operating table potential lifethreatening instruments debris also chemical materials used dental procedures acid etch seals amalgam harmful effects endodontic procedures corrosive irrigants contained sodium hypochlorite without protection rubber dam increased risk chemical damaging soft tissues mouth harmful swallowed another example amalgam restorations amalgam contains element mercury ingested placing amalgam cause potentially harmful side effects treated however amalgam placed safely evidence suggest exposure mercury level nonharmful safe human rubber dam also offer additional protection soft tissues oral mucosa sharp instruments acting barrier instrument soft tissue additionally associated rubber dam caulking adhesive caulking definition material used seal joints used fill gaps rubber dam gingiva adheres wet rubber dam mucosal tissues acting another mode big issue surrounding rubber dam use part legal obligation parts world use rubber dam obligatory procedures endodontic treatment reason injury occur possible crosscontamination result could prevented rubber dam situation regarded medicolegally indefensible meaning clinician able defend court due duty care falling negligence patient lastly patients fact prefer using rubber dam told understanding risks instead feel comfortable knowing safer without well feeling dissociated noises happening around drilling additionally patients tend comfortable may prefer feeling water suction running within although many advantages rubber dams dental treatment also associated risks disadvantages rubber dam take extra time apply however consistent practice use dental practitioner may effect length appointment insufficient training inconvenience application also deterrent use also contribute lost cost dental dams expense dental practice could also disincentive although rubber dams inexpensive purchase initial costs armamentarium high risk rubber dam clamps breaking application due chemical effects sodium hypochlorite antimicrobial solution used root canal treatments repeated stresses clinical potentially weaken material avoid swallowing aspiration broken clamps dental practitioner place floss around clamp allow retrieval snaps springs procedure dental dam clamp placed along gum line cause discomfort pain especially patient require local anaesthesia bleeding gums damage periodontal ligament abrasion cementum root tooth may cause uneven surface tooth root retain dental dam placed mouth effectively blocking airway means patient must able comfortably breathe nose problem patients nasal airway obstruction common cold broken nose adenoids recurring sinus issues habitually breathe mouths patients also find communication reduced dental practitioner may result feelings claustrophobia vulnerability anxiety prone dental phobia individuals learning difficulties disabilities special needs may find use dental dams impossible extent use dental dam may lead visual distortion tooth morphology since teeth rest mouth hidden view may lead perforation access cavity incorrectly angled root canal therapy reason endodontists may routinely begin access cavity applying dam ensure correct orientation prior commencing removal blood
