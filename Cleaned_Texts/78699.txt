babakotia extinct genus mediumsized lemur strepsirrhine primate madagascar contains single species babakotia radofilai together palaeopropithecus archaeoindris mesopropithecus forms family palaeopropithecidae commonly known sloth lemurs name babakotia comes malagasy name indri babakoto sloth lemurs closely related due mix morphological traits show intermediate stages slowmoving smaller sloth lemurs suspensory large sloth lemurs helped determine relationship groups closely related extinct monkey lemurs babakotia radofilai sloth lemurs share many traits living sloths demonstrating convergent evolution long forearms curved digits highly mobile hip ankle joints skull heavily built indriids much larger sloth lemurs dentition similar indriids sloth lemurs lived northern part madagascar shared range least two sloth lemur species palaeopropithecus ingens mesopropithecus dolichobrachion babakotia radofilai primarily leafeater folivore though also ate fruit hard seeds known subfossil remains may died shortly arrival humans island enough radiocarbon dating done species know certain name genus babakotia derives malagasy common name indri babakoto close relative babakotia species name radofilai chosen honor french mathematician expatriate jean radofilao avid spelunker mapped caves remains babakotia radofilai first babakotia radofilai sole member genus babakotia belongs family palaeopropithecidae includes three genera sloth lemurs palaeopropithecus archaeoindris mesopropithecus family turn belongs infraorder lemuriformes includes malagasy first subfossil remains babakotia radofilai discovered part series expeditions following upon discoveries jean radofilao two anglomalagasy reconnaissance expeditions second wave research launched biological anthropologist elwyn l unearthed cave known antsiroandoha ankarana massif northern madagascar nearly complete skeleton skull addition remains roughly dozen identified immediately sloth lemur palaeopropithecid upon babakotia along mesopropithecus helped settle debate relationship sloth lemurs monkey lemurs family archaeolemuridae living indriids monkey lemurs skulls closely resembled indriids teeth specialized unlike indriids larger sloth lemurs hand retained dentition similar living indriids yet differed robust specialized skulls babakotia mesopropithecus shared indriid dentition also indriidlike skulls providing evidence sloth lemurs closely related living indriids monkey lemurs sister group furthermore discovery babakotia helped demonstrate ancestral indriids ricochetal leapers bouncing rapidly tree tree like living indriids vertical climbers hanging feeders possibly occasional weighing kg lb babakotia radofilai mediumsized lemur noticeably smaller large sloth lemurs archaeoindris palaeopropithecus larger small sloth lemurs many ways intermediate level adaptations suspensory behavior large sloth lemurs small sloth includes highly mobile hip ankle joints well specializations vertebral column pelvis forelimbs longer hind limbs giving higher intermembral index mesopropithecus suggesting convergently similar arboreal reduced tarsus curved elongated digits adapted grasping suggesting suspensory hind feet reduced making welladapted climbing hanging like palaeopropithecids leaping like wrist bones found demonstrated species vertical additionally analysis semicircular lumbar vertebrae spinous processes indicate slow movement climbing antipronograde adaptations necessarily slothlike hanging vertical clinging therefore likely slow climber like loris also exhibited suspensory behavior like daubentoniidae lemuridae cheirogaleidae lepilemuridae indriidae sloth lemurs relatively robust skulls compared yet despite shared cranial features larger sloth skull still resembles cranial traits shared sloth lemurs include relatively small orbits robust zygomatic arches mostly rectangular hard small orbits taken consideration relative size optic canal suggest babakotia low visual acuity typical skull length averages mm dental formula babakotia radofilai sloth lemurs indriids either unclear whether one teeth permanent dentition incisor canine resulting two conflicting dental regardless lack either lower canine incisor results fourtooth toothcomb instead typical sixtooth strepsirrhine toothcomb babakotia radofilai differed slightly indriids somewhat elongated premolars cheek teeth broad shearing crests crenulated like lemurs babakotia radofilai endemic madagascar remains found limestone caves ankarana massif within ankarana reserve anjohibe indicating range across extreme north northwest restricted range arboreal primate particularly time much island blanketed forest might due habitat specificity competitive exclusion unknown sympatric occurred together palaeopropithecus maximus mesopropithecus based size morphology molars microwear analysis teeth babakotia radofilai likely folivore supplementing diet fruit hard sloth lemurs including babakotia radofilai permanent teeth erupted early trait seen indriids improves survivability juveniles first dry season following died relatively recently known subfossil remains considered
