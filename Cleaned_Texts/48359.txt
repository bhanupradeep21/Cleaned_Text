alfaxalone also known alphaxalone alphaxolone sold brand name alfaxan neuroactive steroid general anesthetic used currently veterinary practice induction agent anesthesia injectable though expensive induction often preferred due lack depressive effects cardiovascular system common side effect seen current veterinary practice respiratory depression alfaxan administered concurrently sedative anesthetic drugs premedications arent given veterinary patients also become agitated hypersensitive waking alfaxalone works positive allosteric modulator gabaa receptors high concentrations direct agonist gabaa receptor cleared quickly liver giving relatively short terminal halflife preventing accumulating body lowering chance overdose alfaxalone used induction agent injectable anesthetic sedative commonly used cats dogs also successfully used horses sheep pigs exotics redeared turtles axolotl green iguanas koi induction agent alfaxalone causes animal relax enough intubated allows administration inhalational anesthesia premedication administering sedative drugs prior induction increases potency alfaxalone induction alfaxalone used instead gas anesthetics surgeries minutes given constant rate via iv constant rate infusion especially useful procedures bronchoscopies repairing tracheal tears endotracheal tube administration alfaxalone stops animal quickly recovers alfaxalone used sedative given intramuscularly im though requires larger volume countries allow alfaxalone administered despite use anesthetic alfaxalone analgesic though alfaxalone licensed im subcutaneous use united states cause longer recoveries greater agitation hypersensitivity stimuli routinely used im cats licensed alfaxalone dissolved cyclodextrin large starchderived molecule hydrophobic core alfaxalone stays allowing mixture dissolved water sold aqueous solution act one unit dissociate alfaxalone used perform csections pregnant cats though crosses placental barrier effects kittens respiratory depression lasting effect alfaxalone also found safe young puppies alfaxalone noted good anesthetic agent dogs ventricular arrhythmias seems marked difference sex response anaesthesia male rat requires four times alfaxalone relatively side effects compared anesthetics notable lack cardiovascular depression clinical doses makes unique among common side effect respiratory depression addition apnea prevalent alfaxalone also decrease respiratory rate minute volume oxygen saturation alfaxalone administered slowly period least seconds anesthesia induced quick administration increases risk alfaxalone depressive effects central nervous system including reduction cerebral blood flow intracranial pressure body greyhounds particularly susceptible anesthetic side effects decreased blood flow oxygen supply premedications used alfaxalone causes animals especially cats agitated dogs cats paddle air vocalize excessively may remain rigid twitch exaggerated reactions external stimuli light noise reason recommended animals recovering anesthesia alfaxalone stay quiet dark quick metabolism elimination alfaxalone body decreases chance would take times normal dose cause toxicity doses however cause low blood pressure apnea hypoxia arrhythmia caused apnea alfaxalone neuroactive steroid derived progesterone though glucocorticoid mineralocorticoid instead works acting gabaa binds domains α subunit allosterically modifies receptor facilitate movement chloride ions cell resulting hyperpolarization postsynaptic nerve inhibits actions potentials concentrations alfaxalone binds site interface α β subunits near actual gaba binding site acts gaba agonist similar alfaxalone however share benzodiazepine binding actually prefers different gabaa receptors benzodiazepenes works best research suggests neuroactive steroids increase expression gabaa receptors making difficult build alfaxalone metabolized quickly accumulate body use induction agent thus doesnt increase time needed recover administered slowly diluting sterile water less actual alfaxalone alfaxalone binds plasma terminal halflife minutes dogs minutes cats given clinical doses mgkg mgkg respectively pharmacokinetics nonlinear cats alfaxalone metabolism takes place liver though takes place lungs kidneys liver undergoes phase cytochrome phase ii conjugationdependent metabolism phase products cats dogs allopregnatrione dogs phase ii metabolites alfaxalone glucuronide major metabolite sulfate glucuronide cats greater production sulfate alfaxalone glucuronide cats also present alfaxalone mostly excreted urine though excreted bile well alfaxalone also known synthetic pregnane steroid derivative specifically modification progesterone ketone reduced hydroxyl group double bond positions reduced
