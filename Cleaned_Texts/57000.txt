sex organ also known reproductive organ part organism involved sexual reproduction sex organs constitute primary sex characteristics organism sex organs responsible producing transporting gametes well facilitating fertilization supporting development birth offspring sex organs found many species animals plants features varying depending species sex organs typically differentiated male female types humans male sex organs include testicles penis prostate gland female sex organs include ovaries fallopian tubes uterus cervix vagina vulva animals including humans testicle male ovary female called primary sex sexrelated organs called secondary sex organs divided internal external sex organs external sex organs include genitals external genitalia visible birth needed plants male reproductive structures include stamens flowering plants produce female reproductive structures pistils flowering plants produce ovules receive pollen mosses ferns similar plants gametangia reproductive organs part flowers flowering plants produce pollen egg cells sex organs inside gametophytes within pollen coniferous plants likewise produce sexually reproductive structures within gametophytes contained within cones pollen cones pollen sexual organs together sex organs constitute organisms reproductive primary sex organs gonads pair sex organs diverge testicles following male development ovaries following female developmentcitation needed primary sex organs gonads generate reproductive gametes containing inheritable dna also produce primary hormones affect sexual development regulate sexual organs sexually differentiated behaviors secondary sex organs rest reproductive system whether internal external latin term genitalia sometimes anglicized genitals used describe externally visible sex organs male mammals penis scrotum female mammals vulva general zoology given great variety organs physiologies behaviors involved copulation male genitalia strictly defined male structures inserted female hold near gonopore sperm transferby female genitalia defined parts female reproductive tract make direct contact male genitalia male products sperm spermatophores immediately needed hard find common origin gonads gonads likely evolved independently several first testes ovaries evolved due natural consensus emerged sexual selection represents primary factor genital male genitalia show traits divergent evolution driven sexual visible portion mammalian genitals males consists scrotum penis females consists vulva labia clitoris etc placental mammals females two genital orifices vagina urethra males one male female genitals many nerve endings resulting pleasurable highly sensitive human societies particularly conservative ones exposure genitals considered public humans sex organs

single posterior orifice called cloaca serves opening reproductive digestive urinary tracts present amphibians birds fish mammals monotremes tenrecs golden moles marsupial moles orifice excrete urine

plants involves alternation generations sporophyte haploid gametophyte produces sperm egg cells mitosis sporophyte produces spores meiosis turn develop gametophytes sex organs produced plant develop gametophyte seed plants include conifers flowering plants small gametophytes develop inside pollen grains male ovule female flowering plants flowers contain sex sexual reproduction flowering plants involves union male female germ cells sperm egg cells respectively pollen produced stamens carried pistil ovary base fertilization take place within pollen grain male gametophyte consists three cells flowering plants female gametophyte within ovule consists seven cells thus sex organs sex organs fungi called gametangia fungi sex organs indistinguishable cases male female sex organs clearly similar gametangia similar called isogametangia male female gametangia called heterogametangia occurs majority httpsenwikipediaorgwikimalegenitalia
