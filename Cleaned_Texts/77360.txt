historians remain divided interpretations event frayns play brought attention previously primarily scholarly discussion collection historical essays provoked play published english much initial controversy stemmed letter heisenberg sent journalist robert jungk reading german edition jungks book brighter thousand suns letter heisenberg described come copenhagen discuss bohr moral objections toward scientists working nuclear weapons failed say clearly conversation came halt jungk published extract letter danish edition book context made look heisenberg claiming sabotaged german bomb project moral grounds letters whole text shows heisenberg careful claim bohr outraged reading extract copy book feeling false meeting proven heisenberg quite happy produce nuclear weapons germany play inspired numerous scholarly media debates meeting niels bohr copenhagen released public sealed documents related meeting move intended mostly settle historical arguments contained among documents unsent letters bohr drafted heisenberg jungks book drafts proved significant several respects first proved relatively consistent heisenbergs recollections given jungk meaning course conversation fairly well established bohr heisenberg agree heisenberg started visit stating bohr nuclear weapons conceivable heisenberg wrote jungk talk probably started question whether right physicists devote wartime uranium problem possibility progress sphere could lead grave consequences technique war bohr confirms writing make strong impression outset stated felt certain war lasted sufficiently long would decided atomic weapons heisenberg repeated convictions technical feasibility building nuclear weapons heisenberg recalled bohr replied far remember counterquestion really think uranium fission could utilized construction weapons may replied know principle possible would require terrific technical effort one hope realized war bohr shocked reply bohrs draft letters consistent respond perhaps regarded expression doubt related preceding years devoted almost exclusively question quite certain could done point interest odds suggestion critics miscalculations heisenberg led conclude erroneously atomic weapons according bohrs later notes heisenberg told bohr come discuss technical aspects potential weapons heisenberg said explicitly wish enter technical details bohr understand knew talking spent years working exclusively question unfortunately heisenbergs concerns monitored discussion details germanys nuclear efforts someone occupied country would illegal remarks cryptic indeed bohrs letters note heisenberg spoke vague terms bohr able form impression heisenbergs efforts bohr wrote listened without speaking since great matter mankind issue despite personal friendship regarded representatives two sides engaged mortal combat silence gravity write letter could taken expression shock reports possible make atomic bomb quite peculiar misunderstanding must due great tension mind day three years earlier realized slow neutrons could cause fission uranium course obvious bomb certain effect could produced separating uraniums june even given public lecture birmingham uranium fission talked effects bomb course added technical preparations would large one know soon could overcome anything behaviour could interpreted shock derive reports rather news understand germany participating vigorously race first atomic circumspect discussion combined bohrs shocked reaction apparently cut discussion thus bohr letters resolve question posed copenhagen play heisenberg tried convey bohr heisenbergs comment knew potential weaponizing uranium fission appears counter arguments critics calculation errors feasibility rather moral scruples led heisenberg pursue building nuclear weapons finally bohr draft letters written years meeting suggest conflict bohr heisenberg heisenbergs letter wife written eve departure copenhagen provides hint fracture related final evening
