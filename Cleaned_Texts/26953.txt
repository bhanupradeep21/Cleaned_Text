kimuras disease benign rare chronic inflammatory disorder primary symptoms subdermal lesions head neck painless unilateral inflammation cervical lymph cause remains unknown reasons allergic reaction tetanus toxoid alteration immune regulation suspected theories like persistent antigenic stimulation following arthropod bites parasitic candidal infection also proposed date none theories pathophysiology kimuras disease remains unknown although allergic reaction trauma autoimmune process implicated possible causes disease manifested abnormal proliferation lymphoid follicles vascular endothelium peripheral eosinophilia presence eosinophils inflammatory infiltrate suggest may hypersensitivity reaction evidence indicated lymphocytes may also play role investigation neededcitation

subcutaneous nodules head neck often unilateral frequently associated regional lymphadenopathy without involvement salivary glands sometimes bilateral involvement also seen peripheral blood

remission began within period two inhibition eosinophils may key treatment kimuras disease due role eosinophils rather cells regards lesions radiotherapy used treat recurrent persistent lesions however considering benign nature disease radiation considered cases recurrent disfiguring lesionscitation needed surgery considered mainstay therapy however recurrence surgery eightyearold boy
