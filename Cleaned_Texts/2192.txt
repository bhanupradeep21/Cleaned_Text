taenia solium pork tapeworm belongs cyclophyllid cestode family taeniidae found throughout world common countries pork eaten tapeworm uses humans definitive host pigs intermediate secondary hosts transmitted pigs human feces contain parasite eggs contaminate fodder pigs ingest eggs develop larvae oncospheres ultimately infective tapeworm cysts called cysticercus humans acquire cysts consumption uncooked undercooked pork cysts grow adult worms small intestine two forms human infection one primary hosting called taeniasis due eating undercooked pork contains cysts results adult worms intestines form generally without symptoms infected person know tapeworms form easily treated anthelmintic medications eliminate tapeworm form secondary hosting called cysticercosis due eating food drinking water contaminated faeces someone infected adult worms thus ingesting tapeworm eggs instead cysts eggs go develop cysts primarily muscles usually symptoms however people obvious symptoms
