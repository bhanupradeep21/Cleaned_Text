dna barcoding diet assessment use dna barcoding analyse diet detect describe trophic approach based identification consumed species characterization dna present dietary eg individual food remains regurgitates gut fecal samples homogenized body host organism target diet study example whole body dna sequencing approach adopted depends diet breadth target consumer organisms feeding one species traditional sanger sequencing techniques used polyphagous species diet items difficult identify conceivable determine consumed species using ngs barcode markers utilized amplification differ depending diet target organism herbivore diets standard dna barcode loci differ significantly depending plant taxonomic therefore identifying plant tissue taxonomic family genus level markers rbcl trnlintron used differ loci matk trnhpsba noncoding intergenic spacer used identify diet items genus species animal prey broadly used dna barcode markers identify diets mitochondrial cytochrome c oxydase coi cytochrome b diet broad diverse dna metabarcoding used identify consumed major benefit using dna barcoding diet assessment ability provide high taxonomic resolution consumed indeed compared traditional morphological analysis dna barcoding enables reliable separation closely related taxa reducing observed moreover dna barcoding enables detect soft highly digested items recognisable morphological example arachnids feed predigested bodies insects small animals stomach content decomposed morphologically unrecognizable using traditional methods investigating herbivores diet dna metabarcoding enables detection highly digested plant items higher number taxa identified compared microhistology macroscopic instance nichols et al highlighted taxonomic precision metabarcoding rumen contents average dnasequences identified genus species level comparison plant fragments recognised macroscopy morevoer another empirically tested advantage metabarcoding compared traditional timeconsuming methods involves higher cost finally fine resolution dna barcoding represents crucial tool wildlife management identify feeding habits endangered species animals cause feeding damages dna barcoding possible retrieve information sex age prey species crucial limitation anyway overcome additional step analysis using microsatellite polymorphism ychromosome moreover dna provides detailed information recent events eg hr able provide longer dietary prospect unless continuous sampling additionally using generic primers amplify barcode regions broad range food species amplifiable host dna may largely outnumber presence prey dna complicating prey detection however strategy prevent host dna amplification addition predatorspecific blocking indeed blocking primers suppressing amplification predator dna allows amplification vertebrate groups produces amplicon mixes predominately food despite improvement diet assessment via dna barcoding secondary consumption prey prey parasites etc still represents confounding factor fact secondary prey may result analysis primary prey items introducing bias however due much lower total biomass higher level degradation dna secondary prey might represent minor part sequences recovered compared primary quantitative interpretation dna barcoding results attempts use number sequences recovered estimate abundance prey species diet contents eg gut faeces example wolf ate moose wild boar moose dna gut thus moose sequences recovered despite evidence general correlations sequence number biomass actual evaluations method explained fact tissues originally contain different densities dna digested mammals diet widely studied using dna barcoding metabarcoding differences methodology observed depending feeding strategy target mammal species ie whether herbivore carnivore omnivore herbivore mammal species dna usually extracted faeces rumen contents collected road kills animals killed regular within dna barcoding trnl approach used identify plant species using short informative fragment chloroplast dna loop chloroplast trnl uaa potentially application applicable herbivorous species feeding angiosperms alternatively trnl approach markers rbcl matk trnhpsba used amplify plant species studying small herbivores cryptic life style voles lemmings dna barcoding ingested plants crucial tool giving accurate picture food additionally fine resolution plant identification obtained dna barcoding allows researchers understand change diet composition time variability among individuals observed alpine chamois rupicapra october november analyzing faeces composition via dna barcoding alpine chamois showed shift diet preferences also different diet categories observed amongst individuals within carnivores use noninvasive approaches crucial especially dealing elusive endangered species diet assessment dna barcoding faeces greater efficiency prey species detection compared traditional diet analysis mostly rely upon morphological identification undigested hard remains estimating vertebrate diet diversity leopard cat prionailurus bengalensis pakistan shehzad et al identified total prey taxa using dna barcoding faeces eight distinct bird taxa reported previous studies based conventional methods identify bird species leopard cat another example use dna barcoding identify soft remains prey stomach contents predators eg grey seals halichoerus grypus harbour porpoises phocoena dna metabarcoding game changer study complex diets omnivores predators feeding many different species plants animal methodology require knowledge food consumed animals habitat study brown bear ursus arctos diet dna metabarcoding allowed accurate reconstruction wide range taxonomically different items present faecal
