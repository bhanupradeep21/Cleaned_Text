tsh receptor causes production thyroid hormones subsequent growth vascularisation trabs also useful diagnosis graves ophthalmopathy although exact mechanism trabs induce graves ophthalmopathy unknown likely antibodies bind tsh receptors retroorbital tissues causing infiltration lymphocytes inflammatory response leads cytokine production causes fibroblasts produce glycosaminoglycans leading
