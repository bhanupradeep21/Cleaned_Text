hypotension low blood blood pressure force blood pushing walls arteries heart pumps blood pressure indicated two numbers systolic blood pressure top number diastolic blood pressure bottom number maximum minimum blood pressures systolic blood pressure less millimeters mercury mmhg diastolic less mmhg generally considered different numbers apply however practice blood pressure considered low noticeable symptoms symptoms may include dizziness lightheadedness confusion feeling tired weakness headache blurred vision nausea neck back pain irregular heartbeat feeling heart skipping beats fluttering hypotension opposite hypertension high blood best understood physiological state rather severely low blood pressure deprive brain vital organs oxygen nutrients leading lifethreatening condition called shock classified based underlying cause including hypovolemic shock cardiogenic shock distributive shock obstructive hypotension caused strenuous exercise excessive heat low blood volume hormonal widening blood vitamin heart endocrine medications also lead also syndromes cause hypotension patients including orthostatic vasovagal rarer many people excessively low blood pressure cause dizziness fainting indicate serious heart endocrine neurological people exercise top physical condition low blood pressure could single session exercise induce hypotension waterbased exercise induce hypotensive treatment depends causes low blood treatment hypotension may include use intravenous fluids using vasopressors trying achieve mean arterial pressure map greater mmhg appear result better outcomes trying achieve map greater mmhg many people low blood pressure goes people low blood pressure may sign underlying health condition especially drops suddenly occurs older adults also higher risk symptoms low blood pressure falls fainting dizziness standing blood pressure sufficiently low fainting syncope may low blood pressure sometimes associated certain symptoms many related causes rather effects low blood pressure caused low blood hormonal widening blood vessels medicine side severe vitamin heart endocrine reduced blood volume hypovolemia common cause result hemorrhage insufficient fluid intake starvation excessive fluid losses diarrhea vomiting hypovolemia induced excessive use low blood pressure may also attributed heat stroke indicated absence perspiration light headedness dark colored medications produce hypotension different mechanisms chronic use alpha blockers beta blockers lead beta blockers cause hypotension slowing heart rate decreasing pumping ability heart decreased cardiac output despite normal blood volume due severe congestive heart failure large myocardial infarction heart valve problems extremely low heart rate bradycardia often produces hypotension rapidly progress cardiogenic arrhythmias often result hypotension excessive vasodilation insufficient constriction blood vessels mostly arterioles causes due decreased sympathetic nervous system output increased parasympathetic activity occurring consequence injury brain spinal dysautonomia intrinsic abnormality autonomic system functioning also lead excessive vasodilation also result acidosis medications nitrate preparations calcium channel blockers receptor antagonists angiotensin ii acts receptors many anesthetic agents techniques including spinal anesthesia inhalational agents produce significant lower blood pressure side effect certain herbal also interact several medications example theobromine theobroma cacao lowers blood actions vasodilator used treat high blood orthostatic hypotension also called postural hypotension common form low blood occurs change body position typically person stands either seated lying usually transient represents delay normal compensatory ability autonomic nervous commonly seen hypovolemia result various addition blood pressurelowering medications many psychiatric medications particular antidepressants side simple blood pressure heart rate measurements lying seated standing twominute delay position change confirm presence orthostatic taking measurements known orthostatic orthostatic hypotension indicated drop mmhg systolic pressure mmhg drop diastolic pressure facilities beats per minute increase heart vasovagal syncope form dysautonomia characterized inappropriate drop blood pressure upright vasovagal syncope occurs result increased activity vagus nerve mainstay parasympathetic nervous patients feel sudden unprovoked lightheadedness sweating changes vision finally loss consciousness often return rapidly patient lying blood pressure returns another rarer form postprandial hypotension drastic decline blood pressure occurs minutes eating substantial great deal blood diverted intestines kind splanchnic blood pooling facilitate digestion absorption body must increase cardiac output peripheral vasoconstriction maintain enough blood pressure perfuse vital organs postprandial hypotension believed caused autonomic nervous system compensating appropriately aging specific hypotension feature flammer syndrome characterized cold hands feet predisposes normal tension hypotension symptom relative energy deficiency sport sometimes known female athlete triad although also affect blood pressure continuously regulated autonomic nervous system using elaborate network receptors nerves hormones balance effects sympathetic nervous system tends raise blood pressure parasympathetic nervous system lowers vast rapid compensation abilities autonomic nervous system allow normal individuals maintain acceptable blood pressure wide range activities many disease even small alterations networks lead adults optimal blood pressure systolic blood pressure mm hg systolic mm hg diastolic within minutes orthostatic hypotension associated increased risk future cardiovascular events mortality orthostatic vitals frequently measured assist diagnosis orthostatic may involve use tilt table test evaluate vasovagal treatment depends causes low blood treatment may needed asymptomatic low blood depending symptoms treatment may include drinking fluids prevent dehydration taking medicines raise blood pressure adjusting medicines cause low blood adding electrolytes diet relieve symptoms mild hypotension morning dose caffeine also chronic hypotension rarely exists symptom mild cases patient still responsive laying person back lifting legs increases venous return thus making blood available critical organs chest trendelenburg position though used historically longer hypotensive shock treatment always follows first four following steps outcomes terms mortality directly linked speed hypotension stilldebated methods parentheses benchmarks evaluating progress correcting hypotension study septic shock provided delineation general however since focuses hypotension due infection applicable forms severe hypotension best way determine person benefit fluids passive leg raise followed measuring output chronic hypotension sometimes requires use medications commonly used include fludrocortisone erythropoietin sympathomimetics midodrine noradrenaline precursor definition hypotension changes pediatric population depending childs age seen table clinical history provided caretaker important part determining cause hypotension pediatric symptoms children hypotension include increased sleepiness using restroom much difficulty breathing breathing rapidly treatment hypotension pediatric patients similar treatment adults following four first steps listed see children likely undergo intubation treatment hypotension oxygen levels drop rapidly closing fetal shunts following birth create instability transitional circulation fetus often creates state hypotension following birth many infants overcome hypotension closing shunts mean blood pressure mbp lower mmhg correlated severe cerebral injury experienced premature infants poor shunt hypotension ancient greek hypo meaning less english tension meaning strain refers underconstriction blood vessels arteries leads low blood httpsenwikipediaorgwikihypotension
