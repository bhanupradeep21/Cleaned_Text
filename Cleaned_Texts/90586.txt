conditioned taste aversion occurs animal acquires aversion taste food paired aversive stimuli garcia effect explains aversion develops strongly stimuli cause nausea stimuli considered adaptive trait survival mechanism enables organism avoid poisonous substances eg poisonous berries cause harm aversion reduces consuming substance something tastes similar future thus avoiding poisoning studies conditioned taste aversion involved irradiating rats conducted dr john leading sometimes called garcia effect conditioned taste aversion occur sickness merely coincidental caused substance consumed example person becomes sick consuming vodkaandorangejuice cocktails may become averse taste orange juice even though sickness caused overconsumption alcohol circumstances conditioned taste aversion sometimes known saucebearnaise syndrome term coined seligman studying effects radiation various behaviors mid late dr garcia noticed rats developed aversion substances consumed prior irradiated examine garcia put together study three groups rats given sweetened water followed either radiation mild radiation strong radiation rats subsequently given choice sweetened water regular tap water rats exposed radiation drank much less sweetened water finding surprising aversion could occur single trial long delay stimuli research time found learning required multiple trials shorter latencies many scientists skeptical garcias findings follow broad array previous results neutral stimulus could made aversive reinforcing pairing aversive reinforcing stimuli however garcias results clear replicated different settings compelling experiment compared pairing nausea taste versus pairing light sound stimuli bright noisy water strong aversions developed taste stimuli light sound demonstrated particular stimulus used conditioning matter stimulus pairings generate stronger aversion conditioned taste aversion also speciesspecific also challenge previous results taste aversion require cognitive awareness organism consciously recognize connection perceived cause taste effect aversion fact subject may hope enjoy substance aversion persists also taste aversion generally requires one trial classical conditioning requires several pairings neutral stimulus eg ringing bell unconditioned stimulus ie meat powder neutral stimulus elicits response salivation taste aversion food become aversive one pairing sickness addition respondent behavior generally requires brief intervals neutral stimulus unconditioned stimulus taste aversion however hotdog person eats lunch may become aversive result vomiting person evening flavor encountered organism becomes ill effect strong present quality called latent inhibition conditioned taste aversion often used laboratories study gustation learning rats aversions developed odors well tastes common vampire bats desmodus rotundus learn taste aversions despite closely related species bats diet common vampire bats consists vertebrate blood therefore hypothesized development taste aversion food source would advantageous taste aversion common humans humans eat bad food eg spoiled meat get sick may later find particular food aversive food cause sickness become aversive human eats sushi first time happens come unrelated stomach virus may still develop aversion sushi even something obvious riding roller coaster causing nausea eating sushi influence development taste aversion sushi humans might also develop aversions certain types alcoholic beverages vomiting intoxication mechanism disulfram drug used treat alcohol dependence inhibiting aldehyde dehydrogenase causes rapid buildup hangovercausing compound acetaldehyde consuming alcoholic beverages thereby pairing negative stimulus consumption alcohol certain cephalosporin antibiotic medications like cefotetan cefazolin metabolized compound similar effects blocking acetaldehyde metabolism cause hangovers upon alcohol ingestion taste aversion common problem chemotherapy patients become nauseated drug therapy develop aversions food taste aversion demonstrated wide variety captive freeranging predators studies animals consume bait laced undetectable dose aversion agent avoid baits live prey taste scent baits predators detect aversion agent baits quickly form aversions baits discriminate differenttasting live prey stimulus generalization another learning phenomenon illustrated conditioned taste aversion phenomenon demonstrates tend develop aversions even types food resemble foods caused us illness example one eats orange gets sick one might also avoid eating tangerines clementines smell taste similar oranges stimulus generalization applies beyond food tastes aversion trauma aversive events kinds create aversion generalizations events like taste aversion generalization may conscious stimulus generalization factor superstitious behavior racism prejudice kinds although terms taste avoidance taste aversion often used interchangeably studies rats indicate necessarily synonymous rat may avoid food yet still enjoy choose others rats tested sucrose solution paired drug gave positive euphoric effects amphetamine cocaine morphine emitted positive reactions drugs yet avoided approaching solutions one solutions placed next another solution rats given conditioned taste aversion rat would choose aversive scientists theorize terms evolution rats unable vomit immediately purge toxins rats developed strong first line defense sense taste smell shows importance taste correlation taste change physiological state whether good bad rats rely upon taste pairing reaction rather relying later responses involve gastrointestinal tract taste avoidance prevalent taste aversion though two dont necessarily go hand
