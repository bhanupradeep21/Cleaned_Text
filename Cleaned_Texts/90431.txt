diagnosis requires presence psychotic symptoms least two weeks without mood symptoms unipolar psychotic depression requires psychotic symptoms occur severe depressive episodes although residual psychotic symptoms may also present episodes eg remission mild depression diagnosis using involves meeting criteria major depressive episode along criteria moodcongruent moodincongruent psychotic

retardation typically psychotic symptoms tend develop individual already several episodes depression without however psychotic symptoms emerged tend reappear future depressive prognosis psychotic depression considered poor schizoaffective disorders primary psychotic still experienced depressive episode psychotic features increased risk relapse suicide compared without psychotic features tend pronounced sleep family members experienced psychotic depression increased risk psychotic depression patients psychotic depression report initial episode ages depressive episodes psychotic depression tends episodic symptoms lasting certain amount time subsiding psychotic depression chronic lasting years depressive episodes last less months study conducted kathleen bingham found patients receiving appropriate treatment psychotic depression went remission reported quality life similar people without number biological features may distinguish psychotic depression nonpsychotic depression significant difference may presence abnormality hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis hpa hpa axis appears dysregulated psychotic depression dexamethasone suppression tests demonstrating higher levels cortisol following dexamethasone administration ie lower cortisol psychotic depression also higher ventricularbrain ratios nonpsychotic psychotic symptoms often missed psychotic depression either patients think symptoms abnormal attempt conceal symptoms hand psychotic depression may confused schizoaffective due overlapping symptoms differential diagnosis includes also dissociative several treatment guidelines recommend pharmaceutical treatments include either combination secondgeneration antidepressant atypical antipsychotic tricyclic antidepressant monotherapy electroconvulsive therapy ect firstline treatment unipolar psychotic evidence use evidence indicating combination therapy antidepressant plus antipsychotic effective treating psychotic depression either antidepressant treatment alone context psychotic depression following wellstudied antidepressantantipsychotic combinations firstgeneration secondgeneration insufficient evidence determine treatment antidepressant alone tricyclic antidepressants may particularly dangerous overdosing potential cause fatal cardiac insufficient evidence determine treatment antipsychotic medications alone olanzapine may effective monotherapy psychotic although evidence ineffective depressive symptoms olanzapinefluoxetine quetiapine monotherapy may particularly helpful psychotic depression since antidepressant antipsychotic
