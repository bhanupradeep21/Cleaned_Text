humanized antibodies antibodies nonhuman species whose protein sequences modified increase similarity antibody variants produced naturally process humanization usually applied monoclonal antibodies developed administration humans example antibodies developed anticancer drugs humanization necessary process developing specific antibody involves generation nonhuman immune system mice protein sequences antibodies produced way partially distinct homologous antibodies occurring naturally humans therefore potentially immunogenic administered human patients see also human antimouse antibody international nonproprietary names humanized antibodies end zumab omalizumab see nomenclature monoclonal antibodies humanized antibodies distinct chimeric antibodies latter also protein sequences made similar human antibodies carry larger stretch nonhuman protein ways develop monoclonal antibodies list covers many monoclonals developed use humans humanization process takes advantage fact production monoclonal antibodies accomplished using recombinant dna create capable expression mammalian cell culture gene segments capable producing antibodies isolated cloned cells grown bioreactor antibody proteins produced dna cloned genes harvested en masse step involving recombinant dna provides intervention point readily exploited alter protein sequence expressed antibody alterations antibody structure achieved humanization process therefore effectuated techniques dna level methods deriving antibodies intended human therapy require humanization step eg phage display essentially dependent techniques similarly allow insertion swappingout portions antibody molecule humanization usually seen distinct creation mousehuman antibody chimera although creation antibody chimera normally undertaken achieve humanlike antibody replacing constant region mouse antibody human simple chimeras type usually referred humanized rather protein sequence humanized antibody essentially identical human variant despite nonhuman origin complementaritydetermining region cdr segments responsible ability antibody bind target antigen chimeric antibody names contain xi stem examples chimeric antibodies approved human therapy include abciximab reopro basiliximab simulect cetuximab erbitux infliximab remicade rituximab mabthera also several examples chimerics currently clinical trials eg bavituximab see sortable list additional examples humanization process may also include creation mousehuman chimera initial step case mouse variable region spliced human constant region chimera humanized selectively altering sequence amino acids variable region molecule alteration process must selective retain specificity antibody originally developed since cdr portions variable region essential ability antibody bind intended target amino acids portions altered without risk undermining purpose development aside cdr segments portions variable regions differ humans corrected exchanging appropriate individual amino acids accomplished dna level mutagenesis naming humanized chimeras includes stem designations xi zu otelixizumab example humanized chimera currently clinical trials treatment rheumatoid arthritis diabetes possible produce humanized antibody without creating chimeric intermediate direct creation humanized antibody accomplished inserting appropriate cdr coding segments socalled donor responsible desired binding properties human antibody scaffold socalled acceptor discussed achieved recombinant dna methods using appropriate expression mammalian cells antibody developed desired properties mouse nonhuman dna coding antibody isolated cloned vector sequenced dna sequenced directly using singlecell methods dna sequence corresponding antibody cdrs determined precise sequence desired cdrs known strategy devised inserting sequences appropriately construct containing dna human antibody strategy may also employ synthesis linear dna fragments based reading cdr sequences process requires computermodelling software determine antibodys amino acids changed murinesequence humansequence without changes compromising conformation binding site united states software developed patented demonstrated protein design labs inc mountain view california alemtuzumab early example antibody whose humanization include chimeric intermediate case monoclonal dubbed developed bind using mouse system hypervariable loops contain cdrs thereby impart ability bind extracted inserted human antibody alemtuzumab approved treatment bcell chronic lymphocytic currently clinical trials variety conditions including multiple technologies completely avoid use mice nonhuman mammals process discovering antibodies human therapy examples systems include various display methods primarily phage display well methods exploit elevated bcell levels occur human immune response employ selective principles specific antibody production exploit microorganisms phage display even cell free extracts ribosome display systems rely creation antibody gene libraries wholly derived human rna isolated peripheral blood immediate products systems antibody fragments normally fab scfv means although antibody fragments created using display methods fully human sequence full antibodies therefore processes essence identical humanization used incorporate express derived affinities within full antibody adalimumab humira example antibody approved human therapy created phage possible exploit human immune reaction discovery monoclonal antibodies simply put human immune response works way mouse nonhuman mammal therefore persons experiencing challenge immune system infectious disease cancer vaccination potential source monoclonal antibodies directed challenge approach seems especially apt development antiviral therapies exploit principles passive immunity variants approach demonstrated finding way commercial immune activation dostarlimab ibalizumab
