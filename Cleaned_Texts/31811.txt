sinoatrial node also known sinuatrial node sa node sinus node oval shaped region special cardiac muscle upper back wall right atrium made cells known pacemaker cells sinus node approximately mm long mm wide mm thick located directly side superior vena cells produce electrical impulse known cardiac action potential travels electrical conduction system heart causing contract healthy heart sa node continuously produces action potentials setting rhythm heart sinus rhythm known hearts natural pacemaker rate action potentials produced therefore heart rate influenced nerves supply sinoatrial node ovalshaped structure approximately mm long mm wide mm thick located directly side superior vena size vary usually mm long mm wide mm sa node located wall epicardium right atrium laterally entrance superior vena cava region called sinus venarum hence sino positioned roughly groove called crista terminalis located internal surface heart corresponding sulcus terminalis external grooves run entrance superior vena cava inferior vena cava cells sa node spread within mesh connective tissue containing nerves blood vessels collagen fat immediately surrounding sa node cells paranodal cells structures intermediate sa node cells rest connective tissue along paranodal cells insulate sa node rest atrium preventing electrical activity atrial cells affecting sa node sa node cells smaller paler surrounding atrial cells average cell around micrometers diameter micrometers length micrometer unlike atrial cells sa node cells contain fewer mitochondria myofibers well smaller sarcoplasmic reticulum means sa node cells less equipped contract compared atrial ventricular action potentials pass one cardiac cell next pores known gap junctions gap junctions made proteins called connexins fewer gap junctions within sa node smaller size important insulating sa node surrounding atrial sinoatrial node receives blood supply sinoatrial nodal artery blood supply however differ hugely individuals example humans single artery although cases either sinoatrial node arteries supplying sa node also sa node artery mainly originates branch right coronary artery however individuals arisen circumflex artery branch left coronary artery finally sa node artery commonly passes behind superior vena cava reaching sa node however instances passes front despite many differences appear advantage many sinoatrial nodal arteries individual large veins drain blood away sa node instead smaller venules drain blood directly right main role sinoatrial node cell initiate action potentials heart pass cardiac muscle cells cause contraction action potential rapid change membrane potential produced movement charged atoms ions absence stimulation nonpacemaker cells including ventricular atrial cells relatively constant membrane potential known resting potential resting phase see cardiac action potential phase ends action potential reaches cell produces positive change membrane potential known depolarization propagated throughout heart initiates muscle contraction pacemaker cells however resting potential instead immediately repolarization membrane potential cells begins depolarise automatically phenomenon known pacemaker potential pacemaker potential reaches set value threshold potential produces action cells within heart including purkinje atrioventricular node also initiate action potentials however slower rate therefore sa node functioning properly action potentials usually override would produced outlined phases sinoatrial node action potential cardiac action potential

supplying sa node particular vagus nerves originate brain nerves release neurotransmitter called acetylcholine ach ach binds receptor called muscarinic receptor located sa node membrane activation receptor activates protein called gprotein particular gi protein inhibitory activation gprotein blocks camp pathway reducing effects therefore inhibiting sympathetic activity slowing action potential production gprotein also activates potassium channel allows k flow cell making membrane potential negative slowing pacemaker potential therefore decreasing rate action potential production therefore decreasing heart decrease heart rate known negative chronotropy first cell produce action potential sa node isnt always known pacemaker shift certain species example superior shift ie cell produces fastest action potential sa node higher previously usually produces increased heart rate whereas inferior shift ie cell producing fastest action potential within sa node previously produces decreased
