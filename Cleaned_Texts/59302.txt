synaptotropic hypothesis also called synaptotrophic hypothesis neurobiological hypothesis neuronal growth synapse formation hypothesis first formulated je vaughn remains focus current research synaptotropic hypothesis proposes input presynaptic postsynaptic cell maturation excitatory synaptic inputs eventually change course synapse formation dendritic axonal arbors synapse formation required development neuronal structure functioning dendrites central nervous system neurons grow addition retraction thin branches process highly dynamic small fraction newly added branches actually maintained become longlasting components arbor process suggests branches sample environment detect appropriate cells form result hypothesis predicts growth directed regions containing presynaptic morphology stabilized creating microtubule nucleation formation new synapses begins initial contact cells via cellcell adhesion contact often occurs either axonal dendritic filopodia highly dynamic rarely stabilize next adhesive contact converted nascent synapse contains glutamatergic nmda receptors ampa receptors however activation nmdars glutamate trigger recruitment ampars postsynaptic density also relatively high concentration densecore vesicles thought deliver structural proteins presynaptic maturation glutamatergic synapses involves changes amplitude ampa receptormediated synaptic transmission well nmdar subunit composition includes assembly postsynaptic density proteindense region structural signaling functions synaptic vesicles also recruited resulting increase reliability synaptic although neurons generally follow basic morphological pattern consisting treelike dendritic arbor cell body axonal output number preand postsynaptic elements unique every neuron central understanding complex neural function synaptotropic hypothesis implies function drives form since appropriateness new synapses constantly tested filopodia first stages dendritogenesis thus determining form neural interpret synaptotropic hypothesis saying manipulations increase synapse formation maturation promote formation larger dendritic arbors treatments reduce synapse maturation result smaller arbors however opposite result found different manipulations molecular pathways underlying synaptogeneis resulting modified version hypothesis emerged graded levels synaptic maturation produce corresponding levels stabilization different way viewing synaptotropic hypothesis still takes account molecular mechanisms dendritogenesis synaptogenesis synaptotropic hypothesis would predict cell adhesion molecules important synapse formation would also greatly affect dendritic arbor growth shown case peptides mimic cytoplasmic tails ampa receptors expressed individual xenopus neurons trafficking ampa receptors nascent synapses minimized cells cells like normal neurons extend retract dendritic branches normal cell branches would form synapses case neurons expressing peptide result cells minimal dendritic without ampa receptors neuron cant cause neighboring neurons fire action potentials therefore disallowing synapses strengthen described previously pattern dendritic branching depends initial contact filopodia afferent axons hypothesis predicts regions numerous prospective presynaptic terminals attract growing dendrites researchers used developing mouse spinal cord test hypothesis computerassisted threedimensional reconstruction system used golgis method preparations mouse spinal cords relative dendritic lengths densities various zones spinal cord indicate dendritic growth initially primarily towards marginal zone synaptogenic presynaptic terminals however biased distribution lost synapses form intermediate zone study consistent predictions synaptotropic hypothesis dendritic evidence synaptotropic hypothesis comes experiments munc knockout mice mice engineered missing munc protein without mice never release neurotransmitters synaptic vesicles despite mice develop normal brains dying immediately dynamic morphometrics technology involves new methods labeling imaging quantifying dendritogenesis transparent externally developing vertebrate embryos xenopus laevis zebrafish allow direct imaging organism critical stages development keeping embryos intact individual brain neurons fluorescently labeled using single cell electroporation leaving rest brain unaltered also twophoton microscopy allows vivo timelapse imaging create highresolution images neurons deep within living brain minimal damage brain new computer software also track measure dendritic methods comprise new type imaging technology monitor process dendritogenesis help give evidence either dissent support synaptotropic hypothesis dynamic morphometrics imaging techniques used observe dendrite growth processes relationship well understood nonspiny dendritic arbors expressing fluorescent postsynaptic marker protein imaged arborized zebrafish larvae confirmed role newly extended dendritic filopodia synaptogenesis maturation dendritic branches result namely growth branching dendritic findings support model wherein synapse formation direct dendrite arborization basic
