availability fungus important food source c goeldii throughout year also contributes multiple mother carries single baby monkey per pregnancy whereas species family callitrichidae usually give birth twins singleton births provide offspring longer maternal care weaning delay results faster growth rates turn earlier sexual maturity first weeks mother acts primary caregiver father helpers often

amount explains delay allocare c goeldii since crucial counterparts cooperative care callitrichines therefore necessary help mothers recover gestation parturition lactation well share energetic cost carrying infant among helpers caregivers must also provide food infants turn weeks age task food provisioning includes tolerance food robbing since infants stage learning forage also week mothers stop
