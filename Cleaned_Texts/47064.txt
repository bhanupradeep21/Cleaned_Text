soybean genome twice large entire rice genome initial strategy iwgsc produce physical maps individual chromosome sequence get reference genome sequence time whole genome sequencing approaches yield high quality sequence assemblies due extremely high amount repetitive sequences wheat genome feuillet team first establish physical map chromosome published journal science paved way teams complete physical maps chromosomes reference sequence chromosome published feuillet team concomitantly publications draft sequence individual chromosome iwgsc journal reference sequence chromosome revealed striking patterns genes distribution along chromosome better understanding organization function evolution large polyploid genomes wheat draft sequence chromosomes enabled first time annotation genes comparative evolutionary analyses diploid tetraploid wheat relatives sequences anchored many molecular markers genetic maps provided springboard faster gene isolation rapid genetic marker development precise breeding genome editing accelerate wheat following breakthrough nrgene capacity perform assembly highly repetitive sequences iwgsc combined physical mapbased sequencing whole genome sequencing approaches produce first version high quality reference sequence bread wheat published alongside publications exemplifying use high quality sequence since publications referring use iwgsc reference sequence published demonstrating usefulness sequence fulfilling vision feuillet colleagues iwgsc established sequencing wheat genome completely important producers world wheat currently makes calories consumed world global population increases need recently however wheat production stagnating technological advances keep negative economic natural total demand wheat expected increase percent year increase percent per year gonzalez sequencing genome provided invaluable resource scientists accelerate wheat improvement capacity wheat cope climate change produced sustainable environmentally
