peripheral ulcerative keratitis puk group destructive inflammatory diseases involving peripheral cornea human symptoms puk include pain redness eyeball photophobia decreased vision accompanied distinctive signs crescentshaped damage causes disease broad ranging injuries contamination contact lenses association systemic puk associated different ocular systemic moorens ulcer common form majority puk mediated local systemic immunological processes lead inflammation eventually tissue damage standard puk diagnostic test involves reviewing medical history completing physical two major treatments use medications corticosteroids immunosuppressive agents surgical resection prognosis puk unclear one study providing potential puk rare condition estimated incidence per million easily identifiable sign visible lesion cornea presented usually crescent common reasons destruction stromal degradation epithelial defects inflammatory would change conformation peripheral cornea depending severity corneal process usually accompanied possibility concealing formation ovalshaped ulcer margin cornea also symptoms puk include pain redness tearing increased sensitivity bright light impaired blurred vision feeling foreign objects trapped several associations puk ocular systemic rheumatoid arthritis wegners granulomatosis wg polyarteritis nodosa pan common systemic three major causes puk one possible cause injury due kind scratches sharp hard objects surface scratched area forms opening cornea allowing microorganisms access cornea lead contamination contact lenses another cause fungi bacteria parasites microscopic parasite acanthamoeba particular could inhabit surface carrying case contact placing contact lens ones eyes invisible microorganisms may contaminate cornea resulting extended period wearing contact lenses could also cause damage cornea surface allowing entry microorganisms contamination contact lenses contamination occurring water could also cause puk especially places like ocean rivers lakes hot tubs massive amounts bacteria fungi parasites injury cornea surface contact contaminated water could transfer unwanted microorganisms cornea resulting virus bacteria sources infection cornea herpes virus bacteria cause gonorrhea corneal epithelium consists five six layers cells total thickness around cornea thickens towards periphery stroma accounts corneal thickness refers middle layer epithelium present peripheral cornea act transitional zone sclera limbal vasculature deriving capillaries surround peripheral cornea supplies various molecules normally diffuse capillaries periphery central limited diffusion higher concentration igm factor complement cascade langerhans kind inflammatory stimulus present peripheral cornea results recruitment neutrophil activation classical alternative pathways immune response namely humoral cellmediated autoimmune responses lead formation antigenspecific antibodies combat foreign however antigenantibody complexes formed may deposit vascular endothelium activate complements leading severe local circumstance inflammatory cells macrophages neutrophils enter peripheral inflammatory cells release enzymes protease collagenases causing potential disruption corneal additional release cytokines example cells accelerates process stromal moorens ulcer common form one classification moorens ulcer based clinical presentation includes bilateral indolent moorens ulcer bilateral aggressive moorens ulcer unilateral moorens unilateral moorens ulcer meaning ulcer one eye mainly affects elderly years old rapid onset redness severe pain affected eye either slow extremely quick progression typical characteristics unilateral moorens bilateral aggressive moorens ulcer prevalent indian age common presentation includes appearance lesions one eye followed development lesions another finally bilateral indolent moorens ulcer common patients least usually progresses slowly causes little classification methods also exist first one classifying moorens ulcers based clinical presentation prognosis two first type usually presented unilaterally accompanied symptoms ranging mild therefore effective response treatment contrast type ii appears bilateral manner severe symptoms poor outcome second classification based grade refers corneal thinning grade ii describes impending corneal perforation grade iii corneal perforation diameter greater many investigative modalities available diagnosing puk including history review physical thorough history ocular infections contact lens usage medication surgery necessary identify possible presence associated ophthalmic examination helps identify whether due local physical examinations allow understanding underlying systemic standard testing procedure includes hematological investigations immunological testing followed chest xray hematological investigations blood tests estimating hemoglobin platelet counts total white blood cell counts erythrocyte sedimentation rate common body checks include urinalysis liver renal function selection immunological testing various markers based numerous additional medical examinations clinical history possible markers antinuclear antibodies antirheumatoid antibodies antibodies cyclic citrullinated finally chest xray helps distinguish whether complications pulmonary diseases due systemic conditions associated one common causes puk ocular infections microorganisms bacteria viruses detect causative microorganism doctors usually collect samples commencement therapy send laboratory personnel perform smear examination inoculate samples culture media perform serological serological testing antibody test providing information puk diagnosis puk due systemic conditions requires combination serological hematological testing together imaging techniques radiography ct various puk therapies different objectives example inflammation control halting disease progression stroma repairment avoidance secondary complications vision thorough understanding puk different therapies medical surgical treatments two major approaches manage medical therapy several types drugs available puk topical corticosteroids usually serve therapy milder unilateral cases raassociated systemic corticosteroids form oral dose acute management severe however side effects prolonged usage oral corticosteroids immunosuppressive agents azathioprine cyclophosphamide methotrexate demonstrated efficacy treating inflammatory eye diseases including combined therapy systemic corticosteroids mgday immunosuppressive agents used severe cases biological agents antitissue necrosis factors antitnf wellestablished treatment systemic inflammatory infliximab adalimumab tnf blockers treating raassociated however high cost uncertainty longterm side effects possible terms surgical treatment conjunctival resection common procedure temporarily remove local inflammatory mediators collagenases therefore slow disease surgical management includes corneal gluing keratoplasty corneal transplantation management option severe corneal melting perforation although one possible disadvantage risk surgical treatment helps maintain integrity globe usually complementary alone influence underlying immunological therefore medical surgical treatments commonly used choice treatment may different depending nature puk infectious noninfectious selection right targeted antimicrobial therapy infectious puk based clinical judgement culture example appropriate treatment bacterial infections antibiotics moorens ulcers unilateral puk bilateral puk one eye showed recovery intensive topical patients bilateral ulcers occurring simultaneously eyes show improvements topical steroids alone therefore combination immunosuppressive agents systemic steroids given early courses corticosteroids first line therapy side effects may arise longterm usage addition conjunctival resection performed temporarily remove local inflammatory mediators followed use currently limited studies regarding prognosis puk however one study pointed possible complications surrounding puk include moderate severe vision loss corneal perforation increased risk puk rare condition estimated incidence per million studies reported patients puk older years age among men higher occurrence rate men patients live rural areas lower socioeconomic age puk ranges years mean age mortality rate puk diagnosis investigation patients without immunosuppressive medication another singlecentre study involving patients ra reported mortality rate reports also shown possibility puk occurrence ocular retrospective study eyes participants reported developing lateonset puk average months
