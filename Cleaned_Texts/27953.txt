tcrmhc extent crossreactivity tcr elucidation structural trigger tcr garcias recent work lab developed peptidemhc library technology enabled discovery antigens orphan cell receptors resident tumors technology also enabled breakthrough understanding signaling initiated pmhc engagement garcias research established structural biophysical principles govern receptor binding signal activation many different cytokine systems key findings include determination first crystal structures following cytokine family members complex surface receptors family common gamma γc family type interferons type iii garcia laboratory also determined crystal structures many major cytokinereceptor complexes including lif cntf structures revealed wide range binding topologies architectures demonstrate convergent evolution provided many solutions cytokine receptors transduce signals across cell membrane addition molecular studies cytokines garcias group also used directed evolution engineer high affinity cytokine variants ifnλ improved therapeutic garcias laboratory determined crystal structure wnt protein complex cellular receptor wntfrizzled structure indicated wnts utilize posttranslational lipid modification directly engage frizzled extracellular domain represents highly unusual binding mode among soluble ligands garcias study revealed striking donutshaped architecture adopted wntfrizzled complex adorns cover july issue recently garcias laboratory reported breakthrough able recapitulate canonical wnt signaling using watersoluble bispecific ligands dimerize frizzled important implications development therapeutics regenerative garcia published articles science describing first atomiclevel visualizations notch signaling garcias group used directed evolution strengthen lowaffinity interactions receptor ligands deltalike means stabilizing complexes cocrystallization structures determined xray crystallography revealed long narrow binding interfaces assisted multiple olinked fucose glucose modifications olinked glycans rarely observed proteinprotein interfaces presence notchligand interface explained changes glycosylation state influence notch signaling activity garcias publication also established notchligand interactions form catch bonds deltalike jagged ligands different mechanical force thresholds notch receptor garcia laboratory reported xray crystal
