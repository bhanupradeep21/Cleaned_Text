small steps child achieves towards reaching larger goal concept called successive pmt also teaches parents appropriately set limits using structured techniques response childs negative behavior different ways parents taught respond positive versus negative behavior children sometimes referred differential reinforcement mildly annoying dangerous behavior parents practice ignoring behavior following unwanted behavior parents also introduced proper use timeout technique parents remove attention serves form reinforcement child specified period parents also learn remove childs privileges
