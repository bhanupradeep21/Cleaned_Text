passive antibody therapy also called serum therapy subtype passive immunotherapy administers antibodies immunoglobin target kill pathogens cancer designed draw support foreign antibodies donated person extracted animals made laboratory elicit immune response instead relying innate immune system fight disease long history century treating infectious diseases common cancer treatment mechanism actions include antagonistic agonistic reaction complementdependent cytotoxicity cdc antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity adcc passive antibody therapy first propounded emil von behring shibasaburo kitasato treat diphtheria observation immunization rabbits injecting serum tetanusimmunized rabbits later paul ehrlich joined behrings kitasatos research ameliorate immunizability lethal toxins established basis antibody immunotherapy ideology using antibody serum treat infectious diseases three scientists standardized serum production dairy cows merchandised serum vaccines tetanus diphtheria prevalence serum therapy surged early century influenza pandemic spanish flu struck us europe serum containing antibodies recovered patients prevalently injected patients proven therapeutic effects applications expanded viral bacterial infections pneumococcus meningococcus rabies despite unknown underlying mechanism yet severe anaphylactic reactions hypersensitivity common ergo serum therapy pulled market resurrection antibody immunotherapy contributed cesar milstein georges j f kohler manifested mass production pure monoclonal antibodies limited adverse effects since passive antibody therapy become prevailed cancer therapeutics viral treatments high specificity low crossreactivity high sensitivity high overall affinity bind target antigen quicker long production time overall affinity lower polyclonal antibodies low specificity high crossreactivity monoclonal antibodies manufactured ex vivo single b lymphocyte serum immunized animals humans first extracted purified collect b lymphocytes spleen fused plasma cell myeloma culturing fused myeloma cell lines colonies selected antigens positive colonies suitable antibodies bind epitope antigen kill pathogens whereas colonies without targeted antibodies upon injection homogenous antibodies produced single b cell target specific epitope major advantage using monoclonal antibodies specific action towards target since contains one antibody binding site per se minimizes crossreactivity activity antibodies unintentionally bind nontargeted however monoclonal antibodies also mean overall affinity lower owing limited ability recognize different epitopes antigens may lead incomplete elimination pathogens tumor cells production time cost high well limiting generalizability prevalence process manufacturing polyclonal antibodies similar monoclonal antibodies begins inoculation antigen conjugate suitable animals except multiple b lymphocytes collected cultured instead single b production polyclonal antibodies circumvents procedure ex vivo fabrication hybridoma cell line requires minimal purification manufacturing cost time wherefore reduced due heterogeneous origin antibodies express various subtypes immunoglobulin overall higher affinity better detect lowquantity antigens targeting different epitopes however also provokes increased chance nonspecific reactivity antibodies might bind nondiseases causing substances addition serum batch may contain various antibodies different concentrations laborious corroborate constituents every batch since patients fail produce antibodies effectively hence poorer immune responses passive antibody therapy reinforce immune system introduction antibodies donors antibodies glycoproteins naturally produced immune system antibody contains four polypeptides shapes unique recognition sites targets cell surface antigen transmembrane proteins cancer cells infectious organisms viruses bacteria upon binding antigen antibodies trigger different cascades neutralize toxins kill cells three ways action antagonistic agonistic reaction complementdependent cytotoxicity cdc antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity adcc antagonism antibodies eliminates antigens binding relevant fc receptors pathogens disrupting toxins binding receptors cancers tumor cells escape immune vigilance binding checkpoint proteins immune cells inhibiting immune signaling downregulating expression major histocompatibility class mhc antagonistic antibodies also called immune checkpoints inhibitors obstruct binding cancer cells immune checkpoints antagonize cancer cells action restore immune surveillance therefore immune cells recognize surface antigens tumor cells elicit immune responses examples drugs exploit mechanism include pembrolizumab telimomab apart directing inhibitory pathways agonistic antibodies target immunostimulatory receptors elicit immune responses upon binding cluster differentiation proteins cd proteins agonistic antibodies antigenpresenting cells dendritic cells b lymphocytes monocytes stimulated secrete proinflammatory cytokines remove pathogens malignant cells example ligation monoclonal antibodies tumor cells license antigenpresenting cells predominantly dendritic cells increase presentation tumorassociated antigens taa local cytotoxic lymphocytes kill tumor antibodies also trigger classical pathway one three pathways complement cascade briefly protein attaches pathogen surface antibodyantigen complex culminates generation convertase followed cleavage protein protein protein serves inflammation mediator recruit phagocytes hand protein opsonize pathogens bind convertase catalyze formation convertase produce terminal complement components formation complement proteins etc ultimately congregates membraneattack complex lyse membrane addition generation complement proteins complex also induces activation b cells monocytes macrophages neutrophils trigger immune responses instance vasodilation increased vascular permeability infection site several monoclonal antibody drugs rituximab manipulate adcc pathway eradicate cancer cells firstly fab region antibodies tip shapedantibody first binds epitope pathogens immunoreceptors cancer cells whereas fc region stem antibody binds natural killer cells phosphorylate immunoreceptor several notable immunoreceptors cancer treatment include epidermal growth factor receptor efgr insulinlike growth factor receptor igfr cmet commonly overexpressed malignant cells phosphorylation immunoreceptors triggers release cytotoxic granules natural killer cells sequentially perturbs cellcell signaling via induction apoptotic cascade bax bad leading cell death enhancing susceptibility cancer cells chemotherapy radiotherapy passive antibody administration become widely approved cancer treatment following development monoclonal antibody mab since antibodies originated mice wrought problems immunogenetics poor abilities induce immune response human body limiting clinical later development antibody engineering enabled production chimeric antibodies antibodies human fc region mouse fab region humanized antibodies antibodies replaced mouse complementaritydetermining regions human backbone full human antibodies antibodies produced transgenic mice satisfactorily addressed many problems suitable clinical cancer cetuximab trade name erbitux recombinant chimeric monoclonal antibody designed treat metastatic colorectal cancer head neck numerous cancers epidermal growth factor receptor egfr often inappropriately activated overexpressed cancer cells leading uncontrolled cell cetuximab blocks ligand binding egfr inhibits intracellular downstream events critical tumor survival thereby inducing tumor regression reducing cell proliferation increasing administered intravenous injection often prescribed combination radiotherapy chemotherapeutic regimens irinotecan since egfr plays essential role maintaining skin integrity one serious side effect cetuximab therapy skin problems acnelike rash skin drying cracking due inhibition serious side effects severe allergic reactions heart fda approved rituximab
