vascular bypass surgical procedure performed redirect blood flow one area another reconnecting blood vessels often done bypass around diseased artery area normal blood flow another relatively normal area commonly performed due inadequate blood flow ischemia caused atherosclerosis part organ transplantation vascular access hemodialysis general someones vein autograft preferred graft material conduit vascular bypass types grafts polytetrafluoroethylene teflon polyethylene terephthalate dacron different persons vein allograft also commonly used arteries also serve vascular grafts surgeon sews graft source target vessels hand using surgical suture creating surgical anastomosis common bypass sites include heart coronary artery bypass surgery treat coronary artery disease legs lower extremity bypass surgery used treat peripheral vascular disease cardiac bypass performed arteries bring blood heart muscle coronary arteries become clogged condition may cause chest pain angina pectoris heart attack dimensional aspects material selection manufacturing methods influence mechanistic behaviours artificial grafts chosen receive arterylike behaviour legs bypass grafting used treat peripheral vascular disease acute limb ischemia aneurysms trauma many anatomical arrangements vascular bypass grafts lower extremities depending location disease principle restore blood flow area without normal flowcitation needed example femoralpopliteal bypass fempop might used femoral artery occluded fempop bypass may refer belowknee popliteal artery anatomic descriptions lower extremity bypasses include vascular bypass often created serve access point circulatory system hemodialysis bypass referred arteriovenous fistula directly connects vein artery without using synthetic material skull blood flow blocked damaged cerebral artery prevents adequate blood flow brain cerebral artery bypass may performed improve restore flow oxygendeprived ischemic area two main types cerebral artery bypass direct indirect direct revascularization also known ecic bypass involves directly connecting extracranial artery outside brain intracranial artery inside brain also sometimes called stamca bypass superficial temporal artery middle cerebral artery commonly used arteries indirect revascularization involves placing part artery case edas encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis part muscle case ems encephalomyosynangiosis surface brain allowing revascularize brain new vessel growth types indirect revascularization typically take months see several arteries blocked several bypasses needed procedure called multiple bypass number bypasses needed always increase risk surgery depend patients overall health prior constructing bypass surgeons obtain perform imaging study determine severity location diseased blood vessels cardiac lower extremity disease usually form angiogram hemodialysis access done ultrasound occasionally ct angiogram take place formal angiogram lack adequate venous conduit relative contraindication bypass surgery depending area disease alternatives may used medical conditions ischemic heart disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease increase risk surgery also relative contraindications coronary peripheral vascular disease lack runoff distal area also contraindication vascular bypass around one diseased artery another diseased area solve vascular problem patient deemed highrisk undergo bypass may candidate angioplasty stenting relevant vessel dogma vascular bypass technique says obtain proximal distal control means vessel flow surgeon must exposure furthest nearest extents blood vessel bypass created vessel opened blood loss minimized necessary exposure clamps usually used proximal distal end segment exceptions exist blood flow target vessel area proposed entry case intervening occlusion organ perfused artery sensitive even temporary occlusion blood flow brain various measures taken neurosurgery excimer laser assisted nonocclusive anastomosis elana technique use create bypass without interrupting blood supply recipient blood vessels reduces risk stroke rupture aneurysm several complications arise vascular risks bypass general risks surgery immediately following coronary artery neurosurgical vascular bypass surgery patients recover intensive care unit coronary care unit one two days provided recovery normal without complications move less intensively monitored unit stepdown unit ward bed depending extent surgery recovery leg bypass may start stepdown ward bed monitoring immediately bypass surgery focuses signs symptoms bleeding graft occlusion bleeding detected treatment range transfusion reoperation later hospital course common complications include wound infections pneumonia urinary tract infection graft discharge patients often prescribed oral painkillers prescribed statin antiplatelet medication contraindicated bypass performed atherosclerosis eg peripheral vascular disease coronary artery disease patients start feeling normal one month others may still experience problems several months first twelve weeks bypass operations patients advised avoid heavy lifting house work strenuous recreation like golf tennis swimming surgical wounds heal particularly sternum coronary part recovery bypass surgery includes regular visits physician monitor patients recovery normally followup visit surgeon scheduled two four weeks surgery frequency visits gradually lessens patients health vascular bypass operations performed atherosclerosis operation cure metabolic problem led vascular disease lifestyle changes include quitting smoking making diet changes getting regular exercise required cure underlying httpsenwikipediaorgwikivascularbypass
