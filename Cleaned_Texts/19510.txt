rejections xenogenetic infections introduction microorganisms big issue lead fatal infections rejection response generally extreme allotransplantations ultimately results rejection xenograft cases result immediate death recipient several types rejection organ xenografts faced include hyperacute rejection acute vascular rejection cellular rejection chronic rejectioncitation needed rapid violent hyperacute response comes result antibodies present host organism antibodies known xenoreactive natural antibodies rapid violent type rejection occurs within minutes hours time transplant mediated binding xnas xenoreactive natural antibodies donor endothelium causing activation human complement system results endothelial damage inflammation thrombosis necrosis transplant xnas first produced begin circulating blood neonates colonization bowel bacteria galactose moieties cell walls antibodies igm class also include igg epitope xnas target αlinked galactose moiety also called αgal epitope produced enzyme nonprimates contain enzyme thus epitope present organ epithelium perceived foreign antigen primates lack galactosyl transferase enzyme pig primate xenotransplantation xnas recognize porcine glycoproteins integrin binding xnas initiate complement activation classical complement pathway complement activation causes cascade events leading destruction endothelial cells platelet degranulation inflammation coagulation fibrin deposition hemorrhage result thrombosis necrosis since hyperacute rejection presents barrier success xenografts several strategies overcome investigation interruption complement cascade transgenic organs genetically engineered pigs also known delayed xenoactive rejection type rejection occurs discordant xenografts within days hyperacute rejection prevented process much complex hyperacute rejection currently completely understood acute vascular rejection requires de novo protein synthesis driven interactions graft endothelial cells host antibodies macrophages platelets response characterized inflammatory infiltrate mostly macrophages natural killer cells small numbers cells intravascular thrombosis fibrinoid necrosis vessel binding previously mentioned xnas donor endothelium leads activation host macrophages well endothelium endothelium activation considered type ii since gene induction protein synthesis involved binding xnas ultimately leads development procoagulant state secretion inflammatory cytokines chemokines well expression leukocyte adhesion molecules eselectin intercellular adhesion vascular cell adhesion response perpetuated normally binding regulatory proteins ligands aid control coagulation inflammatory responses however due molecular incompatibilities molecules donor species recipient porcine major histocompatibility complex molecules human natural killer cells may due complexity use immunosuppressive drugs along wide array approaches necessary prevent acute vascular rejection include administering synthetic thrombin inhibitor modulate thrombogenesis depletion antigalactose antibodies xnas techniques immunoadsorption prevent endothelial cell activation inhibiting activation macrophages stimulated cells nk cells stimulated release thus role mhc molecules cell responses activation would reassessed species hyperacute acute vascular rejection avoided accommodation possible

uncertain however expected stronger allografts due differences peptides among different animals leads antigens potentially recognized foreign thus eliciting greater indirect xenogenic proposed strategy avoid cellular rejection induce donor nonresponsiveness using hematopoietic donor stem cells introduced bone marrow recipient coexist recipients stem cells bone marrow stem cells give rise

bone marrow causes donor reactive cells considered self undergo chronic rejection slow progressive usually occurs transplants survive initial rejection scientists still unclear chronic rejection exactly works research area difficult since xenografts rarely survive past initial acute rejection phases nonetheless known xnas complement system primarily fibrosis xenograft occurs result immune reactions cytokines stimulate fibroblasts healing following cellular necrosis acute rejection perhaps major cause chronic rejection arteriosclerosis lymphocytes previously activated antigens vessel wall graft activate macrophages secrete smooth muscle growth factors results build smooth muscle cells vessel walls causing hardening narrowing vessels within graft chronic rejection leads pathologic changes organ transplants must replaced many also anticipated chronic rejection aggressive xenotransplants opposed successful efforts made create knockout mice without resulting reduction highly immunogenic αgal epitope resulted reduction occurrence hyperacute rejection eliminated barriers xenotransplantation dysregulated coagulation also known different organ xenotransplants result different responses clotting example kidney transplants result higher degree coagulopathy impaired clotting cardiac transplants whereas liver xenografts result severe thrombocytopenia causing recipient death within days due alternate clotting disorder thrombosis may initiated preexisting antibodies affect protein c anticoagulant system due effect porcine donors must extensively screened transplantation studies also shown porcine transplant cells able induce human tissue factor expression thus stimulating platelet monocyte aggregation around xenotransplanted organ causing severe additionally spontaneous platelet accumulation may caused contact pig von willebrand epitope major problem xenotransplantation dysregulated coagulation cause concern transgenic pigs control variable coagulant activity based specific organ transplanted would make xenotransplantation readily available solution patients per year receive human donation organ tissue extensive research required determine whether animal organs replace physiological functions human organs many issues include size differences organ size limit range potential recipients xenotransplants longevity lifespan pigs roughly years currently unknown whether xenograft may able last longer hormone protein differences proteins molecularly incompatible could cause malfunction important regulatory processes differences also make prospect hepatic xenotransplantation less promising since liver plays important role production many environment example pig hearts work different anatomical site different hydrostatic pressure temperature body temperature pigs average human body temperature implications difference activity important enzymes currently xenozoonosis also known zoonosis xenosis transmission infectious agents species via xenograft animal human infection normally rare occurred past example avian influenza influenza virus passed birds xenotransplantation may increase chance disease transmission reasons implantation breaches physical barrier normally helps prevent disease transmission recipient transplant severely immunosuppressed human complement regulators expressed transgenic pigs shown serve
