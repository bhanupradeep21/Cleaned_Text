alveoli besides anisodont teeth towards tip snout generally large conical slight curvature surfaces tooth bear distinct vertical riges formed tooth enamel however densely packed inner side tooth ridges originate base crown begin higher take carinaelike appearance enamel ridges continue present posterior teeth carinaelike ridges found teeth front phylogenetic analysis conducted eardasaurus generally consistent analysis regarding internal relationships within pliosauridae eardasaurus recovered earlydiverging thalassophonean basal liopleurodon simolestes hauffiosaurus zanoni hauffiosaurus longirostris hauffiosaurus tomistomimus marmornectes candrewi anguanax zignoi peloneustes philarchus eardasaurus powelli pliosaurus andrewsi simolestes vorax liopleurodon ferox pliosaurus brachaucheninae enamel ridges present teeth eardasaurus thought formed carinaelike cutting edges likely held significant ecological importance enhanced cutting ability given teeth ridges commonly thought indicative diet consisting large prey items ridges observed pliosaurids like pliosaurus liopleurodon times bear additional serration compared liopleurodon however carinaeridges eardasaurus much finer weaker serration nevertheless distinction regular enamel ridges carinaelike ridges still highly pronounced ketchum benson subsequently suggest enamel ridges may much widespread among
