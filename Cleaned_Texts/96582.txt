many scientists philosophers science described evolution fact theory phrase used title article paleontologist stephen jay gould describes fact science meaning data known absolute certainty confirmed degree would perverse withhold provisional scientific theory wellsubstantiated explanation facts facts evolution come observational evidence current processes imperfections organisms recording historical common descent transitions fossil record theories evolution provide provisional explanation words evolution fact theory several meanings different contexts biology evolution refers observed changes organisms successive generations descent common ancestor technical level change gene frequency time also refer explanatory theories charles darwins theory natural selection explain mechanisms evolution scientist fact describe repeatable observation capable great consensus refer something well established nobody community disagrees also refer truth falsity proposition public theory mean

probability idea say thing fact mean probability extremely high one high bothered doubt ready act accordingly use term fact proper one evolution fact national academy sciences us makes similar scientists often use word fact describe observation scientists also use fact mean something tested observed many times longer compelling reason keep testing looking examples occurrence evolution sense fact scientists longer question whether descent modification occurred evidence supporting idea strong stephen jay gould also points darwin continually emphasized difference two great separate accomplishments establishing fact evolution proposing theory natural selection explain mechanism two aspects frequently confused scientists continue argue particular explanations mechanisms work specific instances evolution fact evolution occurred still occurring undisputed common misconception evolution reliably observed happened millions years ago science therefore dependent facts initial
