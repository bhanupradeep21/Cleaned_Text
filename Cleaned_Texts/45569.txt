insects reproduce oviparously ie laying eggs eggs produced female pair ovaries sperm produced male one testicle commonly two transmitted female mating means external genitalia sperm stored within female one spermathecae time fertilization eggs travel along oviducts fertilized sperm expelled body laid cases via ovipositor female insects able make eggs receive store sperm manipulate sperm different males lay eggs reproductive systems made pair ovaries accessory glands one spermathecae ducts connecting parts ovaries make eggs accessory glands produce substances help package lay eggs spermathecae store sperm varying periods time along portions oviducts control sperm use ducts spermathecae lined ovaries made number egg tubes called ovarioles vary size number species number eggs insect able make varies according number ovarioles rate eggs develop also influenced ovariole design meroistic ovaries eggstobe divide repeatedly daughter cells become helper cells single oocyte cluster panoistic ovaries eggtobe produced stem germ cells develops oocyte helper cells germ line production eggs panoistic ovaries tends slower meroistic accessory glands glandular parts oviducts produce variety substances sperm maintenance transport fertilization well protection eggs produce glue protective substances coating eggs tough coverings batch eggs called oothecae spermathecae tubes sacs sperm stored time mating time egg fertilized paternity testing insects revealed probably many female insects use spermatheca various ducts control bias sperm used favor males main component male reproductive system testicle suspended body cavity tracheae fat body primitive apterygote insects single testis lepidopterans two maturing testes secondarily fused one structure later stages larval development although ducts leading remain separate however male insects pair testes inside sperm tubes follicles enclosed within membranous sac follicles connect vas eferens vas defferens two tubular vasa deferentia connect median ejaculatory duct leads outside portion vas defferens often enlarged form seminal vesicle stores sperm discharged female seminal vesicles glandular linings secrete nutrients nourishment maintenance sperm ejaculatory duct derived invagination epidermal cells development result cuticular lining terminal portion ejaculatory duct may sclerotized form intromittent organ aedeagus remainder male reproductive system derived embryonic mesoderm except germ cells spermatogonia descend primordial pole cells early ground plan abdomen adult insect typically consists segments less strongly sclerotized head thorax segment abdomen represented sclerotized tergum sternum perhaps pleurite terga separated adjacent sterna pleura membrane spiracles located pleural area variation ground plan includes fusion terga terga sterna form continuous dorsal ventral shields conical tube insects bear sclerite pleural area called laterotergite ventral sclerites sometimes called laterosternites embryonic stage many insects postembryonic stage primitive insects abdominal segments present modern insects tendency toward reduction number abdominal segments primitive number

acrididae segments fossil specimen zoraptera generally first seven abdominal segments adults pregenital segments similar structure lack appendages however apterygotes bristletails silverfish many

collectively external genitalia although may largely internal insect genitalia especially male genitalia often directionally asymmetrical trait evolved multiple times various orders components external genitalia insects diverse form often considerable taxonomic value particularly among species appear structurally similar respects male external genitalia used widely aid distinguishing species whereas female external genitalia may simpler less varied terminalia adult female insects include internal structures receiving male copulatory organ spermatozoa external structures used
