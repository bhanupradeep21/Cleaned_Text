pancreatitis condition characterized inflammation pancreas large organ behind stomach produces digestive enzymes number two main types acute pancreatitis chronic signs symptoms pancreatitis include pain upper abdomen nausea pain often goes back usually acute pancreatitis fever may occur symptoms typically resolve chronic pancreatitis weight loss fatty stool diarrhea may complications may include infection bleeding diabetes mellitus problems two common causes acute pancreatitis gallstone blocking common bile duct pancreatic duct joined heavy alcohol causes include direct trauma certain medications infections mumps chronic pancreatitis may develop result acute commonly due many years heavy alcohol causes include high levels blood fats high blood calcium medications certain genetic disorders cystic fibrosis among smoking increases risk acute chronic diagnosis acute pancreatitis based threefold increase blood either amylase chronic pancreatitis tests may medical imaging ultrasound ct scan may also acute pancreatitis usually treated intravenous fluids pain medication sometimes typically eating drinking disallowed nasogastric tube placed procedure known endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ercp may done examine distal common bile duct remove gallstone gallstones gallbladder often also chronic pancreatitis addition temporary feeding nasogastric tube may used provide adequate longterm dietary changes pancreatic enzyme replacement may occasionally surgery done remove parts globally million cases pancreatitis resulted deaths deaths acute pancreatitis occurs per people new cases chronic pancreatitis develop per people year currently affect per people united common men often chronic pancreatitis starts ages rare acute pancreatitis first described autopsy chronic pancreatitis first described common symptoms pancreatitis severe upper abdominal left upper quadrant burning pain radiating back nausea vomiting worse eating physical examination vary depending severity presence internal bleeding blood pressure may elevated pain decreased dehydration bleeding heart respiratory rates often elevated abdomen usually tender lesser degree pain common abdominal disease bowel sounds may reduced reflex bowel paralysis fever jaundice may present chronic pancreatitis lead diabetes pancreatic cancer unexplained weight loss may occur lack pancreatic enzymes hindering digestioncitation needed early complications include shock infection systemic inflammatory response syndrome low blood calcium high blood glucose dehydration blood loss dehydration fluid leaking abdominal cavity ascites lead kidney failure respiratory complications often severe pleural effusion usually present shallow breathing pain lead lung collapse pancreatic enzymes may attack lungs causing inflammation severe inflammation lead intraabdominal hypertension abdominal compartment syndrome impairing renal respiratory function potentially requiring management open abdomen relieve late complications include recurrent pancreatitis development pancreatic pancreatic secretions walled scar tissue may cause pain become infected rupture bleed block bile duct cause jaundice migrate around abdomen acute necrotizing pancreatitis lead pancreatic abscess collection pus caused necrosis liquefaction infection happens approximately cases almost cases involving two pseudocysts gas eighty percent cases pancreatitis caused alcohol gallstones gallstones single common cause acute alcohol single common cause chronic triglyceride levels greater mgdl mmoll another seven classes medications associated acute pancreatitis statins ace inhibitors oral contraceptiveshormone replacement therapy hrt diuretics antiretroviral therapy valproic acid oral hypoglycemic agents mechanisms drugs causing pancreatitis known exactly possible statins direct toxic effect pancreas longterm accumulation toxic metabolites meanwhile ace inhibitors cause angioedema pancreas accumulation bradykinin birth control pills hrt cause arterial thrombosis pancreas accumulation fat hypertriglyceridemia diuretics furosemide direct toxic effect pancreas meanwhile thiazide diuretics cause hypertriglyceridemia hypercalcemia latter risk factor pancreatic stonescitation needed hiv infection cause person likely get pancreatitis meanwhile antiretroviral drugs may cause metabolic disturbances hyperglycemia hypercholesterolemia predisposes pancreatitis valproic acid may direct toxic effect various oral hypoglycemic agents contributes pancreatitis including metformin glucagonlike strongly associated pancreatitis promoting atypical antipsychotics clozapine risperidone olanzapine also cause number infectious agents recognized causes pancreatitis common causes include trauma autoimmune disease high blood calcium hypothermia endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ercp pancreas divisum common congenital malformation pancreas may underlie recurrent cases diabetes mellitus type associated higher less common causes include pancreatic cancer pancreatic duct vasculitis inflammation small blood vessels pancreas acute intermittent porphyria erythropoietic protoporphyriacitation needed inherited form results activation trypsinogen within pancreas leading autodigestion involved genes may include trypsin codes trypsinogen codes trypsin inhibitor cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance mnemonic getsmashed often used remember common causes pancreatitis pancreatitis sting hypothermia hyperparathyroidism retrograde cholangiopancreatography commonly azathioprine valproic acid differential diagnosis pancreatitis includes limited cholecystitis choledocholithiasis perforated peptic ulcer bowel infarction small bowel obstruction hepatitis mesenteric diagnosis requires following criteria amylase lipase enzymes produced pancreas elevations lipase generally considered better indicator pancreatitis greater specificity longer half however enzymes elevated disease states chronic pancreatitis fecal pancreatic test marker exocrine pancreatic function additional tests may useful evaluating chronic pancreatitis include hemoglobin immunoglobulin rheumatoid factor antinuclear imaging abdominal ultrasound convenient simple noninvasive sensitive specific pancreatitis gallstones imaging however patients view pancreas obstructed bowel gas making difficult contrastenhanced ct scan usually performed hours onset pain evaluate pancreatic necrosis extrapancreatic fluid well predict severity disease ct scanning earlier falsely reassuringcitation needed ercp endoscopic ultrasound also used biliary cause pancreatitis suspectedcitation needed treatment pancreatitis supportive depends severity morphine generally suitable pain control clinical studies suggest morphine aggravate cause pancreatitis treatment acute pancreatitis depend whether diagnosis mild form condition causes complications severe form cause serious complicationscitation needed treatment mild acute pancreatitis successfully carried admission general hospital ward traditionally people allowed eat inflammation resolved recent evidence suggests early feeding safe improves outcomes may result ability leave hospital due inflammation occurring pancreatitis proinflammatory cytokines secreted bloodstream cause inflammation throughout body including lungs manifest ards pancreatitis cause lung injury affect normal lung function supplemental oxygen occasionally delivered breathing tubes connected via nose eg nasal cannulae via mask tubes removed days clear condition improving dehydration may result episode acute pancreatitis fluids provided intravenously opioids may used pain pancreatitis due gallstones early gallbladder removal also appears improve severe pancreatitis cause organ failure necrosis infected necrosis pseudocyst abscess diagnosed severe acute pancreatitis people need admitted highdependency unit intensive care unit likely levels fluids inside body dropped significantly diverts bodily fluids nutrients attempt repair pancreas drop fluid levels lead reduction volume blood within body known hypovolemic shock hypovolemic shock lifethreatening quickly starve body oxygenrich blood needs survive avoid going hypovolemic shock fluids administered intravenously oxygen supplied tubes attached nose ventilation equipment may used assist breathing feeding tubes may used provide nutrients combined appropriate analgesia mild acute pancreatitis necessary treat underlying discontinuing medications cessation alcohol etc cause gallstones likely ercp procedure removal gallbladder recommended gallbladder removed hospital admission within two weeks pancreatitis onset limit risk recurrent pancreatitis cause pancreatitis alcohol cessation alcohol consumption treatment alcohol dependency may improve pancreatitis even underlying cause related alcohol consumption doctors recommend avoiding least six months cause damage pancreas recovery oral intake especially fats generally restricted initially early enteral feeding within hours shown improve clinical fluids electrolytes replaced intravenously nutritional support initiated via tube feeding surpass portion digestive tract affected secreted pancreatic enzymes improvement first hours severe acute pancreatitis mortality rates around higher necrosis pancreas several scoring systems used predict severity attack pancreatitis combine demographic laboratory data estimate severity probability death examples include apache ii ranson bisap
