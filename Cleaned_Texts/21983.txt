streptococcal intertrigo skin condition secondary streptococcal bacterial infection often seen infants young children characterized fieryred color skin foul odor absence satellite skin softening due moisture neck armpits folds newborn children infants commonly develop intertrigo physical features deep skin folds short neck flexed prompt diagnosis medical professional treatment topical andor oral antibiotics effectively relieve main causes intertrigo mechanical factors heat maceration skin secondary infections mostly happens due moisture buildup skin folds making areas ideal feeding places secondary bacterial fungal lot cases disease seen individuals diabetes mellitus since higher ph levels skin folds given reasons mentioned higher cases intertrigo individuals obesity diabetes mellitus immunodeficiency secondary virus infection large skin folds bedridden wear diapers trap moisture ie babies older adults using incontinence streptococcal intertrigo commonly presents beefyred smooth shiny lesion welldefined borders satellite lesions surrounding area distinct foul smell common infection may accompanied general malaise lowgrade fever folds neck commonly affected areas skin folds also susceptible including armpits groin progression intertrigo dependent strain streptococcus responsible symptoms streptococcal intertrigo lead complications appropriately diagnosed treated timely manner reported bacteremia bacterial infection circulating blood occur may require intravenous antibiotic therapy streptococcus pyogenes also known cause serious diseases meningitis necrotizing fasciitis toxic shock syndrome skin infections caused group betahemolytic streptococci gabhs also associated acute glomerulonephritis furthering need prompt diagnosis intertrigo skin condition often associated rashes deep skin folds increased friction moisture exposure various causes lead intertrigo including fungal viral although agent would depend nature infection whether candidal bacterial case bacterial infections main etiological agents either group beta hemolytic streptococci staphylococcus group streptococci gas ubiquitous microorganisms found surrounding environment normal skin although different severities infections group streptococci affect individuals broken skin wounds allow easier access colonization bacteria streptococci family factors aid promotion infection severity group streptococci surface molecules lipoteichoic acid protein f aid adhesion host cells adhered releases streptolysin hyaluronidase degrade host tissues enabling deeper colonization addition attachment dissemination factors group streptococci also encapsulated varying protein factors defend host common symptom associated streptococcal associated intertrigo erysipelas infection upper superficial layers infection mostly associated group betahemolytic streptococcal bacteria gabhs since normally found skin flora group bacteria typically invades affects lymphatic vessels often leading localized inflammation infection recognized tonguelike irregular extensions rash accompanied systemic symptoms fever chills general feeling lymphatic system host gabhs easily disseminate systemically produce effects streptococcal intertrigo occurs bacteria penetrates skin increased amount skin folds increase risk skin abrasion erosion leading inflammation therefore individuals obesity infants factors increase ones skintoskin contact increased risk intertrigo immunocompromised individuals also greater risk intertrigo since susceptible infection foreign pathogen environmental factors also play role increasing risk condition living humid region increases sweat accumulation moisture contributing aggravation similarly poor hygiene exacerbate friction brings dirt particles build increasing potential severity inflammatory response infants tendency drool onto skin folds also puts greater risk infection streptococcal intertrigo diagnosed medical professional performing detailed physical examination taking overnight culture affected areas second sample tested rapid antigen detection test group upon physical examination streptococcal intertrigo commonly presents marked area redness skin distinct foul smell lack satellite lesions presence satellite lesions lesions smaller away main affected region may point differential diagnosis candidal intertrigo common cause characteristics streptococcal intertrigo frequently underdiagnosed considered causative agent standard therapy candidal intertrigo differential diagnoses may present similarly include seborrheic dermatitis atopic dermatitis irritant contact dermatitis allergic contact dermatitis mixed bacterial intertrigo scabies erythrasma inverse given main etiology streptococcal intertrigo warm moist skin surface order prevent future infection repeat incident kind best keep affected area skin folds clean dry also helpful expose areas air limit skinonskin friction much order decrease friction predisposing factor weight loss individuals obesity reduction mammoplasty large breasts encouraged decrease chance worsening symptoms drying agent baby powder application barrier agents zinc oxide petrolatum aids reduction skin deterioration alleviates itching common treatment options intertrigo complicated secondary bacterial infection group betahemolytic streptococcus topical mupirocin bactroban erythromycin low potency topical steroids like hydrocortisone cream oral antibiotics oral penicillin cephalexin ceftriaxon cefazolin broadspectrum antibiotics ideal targeting bacterial agents due large number microbiota human skin additionally low potency steroids aid reduction reaction reducing discomfort drying agents aluminum sulfate talcum powder may used alongside treatments help healing process go although agents used better space hours hair drier could also utilized affected area intertrigo responds well removal moisture age important factor consider dosing since intertrigo prevalent amongst young children proper identification etiology required order treat old infant presented streptococcal intertrigo experiencing rash groin area days bright distinct red coloration evident infants skin folds also moist wrinkly bacterial sample collected tested antibiotics infant initially treated oral flucloxacillin proved effective clearing bacteria culture bacteria classified group betahemolytic old infant history eczema presented dark red rash ear neck lower limbs initially diagnosed intertrigo due excessive drooling prescribed course antifungal topical powder infant returned pediatrician week later rash gotten worse eczema greatly exacerbated skin culture done suspected rash due bacterial infection instead streptococcus pyogenes predominant growth found culture patient prescribed cephalexin suspension dexamethasone suspension resolved inflammation old female presented welldemarcated red smooth plaque foul smell satellite lesions left armpit neck weeks initially treated candidal intertrigo without improvement condition affected areas swabbed culture grew group betahemolytic streptococcus pyogenes sensitive penicillin diagnosed streptococcal intertrigo prescribed amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid antibiotics days along topical application fusidic acid intertrigo completely resolved cases intertrigo originating streptococcal bacteria uncommon underreported intertrigo come many different sources difficult reliably track httpsenwikipediaorgwikistreptococcalintertrigo
