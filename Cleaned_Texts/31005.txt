alcoholic hepatitis hepatitis inflammation liver due excessive intake patients typically history least years heavy alcohol intake typically drinks per usually found association fatty liver early stage alcoholic liver disease may contribute progression fibrosis leading cirrhosis symptoms may present acutely large amount alcoholic intake short time period years excess alcohol intake signs symptoms alcoholic hepatitis include jaundice yellowing skin eyes ascites fluid accumulation abdominal cavity fatigue hepatic encephalopathy brain dysfunction due liver mild cases selflimiting severe cases high risk death severe cases may treated glucocorticoids condition often comes suddenly may progress severity rapidly alcoholic hepatitis characterized number symptoms may include feeling unwell enlargement liver development fluid abdomen ascites modest elevation liver enzyme levels determined liver function may also present hepatic encephalopathy brain dysfunction due liver failure causing symptoms confusion decreased levels consciousness characteristic flapping movement wrist extended indicative hepatic encephalopathy severe cases characterized profound jaundice obtundation ranging drowsiness unconsciousness progressive critical illness mortality rate within days onset despite best alcoholic hepatitis distinct cirrhosis caused longterm alcohol consumption alcoholic hepatitis occur patients chronic alcoholic liver disease alcoholic cirrhosis alcoholic hepatitis lead cirrhosis cirrhosis common patients long term alcohol alcoholics develop acute hepatitis inflammatory reaction cells affected fatty directly related dose alcohol people seem prone reaction others inflammatory reaction fatty change called alcoholic steatohepatitis inflammation probably predisposes liver fibrosis activating hepatic stellate cells produce pathological mechanisms alcoholic hepatitis incompletely understood combination direct hepatocyte damage alcohol metabolites addition increased intestinal permeability thought play heavy alcohol consumption increases intestinal permeability causing direct damage enterocytes intestinal absorptive cells causing disruptions tight junctions form barrier leads increased intestinal permeability leads pathogenic gut bacteria enterococcus faecalis immunogenic fungi entering portal circulation travelling liver cause hepatocyte case enterococcus faecalis bacterium release exotoxin directly damaging liver chronic alcohol consumption may alter gut microbiome promote production pathogenic many pathogenic bacteria also contain pathogen associated molecular patterns pamps extracellular motifs recognized immune system foreign material may lead exaggerated inflammatory response liver leads hepatocyte alcohol also directly damaging liver cells alcohol metabolized acetaldehyde liver via enzymes aldehyde acetaldehyde forms reactive oxygen species liver well acting dna adduct binding dna leading direct hepatocyte manifests lipid peroxidation mitochondrial damage glutathione endogenous antioxidant damaged hepatocytes release danger associated molecular patterns damps molecules lead activation immune systems inflammatory response hepatocyte chronic inflammation seen alcoholic hepatitis leads distinctive fibrotic response fibrogenic cell type activation occurs via increased extracellular matrix deposition around hepatocytes sinusoidal cells causes pericellular fibrosis known chickenwire pericellular chickenwire fibrosis leads portal hypertension elevated blood pressure portal veins drain blood intestines causes many sequelae chronic liver disease including esophageal varices associated variceal bleeding ascites splenomegaly chronic inflammation seen alcoholic hepatitis also leads impaired hepatocyte differentiation impairments hepatocyte regeneration hepatocyte dedifferentiation cholangiocyte type leads defects livers many functions including impairments bilirubin transport clotting factor synthesis glucose metabolism immune impaired compensatory liver regenerative response leads ductular reaction type abnormal liver cell signs pathological changes liver histology include chronic liver disease also present diagnosis made patient history significant alcohol intake develops worsening liver function tests including elevated bilirubin typically greater aminotransferases onset jaundice within last ratio aspartate aminotransferase alanine aminotransferase usually cases liver enzymes exceed liver biopsy required diagnosis however help confirm alcoholic hepatitis cause hepatitis diagnosis clinical practice guidelines recommended people risk stratified using meld score childpugh score scores used evaluate severity liver disease based several lab values greater score severe disease females susceptible alcohol associated liver injury therefore higher risk alcohol associated certain genetic variations encoding gene codes enzyme involved triglyceride metabolism adipose tissue thought
