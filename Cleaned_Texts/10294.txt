glycemic glycaemic index gi number assigned food pure glucose arbitrarily given value represents relative rise blood glucose level two hours consuming gi specific food depends primarily quantity type carbohydrate contains also affected amount entrapment carbohydrate molecules within food fat protein content food amount organic acids salts food whether cooked cooked gi tables list many types foods gis food considered low gi less high gi midrange gi term introduced david j jenkins useful quantifying relative rapidity body breaks takes account available carbohydrate total carbohydrate minus fiber food glycemic index predict individuals glycemic response food used tool assess insulin response burden food averaged across studied population individual responses vary glycemic index usually applied context quantity food amount carbohydrate food actually consumed related measure glycemic load factors multiplying glycemic index food question carbohydrate content actual serving glycemic index food defined incremental area twohour blood glucose response curve auc following fast ingestion food certain quantity available carbohydrate usually g auc test food divided auc standard either glucose white bread giving two different definitions multiplied average gi value calculated data collected human subjects standard test food must contain equal amount available carbohydrate result gives relative ranking tested foods carbohydrates break quickly digestion release glucose rapidly bloodstream tend high gi foods carbohydrates break slowly releasing glucose gradually bloodstream tend low gi lower glycemic index suggests slower rates digestion absorption foods carbohydrates also indicate greater extraction liver periphery products carbohydrate digestioncitation needed current validated methods use glucose reference food giving glycemic index value definition advantages universal producing maximum gi values approximately white bread also used reference food giving different set gi values white bread glucose people whose staple carbohydrate source white bread advantage conveying directly whether replacement dietary staple different food would result faster slower blood glucose response disadvantage using white bread reference food welldefined reference universal standard carbohydrate content white bread glycemic index charts often give one value per food variations possible due importantly glycemic response different one person another also person day day depending blood glucose levels insulin resistance glycemic index indicates impact glucose level two hours eating food
