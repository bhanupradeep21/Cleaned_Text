difference db airconduction boneconduction thresholds given test frequency however medial fixation ossicular chain impairs inertial osseotympanic modes bone conduction increasing boneconduction thresholds hz khz reducing size airbone gaps khz resonant frequency ossicular chain largest increase boneconduction threshold around db occurs frequency resultant notch called carharts notch useful clinical marker medial ossicularchain tympanometry measures peak pressure tpp peakcompensated static admittance ytm middle ear eardrum stapes ankylosed otosclerosis lateral end ossicular chain may still quite mobile therefore otosclerosis may slightly reduce admittance resulting either shallow tympanogram type normal tympanogram type otosclerosis increases stiffness middleear system raising resonant frequency quantified using multifrequency tympanometry thus high resonantfrequency pathology otosclerosis differentiated low resonantfrequency pathologies ossicular discontinuitycitation

characteristic clinical findings conductive hearing loss often treated medically surgery without imaging diagnosis may unclear clinically cases sensorineural mixed hearing loss may become apparent imaging therefore imaging often performed hearing loss sensorineural mixedcitation needed highresolution ct shows subtle bone findings however ct usually needed prior surgerycitation needed otosclerosis ct graded using grading system suggested symons several approaches used treatment otosclerosis including medical surgical amplification technological innovations hearing aid technology cochlear implants used substitute complement earlier workers suggested use calcium fluoride sodium fluoride preferred compound fluoride ions inhibit rapid progression disease otosclerotic ear occurs formation hydroxylapatite crystals lead stapes fixation administration fluoride replaces hydroxyl radical fluoride leading formation fluorapatite crystals hence progression disease considerably slowed active disease process arrested treatment reverse conductive hearing loss may slow progression conductive sensorineural components disease process otofluor containing sodium fluoride one treatment recently success claimed second treatment bisphosphonate medications inhibit bone however early reports based nonrandomized case studies meet standards clinical numerous sideeffects pharmaceutical treatments including occasional stomach upset allergic itching increased joint pains lead worst case bisphosphonates may lead osteonecrosis auditory canal finally neither approach proven beneficial commonly preferred method surgery undertaken various methods treat otosclerosis however method choice procedure known early attempts hearing restoration via simple freeing stapes sclerotic attachments oval window met temporary improvement hearing conductive hearing loss would almost always recur stapedectomy consists removing portion sclerotic stapes footplate replacing middle ear implant secured incus procedure restores continuity ossicular movement allows transmission sound waves eardrum inner ear modern variant surgery called stapedotomy performed drilling small hole stapes footplate microdrill laser insertion pistonlike prothesis success rate either surgery depends greatly skill familiarity procedure however comparisons shown stapedotomy yield results least good stapedectomy fewer complications thus stapedotomy preferred normal recently endoscopic stapedotomy gaining popularity since first description professor tarabichi endsocope provides much better view stapes footplate without removal bone access although hearing aids prevent cure inhibit progression otosclerosis help treat largest symptom hearing loss hearing aids tuned specific frequency losses however
