engines god science fiction novel american author jack mcdevitt group xenoarchaeologists together interstellar pilot priscilla hutchins attempt unravel mysteries surrounding huge mysterious monuments left near several habitable worlds including one moon orbiting saturn humans confirmed existence intelligent extraterrestrial life beyond earth discovered statue bipedal alien iapetus moon saturn developing fasterthanlight travel humans quickly discovered mysterious monuments nearby solar systems however details monumentmakers remained elusive even decades exploring humans found disappointingly habitable worlds even fewer signs intelligent alien life time three examples identified planet pinnacle evidently home intelligent society became extinct nearly million years earlier left little trace noninhabitable planet b planet quraqua many similarities earth home intelligent species quraquans became extinct centuries prior c inakademeri aka nok moon ringed gas giant home known nonhuman intelligent species still alive noks developed technology roughly equivalent earths early century time discovery engaged global conflict roughly analogous world war lack habitable worlds posed significant problem earth becoming increasingly inhospitable humans species global climate change led significant rise sea levels many weatherrelated changes food shortages famine rampant throughout world many people convinced humans could avoid going extinct could establish offworld colony story primarily follows priscilla hutchins also known hutch prestigious starship pilot academy

space lasting nearly month hutch richard arrive quraquan star system landing planet richard wanted explore mysterious structure planets moon called oz monument consisted assembly gigantic smooth cubes rectangles although oz superficially resembled city structures completely solid interior spaces exterior features theories purpose oz yet proposed many scientists including richard think oz built monumentmakers known monuments elegant many floating space fauxcity seemed crude unwieldy comparison however discovery monumentmaker depiction planet richard intent reevaluate potential link oz monumentmakers ultimately discovered several facts oz monument built approximately bc earth time scale b many structures damaged mysterious scorchmarks also dated roughly bc c citys layout perfectly symmetrical composed regular cubic units notable exception two cylindrical towers one towers held short inscription one ancient languages quraquans observation bewildering quraquans never developed space travel someone else monumentmakers must inscribed although scientists could identify language could read inscription consequently deciphering quraquan language pressing need investigating oz
