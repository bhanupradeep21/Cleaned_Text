scientist covered publication titled long explanation noted molecular biologist biophysicist dr colin blake laboratory molecular biophysics oxford centre molecular sciences university oxford commented dr senapathys theory recent work dr senapathy applied rna comprehensively explains origin segregated form rna coding noncoding regions also suggests splicing mechanism developed start primordial evolution presence random sequence therefore sufficient create primordial ancestor segregated form rna observed eukaryotic gene structure dr senapathys research also elucidates origin splice junctions eukaryotic genes major questions splice junction signals originated dr senapathy predicted split gene theory true ends orfs stop codon would become ends exons would occur within introns would define splice junctions senapathy found almost splice junctions eukaryotic genes contained stop codons exactly ends introns bordering exons fact stop codons found form canonical aggt splicing sequence three stop codons occurring part strong consensus signals senapathy observed mutations stop codon bases within splice junctions cause majority diseases caused splicing mutations emphasizing importance stop codons splice junctions thus basic split gene theory led hypothesis splice junctions originated stop dr marshall nirenberg supported publication paper pnas new scientist covered publication titled exons introns research based split gene theory sheds lights basic questions exons introns exons eukaryotes generally short human exons average bases short bases introns usually long average bases several hundred thousands bases long example genes ptprd dr senapathy provided plausible answer questions remained explanation far based split gene theory exons eukaryotic genes originated random dna sequences match lengths orfs random sequence possibly around bases close median length orfs random sequence genome sequences living organisms example human exhibits exactly average lengths bases exons longest exons bases exceptions length longest random orfs addition introns long based split gene theory found true eukaryotic organisms work also explains genomes large example human genome three billion bases small fraction human genome codes proteins regulatory split genes originated random primordial dna sequences would contain significant amount dna would represented introns furthermore genome assembled random dna containing split genes would also include intergenic random dna thus nascent genomes originated random dna sequences large regardless complexity organism observation genomes several organisms onion billion bases salamander billion bases much larger human billion organisms complex human provides credence split gene theory furthermore findings genomes several organisms smaller although contain essentially number genes human c elegans genome size million bases arabidopsis genome size million bases adds support theory split gene theory predicts introns split genes genomes could reduced deleted form compared larger genes long introns thus leading reduced fact researchers recently proposed smaller genomes actually reduced genomes adds support split gene dr senapathys research also addresses origin spliceosomal machinery edits introns rna transcripts genes split genes originated random dna introns would become unnecessary integral part eukaryotic genes along splice junctions ends spliceosomal machinery would required remove enable short exons linearly spliced together contiguously coding mrna translated complete protein thus split gene theory shows whole spliceosomal machinery originated due origin split genes random dna sequences remove unnecessary dr senapathy also proposed plausible mechanistic functional rationale eukaryotic nucleus originated major unanswered question transcripts split genes spliced mrnas present cell without nucleus ribosomes would try bind unspliced primary rna transcript spliced mrna would result molecular chaos boundary originated separate rna splicing process mrna translation avoid problem molecular chaos exactly found eukaryotic cells splicing primary rna transcript occurs within nucleus spliced mrna transported cytoplasm ribosomes translate proteins nuclear boundary provides clear separation primary rna splicing mrna translation investigations thus led possibility primordial dna essentially random sequence gave rise complex structure split genes exons introns splice junctions also predict cells harbored split genes complex nuclear cytoplasmic boundary must spliceosomal machinery thus possible earliest cell complex surprisingly findings extensive comparative genomics research several organisms past years showing overwhelmingly earliest organisms could highly complex eukaryotic could contained complex exactly predicted senapathys theory spliceosome highly complex machinery within eukaryotic cell containing proteins several snrnps paper complex spliceosomal organization ancestral extant eukaryotes molecular biologists dr lesley collins dr david penny state begin hypothesis spliceosome increased complexity throughout eukaryotic evolution however examination distribution spliceosomal components indicates spliceosome present eukaryotic ancestor also contained key components found todays eukaryotes last common ancestor extant eukaryotes appears show much molecular complexity seen today suggests earliest eukaryotic organisms highly complex contained sophisticated genes proteins split gene theory predicts split gene theory culminated shapirosenapathy
