cannibalism rare may common food canada lynxes establish home ranges vary widely size depending upon method measurement two common methods examining tracks lynx snow snowtracking radio telemetry snowtracking generally gives smaller sizes home ranges studies based snowtracking estimated home range sizes sq mi based radio telemetry given area sq like cats canada lynxes scentmark ranges spraying

staying cover hunting helps lynx conserve energy frigid habitat avoiding unnecessary young ungulates given throat bite suffocate death lynx may eat kill immediately cache snow leaves eat next studies suggest success hunting hares depends heavily distance lynx hare lynx begins chasing relative speeds turn depends hunting prowess lynx alertness hare vegetation cover among canada lynxes occasionally hunt together though studies differ affects success rate compared hunting lynxes may hunt groups hares scavenging common take ungulates killed cold apart canada lynxes coyotes also major predators snowshoe hare study showed compared canada lynxes coyotes feet sink deeper snow due smaller size hence larger body mass foot area ratio prompting ambush prey instead chasing lynxes often study two animals southwest yukon showed hare population increased killed necessary subsistence lynxes need kill hare per day meet energy requirements observed kill hares per day period coyotes success rate emerged successful hunters lynxes succeeded hunts however may resulted greater number adult coyotes studied population lynxes rarely cached kills unlike coyotes may led incomplete consumption kills snowshoe hare numbers declined predators hunted time period hares abundant lynxes killed hares earlier moreover lynxes supplemented diet american red specialist predator canada lynx depends heavily snowshoe hares snowshoe hare populations alaska central canada undergo cyclic rises times population densities fall high mi low mi consequently period hare scarcity occurs every eight years example
