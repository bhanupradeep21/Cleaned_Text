cholecystokinin cck cckpz greek chole bile cysto sac kinin move hence move bilesac gallbladder peptide hormone gastrointestinal system responsible stimulating digestion fat protein cholecystokinin formerly called pancreozymin synthesized secreted enteroendocrine cells duodenum first segment small intestine presence causes release digestive enzymes bile pancreas gallbladder respectively also acts hunger evidence small intestine controls release bile uncovered early french physiologist claude bernard showed dilute acetic acid applied orifice bile duct duct released bile french physiologist Ã©mile wertheimer fr showed reflex mediated nervous french physiologist charles fleig showed discharge bile mediated substance conveyed remained possibility increased flow bile response presence acid duodenum might due secretin discovered problem finally resolved andrew conway ivy colleague eric oldberg northwestern university medical school found new hormone caused contraction gall bladder called alan harper henry raper university manchester discovered hormone stimulated pancreatic enzyme secretion named however pancreozymin subsequently found swedish biochemists johannes erik jorpes viktor mutt undertook monumental task isolating purifying porcine cholecystokinin determining amino acid sequence finally presented porcine cholecystokinins amino acid sequence cholecystokinin member
