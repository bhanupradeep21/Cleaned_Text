anosmia also known smell blindness loss ability detect one anosmia may temporary differs hyposmia decreased sensitivity anosmia due number factors including inflammation nasal mucosa blockage nasal passages destruction temporal lobular anosmia stemming sinus inflammation due chronic mucosal changes lining paranasal sinus middle superior anosmia caused inflammatory changes nasal passageways treated simply reducing caused chronic meningitis neurosyphilis would increase intracranial pressure long period cases including ciliopathy due primary ciliary term derives neolatin anosmia based ancient greek ἀν ὀσμή osmḗ smell another related term hyperosmia refers increased ability smell people may anosmic one particular odor condition known specific anosmia absence sense smell birth known congenital united states people aged affected anosmia common symptom persist long anosmia inability may partial total specific certain reduced sensitivity smells anosmia number harmful people sudden onset anosmia may find food less appetizing though congenital anosmics rarely complain none report loss weight loss smell also dangerous hinders detection gas leaks fire spoiled food common view anosmia trivial make difficult patient receive types medical aid someone lost senses hearing sightcitation needed many experience one sided loss smell often result minor head trauma type anosmia normally detected nostrils tested separately using method testing nostril separately often show reduced even completely absent sense smell either one nostril something often revealed nostrils simultaneously losing established sentimental smell memory eg smell grass grandparents attic particular book loved ones oneself known cause feelings source needed loss ability smell may lead loss libido usually apply olfactory dysfunction often people loss smell birth report pretended able smell children thought smelling something oldermature people could understand concept smelling want appear different others children get older often realize report parents actually possess sense smell often surprise parentscitation needed temporary loss smell caused blocked nose infection contrast permanent loss smell may caused death olfactory receptor neurons nose brain injury damage olfactory nerve damage brain areas process smell see olfactory system lack sense smell birth usually due genetic factors referred congenital anosmia family members patient congenital anosmia often found similar histories suggests anosmia may follow autosomal dominant anosmia may occasionally early sign degenerative brain disease parkinsons disease alzheimers diseasecitation needed another specific cause permanent loss could damage olfactory receptor neurons use certain types nasal spray ie cause vasoconstriction nasal microcirculation avoid damage subsequent risk loss smell vasoconstricting nasal sprays used absolutely necessary short amount time nonvasoconstricting sprays used treat allergyrelated congestion safe use prescribed periods anosmia also caused nasal polyps polyps found people allergies histories sinusitis family history individuals cystic fibrosis often develop nasal polypscitation needed amiodarone drug used treatment arrhythmias heart clinical study demonstrated use drug induced anosmia patients although rare case male treated amiodarone ventricular tachycardia use drug began experiencing olfactory disturbance however decreasing dosage amiodarone severity anosmia decreased accordingly suggesting relationship use amiodarone development chemosensory disturbances including loss smell taste predominant neurological symptom many patients exhibit change chemesthesis including smell loss smell also found predictive symptoms including fever cough fatigue based survey million participants uk google searches smell loss smell anosmia similar terms increased since early months pandemic strongly correlated increases daily cases research mechanisms underlying symptoms currently many countries list anosmia official symptom developed smell tests potential screening global consortium chemosensory research collaborative research organization international smell taste researchers formed investigate loss smell related chemosensory doctors begin detailed elicitation history doctor ask related injuries relation anosmia could include upper respiratory infections head injury psychophysical assessment order taste identification used identify anosmia nervous system examination performed see cranial nerves diagnosis well degree impairment tested much efficiently effectively ever thanks smell testing kits made available well screening tests use materials clinics would readily occasionally accidents change patients sense smell particular smells present longer present occasion head traumas patients unilateral anosmia sense smell tested individually many cases congenital anosmia remain unreported undiagnosed since disorder present birth individual may little understanding sense smell hence unaware may also lead reduction though anosmia caused brain damage treated anosmia caused inflammatory changes mucosa may treated glucocorticoids reduction inflammation use oral glucocorticoids prednisone followed long term topical glucocorticoid nasal spray would easily safely treat anosmia prednisone regimen adjusted based degree thickness mucosa discharge oedema presence absence nasal however treatment permanent may repeated short together medication pressure upper area nose must mitigated aeration anosmia caused nasal polyp may treated steroidal treatment removal one experiment two people given single dose mg turmeric reported find improvements anosmia ageusia however actual studies yet done regarding although early development gene therapy restored sense smell mice congenital anosmia caused ciliopathy case genetic condition affected cilia bodies normally enabled detect airborne chemicals adenovirus used implant working version gene defective cells nose restored cilia allowed sense united states people aged affected smell assessed persons aged years older rates anosmiasevere hyposmia age rising age rates
