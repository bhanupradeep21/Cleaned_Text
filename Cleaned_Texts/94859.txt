many protists protective shells usually made silica glass calcium carbonate chalk protists diverse group eukaryote organisms plants animals fungi typically microscopic unicellular organisms live water moist environments protists shells often tough mineralised forms resist degradation survive death protist microfossil although protists typically small ubiquitous numbers shells play huge part formation ocean sediments global cycling elements nutrients role protist shells depends type protist protists diatoms radiolaria intricate glasslike shells made silica hard protective serve barrier prevent water loss shells small pores allow gas exchange nutrient uptake coccolithophores foraminifera also hard protective shells shells made calcium carbonate shells help buoyancy allowing organisms float water column move around easily addition protection support protist shells also serve scientists means identification examining characteristics shells different species protists identified ecology evolution studied cellular life likely originated singlecelled prokaryotes including modern bacteria archaea later evolved complex eukaryotes eukaryotes include organisms plants animals fungi protists protists usually singlecelled microscopic heterotrophic meaning obtain nutrients consuming organisms autotrophic meaning produce food photosynthesis chemosynthesis mixotrophic meaning produce food mixture methods term protist came use historically refer group biologically similar organisms however modern research shown paraphyletic group contain descendants common ancestor constitute clade currently formal scientific use nonetheless term continues used informally refer eukaryotes classified plants fungi animals protists small seen naked eye highly diverse organisms currently organised phyla easy studies shown high protist diversity exists oceans deep seavents river sediments suggesting large numbers eukaryotic microbial communities yet eukaryotes protists possess within cell least
