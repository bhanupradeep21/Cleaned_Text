used carriers gene therapy general neuroethics revolves around cost benefit approach find techniques technologies beneficial patients progress certain fields shown beneficial using stem cells treat certain neurodegenerative diseases parkinsons study done showed induced pluripotent stem cells ipscs used aid parkinsons research treatment cells used study progression parkinsons well used

stem cells treat cerebral palsy study however successful parkinsons treatment case stem cells used treat animal models injured way mimicked cp brings neuroethical issue animal models used science since diseases inflicted occur naturally always reliable examples person actual disease would respond treatment stem cells used survive implantation show significant nerve regeneration however studies ongoing discussed stem cells used treat degenerative diseases one form degenerative disease occur brain well throughout body autoimmune disease autoimmune diseases cause body attack cells therefore destroys cells well whatever functional purpose cells contribute one form autoimmune disease affects central nervous system multiple sclerosis disease body attacks glial cells form myelin coats around axons neurons causes nervous system essentially short circuit pass information slowly stem cells therapy used try cure damage caused body ms hematopoietic stem cell transplantation used try cure ms patients essentially reprogramming immune system main risk encountered form treatment possibility rejection stem cells hematopoietic stem cells harvested individual risk rejection much lower risk cells programmed induce ms however tissue donated another individual high risk rejection leading possibly fatal toxicity recipients body considering fairly good treatments ms use stem cells case may higher cost benefits produce however research continues perhaps stem cells truly become viable treatment ms well autoimmune examples neurological diseases stem cell treatment researched general future looks promising stem cell application field neurology however possible complications lie overall ethics stem cell use possible recipient rejection well overproliferation cells causing possible brain
