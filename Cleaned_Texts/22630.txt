antagonists sometimes referred also called blockers class medications block action histamine histamine receptors parietal cells stomach decreases production stomach acid antagonists used treatment dyspepsia peptic ulcers gastroesophageal reflux disease surpassed proton pump inhibitors ppis ppi omeprazole found effective healing alleviating symptoms ulcers reflux oesophagitis blockers ranitidine antagonists end tidine type antihistamine general usage however term antihistamine typically refers antagonists relieve allergic reactions like antagonists antagonists function inverse agonists rather receptor antagonists due constitutive activity prototypical antagonist called cimetidine developed sir james smith kline french glaxosmithkline midtolate first marketed sold trade name tagamet became first blockbuster drug use quantitative structureactivity relationships qsar led development agents starting ranitidine first sold zantac thought better adverse effect profile later disproven fewer drug interactions potent cimetidine prototypical histamine receptor antagonist later drugs developed cimetidine culmination project smith kline french skf glaxosmithkline james w black c robin ganellin others develop histamine receptor antagonist would suppress stomach acid secretion known histamine stimulated secretion stomach acid also traditional antihistamines effect acid production facts skf scientists postulated existence two different types histamine receptors designated one acted upon traditional antihistamines one acted upon histamine stimulate secretion stomach acid skf team used classical design process starting structure histamine hundreds modified compounds synthesised effort develop model thenunknown receptor first breakthrough nαguanylhistamine partial antagonist lead receptor model refined eventually led development burimamide specific competitive antagonist receptor burimamide times potent nαguanylhistamine proving efficacy receptor potency burimamide still low oral administration efforts improvement structure based structure modification stomach due acid dissociation constant compound led development metiamide metiamide effective agent however associated unacceptable nephrotoxicity agranulocytosis proposed toxicity arose thiourea group similar guanidine analogues investigated discovery cimetidine would become first clinically successful antagonist ranitidine common brand name zantac developed glaxo also glaxosmithkline effort match success smith kline french cimetidine ranitidine also result rational drug design process utilising bythenfairlyrefined model histamine receptor quantitative structureactivity relationships qsar glaxo refined model replacing imidazolering cimetidine furanring nitrogencontaining substituent developed ranitidine found much better tolerability profile ie fewer adverse drug reactions longerlasting action ten times activity cimetidine ranitidine introduced worlds biggestselling prescription drug receptor antagonists since largely superseded even effective proton pump inhibitors ppis omeprazole becoming biggestselling drug many years antagonists competitive antagonists histamine parietal cells receptor suppress normal secretion acid parietal cells mealstimulated secretion acid accomplish two mechanisms histamine released enterochromaffinlike cells ecl stomach blocked binding parietal cell receptors stimulate acid secretion therefore substances promote acid secretion gastrin acetylcholine reduced effect parietal cells receptors blocked antagonists used clinicians treatment acidrelated gastrointestinal conditions people suffer infrequent heartburn may take either antacids receptor antagonists treatment antagonists offer several advantages antacids including longer duration action hours vs hours antacids greater efficacy ability used prophylactically meals reduce chance heartburn occurring proton pump inhibitors however preferred treatment erosive esophagitis since shown promote healing better needed antagonists generally well tolerated exception cimetidine commonly elicits following adverse drug reactions adrs antagonists infrequent adrs include hypotension rare adrs include headache tiredness dizziness confusion diarrhea constipation addition gynecomastia occurred men treated nonhypersecretory conditions cimetidine month longer men treated pathologic hypersecretory conditions even fewer men cimetidine may also cause loss libido impotence reversible upon review found overall risk pneumonia higher among antagonist according umbrella review metaanalyses use receptor antagonist associated pneumonia peritonitis necrotizing enterocolitis clostridium difficile infection liver cancer gastric cancer hip fracture histamine cause bladder inflammation contribute symptoms bladder diseases cystitis inflammation bladder painful bladder disease histamine binds receptors bladder smooth muscle leading relaxationcontradictory bladder muscle promotion urine storage histamine seem direct role development bladder diseases contribute bladder inflammation associated symptoms receptors bladder play role regulating bladder contraction receptor antagonists shown reduce bladder contractions improve bladder function animal blocking activation receptors bladder leads decreased bladder contractions improved urine storage receptor antagonists may potential role managing bladder conditions overactive bladder typically used treating cystitis painful bladder disease mechanism action bladder diseases still fully understood limited research histamine receptor antagonists potentially alleviate symptoms painful bladder regard pharmacokinetics cimetidine particular interferes bodys mechanisms drug metabolism elimination liver cytochrome cyp pathway specific cimetidine inhibitor enzymes reducing metabolism drugs enzymes cimetidine may increase serum concentrations toxic levels many drugs affected including warfarin theophylline phenytoin lidocaine quinidine propranolol labetalol metoprolol methadone tricyclic antidepressants benzodiazepines dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers sulfonylureas recreational drugs ethanol methylenedioxymethamphetamine mdma recently developed antagonists less likely alter cyp metabolism ranitidine potent cyp inhibitor cimetidine although still shares several latters interactions warfarin theophylline phenytoin metoprolol famotidine negligible effect cyp system appears significant
