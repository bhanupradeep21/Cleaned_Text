cofounded biotechnology companies including january filtricine mirvie protos part thermo fisher scientific part snyder made contributions medicine genomics biotechnology support research snyder laboratory invented number novel systemswide genomics technologies snyders laboratory yale initially focused studying genome yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae eukaryote model organism commonly used genetics molecular later lab began use techniques look human encyclopedia dna elements encode project launched us national human genome research institute nhgri goal identifying functional elements human genome principal investigator encode project since inception lab contributed large number data data contributed discovery many transcription factor binding sites originally twice much human genome transcribed mature rnacitation needed snyder laboratory showed transcription factor binding sites vary greatly among people closely related species showing much diversity individuals closely related species happens level gene regulation rather changes genes themselvescitation needed snyder broadened labs genomics research include fields proteomics transcriptomics metabolomics move stanford snyder also began focus using omics technologies monitor human health lab published first deep longitudinal profiling single person using multiomics technologies producing data set colloquially known snyderome research approach later expanded people included data generated wearable biosensors snyders lab established first largescale systems project investigate yeast genes proteins time employing transposon tagging approach investigate gene expression protein localization gene disruptioncitation needed researchers conducted first largescale systems analysis genes proteins creature libraries methodologies made available use laboratories around world addition genome snyder group first establish protein proteome microarrays largescale analysis protein function antibody reactivitycitation needed found protein kinases yeast proteins several novel biological activities used autoantibody profilingcitation needed laboratory constructed first human chromosome array later first whole genome array map transcription factor binding sites novel transcribed regions genomecitation needed collaboration dr patrick brown laboratory snyder laboratory developed chipchip carry first genome wide mapping transcription factor binding sites initially established yeast later applied methods humanscitation needed chipchip technique mapping transcription factor binding sites ultimately morphed chipseq order take advantage dna sequencing rather using dna chipseq method foundational multiple multicenter consortia projects including encyclopedia dna elements project encode later invented rnaseq better map transcriptomes protein coding noncoding advent high throughput dna sequencing technologies snyders laboratory first sequence organism using technology snyders laboratory sequenced human pathogen acinetobacter baumannii invented paired end sequencing using new high throughput sequencing technologies using demonstrate ten times much structural variation sv human genome previously realized sv deletions insertions due nonhomologous recombination unexpected discovery time since svs proposed due homologous recombination beyond genome snyder laboratory also first set protein proteome microarrays largescale characterization protein function antibody demonstrated many novel biological activities protein kinases yeast proteins showed useful autoantibody using indepth omics approaches applied yeast upon move stanford snyder began apply systemswide analysis human health snyder laboratory carried first deep longitudinal profiling one person using multiomics technologies genomics transcriptomics proteomics metabolomics etc deep profiling used genomics first time predict disease risk follow disease onset level previously highlighted cell journals anniversary snyder presents personalized medicine may applied individuals long time frames analyzing transcription metabolite cytokine fluctuations periods health disease alongside fully sequenced approach collecting longitudinal deep data humans applied many groups worldwide snyder lab demonstrated selftracking using wearable biosensors used monitoring health illness together studies demonstrate power using longitudinal tracking big data manage human httpsenwikipediaorgwikimichaelpsnyder
