additionally estimation ecdysozoan opsins suggest anomalocaris may dichromatic color interpretation anomalocaris active predator widely accepted throughout history raptorial frontal appendages midgut glands strongly suggest predatory case canadensis outstanding size amongst burgess shale fauna also make one first apex predators known however longstanding idea anomalocaris fed hardbodied animals especially ability penetrate mineralized exoskeleton trilobites questioned many recent studies considering likely anomalocaris exclusively hunted softbodied cambrian trilobites found round wshaped bite marks identified shape mouthparts peytoia previously misidentified stronger evidence anomalocaris ate trilobites comes coprolite contain trilobite parts large anomalocarids known organism period large enough produced however since anomalocaris lacks mineralized tissue seemed unlikely would able penetrate hard calcified shell rather coprolites may produced different organisms trilobites genus another suggested possibility anomalocaris fed grabbing one end prey oral cone using frontal appendages quickly rock end animal back forth produced stresses exploited weaknesses arthropod cuticles causing preys exoskeleton rupture allowing predator access behaviour originally thought provided evolutionary pressure trilobites roll avoid flexed lack wear radiodont mouthparts suggests come regular contact mineralized trilobite shells possibly better suited feeding smaller softbodied organisms suction since would experienced structural failure used armour canadensis suggested capable feeding organisms hard exoskeletons due short robust spines frontal however conclusion solely based comparison fragile frontal appendages suspension feeding radiodonts eg briggsi houcaris typical lack damage endites frontal appendages canadensis damage present single specimen suggests used grasp hardshelled opposed peytoia whose oral cone rectangular short protruding spines oral cone canadensis smaller irregular opening permitting strong biting motions indicating suctionfeeding behavior suck softer threedimensional modelling various radiodont frontal appendages also suggest canadensis capable prey smaller cm diameter active softbodied animals eg vetulicolian freeswimming arthropods like isoxyids hymenocarines bicknell et al examined frontal appendages anomalocaris suggesting active nektonic apex predator postured frontal appendages outstretched anomalocaris would able swim maximized speed similar modern predatory water bugs eyes would suitable hunt prey welllit waters anomalocaris would hunted various freeswimming animals since large diversity nektonic pelagic softbodied animals probably would hunted benthic animals like trilobites considering possibility damaging frontal appendages substrate trying grab prey seafloor speed instead animals radiodonts eg hurdia cambroraster titanokorys stanleycaris artiopods eg sidneyia would benthic predators burgess specimens anomalocaris found
