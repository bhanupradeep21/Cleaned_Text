dysfunction hematologic abnormalities growth retardation first two included clinical diagnostic syndrome characterized autosomal recessive mode inheritance gene mutated syndrome lies long arm chromosome cytogenetic position composed five exons associated mrna transcript kilobase pairs length sbds gene resides block genomic sequence locally duplicated chromosome second copy contains nonfunctional version sbds gene identical original gene accumulated inactivating mutations time considered pseudogene study sds families diseaseassociated mutations appeared result gene conversion patients harbored least one mutation gene conversion occurs intact sbds gene pseudogene copy aberrantly recombine meiosis leading incorporation pseudogenelike sequences otherwise functional copy sbds gene thereby inactivating two gene conversion mutations predominate sds patients one splice site mutation affecting splice site intron two second exon two nonsense mutation marked absence patients homozygous otherwise common nonsense mutation suggested sbds gene essential consistent knockout mouse gene leads early embryonic turn suggests common splice site mutation seen patients may hypomorphic ie results partial loss function whereas complete loss sbds function likely sbds gene expressed tissues encodes protein amino acid residues great deal indirect evidence suggested sbds protein may involved aspect cellular rna metabolism ribosome assembly function wide occurrence gene archaea eukaryotes supported role protein fundamental evolutionarily conserved aspect cellular homologous genes archaea also tend present conserved cluster enriched rna processing ribosomal genes specific function sbds rna metabolism ribosome assembly function supported localization nucleolus nuclear subdomain processes occur line yeast homologue sdoi shown critical maturation ribosomes effecting release recycling nucleolar shuttling factor required maturation translational activation ribosomes also shown

defective ribosome function pleiotropic disease features may result cellspecific effects reduced levels sbds activity provided hypomorphic mutationscitation needed initially clinical presentation sds may appear similar cystic fibrosis however cf excluded normal chloride sweat test faecal elastase marker pancreatic function reduced variation intermittent nature potential longterm improvement clinical features make syndrome difficult diagnose sds may present either malabsorption hematological problems rarely sds may present skeletal defects including severe rib cage abnormalities lead difficulty breathing diagnosis generally based evidence exocrine pancreatic dysfunction neutropenia skeletal abnormalities short stature characteristics used support diagnosis gene responsible disease identified genetic testing available pancreatic exocrine insufficiency may treated pancreatic enzyme severe skeletal abnormalities may require surgical intervention neutropenia may treated granulocytecolony stimulating factor gcsf boost peripheral neutrophil counts however ongoing unresolved concern drug could contribute development leukemia signs progressive marrow failure may warrant bone marrow transplantation bmt used successfully treat hematological aspects disease however sds patients elevated occurrence bmtrelated adverse events including graftversushost disease gvhd toxicity

proteinbased approachescitation needed major goal curative therapy sds reduce risk bone marrow failure halt progression malignant transformation toward myelodysplastic syndrome mds acute myeloid leukemia aml detrimental complications sds currently therapy however several emerging therapeutic strategies including gene therapy antisense oligonucleotides asos could potentially slow prevent malignant transformation least theory new therapies proven effective several rare diseases including metachromatic leukodystrophy spinal muscular atrophy several sds patient groups advocating better therapies one organization focused driving therapy development challenge whether sds community come together support required whether organizations successfully execute strategy coordinates efforts
