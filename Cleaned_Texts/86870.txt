vegetative reproduction also known vegetative propagation vegetative multiplication cloning form asexual reproduction occurring plants new plant grows fragment cutting parent plant specialized reproductive structures sometimes called vegetative many plants naturally reproduce way also induced artificially horticulturists developed asexual propagation techniques use vegetative propagules replicate plants success rates difficulty propagation vary greatly monocotyledons typically lack vascular cambium making challenging propagate plant propagation process plant reproduction species cultivar sexual asexual happen use vegetative parts plants leaves stems roots produce new plants growth specialized vegetative plant many plants reproduce vegetative reproduction rarely exclusively use method reproduce vegetative reproduction evolutionary advantageous allow genetic diversity could lead plants accumulate deleterious vegetative reproduction favored allows plants produce offspring per unit resource reproduction seed general juveniles plant easier propagate although plants normally reproduce sexually many reproduce vegetatively induced via hormonal treatments meristematic cells capable cellular differentiation present many plant tissues vegetative propagation usually considered cloning however root cuttings thornless blackberries rubus fruticosus revert thorny type adventitious shoot develops cell genetically thorny thornless blackberry chimera epidermal layers genetically thornless tissue beneath genetically grafting often complete cloning method seedlings used rootstocks case top plant clonal crops particularly apples rootstocks vegetatively propagated entire graft clonal scion rootstock clones apomixis including apospory diplospory type reproduction involve fertilization flowering plants unfertilized seeds produced plantlets grow instead flowers hawkweed hieracium dandelion taraxacum citrus citrus many grasses kentucky bluegrass poa pratensis use form asexual reproduction bulbils sometimes formed instead flowers garlic meristem tissue makes process asexual reproduction possible normally found stems leaves tips stems roots consists undifferentiated cells constantly dividing allowing plant growth give rise plant tissue systems meristem tissues ability continuously divide allows vegetative propagation another important ability allows vegetative propagation ability develop adventitious roots arise vegetative parts plants stem leaves roots allow development new plants body parts several advantages vegetative reproduction mainly produced offspring clones parent plants plant favorable traits continue pass advantageous genetic information offspring economically beneficial commercial growers clone certain plant ensure consistency throughout vegetative propagation also allows plants avoid costly complex process producing sexual reproduction organs flowers subsequent seeds example developing ace cultivar extremely difficult farmers develop desired traits lily use grafting budding ensure consistency new cultivar successful production commercial level however seen many variegated plants always apply many plants actually chimeras cuttings might reflect attributes one parent cell lines vegetative propagation also allows plants circumvent immature seedling phase reach mature phase nature increases chances plant successfully reach maturity commercially saves farmers lot time money allows faster crop vegetative reproduction offers research advantages several areas biology practical usage comes afforestation common use made vegetative propagation forest geneticists tree breeders move genes selected trees convenient location usually designated gene bank clone bank cloneholding orchard seed orchard genes recombined pedigreed analyses suggest vegetative reproduction characteristic makes plant species likely become invasive since vegetative reproduction often faster sexual reproduction quickly increases populations may contribute recovery following disturbance fires major disadvantage vegetative propagation prevents species genetic diversity lead reductions crop plants genetically identical therefore susceptible pathogenic plant viruses bacteria fungi wipe entire natural vegetative propagation mostly process found herbaceous woody perennial plants typically involves structural modifications stem although horizontal underground part plant whether stem leaf root contribute vegetative reproduction plant plant species survive significantly expand vegetative reproduction would perennial almost definition since specialized organs vegetative reproduction like seeds annuals serve survive seasonally harsh conditions plant persists location vegetative reproduction individuals long period time constitutes clonal colony sense process one reproduction one survival expansion biomass individual individual organism increases size via cell multiplication remains intact process called vegetative growth however vegetative reproduction new plants result new individuals almost every respect except genetic considerable interest process appears reset aging previously mentioned plants vegetatively propagate artificially naturally common methods natural vegetative reproduction involve development new plant specialized structures mature plant addition adventitious roots roots arise plant structures root stems leaves modified stems leaves roots play important role plants ability naturally propagate common modified stems leaves roots allow vegetative propagation also known stolons runners modified stems unlike rhizomes grow existing stems soil surface propagated buds modified stems produce roots stems buds separated ones found examples plants use runners strawberries currants bulbs inflated parts stem within lie central shoots new plants typically underground surrounded plump layered leaves provide nutrients new examples plants use bulbs shallots lilies tulips tubers develop either stem root stem tubers grow rhizomes runners swell storing nutrients root tubers propagate roots modified store nutrients get large produce new examples stem tubers potatoes yams examples root tubers sweet potatoes dahlias corms solid enlarged underground stems store nutrients fleshy solid stem tissue surrounded papery leaves corms differ bulbs centers consists solid tissue bulbs consist layered examples plants use corms gladiolus taro also known root sprouts suckers plant stems arise buds base parent plants stems examples plants use suckers apple elm banana trees plantlets miniature structures arise meristem leaf margins eventually develops roots drop leaves grew example plant uses plantlets bryophyllum daigremontianum syn kalanchoe daigremontianum also known mother thousands many plantlets keikis additional offshoots develop vegetative stems flower stalks several orchids examples plants use keikis phalaenopsis epidendrum dendrobium genera orchids apomixis process asexual reproduction seed absence meiosis fertilization generating clonal progeny maternal vegetative propagation particular cultivars desirable characteristics common practice used farmers horticulturalists produce better crops desirable qualities common methods artificial vegetative propagation cutting part plant usually stem leaf cut planted adventitious roots grow cuttings new plant eventually develops usually cuttings treated hormones planted induce grafting involves attaching scion desired cutting stem another plant called stock remains rooted ground eventually tissue systems become grafted integrated plant characteristics grafted plant eg mango guava etc layering process includes bending plant branches stems touch ground covered soil adventitious roots develop underground part plant known layer method vegetative reproduction also occurs naturally another similar method air layering involved scraping replanting tree branches develop trees examples jasmine suckers grow form dense compact mat attached parent plant many suckers lead smaller crop size excess suckers pruned mature suckers transplanted new area develop new tissue culture plant cells taken various parts plant cultured nurtured sterilized medium mass developed tissue known callus cultured hormoneladened medium eventually develops plantlets planted eventually develop grown offset lower part single culm
