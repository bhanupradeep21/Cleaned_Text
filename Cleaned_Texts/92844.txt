management heart failure requires multimodal approach involves combination lifestyle modifications medications possibly use devices surgery people congestive heart failure chf educated undertake various nonpharmacological measures improve symptoms prognosis measures according review apparently evidence benefit fluid restriction patients clinically stable heart failure otherwise receiving optimal pharmacological review suggested clinicians still choosing restrict fluid intake patients hf consider individualized fluid prescription potentially based patient body weight sodium intake likelihood generally water intake limited l daily less patients hyponatremia though fluid restriction may beneficial regardless symptomatic reduction significant gap treatment chf particularly underuse ace inhibitors βblockers aldosterone antagonists shown provide mortality treatment chf aims relieve symptoms maintain euvolemic state normal fluid level circulatory system improve prognosis delaying progression heart failure reducing cardiovascular risk medications used include diuretic agents vasodilator agents positive inotropes ace inhibitors beta blockers aldosterone antagonists eg spironolactone medications increase heart function positive inotrope milrinone lead increased death unless contraindicated tolerated ace inhibitor ace therapy recommended patients systolic heart failure irrespective symptomatic severity blood ace inhibitors improve symptoms decrease mortality reduce ventricular hypertrophy angiotensin ii receptor antagonist therapy also referred angiotensin receptor blockers particularly using candesartan acceptable alternative patient unable tolerate acei aceis arbs decrease afterload antagonizing vasopressor effect angiotensin thereby decreasing amount work heart must perform also believed angiotensin directly affects cardiac remodeling blocking activity thereby slow deterioration cardiac function number studies done investigate whether acei plus

absolute risk reduction also increased discontinuation medication due adverse effects absolute risk increase plain english people would need treated reduce one hospitalisation hf treating people would harm one person adverse effects thus combined therapy improve mortality may slightly increase morbidity diuretic therapy indicated relief congestive symptoms several classes used combinations reserved severe heart heart failure patient exhibits resistance poor response diuretic therapy ultrafiltration aquapheresis may needed achieve adequate control fluid retention congestion use mechanical methods fluid removal produce meaningful clinical benefits patients diureticresistant heart failure may restore responsiveness conventional doses newly emerging evidence showed glucocorticoids could used treatment decompensated heart failure potentiate renal responsiveness diuretics especially heart failure patients refractory diuretic resistance large dose loop glucocorticoids induce potent diuresis heart failure could improve renal responsiveness atrial natriuretic peptide upregulating natriuretic peptide receptor npra expression renal inner medullary collecting duct inducing potent recently within last years βblockers contraindicated chf owing negative inotropic effect ability produce bradycardia effects worsen heart failure however current guidelines recommend βblocker therapy patients systolic heart failure due left ventricular systolic dysfunction stabilization diuretic acei therapy irrespective symptomatic severity blood acei therapy addition βblocker decrease mortality improve left ventricular function several βblockers specifically indicated chf including bisoprolol carvedilol nebivolol extendedrelease metoprolol antagonism inotropic chronotropic effects decreases amount work heart must perform also thought catecholamines sympathomimetics effect cardiac remodeling blocking activity slow deterioration cardiac function digoxin mildly positive inotrope negative chronotrope used firstline therapy reserved control ventricular rhythm patients atrial fibrillation adequate control achieved acei beta blocker loop evidence digoxin reduces mortality chf although studies suggest decreased rate hospital contraindicated cardiac tamponade restrictive cardiomyopathy inotropic agent dobutamine advised shortterm use acutely decompensated heart failure phosphodiesterase inhibitors milrinone sometimes utilized severe cardiomyopathy mechanism action inhibiting breakdown thereby increasing concentration camp similar beta adrenoreceptor agonism resulting inotropic effects modest diuretic effects combination isosorbide dinitratehydralazine vasodilator regimen ace inhibitors angiotensin ii receptor antagonists proven survival benefits combination appears particularly beneficial chf patients african american background respond less effectively acei rales showed addition spironolactone improve mortality particularly severe cardiomyopathy ejection fraction less related medication eplerenone shown ephesus similar effect specifically labelled use decompensated heart failure complicating acute myocardial infarction antagonism aldosterone decrease effects sodium water retention thought main mechanism action antagonizing deleterious effects aldosterone cardiac remodeling nesiritide recombinant form bnatriuretic
