symbiotic bacteria bacteria living symbiosis another organism example rhizobia living root nodules legumes provide nitrogen fixing activity types symbiotic relationships mutualism commensalism parasitism endosymbionts live inside organisms whether bodies theory endosymbiosis known symbiogenesis provides explanation evolution eukaryotic organisms according theory endosymbiosis origin eukaryotic cells scientists believe eukaryotes originated relationship two prokaryotic cells approximately billion years ago suggested specifically ancestors mitochondria chloroplasts entered endosymbiotic relationship another prokaryotic cell eventually evolving eukaryotic cells people familiar ectosymbiosis defined symbiotic relationship one organism lives outside surface different instance barnacles whales example ectosymbiotic relationship whale provides barnacle home ride access food whale harmed also receive benefits also example commensalism example ectosymbiotic bacteria cutibacterium acnes bacteria involved symbiotic relationship humans whose skin live cutibacterium acnes cause acne skin becomes oily also reduce skins susceptibility skin diseases caused oxidative certain plants establish symbiotic relationship bacteria enabling produce nodules facilitate conversion atmospheric nitrogen ammonia connection cytokinins found play role development root fixing appears must plant need nitrogen fixing bacteria must also able synthesize cytokinins promote production root nodules required nitrogen fixation symbiotic bacteria able live plant animal tissue digestive systems symbiotic bacteria help break foods contain fiber also help produce vitamins symbiotic bacteria live near hydrothermal vents usually mutual relationship bacteria live tube worms two major modes transmission symbiotic bacteria first horizontal transmission microbes acquired environment either environment host population serves inoculum example horizontal transmission deep sea tube worm second type transmission vertical transmission symbiont passed parent offspring aposymbiotic example vertical transmission seen drosophila melanogaster wolbachia spp corals found form characteristic associations symbiotic nitrogenfixing corals evolved oligotrophic waters typically poor nitrogen corals must therefore form mutualistic relationship nitrogen fixing organism case subject study namely symbiodinium addition dinoflagellate coral also form relationships bacteria archae problem dinoflagellates also nitrogen limited must form symbiotic relationship another organism suggested diazotrophs addition cyanobacteria found possess genes enable undergo nitrogen particular study goes investigate possibility addition named dinoflagellate certain cyanobacteria endosymbiotic algae coral contain enzymes enabling undergo ammonium assimilation due small size genome endosymbionts unable exist length time outside host cell thereby preventing longterm symbiotic relationship however case endonuclear symbiotic bacterium holospora holospora species maintain infectivity limited time form symbiotic relationship paramecium species mutualistic relationship legumes rhizobial bacteria enabling plants survive otherwise nitrogenpoor soil environment coevolution described situation two organisms evolve response one another study reported functional scientists investigated whether mutualistic relationship conferred evolutionary advantage either plant symbiont find rhizobial bacteria studied evolutionary advantage host find great genetic variation among populations rhizobial bacteria studied symbiotic chemosynthetic bacteria discovered associated mussels bathymodiolus located near hydrothermal vents gene enables utilize hydrogen source energy preference sulphur methane energy source production termites known many pests feed wood however termites digest wood alone instead rely nonbacterial protozoan called trichonympha help digestion trichonympha endosymbiont lives inside termites also acts host bacterial symbionts bacteria inside trichonympha termites produces cellulase cellulase enzymes used break cellulose found plants cell walls termites gut protist trichonympha cellulaseproducing bacteria involved obligate symbiotic mutualism termites benefit two species transform wood nutrients termites digest additionally trichonympha benefit termites termites provide place live access food trichonympha also benefit bacteria help break cellulose wood protist consumes finally bacteria benefits gains place live nutrients needs survive human gut contains approximately one hundred trillion microbes gut dynamic ecosystem composed constant transient components meaning bacteria establishes remains throughout human lifetime bacteria ingested later leaves babies born born without bacteria intestines however soon enter world begin accumulating gut bacteria food bacteria human body actually good us help carrying necessary life processes gut bacteria humans often aid breakdown foods synthesize important vitamins could processed humans therefore humans must careful taking antibiotics sick antibiotics differentiate good bad bacteria bodies therefore kill treated carefully lead issues gastrointestinal tract imbalance bacteria therefore doctors recommend taking probiotic taking antibiotics restore good bacteria organisms typically establish symbiotic relationship due limited availability resources habitat due limitation food source triatomine vectors one host therefore must establish relationship bacteria enable obtain nutrients required maintain use symbiotic bacteria paratransgenesis controlling important vectors disease transmission chagas disease triatome kissing bugs symbiotic bacteria legume roots provide plants ammonia exchange
