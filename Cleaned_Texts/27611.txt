cytoskeletal drugs small molecules interact actin tubulin drugs act cytoskeletal components within cell three main ways cytoskeletal drugs stabilize component cytoskeleton taxol stabilizes microtubules phalloidin stabilizes actin filaments others cytochalasin bind actin monomers prevent polymerizing filaments drugs demecolcine act enhancing depolymerisation already formed microtubules drugs multiple effects cytoskeleton example latrunculin prevents actin polymerization well enhancing rate depolymerization typically microtubule targeting drugs found clinic used therapeutically treatment forms result lack specificity specific type actin ie distinguish cardiac smooth muscle muscle cytoskeletal forms actin use drugs animals results unacceptable offtarget effects despite actin targeting compounds still useful tools used cellular level help understanding complex part cells internal machinery operates example phalloidin conjugated fluorescent probe used visualizing filamentous actin fixed samples cytochalasin latrunculin understood toxins developed certain fungi sponges promote depolymerization filaments specifically cytochalasin fungal alkaloid latrunculin toxin secreted sponges although result depolymerization different mechanisms cytochalasin binds end factin blocks addition subunits contrasting latrunculin binds sequesters gactin thus preventing adding filament end factin upon addition live cells cytochalasin latrunculin disassemble actin cytoskeleton inhibit cell movements toxins secreted sponges jasplakinolide phalloidin phallotoxins isolated amanita phalloides death cap contrasts function cytochalasin latrunculin jasplakinolide binds stabilizes actin dimers enhancing one first phases gactin thus lowering critical concentration minimum concentration needed form phalloidin prevents filaments polymerizing binding subunits factin locking together presence phalloidin cell paralyzes killing phallotoxins isolated phalloides type mushroom involved fatal cases mushroom poisoning liver kidneys humans commonly affected ingestion toxin cause symptoms jaundice seizures name ultimately resulting death three classes toxins isolated phalloides amatoxins phallotoxins virotoxins toxins cause deaths within hours similarly phallotoxins virotoxins interact actin prevent filament depolymerization ultimately toxins disrupt functions cytoskeleton paralyzing susceptible
