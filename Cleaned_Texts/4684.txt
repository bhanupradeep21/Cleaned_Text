zygosaccharomyces initially described saccharomyces bailii lindner reclassified zygosaccharomyces bailii work barnett et spoilage resulting growth yeast zygosaccharomyces widespread caused significant economic losses food industry within genus z bailii one troublesome species due exceptional tolerance various stressful wide range acidic andor highsugar products fruit concentrates wine soft drinks syrups ketchup mayonnaise pickles salad dressing etc normally considered shelfstable ie readily inactivate broad range foodborne microorganisms however products still susceptible spoilage z zygosaccharomyces bailii vegetative cells usually ellipsoid nonmotile reproduced asexually multilateral budding ie buds arise various sites budding process parent cell produces bud outer surface bud elongates parent cells nucleus divides one nucleus migrates bud cell wall material filled gap bud parent cell eventually bud separated form daughter cell unequal z bailii cell size varies within range

intrinsic resistance mechanisms z bailii extremely adaptable robust functionality effectiveness unaffected marginally suppressed environmental conditions low ph low aw limited long time known z bailii maintain acid gradient across cell indicates induction system whereby cells reduce intracellular acid accumulation according warth z bailii uses inducible active transport pump expel acid anions cells counteracting toxic effects acids pump requires energy function optimally high sugar levels enhance z bailii preservative resistance nevertheless view disputed observation concentration acid exactly predicted intracellular extracellular phs pka besides unlikely active acid extrusion alone would sufficient achieve unequal acid distribution across cell membrane instead z bailii might developed much efficient ways altering cell membrane limit diffusional entry acids cells turn dramatically reduce need active extrusion protons acid anions thus saving lot indeed warth reported uptake rate propionic acid diffusion z bailii much lower acidsensitive yeasts eg saccharomyces cerevisiae hence conceivable z bailii puts effort limiting influx acids order enhance acid another mechanism z bailii deal acid challenge yeast uses plasma membrane hadenosine triphosphatase hatpase expel proton cells thereby preventing intracellular addition cole keenan suggested z bailii resistance includes ability tolerate
