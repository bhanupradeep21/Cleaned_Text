antalarmin drug acts antagonist corticotropinreleasing hormone crh also known corticotropinreleasing factor endogenous peptide hormone released response various triggers chronic stress drug addiction triggers result release corticotropin acth another hormone involved physiological response stress chronic release crh acth believed directly indirectly involved many harmful physiological effects chronic stress excessive glucocorticoid release stomach ulcers anxiety diabetes mellitus osteoporosis depression development high blood pressure consequent cardiovascular antalarmin nonpeptide drug blocks receptor consequence reduces release acth response chronic demonstrated animals reduce behavioral responses stressful proposed antalarmin likely newer antagonist drugs still could useful reducing adverse health consequences chronic stress humans well possible uses treatment conditions anxiety depression drug synthesis nonpeptide antagonist receptor first described antalarmin close analog highly structurally similar shown easier findings several chemical pharmacokinetic pharmacological studies indicate two compounds possess similar properties shown table adenylyl cyclase camp assays used various functional studies determine amount camp inhibition two receptor antagonists antalarmin several receptor binding studies shown antalarmin high affinity receptors similar profiles

produce effect comparable conventional antidepressant however positive results seen antalarmin combined ssri antidepressant suggesting potential synergistic encouraging results also observed using antalarmin potential treatment stressinduced initial studies investigating showed compound binds high affinity cortical pituitary crh receptors across several species additionally systemic administration fully antagonizes effects exogenous crh acth levels cell firing locus coeruleus fear potentiation animal however potent selective compound demonstrated low oral bioavailability vitro studies using human liver microsomes predicted high hepatic clearance deeming compound unsuitable clinical development nevertheless many investigators continue study close analogs eg antalarmin using tools examine physiology crh crh receptors well determine potential therapeutic value antagonists several cns peripheral vitro studies examining effects antagonists hypothalmicpituitaryadrenal hpa axis showed antalarmin inhibited acth release rat anterior pituitary well inhibited cortisol synthesis release human adrenal vivo studies revealed pretreating rats antalarmin inhibited increases plasma acth following crh injection iv effect baseline however another study demonstrated weeks antalarmin administered twice daily ip rats significantly lowered basal acth corticosterone levels resulting reduced adrenocortical responsiveness antalarmin administered primates also inhibited increases plasma acth well prevented anxiety response produced social stressor eg presentation another male unfamiliar regards neurochemical effects antalarmin shown inhibit increases extracellular cortical norepinephrine induced rat tail suggesting receptors may implicated stressevoked norepinephrine release cortex antalarmin also shown electrophysiological effects partially reversing inhibition neuronal firing dorsal raphe nucleus occurs following intracerebroventricular icv administration studies using crh receptor antagonists antalarmin anxiety models shown agents produce effects similar clinically effective conditioned fear models antalarmin reduced conditioned freezing behavior suggesting blocked development expression conditioned fear implicating receptors oral administration antalarmin mgkg also significantly reduced immobility rat model behavioral despair effects similar ssri crh also shown promote neurodegeneration suggesting antagonists may neuroprotective effects cells derived rat adrenal medulla extensively used study neural differentiation cells treated crh nm

suggesting proinflammatory properties crh antalarmin also blocked vascular permeability mast cell degranulation response induced intradermal urocortin collectively results indicate stress crh leads activation skin mast cells receptor triggers vasodilation increased vascular permeability chronic antalarmin treatment also showed antiinflammatory effects suggested potential uses treatment inflammatory conditions well stressinduced gastrointestinal irritable bowel mixed results seen research use antalarmin antagonists treatment drug addiction disorders tests antalarmin cocaine use cocaineaddicted monkeys produced slight reductions use statistically however tests cocaineaddicted rats antalarmin prevent dose escalation prolonged use suggesting might stabilize cocaine use prevent increasing time although without consistently reducing antalarmin also showed positive effects reducing withdrawal syndrome chronic opioid significantly reduced selfadministration ethanol
