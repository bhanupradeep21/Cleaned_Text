transitional cell carcinoma also called urothelial carcinoma type cancer typically occurs urinary system common type bladder cancer cancer ureter urethra urachus symptoms urothelial carcinoma bladder include hematuria blood urine diagnosis includes urine analysis imaging urinary tract cystoscopy transitional cell carcinomas arise transitional epithelium tissue lining inner surface hollow term urothelial used specifically refers carcinoma urothelium meaning transitional cell carcinomas urinary system accounts bladder cancer cases bladder cancer top common malignancy disease world associated approximately deaths per year second common type kidney cancer accounts five percent primary renal malignant men older people higher rate urothelial carcinomas risk factors include smoking exposure aromatic treatment approaches depend stage spread tumour tumour removal resection chemotherapy chemoradiation may indicated immunotherapy immune check point inhibitor medications may also signs symptoms transitional cell carcinomas depend location extent cancer symptoms bladder cancer blood urothelial carcinoma prototypical example malignancy arising environmental carcinogenic influences far important cause cigarette smoking contributes approximately onehalf disease chemical exposure sustained workers petroleum industry manufacture paints pigments eg aniline agrochemicals known predispose one urothelial risk lowered increased liquid consumption presumably consequence increased urine production thus less dwell time urothelial surface conversely risk increased among longhaul truck drivers others long urine dwelltimes encountered epithelial cancers physical irritation associated increased risk malignant transformation urothelium thus urothelial carcinomas common context chronic urinary stone disease chronic catheterization patients paraplegia multiple sclerosis chronic infections particular examples listed transitional cell carcinomas often multifocal patients one tumor
