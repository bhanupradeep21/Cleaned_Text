operative vaginal delivery also known assisted instrumental vaginal delivery vaginal delivery assisted use forceps vacuum operative vaginal delivery required times maternal fetal distress assist childbirth alternative caesarean use decreased years comparison caesarean two main instruments used rotational forceps vacuum extractors different complication risks possible complications introduced use instruments mother include pelvic floor injury anal sphincter injury bleeding possible complications infant include bruising scalp retinal bleeding scrapes scalp fetal distress occurs second stage labor operative vaginal delivery may used place caesarean section may pose additional risks birth progressed fetal head deep birth canal maternal exhaustion fetal distress would also indications appropriate use operative vaginal analysis multiple studies found detecting angle fetal head using ultrasound reliable way predict uncomplicated operative vaginal delivery used especially firsttime definite contraindication include nonengagement fetal head unknown fetal position cervix fully dilated membranes ruptured known loss minerals fetal bone fetal relative contraindication include less

united states procedure relies primarily either pair curved forceps blades vacuum extractor applies negative pressure inside womb forceps designed reach top fetal head create necessary traction pull rotate baby hand vacuum extractor uses small metal silicon cap exerts negative pressure fetal scalp felicitate pulling since vacuum extraction cause less injuries mother forcepsassisted delivery
