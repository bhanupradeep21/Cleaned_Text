anterior cruciate ligament acl one pair cruciate ligaments posterior cruciate ligament human knee two ligaments also called cruciform ligaments arranged crossed formation quadruped stifle joint analogous knee based anatomical position also referred cranial cruciate term cruciate translates cross name fitting acl crosses posterior cruciate ligament form x composed strong fibrous material assists controlling excessive motion done limiting mobility joint anterior cruciate ligament one four main ligaments knee providing restraining force anterior tibial displacement knee acl injured ligament four located knee acl originates deep within notch distal femur proximal fibers fan along medial wall lateral femoral two bundles acl anteromedial posterolateral named according bundles insert tibial tibial plateau critical weightbearing region upper extremity tibia acl attaches front intercondyloid eminence tibia blends anterior horn medial meniscus purpose acl resist motions anterior tibial translation internal tibial rotation important rotational function prevents anterior tibial subluxation lateral medial tibiofemoral joints important pivotshift acl mechanoreceptors detect changes direction movement position knee joint changes acceleration speed key factor instability acl injuries altered neuromuscular function secondary diminished somatosensory athletes participate sports involving cutting jumping rapid deceleration knee must stable terminal extension screwhome acl tear one common knee injuries tears occurring annually acl tears result noncontact mechanism sudden change direction causing knee rotate inward knee rotates inward additional strain placed acl since femur tibia two bones articulate together forming knee joint move opposite directions causing acl tear athletes require reconstructive surgery acl torn ruptured acl completely removed replaced piece tendon ligament tissue patient autograft donor conservative treatment poor outcomes acl injury since acl unable form fibrous clot receives nutrients synovial fluid washes away reparative cells making formation fibrous tissue difficult two common sources tissue patellar ligament hamstrings patellar ligament often used since bone plugs end graft extracted helps integrate graft bone tunnels surgery arthroscopic meaning tiny camera inserted small surgical camera sends video large monitor surgeon see damage ligaments event autograft surgeon makes larger cut get needed tissue event allograft material donated necessary since tissue taken directly patients surgeon drills hole forming tibial bone tunnel femoral bone tunnel allowing patients new acl graft guided graft pulled bone tunnels two screws placed tibial femoral bone recovery time usually ranges one two years sometimes longer depending patient chose autograft allograft week occurrence injury athlete usually deceived fact heshe walking normally feeling much dangerous athletes start resuming activities jogging wrong move twist could damage bones graft completely become integrated bone tunnels injured athletes must understand significance step acl injury avoid complications ensure proper recovery acl reconstruction common treatment acl tear treatment available individuals may find beneficial complete nonoperative rehabilitation program individuals going continue physical activity involves cutting pivoting individuals longer participating specific activities candidates nonoperative comparing operative nonoperative approaches acl tears differences noted surgical nonsurgical groups significant differences regard knee function muscle strength reported patientscitation needed main goals achieve rehabilitation rehab acl tear regain sufficient functional stability maximize full muscle strength decrease risk reinjurycitation needed typically three phases involved nonoperative treatment acute phase neuromuscular training phase return sport phase acute phase rehab focusing acute symptoms occur right injury causing impairment use therapeutic exercises appropriate therapeutic modalities crucial phase assist repairing impairments injury neuromuscular training phase used focus patient regaining full strength lower extremity core muscles phase begins patient regains full range motion effusion adequate lower extremity strength phase patient completes advanced balance proprioception cardiovascular conditioning neuromuscular final return sport phase patient focuses sportspecific activities agility functional performance brace suggested used phase assist stability pivoting cutting anterior cruciate ligament surgery complex operation requires expertise field orthopedic sports medicine many factors considered discussing surgery including athletes level competition age previous knee injury injuries sustained leg alignment graft choice typically four graft types possible bonepatella tendonbone graft semitendinosus gracilis tendons quadrupled hamstring tendon quadriceps tendon although extensive research conducted grafts best surgeon typically chooses type graft comfortable rehabilitated correctly reconstruction last fact patients happy graft prehabilitation become integral part acl reconstruction process means patient exercises getting surgery maintain factors range motion strength based single leg hop test selfreported assessment prehab improved function effects sustained weeks postsurgical rehabilitation essential recovery reconstruction typically takes patient months return life prior rehab divided protection graft improving range motion decrease swelling regaining muscle phase different exercises based patients needs example ligament healing patients joint used full weightbearing patient strengthen quadriceps hamstrings quad sets weight shifting drills phase two would require full weightbearing correcting gait patterns exercises core strengthening balance exercises would appropriate phase three patient begins running aquatic workouts help reducing joint stresses cardiorespiratory endurance phase four includes multiplanar movements thus enhancing running program beginning agility plyometric drills lastly phase five focuses sport lifespecific motions depending los angeles times review two medical studies discussed whether acl reconstruction advisable one study found children acl reconstruction fared better early surgery underwent delayed surgery adults though patients underwent early surgery followed rehabilitation fared better rehabilitative therapy later first report focused children timing acl reconstruction acl injuries children challenge children open growth plates bottom femur thigh bone top tibia shin acl reconstruction typically crosses growth plates posing theoretical risk injury growth plate stunting leg growth causing leg grow unusual second study noted focused adults found significant statistical difference performance pain outcomes patients receive early acl reconstruction vs receive physical therapy option later surgery would suggest many patients without instability buckling giving way course rehabilitation managed nonoperatively limited outcomes two years involve patients serious patients involved sports requiring significant cutting pivoting twisting rapid acceleration deceleration may able participate activities without acl risk differences outcomes men women attributed
