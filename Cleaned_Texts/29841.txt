according josh mchugh wired magazine cheetahs seem bounce accord impossible stand still difficult move slowly get going cheetahs extremely hard pistorius applied run nondisabled track meets first accepted questions quickly arose whether blades give unfair advantage initial research showed blades provide advantage international association athletics federations iaaf changed rules ban use technical devices provide advantage ruled ineligible compete pistorius challenged ruling additional research reinstated court arbitration sport cas meaning continue run nondisabled meets long uses equipment studied pistoriuss performance early nondisabled races raised questions two major concerns pattern running races legswing times sprinters spring blocks fastest time slow race progresses pistorius ran negative split starting slowly building speed last half race though longer uses pattern average time also less race compared runners controversy use blades persists research provided considerable information work application research expected nondisabled sprinters calves ankles return amplify energy supplied hips knees pistorius compensates additional work calves ankles associated tendons muscles analysis published engineering technology magazine estimates using blades pistorius must generate twice power gluteal quadriceps muscles normal sprinter sources also credit core abdominal muscles faster arm trainer estimates power comes hips rest knees results gait waddles slightly pistorius swings upper body balance springing action blades blades compress weight release moves forward providing forward thrust tips return molded shape spring swings slightly side throws forward next pistorius always slow starting race flexible blades provide thrust blocks pistorius must begin awkward position swing leg outside pop straight blocks begin running preferred method push horizontal first meters race keeps head takes short quick strides establishes rhythm raise head increase speed runners jog losing energy pistorius directs energy forward looking somewhat like rolling wheels also compensates adjustments ankles make turns breaking curves short straight lines according coach ampie louw pistorius may able use inward lean generate force come turn going resolve questions blades pistorius asked take part series scientific tests november german sport university cologne professor biomechanics peter brüggemann iaaf technical expert elio locatelli two days tests brüggemann reported pistorius used less energy expenditure nondisabled athletes achieved given speed study also found showed major differences sprint mechanics significantly different maximum vertical ground return forces positive work returned energy close three times higher human ankle energy loss blade stance phase foot ground measured normal ankle joint measured showing difference brüggemanns analysis stated blades allowed lower energy consumption speed energy loss blade significantly less human ankle maximum december year brüggemann stated die welt newspaper pistorius considerable advantages athletes without prosthetic limbs tested us percentage points expect study published sports later researchers stated analysis take enough variables consideration commentators also argued iaaf study accurately determine whether cheetahs confer net advantage measuring net advantage disadvantage conferred athlete using cheetahs possible given current scientific second iaaf study may measured pistoriuss performance appropriate controls iaaf used five nondisabled athletes run races similar times pistorius controls however pistorius relatively new sport running may trained enough maximize physical potential reach peak performance iaaf study conducted march approximately months iaaf study conducted pistoriuss coach commented pistorius trained enough achieve upper body commensurate upper bodies elite sprinters obtain accurate understanding prostheses affect pistoriuss performance compared athletes similar physical potential consequently iaaf study may flawed compared pistorius might physical potential run faster current times athletes peak team seven researchers conducted tests rice university including peter weyand hugh herr rodger kram matthew bundle alena grabowski team collected metabolic mechanical data indirect calorimetry ground reaction force measurements pistoriuss performance constantspeed level treadmill running found energy usage lower average values elite nondisabled distance runners lower average distance runners lower nondisabled sprint runners sprinting speeds ms pistorius produced longer foot ground contact times shorter leg swing times lower average vertical forces able bodied sprinters team concluded running blades appears physiologically similar mechanically different running biological legs study published several months later journal applied kram also stated pistoriuss rate energy consumption lower average person comparable highcaliber lightness rigidity blade compared muscle bone may allow blade runners swing legs faster nondisabled runners comments article peter weyand biomechanist matthew bundle noted study found pistorius repositioned legs faster world record sprinters allowing increase sprint research team including alena grabowski rodger kram hugh herr conducted followup study single amputees running blades published biology letters six amputees affected leg performance compared biological leg team measured leg swing times force applied running surface highspeed treadmill biomechanics laboratory orthopedic specialty hospital also studied video sprint runners olympics paralympics found difference leg swing times different speeds recorded leg swing times similar nondisabled sprinters also found single running blades reduced foot ground force production tested runners average force production generally considered significant factor running speed researchers concluded reduction force limited sprinters top speed grabowski also found amputees typically increased leg swing times compensate lack discussion continues relative advantage disadvantage using blades researchers analysts also point research studies done level stationary treadmills measure performance starting blocks actual curved tracks also take account differences physiology amputees nonamputees factors musculature blade height weight differences blood circulation patterns due history limb controversy effects running blade length arose paralympic games brazilian runner alan oliveira usa runner blake leeper changed longer running blades within months paralympic games led marked improvement running times pistorius complained race blades provided artificially lengthened running strides would infringement ipc rules regardless blades within allowable height limits athletes complaint supported singleleg runners including jerome singleton jack swift called double blade single blade classes separated future events single blade runners unable adjust height prostheses must always match length biological leg running bladecitation needed improvement running time wide broadcast race results provided public demonstration blade length affects performance pistorius stride length actually longer vs oliveira took strides vs combination stride length stride rate led clearly unusual performance longer pistoriuss management issued statement saying pistorius always meters tall regardless prostheses wears decision maintain height running blades issue
