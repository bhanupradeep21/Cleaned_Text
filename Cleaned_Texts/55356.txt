estimated launch mass change kg lander projected kg lb ascender kg lb unlike change equipped radioisotope heater unit survive extreme cold lunar night lander change stopped functioning following lunar night change included four scientific payloads including landing camera panoramic camera lunar mineralogical lunar regolith penetrating change collected samples using two methods ie drilling
