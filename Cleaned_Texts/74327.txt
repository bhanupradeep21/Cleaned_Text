mandibular fenestra also present dentary bone straight ventral margin stout appearance premaxilla slender teeth denticles present premaxillary teeth also seen basal nodosaurids approximately maxillary teeth suggested due juvenile status however ontogenetic variation number teeth less among known ankylosaurs tooth crowns similar crichtonsaurus teeth shelflike cingulum bases palmate crown bears vertical flutes coincide notches marginal scapula humerus slender appearance scapula narrow scapular base scapular spine may directed towards glenoid humerus deltopectoral crest extends less half length shaft radial condyle humerus poorly developed olecranon process ulna moderately developed manus short xu et al originally recorded manual phalangeal formula however ji et al noted presence five digits fingers rather four one specimen femur indistinct femoral head crestshaped trochanter present midlength shaft tibia long femur pes foot long manus metatarsals elongate metatarsals v splintlike pedal phalangeal formula pedal manual unguals triangular dorsal view condition also seen xu et al noted sternum subtrapezoidal body slender posterolateral process straight medial however arbour currie questioned whether sternum preserved bone tentatively identified left sternum found adjacent various elements boundaries remain unclear sternum could possibly displaced postmortem resulting anteriorly pointing posterolateral process sternum dissimilar ankylosaurs paddlelike ovoid medial ends narrow posterolaterally like nodosaurids fused midline form diamond shape narrower posterolaterally directed processes like preacetabular process ilium deflects laterally enlarged crest present acetabulum connects ischial pubic peduncles ischium straight convex acetabular margin pubis strongly reduced liaoningosaurus represents oldest ankylosaurid known tail club although possessed tail club handle appear tail club knob present tail club ankylosaurids refers entire distal structure ankylosaurid tail rather large terminal osteoderms handle consists interlocking neural arches distal caudal vertebrae prezygapophyses overlap adjacent vertebra least centrum exception subtriangular plates found near cervical pectoral region completely lacks osteoderms body xu et al identified large bony plate present ventral right pelvic girdle noted covered small tubercles tubercles hexagonal rhombic shape diameter mm shelllike ventral bony plate noted present arbour et al reexamined reinterpreted ventral plate skin impressions tubercles instead representing flat polygonal scales reinterpretation based mostly broken edges revealing bony given animals unusual anatomy xu et al trouble identifying relationship ankylosaurs phylogenetic analysis loosely placed nodosauridae conceded binary division ankylosauria may entirely sound meaning liaoningosaurus could represent third paleontologist matthew vickaryous colleagues left incertae second cladistic analysis performed richard thompson colleagues suggested liaoningosaurus basal become consensus among phylogenetic analyses arbour currie han et al although reduced strict consensus performed frauenfelder et al recovered within polytomy along

anodontosaurus euoplocephalus scolosaurus ziapelta based second specimen described ji colleagues proposed liaoningosaurus might adapted semiaquatic lifestyle due presence shelllike ventral bony plate would covered entire ventral surface torso authors suggested structure would functioned protect body underwater however study arbour et al examined shelllike structure reinterpreted skin impressions bony internal contrast zheng suggested structure may formed ventral pelvic shield epidermal scale furthermore ji colleagues argued lack fusion spine hip bones adaptation semiaquatic lifestyle rather juvenile feature presence open neural archcentral sutures vertebrae used indicate juvenile nature type specimen feature also documented young adult addition semiaquatic lifestyle authors suggested liaoningosaurus carnivorous based elongated forklike denticles crowns cheek teeth sharp unguals hands feet presence fish within skeleton second specimen proposed three explanations association may occurred first explanation fish lying bottom lake river passively went ribcage due underwater turbulence second explanation suggests fish died whilst within ribcage scavenging third explanation fish represent gut contents authors considered third explanation reasonable arguing obscure body outline incompleteness fish caused digestive acids fish skeletons scattered sides body cavity instead tightly packed stomach region may caused expulsion gases compression stomach region postmortem addition fish tail lizard preserved posterolateral side paleontologist andrea cau expressed skepticism idea considering radical view actual evidence could explained parsimonious interpretations reduced ossification skeleton small size typical traits juveniles abundance juvenile individuals compared adults coherent known mesozoic dinosaurs population dynamics high conservation deposits also aquatic depositional setting specimen found doesnt necessarily mean animal aquatic many dinosaurs found contexts chaotic distribution fish inside thoracic cavity presence one outside coherent fish scavenging animals carcass would also expected given abundance specimens showed evidence supposedly piscivorous diet arbour currie considered type specimen represent juvenile individual basis unfused neural arches small size absence postcervical addition han et al also considered unfused scapula coracoid low wedgeshaped olecranon process ulna unfused calcaneum astragalus holotype juvenile however ji et al argued holotype specimens instead represented adults due lack fusion ribs vertebrae absence synsacrum small stature known microanatomical study chinese palaeontologist wenjie zheng instead concluded holotype older months suggested liaoningosaurus could juvenile form much larger
