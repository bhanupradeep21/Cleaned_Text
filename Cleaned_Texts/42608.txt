semen analysis plural semen analyses also called seminogram spermiogram evaluates certain characteristics males semen sperm contained done help evaluate male fertility whether seeking pregnancy verifying success vasectomy depending measurement method characteristics may evaluated home kit many characteristics may evaluated generally diagnostic laboratory collection techniques precise measurement method may influence results semen analysis complex test performed andrology laboratories experienced technicians quality control validation test systems routine semen analysis include physical characteristics semen color odor ph viscosity liquefaction volume concentration morphology sperm motility progression provide correct result necessary perform least two preferably three separate seminal analyses interval seven days three months techniques criteria used analyze semen samples based manual examination human semen spermcervical mucus interaction published common reasons laboratory semen analysis humans part couples infertility investigation vasectomy verify procedure also commonly used testing human donors sperm donation animals semen analysis commonly used stud farming farm animal breeding occasionally man semen analysis done part routine prepregnancy testing laboratory level rare healthcare providers test semen sperm unless specifically requested strong suspicion pathology one areas discovered medical history physical examination testing expensive timeconsuming us unlikely covered insurance countries germany testing covered insurances characteristics measured semen analysis factors semen quality one source states men normal semen analysis actually abnormal sperm conversely men poor semen analysis results may go father nice guidelines mild male factor infertility defined two semen analyses one variables percentile confers chance pregnancy occurring naturally vaginal intercourse within two years similar people mild methods semen collection include masturbation condom collection epididymal extraction sample never obtained coitus interruptus portion ejaculate could lost bacterial contamination could occur acidic vaginal ph could detrimental sperm motility optimal sexual abstinence semen sampling two seven days common way obtain semen sample masturbation best place obtain clinic analysis take place order avoid temperature changes transport lethal spermatozoa sample obtained must put directly sterile plastic receptacle never conventional condom since chemical substances lubricants spermicides could damage sample handed clinic studied within hour situations necessitate alternative collection methods retrograde ejaculation neurological injury psychological inhibition depending situation specialized condoms electrostimulation vibrostimulation might used parameters included semen analysis divided macroscopic liquefaction appearance viscosity volume ph microscopic motility morphology vitality concentration sperm count sperm aggregation sperm agglutination presence round cells leukocytes main three parameters spermiogram concentration spermatozoa semen motility morphology analysis important analyse fertility even perfectly fertile man difficult find normal spermatozoa average fertile man spermatozoa normal every parameter abnormal least one sperm count sperm concentration avoid confusion total sperm count measures concentration sperm ejaculate distinguished total sperm count sperm count multiplied volume million sperm per milliliter considered normal according older definitions state lower sperm count considered oligozoospermia vasectomy considered successful sample azoospermic zero sperm kind found sample contains less spermatozoa per milliliter talk criptozoospermia define success rareoccasional nonmotile sperm observed fewer per others advocate obtaining second semen analysis verify counts increasing happen recanalization others still may perform repeat vasectomy situation chips home use emerging give accurate estimation sperm count three samples taken different days chip may measure concentration sperm semen sample control liquid filled polystyrene medical source world health organization value must measured within minutes collection also parameter vitality lower reference limit live man total number sperm far limit million sperm cells per milliliter still bad quality motile however sperm count high low motility example less might matter fraction might still million per millilitre way around man sperm count far less million sperm cells per millilitre still good motility observed sperm cells show good forward movement beneficial nature favours quality quantity specified measure motility grade total motilityprnp progressively motile sperm moving forward direction progressively motile non progressively motilethose sperms moving circular motion non progressively motile immotile sperms fail move dead sperms total motility reference divided progressive motility motility situ semen samples progressive motility considered normozoospermia samples value classified asthenozoospermia regarding criteria regarding sperm morphology criteria described state sample normal samples men whose partners pregnancy last months centile observed sperm normal sample less morphologically normal spermatozoa classified teratozoospermia normal sperm morphology hard classify lack objectivity variations interpretation instance order classify spermatozoa normal abnormal different parts considered sperm head midpiece tail firstly head ovalshaped smooth regular

presence sperm vacuoles associated sperm chromatin immaturity particularly case large according one lab test manual semen volumes ml ml regards ml lower reference low volume called hypospermia may indicate partial complete blockage seminal vesicles man born without seminal clinical practice volume less ml setting infertility likely due incomplete ejaculation partial loss sample asides patient evaluated hypoandrogenism obstructions parts ejaculatory tract azoospermia given least hours since last ejaculation time sample collection human ejaculate mostly composed water semen water one way ensuring man produces drink liquids men also produce seminal fluid lengthy sexual stimulation arousal reducing frequency sex masturbation helps increase semen volume sexually transmitted diseases also affect production semen men human immunodeficiency virus hiv produce lower semen volume volume semen may also increased condition known hyperspermia volume greater may indicate prostate inflammation theres volumen condition named aspermia could caused retrograde ejaculation anatomical neurological diseases antihypertensive drugs semen normally whitishgray colour tends get yellowish tint man ages semen colour also influenced food eat foods high sulfur garlic may result man producing yellow presence blood semen hematospermia leads brownish red coloured ejaculate hematospermia rare condition semen deep yellow colour greenish appearance may due medication brown semen mainly result infection inflammation prostate gland urethra epididymis seminal vesiclescitation needed causes unusual semen colour include sexually transmitted infections gonorrhea chlamydia genital surgery injury male sex organs fructose level semen may analysed determine amount energy available semen specifies normal level μmol per sample absence fructose may indicate problem seminal vesicles semen fructose test checks presence fructose seminal fluid fructose normally present semen secreted seminal vesicles absence fructose indicates ejaculatory duct obstruction pathology according one lab test manual normal ph range criteria specify normal acidic ejaculate lower ph value may indicate one seminal vesicles blocked basic ejaculate higher ph value may indicate ph value outside normal range harmful sperm affect ability penetrate final ph results balance ph values accessory glands secretions alkaline seminal vesicular secretion acidic prostatic liquefaction process gel formed proteins seminal vesicles prostate broken semen becomes liquid normally takes minutes hour sample change thick gel
