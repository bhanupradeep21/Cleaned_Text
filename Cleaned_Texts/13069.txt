lymphangion functional unit lymph vessel lies two semilunar half moonshaped lymph vessels channels larger lymph capillaries thicker walls valves lumen smooth muscles walls thus lymph vessel lymphangion muscular capable contracting additionally lymph propelled forward force exerted walls exterior forces include skeletal muscle contractions arterial pulsations also inspiration respiration provides suction pressure within lumen semilunar valves directed towards flow lymph open pressure first lymphangion greater pressure next lymphangion pressure first lymphangion may increase smooth muscle contraction lymph vessel pressure walls outside capillary result alternatively pressure within next lymphangion may decrease negative pressure result inspiration lymph flows next lymphangion return previous lymphangion semilunar valves close tightly conditions pressure lymphatic sufficiently great valves may fail indeed backward flow lymph resulting edema drained region may happen blockage lymph flow pathology draining lymph node point vessel httpsenwikipediaorgwikilymphangion
