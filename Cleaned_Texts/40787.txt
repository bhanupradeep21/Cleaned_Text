syndrome hss rare autoimmune disorder often described inflammation relation blood vessels form vasculitis associated known cause typically characterized multiple aneurysms pulmonary arteries deep vein thromboses named two british physicians john patterson hughes peter george ingle stovin first described hss presumed rare variant behçets disease entails general problems circulatory system due clinical similarity behçets disease also referred incomplete behçets disease patients young adult males age common clinical presentations include fever cough dyspnea hemoptysis radiological features similar behçets signs symptoms disease mostly associated diagnostic feature disease presence pulmonary artery aneurysms deep vein thromboses symptoms disease typically secondary two conditions common reported clinical symptoms present patients listed pathogenesis syndrome still clear complete enough studies therefore enough published literature presumed possible causes syndrome include presence infections andor possibly angiodysplasia characterized vascular malformation possibility disease consequence infections ruled use antibiotics aid patients angiodysplasia could underlying cause hughesstovin account vascular changes hughesstovin syndrome clinically considered autoimmune disorder primary mechanism precedes presumed manner autoimmune disorders syndrome occurs body begins attacking cells syndrome yields inflammation blood vessels body due bodys overreactive immune system targeting affected cells causes coagulation forming blood clots begins development pulmonary aneurysms thrombosis etiology pathophysiology disease remains unclear however recent years hughesstovin syndrome found potentially caused systemic venous angiitis collagen disease systemic venous angiitis vasculitis inflammatory disease blood vessels walls secondary autoimmune diseases essentially helper cell driven reaction recruited dendritic cells vascular impact affect blood circulation veins thus give rise syndrome hughesstovin occur type artery vein cause underlying main symptoms prevalent disease presumed behçets disease caused similar form vasculitis heavy vascular involvement rigid set diagnostic criteria hughesstovin hughesstovin discerned similar conditions resemblance vasculitis without presenting infection syndrome also identified associated pulmonarybronchial artery aneurysms thrombophlebitis without known diagnostic symptoms features behçets disease however physicians often diagnosed hughesstovin syndrome using one techniques physicians able differentiate hss behçets disease hss often clinically considered rare variant disease way absence common symptoms behçets disease mouth genital ulcers therefore presence multiple pulmonary artery aneurysms paa deep vein thrombosis physicians differentiate hss behçets disease ultimately rule behçets disease basis absence skinrelated findings currently satisfactory treatment immunosuppressive therapy common treatment involving mix glucocorticoids cyclophosphamide effective early stages may cause remission aneurysms ineffective disease progressed administration corticosteroids type steroid hormones combination cytotoxic agents aid stabilization pulmonary artery furthermore presence thrombosis typically would require anticoagulants however typically prescribed due possible lifethreatening rupture pulmonary artery aneurysms therefore anticoagulants given done extensive care special cases depending state pulmonary artery aneurysms surgery might also option aneurysm localized would improve state patient hughesstovin syndrome compromises vein dysfunctions formation thrombosis pulmonary aneurysms disease noted proceed three main clinical stages first stage observed regarded thrombophlebitis symptoms thrombophlebitis typically occurs presence inflammation injury related veins blood clot forms also proceed occurrence frequent coagulation caused body second clinical stage formation pulmonary artery aneurysms mechanism formation pulmonary aneurysms typically result inflammation cases third stage associated aneurysm ruptures massive blood loss possibly resulting fatal consequences syndrome often detected late precedence relatively late course disease therefore associated significantly high rate mortality often associated high risk blood loss result rupture pulmonary artery aneurysms bronchial artery hypertrophy secondary ischemia related pulmonary artery terminal events associated disease typically due massive hemorrhage near lungs rupture aneurysms existing evidence suggests success managing disease immunosuppressive therapy additionally lung transplant might also decrease threat disease presents hss largely rare disorder less published english literature case studies therefore population based incidence yet specified however disorder reported prevalent among men aged young adult bracket much less reported female incidence reported cases show preponderance specific geographic location cases vary precedent countries reported cases show diverse geographical locations occurrence exemplify north america africa europe asia therefore geographic location preponderance case studies published world also reported significance genetic background familial predisposition less published english literature condition therefore available research often limited providing thorough information syndrome therefore aspects illness adequately researched due lack case reports authors established focus research group establish necessary information hughesstovin syndrome research group called hss international study group hssisg research group hopes gather available information syndrome better assess pathogenesis disease course action way progresses would allow facilitation early diagnosis enhance efficiency syndrome assessed potentially reducing risk mortality recent research emphasizes need early diagnosis multiple research presents patients severe cases due neglecting treatment overall available research limited providing knowledge mechanism course disease however multiple cited research articles present disease incomplete form behçets disease current research presume disease proceeds manner similar behçets disease similar symptoms except skin findings furthermore current research heavily consists case studies allows us depict similarities patients suffering hughesstovin syndrome presented research also stresses importance early diagnosis treatment improve prognosis disease prevent fatal consequences clear need research investigate genetic etiological pathological basis disease
