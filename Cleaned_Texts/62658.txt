rarely found fossils several reasons mainly preservation bias smaller bones younger animals less likely preserved fossilization larger bones adults collection bias smaller fossils less likely noticed collectors young albertosaurus relatively large juvenile animals remains still rare fossil record compared adults suggested phenomenon consequence life history rather bias fossils juvenile albertosaurus rare simply die often adults hypothesis albertosaurus life history postulates hatchlings died large numbers preserved fossil record due small size fragile construction two years juveniles larger predator region aside adult albertosaurus fleet foot prey animals resulted dramatic decrease mortality rate corresponding rarity fossil remains mortality rates doubled age twelve perhaps result physiological demands rapid growth phase doubled onset sexual maturity ages fourteen sixteen elevated mortality rate continued throughout adulthood perhaps due high physiological demands procreation including stress injuries received intraspecific competition mates resources eventually everincreasing effects senescence higher mortality rate adults may explain common preservation large animals rare individuals survived long enough attain sizes high infant mortality rates followed reduced mortality among juveniles sudden increase mortality sexual maturity animals reaching maximum size pattern observed many modern large mammals including elephants african buffalo rhinoceros pattern also seen tyrannosaurids comparison modern animals tyrannosaurids lends support
