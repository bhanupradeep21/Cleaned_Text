equine anatomy encompasses gross microscopic anatomy horses ponies equids including donkeys mules zebras anatomical features equids described terms animals international committee veterinary gross anatomical nomenclature book nomina anatomica veterinaria many horsespecific colloquial terms used equestrians horses equids evolved grazing animals adapted eating small amounts kind food day long wild horse adapted eating prairie grasses semiarid regions traveling significant distances day order obtain adequate therefore digestive system horse ft long intestines digestion begins mouth also called oral cavity made teeth hard palate soft palate tongue related muscles cheeks lips horses also three pairs salivary glands parotoid largest salivary gland located near poll mandibular located jaw sublingual located tongue horses select pieces forage pick finer foods grain sensitive prehensile lips front teeth horse called incisors clip forage food pushed back mouth tongue ground swallowing premolars esophagus ft length carries food stomach muscular ring called cardiac sphincter connects stomach esophagus sphincter well developed horses oblique angle esophagus connects stomach explains horses esophagus also area digestive tract horses may suffer choke horses relatively small stomach size limits amount feed horse take one time average sized horse kg lb stomach capacity around l us gal works best contains l us gal stomach empties full whether stomach enzymes completed processing food prevents full digestion proper utilization feed continuous foraging several small feedings per day preferable one two large horse stomach consists nonglandular proximal region saccus cecus divided distinct border margo plicatus glandular distal stomach assorted acids enzyme pepsin break food pepsin allows breakdown proteins amino acid enzymes include resin lipase additionally stomach absorbs water well ions lipidsoluble compounds horses small intestine ft long holds l us gal major digestive organ nutrients three parts duodenum jejunum ileum majority digestion occurs duodenum majority absorption occurs jejunum bile liver aids digesting fats duodenum combined enzymes pancreas small intestine horses common mammals camels gall bladder meaning bile flows food digested absorbed bloodstream small intestine including proteins simple carbohydrate fats vitamins e remaining liquids roughage move large intestine cecum first section large intestine also known water gut hind gut culdesac ft long holds l us gal contains bacteria digest cellulose plant fiber bacteria feed upon chyme digestive also produce certain fatsoluble vitamins absorbed reason horses must diets changed slowly bacteria cecum able modify adapt different chemical structure new abrupt change diet cause colic broad term used describe abdominal pain horses much like stomachache humans unlike occasional tummy upsets colic horses myriad causes severities ranging mild gas buildup serious intestinal new food properly digested large colon small colon rectum make remainder large intestine large colon ft long holds l us gal semiliquid matter made right ventral lower colon left ventral colon left dorsal upper colon right dorsal colon transverse colon three flexures also named sternal flexure right left ventral colon pelvic flexure left ventral left dorsal colon diaphragmatic flexure left dorsal right dorsal colon main purpose large colon absorb carbohydrates broken cellulose cecum due many twists turns common place type horse colic called small colon ft length holds l us gal material area majority water horses diet absorbed place fecal lumps formed rectum cm ft long acts holding chamber waste matter expelled body via mares reproductive system responsible controlling gestation birth lactation well estrous cycle mating behavior lies ventral lumbar vertebrae although position within mare vary depending movement intestines distention bladder mare two ovaries usually cm length cm thick generally tend decrease size mare ages equine ovaries unlike humans vascular tissue cortical follicular tissue ovulation occur ovulation fossa near infundibulum ovaries connect fallopian tubes oviducts serve move ovum ovary uterus oviducts lined layer cilia produce current flows toward uterus oviduct attaches one two horns uterus approximately cm length horns attach body uterus cm long equine uterus bipartite meaning two uterine horns fuse relatively large uterine body resembling shortened bicornuate uterus stretched simplex uterus caudal uterus cervix cm long separates uterus vagina usually cm diameter longitudinal folds interior surface expand allow passage foal vagina mare cm long quite elastic allowing expandcitation needed vulva external opening vagina consists clitoris two labia lies ventral mare two mammary glands smaller maiden mares two ducts open externallycitation needed stallions reproductive system responsible sexual behavior secondary sex

sex glands vesicular glands prostate gland bulbourethral glands contribute fluid semen ejaculation strictly necessary horses teeth include incisors premolars molars sometimes canine teeth horses incisors premolars molars fully developed continue erupt throughout lifetime grinding surface worn chewing pattern wear rough estimate horses age made examination teeth abnormal wear teeth caused conformational defects abnormal behaviors improper diets cause serious health issues even result death horse hoof horse encases second third phalanx lower limbs analogous fingertip toe tip human essence horse travels tiptoes hoof wall much larger thicker stronger version human fingernail toenail made similar materials primarily keratin strong protein molecule horses hoof contains high proportion sulfurcontaining amino acids contribute resilience toughness vascular foldlike structures called laminae suspend distal phalanx hoof wall skeleton horse three major functions body protects vital organs provides framework supports soft parts body horses bones divided appendicular skeleton legs axial skeleton skull vertebral column sternum ribs pelvic thoracic limbs contain number bones bones per limb bones connected muscles via tendons bones via ligaments bones also used store minerals site red blood cell formation bones horse domestic species third metacarpal metatarsal much developed second fourth undeveloped first fifth metacarpal ligaments attach bone bone bone tendon vital stabilizing joints well supporting structures made fibrous material generally quite strong due relatively poor blood supply ligament injuries generally take long time heal tendons cords connective tissue attaching muscle bone cartilage tendons major contributor shock absorption necessary support horses body translate force generated muscles movement tendons classified flexors flex joint extensors extend joint however tendons flex multiple joints extending another flexor tendons hind limb example flex fetlock pastern coffin joint extend hock joint case tendons associated muscles named distal action digital flexion tendons form embryo fibroblasts become tightly packed tendon grows tendons develop lay collagen main structural protein connective tissue tendons pass near bony prominences protected fluid filled synovial structure either tendon sheath sac called bursa tendons easily damaged placed much strain result painful possibly careerending injury tendinitis commonly seen high performance horses gallop jump tendon damaged healing process slow tendons poor blood supply reducing availability nutrients oxygen tendon tendon damaged tendon always weaker collagen fibres tend line random arrangements instead stronger linear pattern scar tissue within tendon decreases overall elasticity damaged section tendon well causing increase strain adjacent uninjured tissue muscle contracts pulls tendon acts horses bones move muscles commonly arranged pairs oppose antagonists
