abnormal behavior birds captivity found occur among domesticated wild abnormal behavior defined several ways statistically abnormal occurrence frequency intensity behaviour varies statistically significantly either less normal means theoretically almost behaviour could become abnormal individual less formally abnormal includes activity judged outside normal behaviour pattern captive birds particular class example running rather flying may normal behaviour regularly observed one species however another species might normal becomes abnormal reaches high frequency another species rarely observed incidence considered abnormal article include oneoff behaviours performed individual birds might considered abnormal individual unless performed repeatedly individuals species recognised part ethogram species abnormal behaviours categorised collectively eg eliminative ingestive stereotypies however many abnormal behaviours fall debatably several categories categorisation therefore attempted article abnormal behaviours considered related captive housing may also due medical conditions article include behaviours birds genetically modified express abnormal behaviour housed captive commercial conditions birds often show range abnormal behaviours often selfinjurious harmful individuals include feather toe pecking cannibalism stereotypy vent pecking well abnormal sexual behaviours chronic egg laying feather pecking abnormal behaviour observed birds captivity primarily laying whereby one bird repeatedly pecks feathers another toe pecking similar occurrence commercialized hens includes repeatedly pecking toes another behaviours tied physiological stress ie extremely enlarged adrenal glands likely caused housing conditions cannibalism birds captivity behaviour often linked feather pecking increasing frequency intensity feather pecking risk prevalence cannibalism since feather pecking leads increased food consumption due heat loss skin bird feather pecking already aggressive behaviour consists cannibalistic qualities cannibalism common consequential effect cannibalism defined act consuming part another individual species stereotypies invariant repetitive behaviour patterns blatant function objective seem restricted captive andor mentallyimpaired stereotypies result inability animal perform normal behaviour due external environmental conditions circumstance common stereotypy laying hens pacing involves animal constantly walking back forth seemingly ritualistic manner due access suitable nest pacing stereotypy also hypothesized arise intentional movements escape specifically captive animals birds overabundance well lack stimulation associated suboptimal environment captivity common factors amongst development stereotypy behaviours vent pecking abnormal behaviour observed birds captivity involves pecking causing damage cloaca surrounding skin underlying tissue another bird occurrence vent pecking primarily immediately bird oviposited cloaca red vent pecking like feather pecking gateway behaviour cannibalism due cannibalistic features hostility towards another individual involves aggressive tearing damaging skin tissue vent cannibalism found common type cannibalism causing death autopsy results laying analyzing behaviour birds captivity considered normal abnormal behaviour dependent form frequency particular behaviour expressed natural birds raised pet stores tend raised birds however sold taken owners home birds captivity often housed isolation environments lacking abundant resources complex stimuli united states estimated forty million birds kept caged improperly cared inappropriate housing conditions abnormal behaviour patterns may appear caged birds kept pets established abnormal behaviours birds often social interactions amongst birds absent inadequate abnormal social behaviour may develop example study regarding parrots isolated cages demonstrated birds showing social deprivation significant behavioural disturbances aggressive behaviour feather picking selfmutilation restlessness screaming apathetic behavior several parrots living captivity monitored study displayed behaviors consisting screaming excessively biting specific noise made birds encouraged captivity biting however typical defense mechanism used wild cannibalism often occurs large animal husbandry systems usually impoverished environments lack addition studies caged canaries revealed two common include spot picking birds repeatedly touch particular spot environment tip beak route tracing pacing behaviour associated physical restrictions movement imposed cage absence song learning zebra finches also implicated behavioural birds social interaction young male song tutor important normal song development without stimulus song necessary mating behavior learned researchers analyzed ways alleviate abnormal behaviours caged birds presenting birds novel stimuli eg mirror plastic birds social stimuli brief view bird another cage significantly reduced addition suggested keeping caged birds pairs small groups may reduce development abnormal behaviours however little quantitative evidence thus far collected support statistically endangered birds tend egg infertility number increases breeders endangered species working captive addition abnormal behaviours exhibited result commercialized captivity poultry also exist problematic behaviours occur function social deprivation associated domestication social deprivation prevention reduction normal interaction individual others currently dominant method rearing domesticated birds handrearing requires chicks separated parents periods time several social deprivation associated technique upbringing one detrimental forms social deprivation since even shortterm disruptions parental care cause extreme abnormal behaviour affected example normal sexual habitat imprinting altered male female birds result maternal separation well individual ability adapt stressors within neophobia avoidance novel objects environment diminished social deprivation maternal lack neophobia decrease probability survival due affected animals lack hesitation approach potentially dangerous stimuli moreover many juveniles require song tutor accomplish song learning necessary successful mating therefore socially deprived juveniles may exhibit abnormal vocal consequent mating behaviours may detrimental survival important note established abnormal behaviours often presently little research regarding solution abnormality caused captivity birds however suggested keeping domesticated caged birds small groups pairs may reduce likelihood developing abnormal httpsenwikipediaorgwikiabnormalbehaviourofbirdsincaptivity
