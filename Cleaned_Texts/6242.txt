wynder graham study conducted ernest wynder evarts graham entitled tobacco smoking possible etiologic factor bronchiogenic carcinoma study six hundred eightyfour proved cases published may casecontrol study determine relationship various external factors development bronchogenic carcinoma study concluded longterm tobacco usage contributes onset lung cancer overwhelming majority men disease classified moderate heavy smokers extended period time compared lower percentage general hospital population control group studies conducted smoking lung cancer scientifically related connected higher rate smoking lung cancer incidence eventually mortality years percivall pott discovery high incidence scrotal cancer chimney sweeps demonstrated charred organic substances carcinogenic wynder used pott research foundation argument hypothesis smoking leads development lung cancer biologically isaac adler connected rise primary lung cancer consumption cigarettes different smoking habits men women men experienced higher incidence lung cancer also smoked much early researchers include joseph bloodgood demonstrated link tongue cancer tobacco founder american cancer society frederick hoffman proved excessive smoking caused cancer development mouth lungs morton lenvin analyzed hospital data show positive correlation tobacco lung cancer despite growing evidence linking tobacco usage lung cancer scientific consensus lung cancer caused industrial automotive richard doll prominent scientist conducted british doctors study austin bradford hill theorized smoking considered obvious factor everyone participated yet everyone developed lung cancer scientists believed many factors responsible development lung cancer automobile exhaust coal fumes infectious diseases race better diagnostic moreover deemed unlikely single preventable factor smoking could alone cause complicated outcome like fifty years leading wynder graham study lung cancer observed risen dramatically disproportionately comparison cancers year studys publication deaths lung cancer quadrupled leading cancer found follows upward trend smoking peaked years prior due social pervasiveness global association glamour camaraderie heavy influence tobacco ernst wynder medical student came idea link smoking cancer witnessed blackened lungs man lung cancer later learned heavy smoker wynder sought assistance evarts graham thoracic surgeon head surgery department although graham believe increased risk lung cancer smoking smoked excessively enabled wynder conduct casecontrol study providing subjects lung cancer wynder began distributing questionnaires bellevue hospital asking individual habits smoking data patients proved smoking lung cancer findings presented american cancer society national meeting lack audience response reflected dismissal smoking causal factor lung wynder graham study first largescale study investigate link smoking cancer differed previous studies size test group clear statisticallysignificant objective research design clinical study assess multiple external factors onset bronchogenic carcinoma activities predisposed determinants increase risk lung cancer study retrospective casecontrol study compared smoking habits individuals bronchogenic carcinoma without survey included questions smoking starting age year tobacco consumption brands used well inquires exposure hazardous agents workplace alcohol use causes death family members researchers obtained information special interviews patients hospitals across nation since hospital records provided insufficient information scope study trained staff interviewed patients remaining subjects either mailed survey close contact answer addition current smoking habits surveys asked patients smoking habits last years due hypothesis delayed emergence cancer smokers list questions etiologic note questions reproduced table etiologic survey wynder grahams study subjects classified two categories cases bronchogenic carcinoma controls without condition microscopic confirmations disease general hospital population group consisted men women without cancer furthermore control studies added minimize bias interviewers compare incidence lung cancer exposure factors among different groups control study included men lung cancer chest diseases interviewers affiliated hospitals know patients diagnoses control study ii involved individuals lung cancer involved similar survey administered doctors oversight researchers finally researchers equated age distributions lung cancer noncancer groups total percentage patients cancer particular age group used benchmark adjust percentages organize data smokers classified nonsmokers light moderately heavy heavy excessive chain individuals study evaluated based average daily consumption cigarettes age history disease occupation latter two avoid confounding variables researchers wondered connection increased consumption cigarettes longer period time higher prevalence lung cancer individuals excluding note table reproduced table classification smoking habits wynder grahams study wynder graham study significant due segmentation risk groups quantity smoked period tobacco usage also study sought reduce confounding variables selection key finding study men study men lung cancer likely longterm smokers without disease thus researchers concluded smoking responsible onset bronchogenic carcinoma establish causal relationship smoking cigarettes developing lung cancer also evident doseresponse relationship average daily cigarette consumption increased number people lung cancer opposed ones without disease additionally cigarette usage shown contribute development forms cancer heart also control studies conducted third party physicians exhibit corresponding results data gathered researchers concerning age distributions lung cancer younger years age meanwhile older general hospital population nonsmokers nonsmokers within lung cancer group likewise general hospital group classify heavy chain smokers whereas lung cancer group smoke amount also focusing excessive smokers subset difference excessive smokers lung cancer group general hospital researchers assessed different methods smoking cigarette pipe cigar found almost smokers consumed cigarettes smoked pipes smoked cigars polling inhalation discovered cigarette smoke inhaled often cigars pipes also women smoke lot less men enough data link smoking lung cancer cases therefore wynder conducted separate study women note graph reproduced figure percentages amount smoking among male patients cancer lungs men general hospital population without cancer age economic distribution wynder grahams study note table reproduced table age distribution cases cancer lung men wynder grahams study study concluded men bronchogenic carcinoma heavy chain smokers compared general population statistically rare find cases epidermoid undifferentiated carcinoma males heavy smokers moreover people lung cancer smoked years leads researchers hypothesize lag time starting smoking exhibiting first signs cancer since overwhelming majority smokers smoked cigarettes cigarette users inhale thought factor developing lung cancer higher importantly study proved dosedependent relationship subjects developed lung cancer smoked excessively prolonged period time individuals develop wynder graham study able conclude smoking important factor production bronchogenic carcinoma smoking wasnt established causal factor four years later wynder published another paper entitled tobacco cause lung year wynder graham published findings doll hill conducted casecontrol study reaffirmed smoking raises chance developing lung cancer several major studies published three quarters year apart reached conclusion smoking related lung public outrage immediately following papers underwhelming fact scientific medical sectors cast doubt findings characterizing study results doll theorized state denial due ubiquity smoking consequently public dismissed dangers cigarettes since everyone smoked developed lung additionally tobacco industry obscured distorted scientific conclusions dissuade public recognition harmful results smoking denied causal link cigarettes lung tobacco industry appealed peoples desire freedom opposition paternalism conveyed message decision smoke left individual america government authority dictate persons lifestyle choices surgeon general luther terry assembled task force review evidence two years later released smoking health report advisory committee surgeon general united states stated smoking definitive causal factor lung cancer men probable cause result statistics indicate public took notice health advisory since smoking decreased several months following congressional action followed next several years federal cigarette labeling advertising act public health cigarette smoking act legislation resulted health warnings cigarette boxes prevention broadcast cigarette additionally federal cigarette tax doubled last cigarette tax increase occurred years earlier support korean
