even much although many harpacochampsas gavialoid features already recognized initial description first thought result convergent evolution instead originally classified member crocodylidae however given sparse material uncertain internal relationships within eusuchia including position tomistoma authors hesitant specify exact placement certainty two possible hypotheses suggested one placing harpacochampsa closer crocodylines osteolaemines put forth possible relationship monophyletic grouping cenozoic australian crocodiles named mekosuchinae two years however taxons inclusion within
