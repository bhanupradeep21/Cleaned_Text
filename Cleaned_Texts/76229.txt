antibiotic expression using bacteria commonly develop resistance different antibiotics phenomenon called multidrug resistance actual process resistance mechanism complex case reduced permeability bacteria mechanisms different grampositive gramnegative bacteria grampositive bacteria blockage penicillin due changes cell wall example resistance vancomycin aureus due additional peptidoglycan synthesis makes cell wall much thicker preventing effective penicillin resistance gramnegative bacteria due mutational variations structure number bacteria like pseudomonas aeruginosa reduced number porins whereas bacteria like enterobacter species escherichia coli klebsiella pneumoniae modified porins nonspecific porins ompc ompf groups transport resistance due pbp alterations highly varied common case found streptococcus pneumoniae mutation gene pbp mutant pbps decreased binding affinity six mutant pbps pneumoniae sometimes responsible reduced binding aureus activate hidden gene produces different pbp low binding affinity different strain aureus named methicillinresistant aureus mrsa resistant penicillin βlactams also antibiotics bacterial strain developed introduction methicillin mrsa mutations genes mec system pbp produce variant protein called also termed making four normal pbps poor binding affinity penicillin also lacks glycosyltransferase activity required
