phosmet phthalimidederived nonsystemic organophosphate insecticide used plants animals mainly used apple trees control codling moth though also used wide range fruit crops ornamentals vines control aphids suckersclarification needed mites fruit first registered use phosmet united states used variety crops including fruit trees apple pear peach nut trees almonds walnuts treatment various pests codling moth leafrollers others also registered use cattle swine dogs treatment lice fleas ticks also used domestically trees bushes shrubs homeowners phosmet used phosmet organophosphate consisting phthalimide dithiophosphate ester two methyl groups structure benzene ring connected imide connected dithiophosphate phosmet produced reaction nchloromethylphthalimide dimethyldithiophosphoric acid
