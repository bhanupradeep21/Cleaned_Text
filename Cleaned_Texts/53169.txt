cardiac physiology isometric contraction event occurring early systole ventricles contract corresponding volume change isometrically shortlasting portion cardiac cycle takes place heart valves closed inverse operation isovolumetric relaxation diastole valves optimally closed healthy young adult blood enters atria flows ventricles via opened atrioventricular valves tricuspid mitral valves atrial contraction rapidly follows actively pumping returning blood diastole ends ventricles begin depolarizing ventricular pressure starts rise owing contraction atrioventricular valves close order prevent backflow atria stage corresponds r peak qrs complex seen ecg semilunar valves aortic pulmonary valves also closed net result contraction causes ventricular pressures rise sharply overall change volume closed valves isovolumetric contraction phase lasts short period time enough build sufficiently high pressure eventually overcomes aorta pulmonary artery upon opening semilunar valves process therefore helps maintain correct unidirectional flow blood heart circulatory word contains prefix iso derived ancient greek ἴσος ísos meaning equal therefore isovolumetric contraction one volume fluid remains constantcitation needed httpsenwikipediaorgwikiisovolumetriccontraction
