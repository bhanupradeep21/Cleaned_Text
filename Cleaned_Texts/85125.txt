catamenial pneumothorax spontaneous pneumothorax recurs menstruation within hours onset usually involves right side chest right lung associated thoracic third half patients pelvic endometriosis well despite association cp still considered misunderstood endometriosis considered underdiagnosed lack clear cause means diagnosis treatment difficult disease believed largely undiagnosed misdiagnosed leaving true frequency unknown general population catamenial pneumothorax defined least two episodes recurrent pneumothorax corresponding menstruation first described woman presented episodes rightsided pneumothorax year recurring monthly menstruation thoracotomy revealed thoracic many patients present chest pain close menstrual periods surgical exploration used attempt visualize problem mechanical pleurodesis hormonal suppressive therapy also sometimes second surgical look show fenestrations diaphragm due fact endometriosis attributed retrograde menstruation upwards women may immune prevents clearance endometrial cells peritoneum endometriosis defined tissue similar endometrial tissue implanted outside uterus mechanisms include retrograde menstruation resulting abdominopelvic spread bloodborne lymphatic spread deposition thoracic endometriosis common nonabdominal site involvement also primary risk factor catamenial catamenial pneumothorax primary clinical presentation thoracic endometriosis defined recurrent episodes lung collapse within hours menstruation symptoms include chest shoulder pain cough dyspnea shortness chest shoulder pain radiating shoulder blades dry cough also present come crackling sound upon typically occurs women aged years diagnosed young girls early years age post menopausal women exclusively women menstrual age history pelvic chest pain requires immediate medical attention although exact cause known theories come metastatic hormonal anatomical possibilities metastatic model proposes endometrial tissue migrated endometrium diaphragm pleural space causing small holes diaphragm allowing air pleural space hormonal model believed prostaglandin causes narrowing bronchioles small tubes within lungs narrowing cause alveoli rupture may trap air pleural space anatomical model researchers believe absence cervical mucous plug normally menstrual cycle allows air pass genital tract pleural space fenestrations diaphragm another theory hormonal changes come menstrual cycle cause blebs spontaneously rupture blebs small blisterspustules filled air fluid develop endometrial tissue attaches within thoracic cavity forming chocolatelike cysts generally parietal pleura involved lung visceral layer diaphragm rarely tracheobronchial tree may also afflicted mechanism endometrial tissue reaches thorax remains unclear nearly cases occur right hemithorax phenomenon thought potentially due direction flow retroperitoneal peritoneal flow occurs clockwise pattern could likely explain tendency catamenial pneumothoraces defects diaphragm

lung endometrial cells undergo structural changes secretory phase menstrual cycle process called decidualization decidualized pleural endometrial implants disrupt pleura lead pneumothorax diagnosis hinted high recurrence rates lung collapse woman reproductive age endometriosis elevated clinical diagnosis made based history imaging gold standard definitive diagnosis remains videoassisted thoracoscopic surgery vats allows visualization lesion also surgical treatment via cauterization ectopic endometrial tissue special staining microscope utilizing cell marker used positively identify endometrial catamenial pneumothorax common form thoracic endometriosis syndrome also includes catamenial hemothorax catamenial hemoptysis catamenial hemothorax endometriosis lung nodules well exceptional pneumothorax medical emergency become associated decreased lung function progressed tension pneumothorax potentially fatal many cases catamenial pneumothorax resolve spontaneously require immediate intervention severe cases chest tube may required release air andor blood allow lung reexpandcitation needed surgery hormonal treatments combined approaches proposed variable results terms short long term effective separately together used treat women condition specifics depend patient situation surgery may used excise endometrial tissue lungs pleural space well repair damage holes surgery may also used remove blisters blebs additional procedure involves mesh placed diaphragm block holes may missed first surgery hormonal therapies also used suppress ovulation surgical removal endometrial tissue endeavored menstruation optimal pleurodesis may also effective removing space lung chest wall preventing air build layers nonsurgical treatment includes pharmacological treatment via continuous oral contraceptive therapy avoid cyclical bleeding monthly menstruation oral contraceptives appear preferable patients due fewer negative side effects treatment gnrh agonist therapy lead hypoestrogenic effects including osteoporosis resulting discontinuation therapy thus higher likelihood recurrence catamenial sources claim entity represents pneumothorax regard low incidence primary spontaneous pneumothorax ie due surgical trauma etc women rare condition hence many basic textbooks mention many doctors never heard therefore catamenial pneumothorax probably
