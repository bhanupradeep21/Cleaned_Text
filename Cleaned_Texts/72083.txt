tactile discrimination ability differentiate information sense touch somatosensory system nervous system pathway responsible essential survival ability used various types tactile discrimination one well known researched twopoint discrimination ability differentiate two different tactile stimuli relatively close types discrimination like graphesthesia spatial discrimination also exist extensively tactile discrimination something stronger weaker different people two major conditions chronic pain blindness affect greatly blindness increases tactile discrimination abilities extremely helpful tasks like reading contrast chronic pain conditions like arthritis decrease persons tactile one major application tactile discrimination new prosthetics robotics attempt mimic abilities human hand case tactile sensors function similarly mechanoreceptors human hand differentiate tactile somatosensory system includes multiple types sensations body includes light touch pain pressure temperature joint muscle categorized three different areas discriminative touch pain temperature proprioception discriminative touch includes touch pressure able recognize vibrations etc pain temperature includes perception pain amounts pain severity temperatures pain temperature category sensations also includes itching tickling proprioception includes receptors everything occurs surface skin includes sensations various muscles joints tendons three categories types pathways receptors pathways target cerebellum brain section brain tracks muscles times potential damage area greatly affect ones within somatosensory pathway three types neurons pseudounipolar neuron secondary afferentme neurons tertiary afferent neurons also slowly adapting receptors signify receptors sense indents made skin rapidly adapting receptors also present system example slowly adapting receptor use person breaks hisher arm arm immobilized healed heshe want forget broken something could potentially worsen damage arm example rapid adapting receptor use putting initially feel clothes worn forget wearing clothes forefront brain focus feeling clothes body however concentrate feeling could instantly feel contact skin clothing discriminative touch system deals everything toes neck spinal cord sensation experienced enters periphery axons specifically sensory axons signal passes axon axon distal proximal process proximal end specific axon leads spinal cord dorsal half moves towards brain axons leading signal towards spinal cord brain classified primary afferents makes sense afferent defined conducting toward something neurons sending signals towards receive neuron synapses classified secondary afferents neurons go thalamus synapsed towards another set neurons move towards cerebral many types receptors somatosensory pathway including stereognosistactile gnosis defined ability tell difference identify objects via touch absence visual auditory contact subject need able recognize temperature spatial properties texture size achieve reach accurate conclusion object type tactile discrimination give indication status parietal lobe conducting test common objects subject familiar used order ensure accurate reading consistency amongst multiple tests multiple different subjects utilizing form tactile discrimination practitioners able detect track presence effects neurodegenerative diseases alzheimers disease due astereognosis failure recognize objects via touch without visual graphesthesia ability person able recognize number letter written persons like tactile discrimination tests test measurement patients sense touch requires patient perform test voluntarily without visual contact purpose form tactile discrimination detect defects central nervous system lesions brainstem spinal cord thalamus sensory cortex order test carried successfully imperative subjects primary sensations fully functional severe lesion central nervous system would suggest loss primary sensation also important practitioner patient communicate ahead time orientation characters well body figures drawn usually palms order make tactile discrimination flexible patient may select correct answer series images lieu communicating verbally patient suffers speech language impairment graphesthesia test also versatile stereognosis test since doesnt require patient able grasp twopoint discrimination neurological examination two sharp points applied surface part body order see patient recognizes two discrete twopoint threshold smallest distance two points patient conducting form tactile discrimination believed practitioners able discern relative amount nerves tested location conducting procedure desired part body practitioner may apply points simultaneously one point practitioner may switch two random order examination conducted proper fashion imperative clear open communication subject practitioner subject fully conscious sort influence time making visual contact efficacy twopoint discrimination come scrutiny many researchers despite commonly used day clinical setting research studies shown test poor job determining degree nerves regain function damage well determining sensory failures first place owing form tactile discriminations simplicity crudeness dependence anecdotal evidence research studies also shown discrepancy data obtained tests data obtained tests used measure tactile spatial spatial discrimination another form twopoint discrimination practitioner tests innervation skin two blunt points compass drawing tool like patient must able discriminate two applied points parameters methods objectives spatial discrimination tactile discrimination tactile discrimination remain person become blind order see world senses become heightened important sense blind sense touch becomes frequently used help perceive world people blind displayed visual cortices become responsive auditory tactile stimulation braille allows blind able use sense touch feel roughness distance various patterns used form language within brain activation occipital cortex functionally relevant tactile braille reading well somatosensory various parts brain function way contribute effectiveness braille read blind people blind also rely heavily tactile gnosis spatial discrimination graphesthesia twopoint discrimination essentially occipital cortex allows one effectively make judgements distance braille patterns related spatial meanwhile somatosensory cortex allows one effectively make judgements roughness braille patterns related twopoint various visual areas brain essential blind person read braille much person sight essentially whether one blind perception objects involves tactile discrimination impaired one see comparing people blind people sight amount activity within somatosensory visual areas brain differ activity somatosensory visual areas high tactile gnosis people blind moreso active visual related stimuli involve touch nonetheless difference various areas within brain comparing blind sighted shape discrimination causes difference brain activity well tactile gnosis visual cortices blind individuals active various vision related tasks including tactile discrimination function cortices resemble activity adults nonneuropathic chronic pain conditions shown decrease tactile acuity ability precisely detect difference different chronic pain conditions affect tactile acuity deficits one conditions profound deficits tactile acuity arthritis condition affects tactile acuity site pain remote locations away suggests deficit may result cortical reorganization cortical remapping patients brain conditions like complex regional pain syndrome chronic lower back pain show deficits site pain still conditions like burning mouth syndrome shows deficit tactile acuity although evidence chronic pain conditions cause decrease tactile acuity evidence suggest deficit becomes clinically meaningful affects function robots prosthetic limbs become complex need sensors capable detecting touch high tactile acuity becomes necessary many types tactile sensors used different three types tactile sensors first single point sensors compared single cell whiskers detect local stimuli second type sensor high spatial resolution sensor compared human fingertip essential tactile acuity robotic hands third final tactile sensor type low spatial resolution sensor similar tactile acuity skin ones back sensors placed meaningfully throughout surface prosthetic robot give ability sense touch similar better ways human
