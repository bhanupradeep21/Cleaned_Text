muscle contractures occur many reasons paralysis muscular atrophy forms muscular dystrophy fundamentally muscle tendons shorten resulting reduced flexibility various interventions slow stop even reverse muscle contractures ranging physical therapy surgery joints usually immobilized shortened position resulting changes within joint connective tissue length muscle associated tendon prolonged immobilization facilitates tissue proliferation impinges joint maintaining shortened position prolonged period time leads fibrous adhesion formation loss sarcomeres loss tissue example fracture immobilization done casting limb plaster paris muscle length shortens muscle used large span time common cause ankle lose flexibility manner sheets tucked foot bed sleeping weight sheets keep feet plantarflexed night tucking sheets foot bed sleeping feet hanging bed prone position part correcting imbalance due sensory issues autism spectrum disorder children prefer toe walk instead feet making full contact ground chronic toe walking leads muscle contracture due lack calf muscles adequately stretched muscle contracture developed voluntary toe walking becomes spasticity left untreated contractures occur loss muscle tone inhibition hypertonia causes muscle become hyperactive resulting constant contraction reduces individual control affected area joint remain flexed state producing similar effects listed immobilization muscle imbalance agonist antagonist muscle occur due neurological disorder spinal cord injury myopathy lifestylepostural one muscle may normal atrophic hypertrophic alternately one muscle may hypertrophic decrease muscle tone leads continuous disuse eventually muscular atrophy constant contraction agonist muscle minimal resistance result contracture selective muscle hypertrophy may exacerbate contractures postural example case partial paralysis ie poliomyelitis loss strength muscle control tend greater muscles others leading imbalance various muscle groups around specific joints case point muscles dorsiflex flex foot upward less functional muscles plantarflex flex foot downward contracture occurs giving foot progressively downward angle loss flexibility metabolic myopathies gsdv mcardle disease gsdvii tarui disease temporary muscle contractures develop response impending muscle damage associated atp energy muscle contracts fails relax becoming hard stiff muscle may swell although temporary longer lasting generally painful muscle contractures different cramps elicited nerve intrinsic mechanisms muscle silent type transient contracture also called gsdv gsdvii cramp contracture managed cessation causal activity pain resolves however repeated episodes accumulate muscle damage see unlike stretching muscle cramps stretching muscle contracture avoided may cause muscle damage tearing muscle fibres ie resist uncurling fingers clawed congenital myopathies bethlem myopathy ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy cause muscle contractures two myopathies mutations collagen vi xii genes result deficient dysfunctional microfibrillar collagen extracellular matrix muscle connective potential effects muscle include progressive dystrophic changes fibrosis evidence increased apoptosis bethlem myopathy contractures presenting infancy may resolve age years reoccur disease progresses typically late first decade early following trauma fractures crush injuries burns arterial injuries ischemia restriction blood flow leads death muscle tissue necrosis cause contracture volkmanns adhesions bind two separate tissues organs together fibrotic scar tissue joining muscle fibres facia ligaments joints fibrosis occurs within organ fibrotic scar tissue within skeletal muscle known myofibrosis limits muscle contractibility stiffens muscle injury large burn surgery cause muscle contractures internal scar tissue adhesions fibrosis develops repetitive muscle injuries eg sports injuries major muscle strains microinjuries eg overuse injuries minor muscle strains also cause adhesions fibrosis made dense fibrous tissue strong supportive helping prevent injury microinjury reoccurring however fibrotic scar tissue causes muscle tissue become stuck together restricts movement causing pain weakness limited joint typically performed physical therapists passive stretching beneficial preventative measure tool maintain
