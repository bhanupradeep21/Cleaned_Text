medical research council mrc laboratory molecular biology lmb research institute cambridge england involved revolution molecular biology occurred since remained major medical research laboratory forefront scientific discovery dedicated improving understanding key biological processes atomic molecular cellular levels using multidisciplinary methods focus using knowledge address key issues human new replacement building constructed close original site cambridge biomedical campus opened majesty queen may road outside new building named francis crick avenue joint nobel prize winner lmb alumnus codiscovered helical structure dna max perutz following undergraduate training organic chemistry left austria came university cambridge study phd joining xray crystallographic group led jd bernal cavendish laboratory started lifelong work hemoglobin death lord rutherford led successor lawrence bragg pioneer xray crystallography becoming new cavendish professor physics bragg became major supporter perutz group early days world war ii many scientists physical side science turned biology bringing new way thinking expertise john kendrew joined perutzs group study protein closely related hemoglobin myoglobin medical research council mrc guidance secretary harold himsworth decided form support mrc unit study molecular structure biological systems group also included hugh huxley working muscle joined francis crick worked initially protein crystallography joined james watson annus mirabilis watson crick discovered doublehelical structure dna revealed biological information encoded linear structure information could duplicated cell division perutz discovered detailed threedimensional structures proteins myoglobin hemoglobin could principle solved xray analysis using heavy metal atom labeling technique hugh huxley discovered muscle contraction works sliding filament mechanism groups name changed mrc unit molecular biology also year vernon ingram discovered disease sickle cell anaemia caused single amino acid change hemoglobin molecule sydney brenner joined unit cricks review protein synthesis appeared laid first time central dogma molecular biology sequence hypothesis adaptor hypothesis brenner helped discover messenger rna year crick established genetic code read triplets work accomplished singlestorey temporary building hut rooms austin wing room leanto glass front greenhouse short sealed corridor gallery within cavendish mrc built new laboratory outskirts cambridge lmb unit cavendish moved early additionally fred sangers unit housed universitys biochemistry department joined aaron klug london sanger invented methods determining sequence amino acids protein awarded nobel prize chemistry first protein sequence insulin new laboratory opened queen elizabeth ii later year kendrew perutz shared nobel prize chemistry crick watson received share nobel prize physiology medicine lmb building incorporated new addenbrookes hospital complex constructed new lmb perutz chairman contained divisions structural studies headed kendrew molecular genetics crick protein chemistry sanger scientists number rapidly increased particularly large influx postdoctoral visitors molecular biology world flourished outline bones flesh put detailed atomic structures series proteins function deduced included myoglobin hemoglobin chymotrypsin last david blow genetic code evidence around world assembled crick punctuation signals messenger rna start translating rna protein sequence stop discovered postdoctoral fellow joan crick suggested trna molecules original adaptors read messenger wobble hypothesis sanger devised new methods sequencing rna molecules later dna molecules received second nobel prize chemistry much later line extended include determining sequence whole genomes john sulston played key role trna precursor molecules processed give functional trna elucidated john smith sid altman later led discovery ribozymes atomic structure first trna molecule solved zinc fingers discovered klug received nobel prize chemistry structure atp synthase solved john e walker andrew leslie walker shared nobel prize chemistry kiyoshi nagai began working deciphering structure spliceosome first using xray crystallography later cryogenic electron group published first structure spliceosome captured fully active substratebound state immediately following catalytic structure ribosome solved venkatraman ramakrishnan shared nobel prize chemistry towards end decade seemed new problems biology could solved using approaches proved successful molecular biology sydney brenner started working genetics nematode c elegans group expanded especially many foreign visitors today form core c elegans research sulston determined cell lineage small worm john graham white entire wiring diagram nervous system robert horvitz helped cell lineage share nobel prize physiology medicine brenner sulston jonathan hodgkin established genetic pathway c elegans controls sex determination john gurdon developed use frog oocyte translate mrnas sharing nobel prize physiology medicine earlier work showing genetic information remains intact development peter lawrence came study pattern formation helping discover compartments drosophila determine flys body plan influence crick also became interested morphogenetic gradients may help specify biological patterns césar milstein many years working antibody variation joined georges köhler together discovered produce monoclonal antibodies shared nobel prize physiology medicine area extended greg pioneered antibody engineering using phage display make novel human antibodies antibody fragments shared nobel prize chemistry monoclonal antibodies fragments major medical importance michael neuberger discovered mechanism antibody diversification occurs activationinduced cytidine deaminase fundamental discovery keystone understanding molecular mechanism organisms produce diverse repertoire antibodies recognise new pathogens wider importance understanding role directed mutagenesis dna repair physiology finally molecular mechanisms elucidated neuberger may great importance understanding mutational pattern kataegis breast cancer sadly michael neuberger died myeloma irony lost emphasis classical molecular biology shifted towards cell biology development molecular genetics division renamed cell biology mark bretscher discovered topological way proteins arranged human erythrocyte membrane phospholipid asymmetry richard henderson nigel unwin developed electron crystallography determine structure twodimensional arrays applying bacterial purple protein bacteriorhodopsin barbara pearse discovered major components clathrincoated vesicles structures formed endocytosis low resolution structure cagelike lattice around determined proteins become localised different parts cell endoplasmic reticulum golgi apparatus plasma membrane role cell polarity elucidated bretscher hugh sean munro spindle pole bodies large structures yeast cells act foci chromosomes moved mitosis purified low resolution structure deduced john continuing interest structure chromosomes initiated visitor roger kornberg discovered first level condensation dna nucleosome continues focus understanding higher orders folding dna new division neurobiology created wide variety topics nigel unwin developed electron crystallography solved structure acetylcholine receptor activates many neurons michel goedert identified variant proteins associated alzheimers disease scientific advances often depend technological advances lmb forefront many major examples include nucleic acid sequencing protein antibody engineering construction new xray equipment invention scanning confocal
