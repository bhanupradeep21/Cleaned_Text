bowel obstruction also known intestinal obstruction mechanical functional obstruction intestines prevents normal movement products either small bowel large bowel may signs symptoms include abdominal pain vomiting bloating passing mechanical obstruction cause cases severe abdominal pain sudden onset requiring admission causes bowel obstruction include adhesions hernias volvulus endometriosis
