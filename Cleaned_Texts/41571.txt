molecular structure nucleic acids structure deoxyribose nucleic acid first article published describe discovery double helix structure dna using xray diffraction mathematics helix transform published francis crick james watson scientific journal nature pages volume dated april article often termed pearl science brief contains answer fundamental mystery living organisms mystery question possible genetic instructions held inside organisms passed generation generation article presents simple elegant solution surprised many biologists time believed dna transmission going difficult deduce understand discovery major impact biology particularly field genetics enabling later researchers understand genetic code application physics chemistry biological problems led development molecular biology particularly concerned flow consequences biological information dna proteins discovery dna double helix made clear genes functionally defined parts dna molecules must way cells translate information dna specific amino acids make proteins linus pauling chemist influential developing understanding structure biological molecules pauling published structure alpha helix fundamentally important structural component proteins early pauling published triple helix model dna subsequently turned crick particularly watson thought racing pauling discover structure dna max delbrück physicist recognized biological implications quantum physics delbrucks thinking physical basis life stimulated erwin schrödinger write life schrödingers book important influence crick watson delbrucks efforts promote phage group exploring genetics way viruses infect bacteria important early development molecular biology general development watsons scientific interests crick watson maurice wilkins nobel prize medicine recognition discovery dna double helix always case structure molecule easy relate function makes structure dna obviously related function described modestly end article escaped notice specific pairing postulated immediately suggests possible copying mechanism genetic material specific pairing key feature watson crick model dna pairing nucleotide dna amount guanine equal cytosine amount adenine equal thymine cg pairs structurally similar particular length base pair fit equally two sugarphosphate backbones base pairs held together hydrogen bonds type chemical attraction easy break easy reform realizing structural similarity cg pairs watson crick soon produced double helix model dna hydrogen bonds core helix providing way unzip two complementary strands easy replication last key requirement likely model genetic molecule indeed basepairing suggest way copy dna molecule pull apart two sugarphosphate backbones hydrogen bonded g c components strand could used template assembly new basepair complementary strand watson crick produced double helix model dna known specialized features many different life forms earth made possible proteins structurally proteins long chains amino acid subunits way genetic molecule dna contain instructions make thousands proteins found cells dna double helix model clear must correspondence linear sequences nucleotides dna molecules linear sequences amino acids proteins details sequences dna instruct cells make specific proteins worked molecular biologists period francis crick played integral role theory analysis experiments led improved understanding genetic advances molecular biology stemming discovery dna double helix eventually led ways sequence genes james watson directed human genome project national institutes ability sequence manipulate dna central biotechnology industry modern medicine austere beauty structure practical implications dna double helix combined make molecular structure nucleic acids structure deoxyribose nucleic acid one prominent biology articles twentieth century although watson crick first put together scattered fragments information required produce successful molecular model dna findings based data collected researchers several laboratories example drew published research relating discovery hydrogen bonds dna john masson gulland denis jordan colleagues university college nottingham however discovery dna double helix also used considerable amount material unpublished work rosalind franklin ar stokes maurice wilkins hr wilson kings college london key data wilkins stokes wilson separately franklin gosling published two separate additional articles issue nature article watson article watson crick acknowledged stimulated experimental results kings college researchers similar acknowledgment published wilkins stokes wilson following threepage article watson published highly controversial autobiographical account discovery doublehelical molecular structure dna called double helix publicly accepted either crick furthermore erwin chargaff also printed rather unsympathetic review watsons book march issue science book watson stated among things crick access franklins data source aware also bdna xray diffraction pattern obtained franklin gosling may kings london particular late franklin submitted progress report medical research council reviewed max perutz cavendish laboratory university cambridge watson crick also worked mrcsupported cavendish laboratory cambridge whereas wilkins franklin mrcsupported laboratory kings london mrc reports usually widely circulated crick read copy franklins research summary early perutzs justification passing franklins report crystallographic unit bdna adna structures crick watson report contained information watson heard november franklin talked unpublished results raymond gosling meeting arranged mhf wilkins kings college following request crick perutz said acted unethically report part effort promote wider contact different mrc research groups justification would exclude crick present november meeting yet perutz also gave access franklins mrc report data crick watson sought permission cavendish laboratory head william lawrence bragg publish doublehelix molecular model dna based data franklin wilkins november watson acquired little training xray crystallography admission thus fully understood franklin saying structural symmetry dna crick however knowing fourier transforms bessel functions represent xray diffraction patterns helical structures atoms correctly interpreted one franklins experimental findings indicating dna likely double helix two polynucleotide chains running opposite directions crick thus unique position make interpretation formerly worked xray diffraction data large molecules helical symmetry similar dna franklin hand rejected first molecular model building approach proposed crick watson first dna model watson presented wilkins london obviously incorrect structure hydrated charged groups inside model rather outside watson explicitly admitted book double
