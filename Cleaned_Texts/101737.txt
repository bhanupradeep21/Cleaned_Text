animals infanticide involves intentional killing young offspring mature animal animal infanticide studied zoology specifically field ethology ovicide analogous destruction eggs practice observed many species throughout animal kingdom especially primates primate infanticide including microscopic rotifers insects fish amphibians birds infanticide practiced males infanticide caused sexual conflict general theme killer often male becoming new sexual partner victims parent would otherwise represents gain fitness killer loss fitness parents offspring killed type evolutionary struggle two sexes victim sex may counteradaptations reduce success may also occur reasons struggle food females case individuals may even kill closely related offspring filial infanticide occurs parent kills offspring sometimes involves consumption young termed filial cannibalism behavior widespread fishes seen terrestrial animals well human infanticide recorded almost every culture unique aspect human infanticide sexselective infanticide infanticide came seen significant occurrence nature quite recently time first seriously treated yukimaru infanticide attributed stress causing factors like overcrowding captivity considered pathological maladaptive classical ethology held conspecifics members species rarely killed gained much greater acceptance possible reasons treated prevalent natural phenomenon include abhorrence people popular group species selectionist notions time idea individuals behave good group species compare genecentered view evolution fact difficult observe form infanticide represents struggle sexes one sex exploits much latters disadvantage usually male benefits behavior though cases males play similar roles females parental care victim perpetrator may reversed see batemans principle discussion asymmetry hanuman langurs gray langurs old world monkeys found india social animal living groups consist single dominant male multiple females dominant male reproductive monopoly within group causes subordinate males much lower fitness value gain opportunity reproduce subordinate males try take dominant role within group usually resulting aggressive struggle existing dominant successful overthrowing previous male unrelated infants females infanticidal period limited window group taken cannibalism however observed species infanticide reduces intraspecific competition incumbents offspring males also increases parental investment afforded young allows females become fertile females species well many mammals ovulate lactation becomes easier understand infanticide evolved male kills females young stops lactating able become pregnant newly dominant male able reproduce faster rate without act males constant struggle protect group express infanticidal behavior contribute larger portion future gene pools see natural selection similar behavior also seen male lions among species also kill young cubs thereby enabling impregnate females unlike langurs male lions live small groups cooperate take control pride existing attempt kill cubs roughly nine months old younger though species female attempt defend cubs viciously males average twoyear window pass genes lionesses give birth every two years selective pressure conform behavior strong fact estimated quarter cubs dying first year life victims male mice show great variation behavior time fertilizing female become aggressive towards mouse pups three weeks killing come across period however behavior changes dramatically become paternal caring offspring lasts almost two months afterwards become infanticidal coincidence female gestation period three weeks well takes roughly two months pups become fully weaned leave nest proximate mechanism allows correct timing periods involves circadian rhythms see chronobiology day night cycle affecting mouses internal neural physiology disturbances duration cycles results different periods time adaptive value behavior switching twofold infanticide removes competitors mouse offspring allows female victims impregnated earlier continued care young mentioned gerbils hand longer commit infanticide paired female actively kill eat offspring young females species behave much like male mice hunting litters except rearing prospective infanticide subset sexual competition infanticide young born arrival new male killed less common infanticide existing young still increase fitness cases offspring could possibly fathered new mate ie one gestation fertility period known occur lions langurs also observed species house birds however situation complex female eggs fertilized one time delay males may destroy clutches laid days arrival though investment around days parental care large high level parental certainty females also known display infanticidal behavior may appear unexpected conditions described apply males always unlimited resource species males provide parental care offspring females may compete indirectly others killing offspring freeing limiting resource males represent documented research stephen emlen natalie demong wattled jacanas jacana jacana tropical wading wattled jacana exclusively male sex broods females defend territory experiment demong emlen found removing females territory resulted nearby females attacking chicks male cases evicting nest males fertilized offending females cared emlen describes shot female one night first light new female already turf saw terrible picking throwing chicks dead within hours soliciting male mounting day next night shot female came next morning saw

without male caring eggs like become desiccated hatch species males scarce resource females must sometimes compete find free male often stab eggs brooding one case males fertilize female care eggs noritaka ichikawa found males moisten eggs first seconds moisture bodies evaporated however guard egg masses long several hours time could hunting prey seem prevent evaporation staying guard males guarded nest short periods seen similar hatching rates controlled experiment females present seems rather males successful avoiding infanticidal females water eggs might well explain ultimate cause female rats eat kits strange females source nutrition take nest blacktailed prairie dogs coloniallyliving harempolygynous squirrels found mainly united states living arrangement involves one male living four females territory defended individuals underground nesting blacktails one litter per year estrous single day around beginning spring sevenyear natural experiment john hoogland others princeton university revealed infanticide widespread species including infanticide invading males immigrant females well occasional cannibalism individuals surprising finding study far common type infanticide involved killing close kins offspring seems illogical kin selection favors behaviors promote wellbeing closely related individuals postulated form infanticide successful trying kill young nearby groups whole group must bypassed case within group mother need evaded marauding behavior evidently adaptive infanticidal females healthier young others heavier well behavior appears reduce competition females food future competition among offspring similar behavior reported meerkat suricata suricatta including cases females killing mothers sisters daughters offspring infanticidal raids neighboring groups also bottlenose dolphins reported kill young impact dominant male langurs tend kill existing young upon taking control sightings infanticide leopard males stegodyphus lineatus

observed explained way preserving mothers resources energy turn increasing reproductive success upcoming breeding may beneficial species behave way infanticide without risks perpetrator already expended energy perhaps sustained serious wounds fight another male attacks females vigorously defend offspring may telling harempolygynous males risk infection also energetically costly pursue mothers young may try escape costs behavior described prairie dogs include risk individual losing young killing anothers mention fact killing relatives species infanticide common perpetrators may well victims future come better long infanticidal individual gains reproductive output behavior tend become common costs behavior general may induced counterstrategies evolved sex described taking broader view blacktailed prairie dog situation infanticide seen cost social female private nest away others would much less likely infants killed absent costs increased spread parasites must made benefits group territory defense increased awareness predators avian example published nature acorn woodpeckers females nest together possibly nesting alone eggs constantly destroyed rivals even eggs consistently removed first nest partners entire group lays day cooperate incubate eggs group time significant proportion eggs lost ovicidal form infanticide reduces fitness killed individuals parents animals evolved range counterstrategies behavior may divided two different classes tend prevent infanticide minimize losses females abort resorb young still development new male takes known bruce may prevent young killed birth saving mother wasted time energy however strategy also benefits new male mice occur proximate mechanism female smelling odor new males infanticide burying beetles may led male parental species males often cooperate female preparing piece carrion buried eggs eaten larvae hatch males may also guard site alongside female apparent experiments behavior provide young better nourishment use defending predators however burying bugs may try take nesting space occurs malefemale pair twice successful nest defense preventing ovicide offspring female langurs may leave group young alongside outgoing male others may develop false estrous allow male copulate deceiving thinking actually sexually females may also sexual liaisons males promiscuous behavior adaptive males know whether offspring killing may reluctant invest less effort infanticide lionesses cooperatively guard scouting males pair seen violently attack male killed one resistance infanticide also costly though instance female may sustain serious injuries defending young times simply advantageous submit infanticide destruction offspring characteristic many species posed great threat observable changes behavior respective female mothers specifically changes exist preventive measures common behavioral mechanism females reduce risk infanticide future offspring process paternity confusion dilution theory implies female mates multiple males widely spread assumption paternity across many males therefore make less likely kill attack offspring could potentially carry genes theory operates assumption specific males keep memory past mates desire perpetuate genes japanese macaque macaca fuscata female mating multiple males dilution paternity found inhibit maletoinfant aggression infanticide eight times less towards infants females previously multimale mating mmm recorded measure prevent infanticide species young altricial heavily dependent high turnover rate dominant males leads infanticide previous dominant males young examples include limited whitefooted mice hamsters lions langurs baboons along mating multiple males mating females throughout entirety reproductive cycle also serves purpose inhibiting chance infanticide theory assumes males use information past matings make decisions committing infanticide females subsequently manipulate knowledge females able appear sexually active receptive stages cycle even pregnancy another males offspring confuse males believing subsequent children pseudoestrus theory applies females within species exhibit obvious clues stage cycle langurs rhesus macaques gelada alternative paternity confusion method infanticide prevention paternity concentration behavior females concentrate paternity one specific dominant male means protection infanticide hands lessdominant particularly applies species male long tenure dominant male faces little instability hierarchy females choose dominant males best available form protection therefore mate exclusively male especially common within small additional behavioral strategy prevent infanticide males may aggressive protection nest along female presence strategy commonly used species european aggressive protection nest effort reduce infanticide observed black rock skink egernia saxatilis live small families adults defend territories conspecifics small nuclear families live permanent shelter parents protect infants infanticidal conspecifics way adults attack unrelated juveniles offspring presence parent significantly reduces rate infanticide conspecific adults ignore juveniles parent present likely another adult threatening aggressive lizard therefore juvenile living within parents territory experience far less attacks conspecific filial infanticide

much study repulsive subject many people regard reprehensible even think research infanticide animals part motivated desire understand human behaviors child abuse hausfater explains researchers trying see theres connection animal infanticide child abuse neglect killing humans dont know yet connections infanticide still practiced human cultures groups individualscitation needed many past societies certain forms infanticide considered permissible whereas modern societies practice considered immoral criminal still takes place western world usually parents mental illness violent behavior addition
