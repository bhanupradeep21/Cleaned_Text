several key features archosauriform skull total measures approximately millimetres long broad flattened snout teyujagua possesses mosaic characteristics intermediate basal archosauromorphs archosauriformes primitive features include absence antorbital fenestra open lower temporal bar however like archosauriformes serrated teeth exposed mandibular fenestra lower jaw features previously found external nares dorsally positioned fused single large opening confluent feature found several aquatic semiaquatic archosauriformes although orbits positioned laterally slightly forwards providing limited binocular vision nasals long occupy much skull length followed short broad frontals almost excluded margin orbit pre postfrontals postfrontal bones sculpted jugals similarly adorned longitudinal ridges parietal bones surround small pineal foramen third eye feature absent archosauriforms sometimes found proterosuchid archosauriform proterosuchus lower temporal fenestra trapezoidal shape another characteristic previously found archosauriforms upper temporal fenestrae unique feature autapomorphy teyujagua external mandibular fenestra positioned unusually far forward lower jaw directly beneath eyes jaw closed dentition heterodont bearing four small premaxillary teeth maximum larger maxillary teeth dentary tooth row slightly shorter tooth row maxilla teeth laterally compressed serrated however unlike later archosauriformes serrated distal rear margins teeth also unlike early archosauriform teeth loosely implanted deep sockets thecodont whereas earliest
