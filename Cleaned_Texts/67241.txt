hindeodus extinct genus conodonts family anchignathodontidae generic name hindeodus tribute george jennings hinde british geologist paleontologist early suffix odus typically describes animals teeth essentially making hindeodus mean hindeteeth conodonts hindeodus typically small elongate marine animals look similar eels today hindeodus existed early carboniferous early triassic inhabited wide variety different environments paleozoic triassic body consisted entirely soft tissues except assortment phosphatic elements believed feeding despite years controversy regarding phylogenetic position conodonts hindeodus considered vertebrates slightly derived early vertebrates called cyclostomata part large clade complex conodonts called prioniodontida order hindeodus fossils distributed worldwide due diversity environments species hindeodus differentiated slight variation elements feeding apparatus species hindeodus called hindeodus parvus particularly well studied used index fossil defining permiantriassic hindeodus first described rexroad furnish illinois state geological surveys study mississippian specimen found pella formation southcentral iowa known excellent preservation conodonts however species hindeodus among least abundant fossils less specimens per kilogram initially believed hindeodus may species trichondella elsonella determined hindeodus morphologically phylogenetically comparable either thus must new faunal diversity end permian extinction event million years ago drastically plummeted hindeodus survived early possible explanation versatility certain hindeodus species terms environments able survive additionally evidence hindeodus able migrate permiantriassic transitional period lead wide distribution worldwide hindeodus primarily softbodied mineralized tissue hindeodus conodonts elements tooth like structures arranged particular positions thought served feeding apparatus functioning grasp intake conodont elements essentially basis conodont taxonomy elements extensively studied debated therefore specific categorization elements based shape position elements divided p elements hindeodus elements ramiform branchlike elements makellate pickshaped p elements pectiniform coneshaped hparvus apparatus particular consists six kinds elements arranged different positions nine elements unpair paired two elements one pair p elements element unpaired long sharp cusp lacks posterior process elements differentiated laterally compressed long sharp cusp two lateral processes elements long sharp cusp anterior process shorter posterior process element typical makellate pickshaped structure element several different hypotheses functions hindeodus apparatus one hypothesis elements used support structures filamentous soft tissue used suspension feeding however upon analysis determined p elements would provide enough surface area support ciliated tissue needed suspension accepted hypothesis conodont elements used predation predicted elements open allowing prey captured oral cavity animal cusps elements aid food intake firmly gripping prey bladelike p elements slice like pair hypothesis supported presence lingual cartilage found conodonts

exceptionally preserved bedding plane unlikely apparatuses preserved incompletely alternative hypothesis hindeodus lost two elements implies changes capture prey primary function array trap prey animals final hypothesis hindeodus lost two p elements implies changes food processing ability may due change diet food requires less slicing crushing upon analysis conodont history evident p elements vary among conodonts sm array essentially conserved million years suggests evolutionary constraints number elements stronger p elements thus less likely loss p elements likely linked permiantriassic extinction event many environmental changes occurred may impacted availability hindeodus prey resulting change diet new food processing hindeodus characterized p element large cusp denticles increase width anteriorly toward head except anteriormost denticle generally decrease height anteriorly except posteriormost three denticles ones furthest back equal heights cusps much higher denticles possess elements short lateral processes slightly upturned laterally denticles variable hindeodus differentiated conodonts p elements large fixed cusps located anterior end blade usually grow primarily adding new denticles posterior end conodonts vary growth pattern location cusps example ozarkidina cusps located within blade growth occur anteriorly hindeodus p element crucial identifying genus stable morphology carboniferous triassic one minor morphological however late permian early triassic rapid evolutionary change especially p element cause rapid change morphology certain may related environmental changes leading different availability food source thus leading changes feeding species hindeodus divided two groups based morphology posterior portion elements species hparvus heurypyge
