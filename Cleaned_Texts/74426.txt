probainognathus meaning progressive jaw extinct genus cynodonts lived around million years ago late triassic argentina together genus bonacynodon brazil probainognathus forms family probainognathidae probainognathus relatively small carnivorous insectivorous cynodont like cynodonts relative mammals possessed several mammallike features like cynodonts probainognathus double jaw joint included quadrate articular bones like basal synapsids also squamosal surangular bones joint dentary squamosal bones seen modern mammals however absent probainognathus first specimens probainognathus jenseni discovered chañares formation la rioja province argentina group headed harvard collector james jensen specimens collected kilometres mi north terminus rio chañares campo de probainognathus jenseni first described named harvard paleontologist alfred sherwood romer generic name probainognathus means progressive jaw greek referencing advanced jaw articulation specific epithet jenseni honours james juvenile skull pvsj ischigualasto formation northwestern argentina assigned cf probainognathus paper josé bonaparte alfred w crompton later studies shown specimen likely belongs cynodont derived specimen sent ct scan university texas austin resulting model made available holotype probainognathus jenseni along several specimens stolen national university la rioja probainognathus small cynodont apparent body size inconsistent across sources ranging size rat size small diet probainognathus thought carnivorous insectivorous extrapolated teeth included dullytipped partially developed canines postcanines four upper incisors positioned vertically three lower incisors leaned slightly cheek teeth slender sides lengthened anteroposteriorly several cusps along based endocranial cast probainognathus several details extrapolated brain probainognathus cerebral hemispheres elongated established olfactory bulbs significant cerebellum among less pronounced structures anterior features suggested probainognathus brain welldeveloped visual auditory motor body sensory systems whole brain probainognathus indicates process developing snout probainognathus extended beyond premaxillary processes thin apparent fragility structure led broken several specimens led increased difficulty studying several features identified however suborbital arch zygomatic arch shaped relatively sharply extension squamosal posteriorly zygomatic arch probainognathus long secondary palate stretched way posterior end tooth secondary palate formed largely palatine somewhat narrow narrowing palate allowed conservation space able fit back lower postcanine teeth moreover vomer stretched posteriorly secondary palate significant pterygoid flanges present skull probainognathus average around centimetres length lacked pineal skull broad proportion length face short narrow zygomatic region relatively large seemingly jaw muscle skull also possessed double occipital condyle typical mammalian comparison close relatives chiniquodon braincase probainognathus broader parietal region oticoccipital region skull deeper likewise parietals depth occipital crest higher orbits proportionately larger relative rest head sagittal crest also lengthened posteriorly split occipital crests led straighter posterior margin concave occiput jaw probainognathus particular phylogenetic importance morphologically dentary made lower jaw curved extended posteriorly area articular jaw correspondingly upper jaw squamosal bone became situated next like cynodonts probainognathus possessed double jaw joint indicated socket glenoid squamosal bone romer interpreted socket articulating dentary bone lower jaw seen modern mammals early mammaliaforms like later studies reinterpreted socket articulating surangular one postdentary bones instead dentarysquamosal articulation became established former bones involved jaw articulation articular quadrate could become integrated inner ear malleus incus yet happened case probainognathus reduced size quadrate well loose association squamosal proximity stapes indicates quadrate incus process jaw probainognathus suggested mammallike soft tissue features jaw muscles probainognathus thought positioned farther forward masseter splitting two separate muscles superficial masseter deep romer first described probainognathus assigned family chiniquodontidae based
