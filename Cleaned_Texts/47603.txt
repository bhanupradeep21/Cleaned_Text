follicular atresia refers process follicle fails develop thus preventing ovulating releasing normal naturally occurring progression occurs mammalian ovaries age approximately mammalian follicles ovaries undergo ovulation remaining follicles go follicular atresia cycle growth phases summary follicular atresia process leads follicular loss loss oocytes disturbance loss functionality process lead many ovaries site development breakdown ovarian follicles secrete hormones oocytes oocytes immature eggs surrounded granulosa cells internal external theca oocytes able mature within follicle meiosis humans ovaries process occurs continuously born finite number follicles follicles follicles undergo one follicle mature enough release egg may typically around follicles mature month single follicle ovulated follicle oocyte released becomes corpus luteum corpus luteum last stage ovarian follicles lifecycle important role secreting estrogen progesterone prepare body conception conception occur shed known corpus observed mechanism important regulating maintaining healthy reproductive system mammals follicular atresia occurs throughout stages follicular development follicular reserve completely exhaustion follicular reserve occurs menopause typically around age humans ovaries dramatic decrease estrogen progesterone levels characteristic menopause caused follicular atresia breakdown follicles prevent releasing hormones estrogen progesterone levels also decrease menopause without follicles development corpus luteum major source circulating progesterone levels atresia complex hormonally controlled apoptotic process depends dominantly granulosa cell apoptosis follicular atresia inhibited folliclestimulating hormone fsh promotes follicle follicle developed secretes estrogen high levels decreases secretions granulosa cell apoptosis considered underlying mechanism follicular atresia associated five ligandreceptor systems involved cell granulosa cell apoptosis promoted tumor necrosis factoralpha tnfα although mechanism occurs fas antigen cell surface receptor protein expressed granulosa cells mediates signals induce apoptosis binding fas ligand therefore plays important role follicular lack functional fas ligand fas receptor system linked abnormal follicle development increased numbers secondary follicles result inability induce tnfrelated apoptosisinducing ligand trail activates caspase turn interacts caspases induce apoptosis granulosa addition two intracellular inhibitor proteins cellular flicelike inhibitory protein short form cflips long form cflipl strongly expressed granulosa cells may act antiapoptotic antimüllerian hormone amh studied key regulator ovaries humans inhibits follicular atresia proven amh reduces growth follicles upregulation proposes potential pathophysiological pathway using indirect comparators derive hypothesis exploring different patient populations individuals polycystic ovary syndrome pcos help support hypothesis amh may key regulator inhibiting follicular proposed enhanced levels nitrogen oxide rats prevent atresia ovarian follicle depressed levels opposite studying dairy cows two forms follicular atresia identified antral basal antral follicular atresia characterized apoptosis granulosa cells within antral layers granulosa membrane sometimes within antrum process presence pyknotic nuclei antral layers membrane apoptosis ensures follicle gets eliminated without triggering inflammatory antral follicular atresia causes damage basal granulosa cells type follicular atresia often considered classic commonly observed form species occurs throughout follicular development universally seen large follicles basal follicular atresia characterized destruction granulosa cells

order mammals maintain healthy reproductive system mammalian ovaries ovulate follicles remaining follicles may go atresia cycles growth however disorders regulation follicle breakdown generation lead various pathologies premature ovarian failure pof also called premature ovarian insufficiency loss ovarian function age due follicular dysfunction accelerated follicular pof may present

prevalent amongst humans ovaries leads many deaths united since fsh inhibits follicular atresia overproduction fsh lead excessive follicle formation increased risk ovarian inability regulate granulosa
