amanita virosa commonly known europe destroying angel european destroying angel deadly poisonous basidiomycete fungus one many genus amanita occurring europe virosa associates various deciduous coniferous trees large fruiting bodies ie mushrooms appear summer autumn caps stipes gills white colour immature specimens virosa resemble several edible species commonly consumed humans increasing risk accidental poisoning small specimens may resemble common portobello mushroom nonexperts one cap virosa enough kill adult symptoms poisoning generally come several hours afterwards fact makes fungus even problematic along geographical namesakes virosa one poisonous known poisonous mushrooms principal toxic constituent αamanitin damages liver kidneys usually fatally amanita virosa first appears white eggshaped object covered universal veil grows mushroom breaks free though may ragged patches veil cap edges cap initially conical inturned edges becoming hemispherical flattening

conical μm long stain blue iodine flesh white taste reminiscent radishes turns bright yellow sodium fungus highlights danger picking immature fungi resembles edible mushrooms agaricus arvensis campestris puffballs lycoperdon spp caps opened gills become visible ability peeled taken sign edibility mushrooming potentially lethal mistake species unclear fungus closely resembles edible species

silibinin prevents uptake amatoxins hepatocytes thereby protecting undamaged hepatic tissue also stimulates dnadependent rna polymerases leading increase rna nacetylcysteine shown promise combination animal studies indicate amatoxins deplete hepatic nacetylcysteine serves glutathione precursor may therefore prevent reduced glutathione levels subsequent liver none antidotes used undergone
