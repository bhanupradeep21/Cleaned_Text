social sharing emotions phenomenon field psychology concerns tendency recount share emotional experiences others according area research emotional experiences uniquely fleeting internal scientific studies catastrophes important life events demonstrate propensity victims talk experiences express onset empirical studies rimé et al coined term social sharing emotions name observed research significant development social psychology questioned accepted view emotions shortlived intrapersonal prevalent literature yet first set revealed emotional experiences shared discussed therefore studies concerning social sharing emotions contribute substantial new perspective understanding emotions underlying processes rimé et noted contemporary scientific research emotions considered responses preceding events restrained selfcontrol selfrestoration emotions generally regarded ephemeral intrapersonal experiences rimé also later pointed attachment theory rendered emotional regulation interpersonal nature children yet become mature adults one must become autonomous capable regulating emotions independently field psychology healthy individual typically seen selfcontained independent selfreliant capable asserting influencing riger also suggests individualistic view emotional regulation could influenced context within studied ie united states leon festinger well known social psychologist presented influential social comparison theory proposes people seek obtain accurate selfevaluations comparing similar furthermore people turn social environment search clarification faced obscure confusing environmental situations sensations thus extending theory emotions would posit experiencing emotional situations conform held expectations ambiguous one would expected later share emotional experience festingers wellknown theory cognitive dissonance proposed offers evidence process might occur emotional experiences unexpected affect ones selfconcept thus challenge ones system beliefs according festinger peoples expectations manifest cognitive dissonance created expectations reality people seek reduce dissonance rationalizing experiencing emotion people would expected communicate event others order help reduce cognitive article emphasizes importance ability others assist process coping people able offer new perspectives interpretations emotional event previous rimé concluded emotions necessitate cognitive articulation dense complex nature using language express experience people forced classify organize contents emotions furthermore concretize objectivize experience script easily rimé also notes social environment point people towards socially acceptable ways defining idea social sharing emotion derived studies emotional trauma studies show natural disasters catastrophes lifechange events people tendency talk experiences disclose feelings example study exploring psychological reactions death loved one found bereavers felt need talk event studies produced similar findings people experienced natural disasters cancer patients rimé later proposed term social sharing emotions describe research indicates strong emotional experiences present following trauma crises inherently adaptive lead growth resilience altruism community engagement order growth occur collective engagement processing emotional experiences social sharing emotions defined interpersonal process wherein emotional event individuals initiate interpersonal behaviours discussing event reactions words social sharing emotions process reactivating emotion symbolic level taking place part ensuing interpersonal furthermore rimé et offered two defining characteristics phenomenon first studies social sharing emotion explore individual aspects process studies aimed answer questions concerning occurs long emotional event age gender cultural differences often occurs given emotional event etc first empirical social sharing emotions conducted retrospective studies participants filled questionnaire asked recall specific personal experience provoked emotion asked respond questions related social sharing behaviors related event studies emotional experiences followed social sharing experiences least one however retrospective studies subject certain biases may affected results example participants could influenced number memory biases possible selective memory bias events emotionally intense possible bias easily recall recent events possible biases studies conducted using daily diaries every night participants asked write significant event day answer various questions related social sharing event one studies study emotional events shared day event occurred also followup studies conducted using different followup experimenters contacted certain individuals foreseeable emotional experiences birth child giving blood taking exam way experimenters chose emotional event recalled furthermore types emotional events would studying could examine possible differences types emotional events findings studies supported retrospective studies emotional events socially shared furthermore significant difference found frequency social sharing different types emotional events two methodologies help eliminate possible biases original studies still operated assumption causal link emotional experience development process social sharing therefore true experimental method used study phenomenon two friends came together laboratory split one subjects watched excerpt one three films either documentary animals weak emotion violent scene animals moderate emotion scene depicting humans committing cruel acts towards animals strong emotion time subject given trivial task complete two subjects reunited asked wait minutes next part experiment time conversations recorded analyzed presence social methods produced similar results social sharing found occur emotional exist strong stereotypes women express talk emotions others men results studies indicate contrary sex differences concerning amount social sharing emotion men women however although quantitative sex differences found one qualitative difference found social sharing behaviors males females choose share women tend share emotions equally family members close friends spousespartners hand men tend share exclusively partnersspouses less close friends family changes people choose targets social sharing evident spanning life cycle targets social sharing children years old typically attachment figures ie parents research found targets still predominantly attachment figures mother father age social sharing extended siblings sometimes peers even pets grandparents teddy bear adolescents tend choose among family members young adults confide equally family friends partners study mature adults tend choose partners study large number psychological studies recruit college students participate reasons convenience studies social sharing emotion exception reason question raised whether level education plays role sharing behaviors addressed question analyzing data crosssectional study girls elementary school middle school high school girls pursuing undergraduate education college girls pursuing masters degree despite possible reasons believe education might increase capacity likelihood sharing behaviors differences found similar problems restricted educational background subjects first studies social sharing emotions limited belgian french populations later studies conducted netherlands italy spain produced similar results first studies question whether social sharing exists nonwestern cultures first intercultural compared dutch subjects turkish surinamese immigrants findings showed social sharing prominent behavior group although slightly less surinamese subjects studies comparing western eastern produced similar results finding eastern cultures slightly lower rates social sharing furthermore several general qualitative differences found western eastern populations average western subjects shared emotional event often times asian subjects times also longer delay emotional event social sharing asian groups western differences could explained collectivisticindividualistic culture case differences could reflect extent social networking typically seen culture individualistic culture social networking diversified collectivistic cultures family generally center network additionally differences could reflect closeness interpersonal relationships collectivistic cultures difficult individuals recognize social sharing occurs often together results studies social sharing emotion reveal behaviors common fact norm transcending boundaries gender age level education culture etc however social sharing occurs average emotional events leaves discussed perhaps purposefully kept study conducted sought determine people believe share emotional episodes according self reports participants several main reasons people initiate social sharing behaviors particular order popular notion people might share extremely intense emotional events simply inexpressible along idea psychologists initially extreme nature experiences would play important role determining whether emotional event shared additionally thought people would motivated deliberately revisit events would reactivate extreme negative emotions accompanied events however studies revealed difference average emotional intensity events shared compared kept secret intensity emotion seem influence whether emotional event shared kept secret type emotion involved appear play role specifically emotional experiences involving feelings shame guilt tend shared less frequently less often fewer people sharing emotional events involves selfdisclosure feelings shame guilt associated concealment social sharing emotions important source interpersonal interaction social integration forming positive durable relationships fact many people engage sharing behaviors order social interactions strengthen relationships described however might result sharing certain emotional events asked would keep emotional event secret frequent reasons wanting avoid hurting someone preserving ones image eyes others protecting ones private life protecting ones self reasons together constituted responses participants concern one thing protection according baumeister idea protection pertains protection undesirable consequences realm social sphere namely revelation secrets would harmful social relationships therefore instead social integration strengthening relationships revelation certain emotional events could harmful relationship could thus result social disintegration deterioration whereas initial studies focused behaviors person shares emotions later studies examined impact interaction recipient social sharing person listened recounting emotional event findings led emergence questions exploring aspects social sharing emotions emotions elicited recipient processes occur listening emotional episode type sharing affects intimate relationships etc new lines study allowed identification elements process secondary social sharing emotions scientific evidence suggesting exposure narration emotional experience several effects target person increased autonomic arousal among subjects listening distressed heightened anxiety among subjects listened people disclosing intimate aspects depressive hostile sentiments subjects exposed conversation someone evidence concluded exposure social sharing emotion emotioneliciting event would follow listener would later share experience people christophe et rimé called subsequent phenomenon secondary social sharing words receiver social sharing consequently experience kind emotion receiver become transmitter narration part emotional experience hearing story first studies secondary social sharing confirmed existence first study subjects reported particularly strong sentiments interest surprise result hearing someone recount emotional experience cases subjects shared episode third person furthermore subjects reported higher emotional intensity response hearing emotional story shared experience story often situation suggested frequency sharing grows relation intensity emotions felt listening second study christophe et proposed subjects recall emotional experience according intensity level given low moderate high study emotional intensity rated higher secondary social sharing occurred cases confirmed intense emotions hearing account emotional experience greater propensity secondary social moreover cases secondary social sharing occurred day primary social sharing situation yet secondary sharing necessarily shortlived occurrence participants reported sometimes still talked episode several times sometimes talked several months important point secondary social sharing limited negative emotional episodes instead occur positive emotional episodes well one study participants reported degree secondary social sharing response positive negative emotional situation differences found two however qualitative differences secondary sharing positive emotional episodes secondary social sharing initiated faster higher number repetitions targets negatives emotional social sharing emotions extend beyond secondary original subject might share experience primary social sharing people people turn share experience secondary social sharing people possibly according one tertiary individuals share experience people least cases total people implicated primary social sharing people secondary social sharing finally additional people tertiary social sharing summing people total one event idea important implications concerning link individual collective well ideas collective memory discussed despite fact certain situations people share personal emotional information nonintimate others data shows target social sharing usually close relative intimate however paradox arises considering secondary social sharing emotions one hand socially sharing emotional experience intimate presupposes confidentiality yet majority cases experiences become subject secondary sharing people one study secondary social sharing occurred two times cases two people time importantly another found investigated cases subjects reported shared identity original sharer third person secondary sharing two studies indicate confidentiality somewhat illusion emotional experience socially shared confidentiality may actually exception rather rule series classification recipients general behaviors responses social sharing emotions created five general classes behaviors identified responses could vary depending magnitude emotional episode heard subjects listened highly emotional experiences exhibited less verbal expression attempted less dedramatization much nonverbal comforting tried understand behaviors roles person interaction series three studies first two experiments subjects invited watch short film nonemotional moderate intense emotional conditions partner real friend given nonstimulating task complete right put room together waited second part experiment time conversation recorded order analyze manifestations social sharing studies duration social sharing significantly higher intense emotion condition nonemotional moderate emotion conditions condition social sharing substantial enough justify calculating individual contributions targets partners social sharing process consistent hypothesis person exposed emotion would socially share targets contributed social sharing component conversation much greater extent partners time respectively second experiment social sharing tended decline time passed intense emotion condition elicited significantly sharing first two minutes subjects together findings suggest intensity emotion extent sharing linked monotonically studies verbal exchanges comments targets targets expressions predominantly consisted giving information expressing feelings movie thereby conforming formal definition social sharing emotion hand partners comments found brief consist mainly requests information expressions feelings elicited targets sharing regard findings quite consistent previous research showing sharing emotion elicits emotional responses listeners according luminet et results suggest social sharing fulfills informational goals well emotional ones third study subjects invited watch short film answer questionnaires two days later goal study determine whether social sharing occurs real life results showed higher level sharing results exposure intense emotion condition findings observed first two experiments therefore reproduced third study despite different method measuring social sharing together results strongly suggest emotional intensity event determined extent social according social sharing experience pleasant one could help strengthen socioaffective links two people seen diagram social sharing result reciprocal affection two people involved play obvious role attachment social sharing done partners intimate relationship could seen reinforcement affective bond phenomenon social sharing emotions extends beyond realm psychology also considered context emotional episode shared group people becomes part shared knowledge within group discussed knowledge event experienced single person extend people via secondary tertiary social sharing thus event become shared part relatively large group people yet event extended even larger groups people perhaps even whole communities even nations event intense one many people concurrently experience event simplest terms collective memory understood memory group people usually associated passing memory generation however many nuances idea must also considered terms processes remembering forgetting thus typical emotional event socially shared propagates perhaps people event becomes collective memory group community people emotional event particularly intense event would expected undergo even larger diffusion furthermore intense emotional event rapid diffusion reach people shorter amount time especially true events shared via mass media newspapers magazines television internet etc case collective memory longer confined local population instead become regional national even international besides propagation single persons emotional event many people simultaneously experience single national emotional event disappearing important person event also becomes part collectively shared memory however person still personal memory event experienced event emotional events like one described experienced concurrently many people matter chance others sometimes purposefully created within group people social sharing behaviors incite socioaffective dynamic involved persons according several may produce interpersonal benefits result social integration humans long aware processes using even exploiting long time particularly prominent example purposeful collective social sharing celebration commemoration collective events war victories defeats natural disasters ceremonies symbols symbolic characters stories according collective instances social sharing created similar reasons individual instances event fully integrated lives participants collective social sharing may mean emotions elicited event reactivated people actually experienced event emotional event reproduced successive generations actually experience event event represents important memory group following idea collective rituals symbols likened conventional social sharing situations cause reactivation emotions lived people possess inherent ensemble basic beliefs others world etc naïve theories compose symbolic universe ones symbolic universe part socially shared knowledge transmitted principally result education social communication large emphasis process attachment parents impart visions world symbolic universes children symbolic universes guide make sense world composed relatively stable network ideologies therefore one beliefs compromised stability entire network could jeopardized important people maintain sense stability within system beliefs natural psychological motivation try protect beliefs beliefs fundamentally social origin revalidation legitimized social consensus along lines aforementioned social rituals came used structured way resubstantiating beliefs invalidated result emotional primary social sharing emotions involves repeated reproduction individuals report memories episode several different occasions secondary social sharing involves different process recalled information transmitted chain people social sharing originally unclear cognitive aspects likely modified meaningful however memory also affected peoples store relevant prior knowledge thus secondary social sharing emotion people likely process emotional information exposed filter preexisting beliefs views ie symbolic universe people encounter events information fits beliefs events information tend blend thus overlooked hand fit within schemas salient therefore memorized reproduced later recounting event episodes weak emotional intensity process likely limited consequences social knowledge emotion number serial repetitions recounting event usually low strong emotional episodes however reason expect due combination number repeated reproduction related number serial reproductions collective memory emotional event
