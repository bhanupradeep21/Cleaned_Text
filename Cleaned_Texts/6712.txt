examine relationships various spatial abilities better understand abilities relate individual differences anxiety due varied multifaceted nature relationship navigation ability selfreports

standardised measures research helped observe gender dynamic individual group level men selfrate better navigators respect observed females modest responses selfestimate questions spatial navigating wayfinding tasks due spatial abilities considered masculine females therefore tend conform negative stereotypes abilities awareness hinders performance tasks females researchers nori piccardi report however performance highly competent women masculine task predicts better overall wayfinding research carried walkowiak et al across larger crossnational samples suggests impact cultural norms countryspecific stereotypic gender beliefs societal norms cultural variation selfestimates women relatively consistent patterns men women across countries observed countries high low selfratings women men rated high low moreover researchers also observed navigation performance gap men women correlated gender gap index higher performance gap linked higher gender gap also examined selfratings performance gap relation metric found significant positive correlation selfrating performance gap gender inequality index country thus unequal country terms gender gap greater overconfidence males selfestimating performance spatial studies show decline wayfinding attitudes older adults compared younger study made walkowiak et showed asking participants selfrate wayfinding abilities either good good bad bad resemble least part sense direction overestimation amongst oldest male participants rated wayfinding skills better youngest males however despite higher scores selfreported navigation abilities wayfinding performance based tasks using mobile videogame seems getting worse increasing age acrosslifespan studies females selfreported going less using navigation aids maps gps preferring use verbal directions respect males study also examined relationship age sense direction found older people also less likely go reach places also got lost less unfamiliar environments suggests strategy used older people might scared losing ways avoid scenarios might happen concerning gps use researchers also found modest evidence older people well prefer verbal directions navigation aids
