killer activation receptors kars receptors expressed plasmatic membrane natural killer cells nk cells kars work together inhibitory receptors abbreviated kirs text inactivate order regulate nk cells functions hosted transformed cells two kinds specific receptors morphological features common transmembrane proteins similarities specially found extracellular domains differences tend intracellular domains kars kirs tyrosine containing activatory inhibitory motifs intracellular part receptor molecule called itams itims first thought one kar one kir tworeceptor model last decade many different kars kirs discovered opposingsignals model activated cellsurface ligands mica unfortunate confusion kir acronym kir term started used parallelly killercell immunoglobulinlike receptors kirs killer inhibitory receptors killercell immunoglobulinlike receptors involve activatory inhibitory killercell inhibitory receptors involve immunoglobulinlike receptors ctype lectinlike two different kinds surface receptors responsible triggering nkmediated natural cytotoxicity nk kars meaning killer activation receptors nk kirs meaning killer inhibitory receptors receptors broad binding specificity therefore able broadcast opposite signals balance competing signals determines whether cytotoxic activity nk cell get started kars kirs receptors antagonic effects nk cells structural characteristics common firstly usually transmembrane proteins apart extracellular domains proteins tend similar molecular features responsible ligand recognition therefore opposing functions receptors must attributed differences intracellular domains kars proteins possess positively charged transmembrane residues short cytoplasmic tails contain intracellular signaling domains contrast kirs proteins usually long cytoplasmic tails chains form kars able mediate signal transduction isolation common feature receptors presence noncovalently linked subunits contain immunoreceptor tyrosinebased activation motifs itams cytoplasmic tails itams composed conserved sequence amino acids including two tyrxxleuile elements x amino acid separated six eight amino acid residues binding activation ligand activation receptor complex occurs tyrosine residues itams associated chain phosphorylated kinases signal promotes natural cytotoxicity conveyed interior nk cell therefore itams involved facilitation signal transduction subunits moreover composed accessory signaling molecule γc chain one two adaptor proteins called molecules possess negatively charged transmembrane domains common feature members kir presence immunoreceptor tyrosinebased inhibition motifs itims cytoplasmic tails itims composed sequence ilevalleuserxtyrxxleuval x denotes amino acid latter essential signaling functions molecules inhibitory receptor stimulated binding mhc class kinases phosphatases recruited receptor complex itims counteract effect kinases initiated activating receptors manage inhibit signal transduction within nk cell following criterion structure kars found three different groups first group receptors kars included called natural cytotoxicity receptors ncr includes activation receptors two classes natural killer group includes activation inhibition receptors article describe activator role kirs exceptionally inhibitor role three receptors included ncr class crystal structure representative three ncr determined two immunoglobulin domains probable binding site ligand near interdomain hinge two receptors considered important better studied receptor bind homodimeric lectinlike receptor hand consists complex formed protein ctype lectin molecule bonded protein molecule bind five classes b c e h union trigger activation inhibition response depending molecule example inhibitor complex important mention kirs inhibitor function generalized article kirs activator role also exist one activatory kirs iglike structure like kirs general finally low affinity fc receptor fcγriii contains nglycosylation sites therefore glycoprotein killer activation receptors associated signaling intracellular chains fact intracellular domains determine opposite functions activation inhibitory receptors activation receptors associated accessory signaling molecule instance adaptor protein either signaling molecules contain immunoreceptor tyrosinebased activated motifs itams phosphorylated consequently facilitate signal transduction receptors specific ligand although receptors belong class ncr recognize similar molecules mentioned previously natural killer cells discharge function properly two types receptors killer activation receptor kar killer inhibition receptors kirs type receptors act together activate activate natural killer cell following opposingsignals model kars detect specific type molecules mica micb molecules mhc class human cells related cellular stress mica micb appear infected transformed cells arent common healthy cells kars recognise mica micb huge proportion get engaged engagement activates natural killer cell attack transformed infected cells action done different ways nk kill directly hosted cell segregating cytokines ifnβ ifnα things furthermore less common ligands like carbohydrate domains recognised group receptors ctype lectins named calciumdependent carbohydrates recognition domains addition lectins molecules implicated activation nk additional proteins last one works antibodymediated recognition finally group proteins related activation unknown way recapitulate ligands activate nk explained however activation killer inhibition receptors kirs recognize certain molecules mhc class hosted cell get engaged molecules typical healthy cells molecules repressed infected transformed cells reason hosted cell really infected proportion kars engaged ligands bigger proportion kirs engaged mhc molecules happens nk activated hosted cell destroyed hand kirs engaged mhc class molecules kars engaged ligands nk isnt activated suspicious hosted cell remains alive conclude add kar specific kir always work together instance ctype lectins receptors inhibited complex one way nk cells able distinguish normal infected transformed cells monitoring amount mhc class molecules cells surface provided infected tumor cell expression mhc class decreases happens malignant transformations say cancers killer activation receptor kar located surface nk cell binds certain molecules appear cells undergoing stress situations humans kar called molecules recognizes mica micb binding provides signal induces nk cell kill target cell killer inhibitory receptors kirs examine surface tumor cell order determine levels mhc class molecules kirs bind sufficiently mhc class molecules killing signal overridden prevent killing cell contrast kirs sufficiently engaged mhc class molecules killing target cell proceeds httpsenwikipediaorgwikikilleractivationreceptor
