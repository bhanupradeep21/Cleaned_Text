lymphatic vessels lymph vessels lymphatics thinwalled vessels tubes structured like blood vessels carry lymph part lymphatic system lymph vessels complementary cardiovascular system lymph vessels lined endothelial cells thin layer smooth muscle adventitia binds lymph vessels surrounding tissue lymph vessels devoted propulsion lymph lymph capillaries mainly concerned absorption interstitial fluid tissues lymph capillaries slightly bigger counterpart capillaries vascular system lymph vessels carry lymph lymph node called afferent lymph vessels carry lymph node called efferent lymph vessels lymph may travel another lymph node may returned vein may travel larger lymph duct lymph ducts drain lymph one subclavian veins thus return general circulation vessels bring lymph away tissues

vessels contain valves general structure lymphatics based blood vessels inner lining single flattened epithelial cells simple squamous epithelium composed type epithelium called endothelium cells called endothelial cells layer functions mechanically transport fluid since basement membrane rests discontinuous leaks next layer smooth muscles arranged circular fashion around endothelium

smallest vessels lymphatic lymph capillaries lack muscular layer outer adventitia proceed forward course joined capillaries grow larger first take adventitia smooth muscles lymphatic conducting system broadly consists two types initial lymphatics prelymphatics lymph capillaries specialize collection lymph interstital fluid larger lymph vessels propel lymph forward unlike cardiovascular system lymphatic system closed central pump lymph movement occurs despite low pressure due peristalsis propulsion lymph due alternate contraction relaxation smooth muscle valves compression contraction adjacent skeletal muscle arterial lymphatic circulation begins blind ending closed one end highly permeable superficial lymph capillaries formed endothelial cells buttonlike junctions allow fluid pass interstitial pressure sufficiently buttonlike junctions consist protein filaments like platelet endothelial cell adhesion valve system place prevents absorbed lymph leaking back interstital fluid valve system involves collagen fibers attached lymphatic endothelial cells respond increased interstitial fluid pressure separating endothelial cells allowing flow lymph capillary another system semilunar valves prevents backflow lymph along lumen lymph capillaries many interconnections anastomoses form fine rhythmic contraction vessel walls movements may also help draw fluid smallest lymphatic vessels capillaries tissue fluid builds tissue swell called edema circular path bodys system continues fluid transported progressively larger lymphatic vessels culminating right lymphatic
