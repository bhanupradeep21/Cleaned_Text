giraffatitan brancai first named described german paleontologist werner janensch brachiosaurus brancai based several specimens recovered tendaguru known five partial skeletons including three skulls

traditionally distinctive highcrested skull seen characteristic genus brachiosaurus giraffatitan brancai originally referred however possible brachiosaurus altithorax show feature since within traditional brachiosaurus material known tanzanian specimens assigned giraffatitan placement giraffatitan nostrils source much debate witmer describing science hypothesized position fleshy nostrils

wear would result biting tearing plant matter rather purely grinding would result already ripped leaves branches gregory paul noted brachiosaurus brancai popular depictions brachiosaurus based showed significant differences north american brachiosaurus especially proportions trunk vertebrae gracile build paul used differences create subgenus named brachiosaurus giraffatitan brancai george

openings skull long thought located top head past decades scientists theorized animal used nostrils like snorkel spending time submerged water order support great mass current consensus view however giraffatitan fully terrestrial animal studies demonstrated water pressure would prevented animal breathing effectively submerged feet narrow efficient aquatic use furthermore new studies lawrence witmer show nasal openings skull placed high eyes nostrils would still close tip snout study also lends support idea tall crests brachiosaurs supported sort fleshy resonating chamber giraffatitans

fully coldblooded passive bulk endotherm would needed far less food meet daily energy needs scientists proposed large dinosaurs like giraffatitan internal organs giant sauropods probably giraffatitan lived tanzania late jurassic tendaguru since boundary kimmeridgian tithonian dated million years tendaguru ecosystem primarily consisted three types environment shallow lagoonlike marine environments tidal flats low coastal environments vegetated inland environments marine environment existed fair weather wave base behind siliciclastic ooid barriers appeared little change salinity levels experienced tides storms coastal environments consisted brackish coastal lakes ponds pools environments little vegetation probably visited herbivorous dinosaurs mostly droughts well vegetated inlands dominated conifers overall late jurassic tendaguru climate subtropical tropical seasonal rains pronounced dry periods early cretaceous tendaguru became tendaguru beds similar morrison formation north america except marine giraffatitan would coexisted fellow sauropods like dicraeosaurus hansemanni sattleri janenschia africana tendaguria tanzaniensis tornieria africanus ornithischians like
