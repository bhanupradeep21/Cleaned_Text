cuteness type attractiveness commonly associated youth appearance well scientific concept analytical model ethology first introduced austrian ethologist konrad lorenz proposed concept baby schema kindchenschema set facial body features make creature appear cute activate release others motivation care cuteness may ascribed people well things regarded attractive doug jones visiting scholar anthropology cornell university said proportions facial features change age due changes hard tissue soft tissue jones said agerelated changes cause juvenile animals characteristic cute appearance proportionately smaller snouts higher foreheads larger eyes adult counterparts terms hard tissue jones said neurocranium grows lot juveniles bones nose parts skull involved chewing food reach maximum growth later terms soft tissue jones said cartilaginous tissues ears nose continue grow throughout persons lifetime starting age twentyfive eyebrows descend supraorbital rim position supraorbital rim position lateral aspect eyebrows sags age making eyes appear smaller red part lips gets thinner age due loss connective study found faces attractive northern italian caucasian children characteristics babyness larger forehead smaller jaw proportionately larger prominent maxilla wider face flatter face larger anteroposterior facial dimensions northern italian caucasian children used konrad lorenz argued infantile features triggered nurturing responses adults evolutionary adaptation helped ensure adults cared children ultimately securing survival species later scientific studies provided evidence lorenzs theory example shown human adults react positively infants stereotypically cute studies also shown responses facial attractiveness similar across within study conducted stephan hamann emory university found using fmri cute pictures increased brain activity orbital frontal desmond collins extension lecturer archaeology london said lengthened youth period humans part physical anthropologist barry bogin said pattern childrens growth may intentionally increase duration cuteness bogin said human brain reaches adult size body percent complete dental maturation percent complete reproductive maturation percent complete bogin said allometry human growth allows children superficially infantile appearance large skull small face small body sexual underdevelopment longer mammalian species bogin said cute appearance causes nurturing caregiving response older perceived cuteness infant influenced gender behavior koyama et al research female infants seen cute physical attraction female infants display male whereas research karraker demonstrates caregivers attention involvement male infants protection could solely based perception happiness attractiveness gender observer determine perception difference cuteness study sprengelmeyer et al suggested women sensitive small differences cuteness aged men suggests reproductive hormones women important determining finding also demonstrated study conducted r alley undergraduate students consisting men women rate cuteness infants depending different characteristics age behavioral traits physical characteristics head shape facial feature borgi et al stated young children demonstrate preference faces infantile facial arrangement ie rounder face higher forehead bigger eyes smaller nose smaller mouth study used three sixyearold children borgi et al asserted children showed viewing time preference toward eyes high infantile faces dogs cats humans opposed low infantile faces three suggestions hormone levels affect persons perception cuteness konrad lorenz suggests caretaking behaviour affective orientation towards infants innate mechanism triggered cute characteristics chubby cheeks large eyes sprengelmeyer et al study expands claim manipulating baby pictures test groups ability detect differences cuteness studies show premenopausal women detected cuteness better aged postmenopausal women furthermore support claim women taking birth control pills raise levels reproductive hormones detect cuteness better aged women taking sprengelmeyer gathered young women young men older women participate study ran three studies images white european babies shown participants asked rate cuteness scale one seven study found differences among groups cuteness discrimination ruled cohort social influences perceived cuteness second study found premenopausal women discriminated cuteness higher level postmenopausal female peers finding suggested biological factor investigated third study sprengelmeyer compared cuteness sensitivity premenopausal women taking oral contraceptives study concluded postperceptual processes impacted hormone levels progesterone estrogen specifically females thus impacted sensitivity study konrad lorenz early found shape infants head positively correlated adult caregiving increased perception cute however study thomas alley found correlation pointed faulty procedures study alleys study found cephalic head shape infant induce positive response adults children considered cute study alley undergraduate students rate line drawings infants face drawing used time however cephalic head shape changed using cardioidal transformation transformation models cephalic growth relation ageing process adjust perceived age features face changed study concluded large head shape increased perceived cuteness elicited positive response adult caretaking study also noted perceived cuteness also dependent physical behavioural characteristics child including study mccabe children whose ages ranged toddlers teenagers children adultlike facial proportions likely experienced physical abuse children age less adultlike facial study karraker suggested adults beliefs personality expected behavior infant influence adults interaction infant gave evidence way basic cuteness effects may occasionally obscured particular koyama said adult caregivers perception infants cuteness motivate amount care protection caregiver provides admiration demonstrated toward infant concluded adults protective feeling children appeared important criterion judgment boys melanie glocker provided experimental evidence infants cuteness motivates caretaking adults even related glocker asked individuals rate level cuteness pictured infants noted motivation participants care infants research suggested individuals rating perceived cuteness infant corresponded level motivation individual care glocker colleagues used functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri demonstrate baby faces higher content baby schema features generated activation nucleus accumbens small brain area central motivation work elucidated neural mechanism baby schema kindchenschema may motivate release caretaking behavior furthermore cute infants likely adopted rated likeable friendly healthy competent infants less cute implication baby schema response crucial human development lays foundation caregiving relationship child sherman haidt coan two experiments found exposure high cuteness stimuli increased performance playing operation game task requires extreme carefulness study said shift behavior toward greater carefulness consistent viewpoint cuteness something releases human caregiving system study said shift behavior toward greater carefulness also makes sense adaptation caring small doug jones visiting scholar anthropology cornell university said faces monkeys dogs birds even fronts cars made appear cuter morphing cardioidal heartshaped mathematical transformation jones said negative cardioidal strain results faces appearing less mature cuter causing facial features top face expand outward upward causing features bottom face contract inward stephen jay gould said time mickey mouse drawn resemble juvenile relatively larger head larger eyes larger bulging cranium less sloping rounded forehead shorter thicker pudgier legs thicker arms thicker snout gave appearance less protrusive gould suggested change mickeys image intended increase popularity making appear cuter inoffensive gould said neotenous changes mickeys form similar neotenous changes occurred human nancy etcoff phd psychology boston university said cartoonists capitalize innate preferences juvenile features mentioned mickey mouse bambi examples trend said mickey mouses bodily proportions aged reverse since inception eyes head kept getting bigger limbs kept getting shorter thicker culminating resembling human infant mentioned exaggerated high forehead doe eyes bambi another example mark j estren phd psychology university said cute animals get public attention scientific study due physical characteristics would considered neotenous perspective human development estren said humans mindful bias cute animals animals would considered cute also valued addition cute perception cuteness culturally diverse differences across cultures significantly associated need socially
