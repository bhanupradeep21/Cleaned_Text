development years minimise side effects achieve selectivity longer duration action mechanism action well understood facilitated development structure binding site nature binding also well known structure activity relationship agonists developed century valuable class drugs jōkichi takamine isolated hormone adrenalin also known adrenalin first given asthma patients orally little effect metabolized digestive tract deactivated epinephrine first time given subcutaneously discovered positive effect given subcutaneously adrenalin affects whole body giving various side effects thus reducing value treatment inhaled route later tried gave much less adverse effects still inconvenient side effects like fear anxiety restlessness headache dizziness isoproterenol isoprenaline discovered compound similar effect adrenalin fewer side effects found isoproterenol used generally treat asthma patients given sublingually first pressurized metereddose inhaler introduced much convenient patients previously used squeezebulb inhalers pressurized metereddose inhaler technique developed rapidly shown responsible bronchodilation led development selective orciprenaline longer acting found potent isoproterenol orciprenaline catechol structure reason longer action time albuterol salbutamol discovered followed tributalin fenoterol years later albuterol terbutaline gave fewer
