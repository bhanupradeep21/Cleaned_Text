tolerant high potassium levels body often adapts several medications example antibiotic trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole ace inhibitor also lead development significant hyperkalemia electrocardiogram show tall peaked waves often larger r wave degenerate sine wave qrs complex widens immediate initial therapy administration calcium either calcium gluconate calcium chloride stabilizes electrochemical potential cardiac myocytes thereby preventing development fatal arrhythmias however temporizing measure temporizing measures may include nebulized salbutamol intravenous insulin usually given combination glucose sodium bicarbonate temporarily drive potassium interior cells definitive treatment hyperkalemia requires actual excretion potassium either urine facilitated administration loop
