mycotoxin phomoxanthone pxa short toxic natural product affects mitochondria toxic best studied naturally occurring phomoxanthones pxa recently shown induce rapid noncanonical mitochondrial fission causing mitochondrial matrix fragment outer mitochondrial membrane remain intact process shown independent mitochondrial fission fusion regulators phomoxanthones named fungus phomopsis first isolated xanthonoid structure means structures similar compound xanthone pictured left chemically phomoxanthones dimers two tetrahydroxanthones meaning consist two subunits xanthonoids four hydroxy groups two subunits phomoxanthones covalently linked pxa homodimer meaning consists two identical subunits subunits diacetylated tetrahydroxanthones two hydroxy groups replaced acetyl groups position link two dimer subunits structural difference pxa less toxic isomers phomoxanthone b pxb dicerandrol c pxa two xanthonoid monomers symmetrically linked position pxb asymmetrically linked dicerandrol c symmetrically linked otherwise three compounds structurally phomoxanthones structurally closely related secalonic acids another class dimeric tetrahydroxanthone mycotoxins share several properties notably phomoxanthones secalonic acids unstable dissolved polar solvents dmso covalent bond two monomers shifting two phomoxanthones pxa pxb thus slowly isomerise well essentially nontoxic dicerandrol

anticancer drug remained preliminary results study human cancer cells noncancer cells suggested pxa might toxic former latter although results vivo studies yet aside potential medical use recent findings indicate pxa might application research tool study mitochondrial membrane dynamics particularly noncanonical mitochondrial fission remodelling mitochondrial since pxa antibiotic activity organisms diverse bacteria protozoans fungi plants animal cells including human cancer cells affect cellular feature evolutionarily highly conserved recent study shown pxa directly affects mitochondria disrupting biochemical functions membrane mitochondria cellular organelles present almost eukaryotes according theory symbiogenesis derived bacteria share many characteristics including several properties membrane one main functions mitochondria produce cellular energy currency atp process oxidative phosphorylation oxphos oxphos depends mitochondrial membrane potential generated electron transport chain etc via consumption oxygen pxa shown interfere functions mitochondria decrease atp synthesis depolarise mitochondria also inhibits etc cellular oxygen consumption sets apart uncoupling agents protonophores also decrease atp synthesis depolarise mitochondria increase respiration time due increased etc activity attempt restore membrane addition inhibition function mitochondria pxa also disrupts membrane architecture many cell types mitochondria normally form intricate tubular network undergoes constant process balanced mitochondrial fission mitochondrial fusion treatment pxa many mitochondrial stressors protonophores causes excessive fission results mitochondrial fragmentation case pxa however fragmentation process shown different canonical fragmentation
