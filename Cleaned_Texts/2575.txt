computational cognition sometimes referred computational cognitive science computational psychology cognitive simulation study computational basis learning inference mathematical modeling computer simulation behavioral experiments psychology approach develops computational models based experimental results seeks understand basis behind human method processing information early computational cognitive scientists sought bring back create scientific form brentanos two main purposes productions artificial intelligence produce intelligent behaviors regardless quality results model intelligent behaviors found beginning existence need artificial intelligence emulate behavior human cognition economist herbert simon allen newell attempted formalize human problemsolving skills using results psychological studies develop programs implement problemsolving techniques people would works laid foundation symbolic ai computational cognition even advancements cognitive science cognitive field symbolic ai based physical symbol systems hypothesis simon newell states expressing aspects cognitive intelligence achieved manipulation however john mccarthy focused initial purpose artificial intelligence break essence logical abstract reasoning regardless whether human employs next decades progress made artificial intelligence started focused developing logicbased knowledgebased programs veering away original purpose symbolic ai researchers started believe symbolic artificial intelligence might never able imitate intricate processes human cognition like perception learning perceived impossibility since refuted implementing emotion ai seen stumbling block path achieving humanlike cognition researchers began take subsymbolic approach create intelligence without specifically representing knowledge movement led emerging discipline computational modeling connectionism computational contributes understanding human cognition artificial intelligence computational cognitive modeling emerged need define various cognition functionalities like motivation emotion perception representing computational models mechanisms computational models study complex systems use algorithms many variables extensive computational resources produce computer simulation achieved adjusting variables changing one alone even combining together observe effect outcomes results help experimenters make predictions would happen real system similar changes computational models attempt mimic human cognitive functioning details function must known transfer display properly models allowing researchers thoroughly understand test existing theory variables vague variables modifiable consider model memory built atkinson shiffrin showed rehearsal leads longterm memory information rehearsed would stored despite advancement made revealing function memory model fails provide answers crucial questions like much information rehearsed time long take information transfer rehearsal longterm memory similarly computational models raise questions cognition answer making contributions much less significant understanding human cognition cognitive additional shortcoming computational modeling reported lack john anderson adaptive control thoughtrational actr model uses functions computational models findings cognitive science actr model based theory brain consists several modules perform

compared reallife situational results feedback provided backward propagation errors would used improve accuracy networks subsequent second function parallelprocessing stemmed belief knowledge perception limited specific modules rather distributed throughout cognitive networks present parallel distributed processing shown psychological demonstrations like stroop effect brain seems analyzing perception color meaning language however theoretical approach continually disproved two cognitive functions colorperception wordforming operating separately simultaneously parallel field cognition may benefitted use connectionist networks setting neural network models quite tedious task results may less interpretable system trying model therefore results may used evidence broad theory cognition without explaining particular process happening within cognitive function disadvantages connectionism lie research methods employs hypothesis tests proven inaccurate ineffective often taking connectionist models away accurate representation brain functions issues cause neural network models ineffective studying higher forms informationprocessing hinder connectionism advancing general
