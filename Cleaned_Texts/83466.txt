mauriciosaurus shortnecked plesiosaur bearing dropshaped body small tail type specimen mauriciosaurus measures metres ft long metres ft wide however specimen immature judging lack fusion cervical coracoids bearing forward projections interlock clavicles thin bones shoulder hip girdles lack ridge top surface short presence gaps filled extensive cartilage life long bones flippers palate mineralized suggesting specimen still least adult individuals would grown twice length type snout mauriciosaurus round crosssection straightsided bottom jaw even unlike thililua jaw projects downwards level eye side upper jaw mauriciosaurus contain least teeth including premaxilla maxilla teeth shape four times taller wide conical recurved tips smallest tooth back mouth quarter size largest gaps separating teeth slightly wider teeth hard infer much precise arrangement teeth life teeth upper lower jaws probably would interlocking compared polycotylids teeth smaller numerous trinacromerum dolichorhynchops diagnostic characteristics skull mauriciosaurus found palate like polycotylids pterygoid bone mauriciosaurus bears dishlike unlike trinacromerum however depression span entire bottom surface bone instead restricted front portion back bottom surface pterygoid bears prominent ridges arranged uniquely wshape polycotylus similar albeit less complex arrangement like trinacromerum unlike tips processes extending front pterygoids significantly widened three times wide rest process mauriciosaurus twice wide similarly mauriciosaurus trinacromerum bear projections rear quarter pterygoid rounded tubercle mauriciosaurus sharp ridge whereas dolichorhynchops lacks additional trait shared mauriciosaurus trinacromerum involves parasphenoid separates pterygoid midline skull front parasphenoid bifurcated tapers single blunt point pterygoid parasphenoid enclose three holes palate anterior two posterior interpterygoid vacuities anterior interpterygoid vacuity largest holes palate extending roughly tooth positions maxilla like polyoctylids posterior interpterygoid vacuities closed pterygoid however unusually narrow ovalshaped mauriciosaurus whereas wider rounded trinacromerum due concave inner margins pterygoid meanwhile lower jaw splenial contributes bottom surface jaw palmulasaurus mauriciosaurus bore cervical vertebrae least thoracic vertebrae least sacrum tail delineation two types clear since obscured ischium centra mauriciosaurus constricted outer surfaces unlike cylindrical centra cervical thoracic centra lengthwidth ratios cervical centra procoelous concave front convex behind whereas thoracic centra platycoelous surfaces flat sacral caudal centra generally shorter lengthwidth ratios also become narrower last several preserved caudal centra twice long wide first caudal centrum appears opisthocoelous convex front concave behind rest platycoelous flat sides caudal centra articulated one haemal arch back end opposed one end like members cervical vertebrae front half neck bore two pits bottom surfaces separated median ridge ridge abruptly replaced depression twelfth eighteenth vertebrae following ridge present pits present thoracic vertebrae separated one two distinct ridges additional pit present immediately beside blunt keels border sides bottom face neural spines cervical vertebrae become taller inclined seventeenth neural spine tall centrum inclined angle thoracic ribs ninth longest rib size gradually decreasing either side thoracic ribs bear one articular facet third rib unusually facet strongly triangular crosssection probably artifact particularly unusual feature mauriciosaurus gastralia six gastralia made central vshaped medial ossicle various lateral ossicles attached sides second third gastralia share single medial ossicle fifth sixth fourth medial ossicle unusually massive twice thickness medial ossicles gastralia converge single central point feature unprecedented among polycotylids otherwise seen unlikely unusual arrangement product taphonomic processes since gastralia seem preserved alignment arrangement gastralia appear influenced age addition aforementioned forward projections trapezoidal coracoid mauriciosaurus differs dolichorhynchops trinacromerum lacks perforations along midline back may possibly influenced specimens young age unusual entirely absent stage development additionally unlike eopolycotylus surface coracoid mauriciosaurus largely smooth devoid pits front back scapula convex edges concave dorsal scapular process projects upwards outer edge front scapula small ridge probably would supported extension made cartilage within pelvis pubis largest bone third larger ischium six times larger ilium curved unlike rounded shape pubis attributed specimens one traits allies mauriciosaurus polycotyline polycotylids slightly sshaped humerus approximately times long like polycotylids humerus also shorter femur wider bottom end humerus bulge situated behind humeral head contrast eopolycotylus neither humerus femur bears articular facet lower limb unlike primary epipodials radius ulna front flipper tibia fibula hind flipper meet along entire lengths openings wider long traits shared trinacromerum however bones less wide appear roughly flipper bore five digits second fourth longest front flippers fourth longest hind flippers across flippers phalanges third digit lengthwidth ratio similar longer shorter may indicative mauriciosaurus retained primitive pattern long phalanges phalanges digits interlock like polycotylids another trait mauriciosaurus shares polcotylines bears three distal tarsals opposed four second third fused single five different types soft tissue preserved type specimen mauriciosaurus first type consists largely amorphous glossy black material bearing traces fibres wrinkles preserved within body cavity mostly right side torso likely represents heavilypigmented peritoneum would lined inside body cavity life another type tissue consists dark grey thin rectangular structures mm long mm wide organized parallel rows found base neck along flanks torso behind femur hind flipper likely represent scalelike tubercles would covered underside animal junction femur body become larger trapezoidal radially arranged form folding surface meanwhile back edge flippers structures become subcircular enhances flexibility third type tissue thick red amorphous sharply offset surrounding rock likely represents remnants decayed skin subcutaneous tissue thickness preserved tissue may consequence skins retention flexibility death subcutaneous tissue genuinely thick patches tissue also found behind left humerus along back edge right hind flipper suggests flippers bore flexible trailing edge even thicker substance dark red dark grey also found back trunk well bases right hind flipper tail substance crisscrossed series straight furrows divide rectangular trapezoidal segments unknown probably epidermal provenance finally grey glossy amorphous substance forms thick cone surrounding base tail probably represents subcutaneous mauriciosaurus assigned polycotylidae frey et al based characteristics pterygoid mandible humerus phalanges previously described additional characteristics used refer mauriciosaurus polycotylidae included reduced number cervical vertebrae relative plesiosaurs leptocleidia well presence several additional ossifications supporting epipodials within polycotylidae mauriciosaurus assigned clade polycotylinae based lengthwidth ratio humerus lack opening antebrachial foramen radius ulna presence three distal tarsals primary epipodials wider long presence vertebrae within polycotylinae frey et al considered mauriciosaurus morphologically closest dolichorhynchops trinacromerum mauriciosaurus similar dolichorhynchops rounded ends humerus femur meanwhile similar trinacromerum expanded pterygoid rods bifurcated front end relatively longer differs genera wshaped ridges present back bottom surface well possession tooth positions premaxilla addition characteristics others used frey et al diagnose mauriciosaurus new genus included narrow interpterygoid vacuities lack perforations coracoids highly specialized arrangement mauriciosaurus probably pursued small prey due slender snout small pointed soft tissue structures interpreted peritoneum mauriciosaurus would richly pigmented melanocytes living squamates reside deserts high altitudes pigmentation peritoneum protects body cavity solar ultraviolet radiation thereby preventing damage reproductive surfaceswimming plesiosaur mauriciosaurus would frequently exposed solar radiation thus pigmented peritoneum would advantageous particularly early stages life however black peritoneum also found teleost function currently subcutaneous adipose tissue likely responsible streamlining body mauriciosaurus also seen marine mammals presence subcutaneous fat may account thick layers tissue constitute third type preserved soft tissue type specimen tail small neural spines haemal arches transverse processes suggest hypaxial muscles tail weak preserved cone soft tissue around tail thus plausibly represents contour fat served stabilize tail continuing outline torso onto tail manner unlike fattailed geckos forms dropshaped hydrodynamic body outline thickest part body located front third torso tail forming single cohesive inferred soft tissue preserved behind flippers flippers mauriciosaurus heavily muscled bore flexible trailing edge made skin trailing edge allowed flipper form hydrofoil would enhanced locomotion previously hypothesized given immobile body neck stiffened overlapping cervical ribs flippers would source locomotion overall anatomical features mauriciosaurus reminiscent contemporary sea turtles particular body outline leatherback sea turtle dermochelys coriacea strongly resembles mauriciosaurus coriacea swims average velocity kilometres per hour consistent estimates swimming speeds mesozoic marine however mauriciosaurus would capable attaining higher speeds due involving four limbs frey et al hypothesized thick contour fat plesiosaurs mauriciosaurus may account scarcity preserved skin members group death cases rotting putrefaction subcutaneous fat would quickly broken apart relatively thin skin mauriciosaurus however fell back soft soupy watersoaked anoxic sediment temperature conditions allowed subcutaneous fat condense adipocere instead decaying preserved skin top half however exposed portions belly largely decayed prior burial collapsing body cavity turonian vallecillo plattenkalk would part relatively flat ie low relief openocean deep located kilometres mi offshore junction western interior seaway prehistoric gulf mexico mauriciosaurus thus first juvenile polycotylid specimen known preserved shallowwater environment oxygenpoor seafloor would prevented carnivores scavengers substratedwelling animals feeding deposited carcasses explaining quality
