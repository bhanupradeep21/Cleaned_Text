shared archaeopteryx genus early bird transitional older feathered dinosaurs modern birds discovery sinornis scientists know much evolution flight lead modern birds archaeopteryx lived late jurassic period around million years ago lacks many adaptations modern birds flight primitive features found sinornis include moderately recurved manual unguals opposed highrecurved one archaeopteryx sinornis shares similar pelvis latter genus pelvic girdle free elements unlike fused ones found modern birds iliac blades erect ischium bladeshaped rather analogous archaeopteryx older theropod dinosaurs pubis

seemed provide early glimpse flight evolution showing intermediate evolutionary step primitive wings archaeopteryx specialized wings modern modern birds sinornis modified wrist bone groove lets wrist bend sharply back tightly tucking wings flight rest sinornis capable flight similar modern birds based breastbone shoulder structures provided room support bulky aerobic flight also reduced claws small hands stable second finger anchored important flight feathers unlike fused finger bones modern birds sinornis separate finger bones well adapted flight reduction tail moved centre gravity sinornis also capable perching discovered chinese farmer prior fossil sinornis sheds light evolutionary steps transitioned birds strong specialized flyers paul sereno university chicago colleague rao chenggang beijing natural history museum first name describe skeleton find much scientists knew origin birds came archaeopteryx jurassic species confusing mix reptilian birdlike traits sinornis shared many traits modern birds retaining certain basal characteristics archaeopteryx could presented missing link avian fossils discovered sinornis younger archaeopteryx sinornis skeleton complete fossil sinornis originally dated million years seemed show million years archaeopteryx transition modern wing well underway however later research showed layers fossil found fact million years old reducing importance sinornis discovery sinornis older fossils discovered shared even basal features archaeopteryx paul sereno et al considered similar prehistoric bird species formation cathayornis junior

oconnor gareth dyke oconnor dyke concluded despite paper sereno colleagues two birds synonyms fact differ several clear ways including different proportions wing claws digits differences pelvis size holotype skeleton cathayornis sinornis discovered china different regions skeletons small preserved similarly using molds casts facilitate study sinornis complete known enantiornithean time provides
