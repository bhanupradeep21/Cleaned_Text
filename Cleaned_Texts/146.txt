euthanasia solution drugcontaining aqueous solution intentionally ending life either relieve pain suffering execute drugs used euthanasia solution need safe personnel also need rapid onset action minimize possible pain felt humans satisfy requirements active ingredients euthanasia solution usually anaesthetics respiratory depressants cardiotoxic drugs cytotoxic drugs animals euthanasia solutions different routes administration including injection oral absorption immersion depends type animals based anatomical physiological solutions predominantly administered terrestrial animals injection aquatic animals immersion euthanasia solutions approved food drug administration fda commercially available fdaapproved need compounded veterinarians potential hazards humans humans drugs used may differ animals use used execute convicts death row euthanize humans legal circumstances countries lethal injection execution legal drugs essential carrying painless execution unfortunately solutions sometimes abused muscle relaxants drugs relax respiratory muscles mainly diaphragm intercostal muscles ingredients pancuronium bromide pavulon alcuronium bromide alloferin block acetylcholine receptors muscle cells neuromuscular junction prevent respiratory muscles paralyzing muscles animals humans stop breathing eventually lack oxygen also called hypoxia brain death results besides drugs effective reducing suffering objects preventing terminal gasp caused anaesthetics drugs reduce pain felt animals humans euthanasia local anaesthetics involve numbing injected area diminish pain injection euthanasia solution general anaesthetics induce coma objects used together exert effects preventing nerve impulses transmitted cerebrum largest part barbiturates eg pentobarbital sodium thiopental general anaesthetics attach gammaaminobutyric acid gaba receptors lengthen time opening chloride channels nerve depresses activity nerves interrupts nerve signaling moreover since barbiturates depress brains respiratory centre cardiac centre controls breathing heart respectively cause breathing heart stop suddenly known respiratory arrest cardiac sodium channel blockers like benzocaine lidocaine phenytoin tricaine methanesulfonate regularly used produce rapid local anaesthetic effects preventing sodium ions entering nerve cells electrical impulse generated cells surrounding affected area transmit signals heart relies normal levels ion intake blood normal rhythm contraction cardiotoxic drugs act cardiac muscles cease muscle contraction heart fails pump blood body vital organs die lacking oxygen nutrients saturated potassium chloride solution used introduce potassium ions plasma cause cardiac excessive potassium ions blood leads clearance potassium concentration gradient cardiac muscles hence repolarization cardiac muscles hindered subsequent contraction relaxation cardiac muscles since highdose potassium ions alone also lead seizures muscle spasms pain felt euthanized animal therefore potassium chloride solution must injected anaesthetized patients animals sodium hypochlorite formaldehyde applied euthanize killing cells directly sodium hypochlorite disrupts cell processes saponification fatty acids denaturation proteins formaldehyde poses oxidative injury cells inducing crosslinkage genetic materials route administration euthanasia solution varies intravenous administration meaning injection vein commonly used animals owing rapid speed distribute drug brain high whilst alternatives like intraperitoneal injection less irritating larger dose solution required euthanize two commercially available formulations euthanize terrestrial animals phenytoinpentobarbital commercial production ceased united kingdom united states still often used european contains embutramide mebezonium iodide tetracaine despite several merits including fast onset action absence terminal gasps demise injected intravenously common drug combination used veterinarians euthanasia phenytoinpentobarbital commercial product euthasol includes rhodamine b dye fluorescent dye added clearly distinguish solution well propylene glycol ethyl alcohol benzyl alcohol water sodium hydroxide hydrochloric acid needed achieve desired conventional practice combination drug injected intravenously however intravenous injection causes discomfort animal alternative route administration intraperitoneal intracardiac injection active pharmaceutical ingredients euthanasia solutions exert therapeutic effects humans indicated treating diseases instance thiopental pentobarbital barbiturates thiopental used anesthesia epilepsy well intracranial pressure reduction pentobarbital insomnia another drug phenytoin anticonvulsant treating since drugs act mainly brain central nervous system nations using executions different nations adopt varied execution methods one cocktail cocktail proposed medical examiner jay chapman according method anaesthetics would first administered drugs may involve barbiturate eg sodium thiopental midazolam paralyzing agents would injected paralyze body muscles hence neuromuscular blocking agents eg vecuronium bromide would used eventually potassium chloride would used stop heart drugs administered intravenously intravenous administration euthanasia solution similar lethal injection execution belgium barbiturates neuromuscular relaxants increasingly used past two decades combination common nevertheless potassium chloride solution recommended current euthanasia apart intravenous administration euthanasia solution taken orally humans prepared dissolving powder containing euthanasia drugs glass patient difficulty swallowing euthanasia solution delivered via feeding prevent vomiting suffering due unpleasant taste patient given antiemetic drugs drinking euthanasia solution besides palatable drinks chocolate fruit juice also given patient although ingredients euthanasia solution useful euthanasia aquatic animals approved fda common practice aquatic animals euthanized immersion tailormade euthanasia solution dissolved active ingredients absorbed fish ingestion skin penetration exerting concentration active ingredients water quality water tank considered choosing appropriate euthanasia drugs compounding immersion formulation immersion solution varies age species fish example bleach used kill embryos zebrafish painlessly whilst lethal doses anaesthetics ethanol eugenol applied immersion solution adult doubts regarding method reliability drug potency qualification execution personnel first foremost allegedly cocktail tested efficacy reliability painful failed death reported raises concerns drugs secondly effect chosen anaesthetic may shortlasting person executed may experience fierce sensation heartburning prior nonetheless effect paralyzing agent prevents convict expressing feeling lawsuits filed use sodium thiopental paralyzing agents thirdly manual errors untrained execution personnel catastrophic person awareness aroused regarding qualification personnel involved carrying painless execution recently usa beset shortage drugs execution firstly european firms stopped supplying thiopental hence hospira manufacturer thiopental products us halted commercial drug authorities proposed using despite pentobarbital normally used execution reliability considered higher owing longerlasting anesthetic effect secondly pentobarbital supply also limited european company lundbeck ceased selling pentobarbital usa since unable import pentobarbital authority requested local pharmacies institutions manufacture yet quality local products may guaranteed revealed reports products might contaminated potent decreased availability pentobarbital carrying animal euthanasia becomes challenge fda promised subsidize pentobarbital products vets looking replacement administer ketamine xylazine propofol via intravenous injection anesthetic inhalation isoflurane sevoflurane pentobarbital overdose common abusing euthanasia solution generally patients purchased pentobarbitalcontaining commercial products euthasol nembutal online stores intentionally ingested lethal dose mostly patients would collapse fall coma within minutes hour breathing stopped cardiac arrest medical treatment average concentration pentobarbital accounting death cases estimated mgl patients serum concentration higher average early cpr medical intervention death prevented full recovery made possible section lists regulations regarding drug purchase
