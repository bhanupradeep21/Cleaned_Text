genetics dominance phenomenon one variant allele gene chromosome masking overriding effect different variant gene copy first variant termed dominant second called recessive state two different variants gene chromosome originally caused mutation one genes either new de novo inherited terms autosomal dominant autosomal recessive used describe gene variants nonsex chromosomes autosomes associated traits sex chromosomes allosomes termed xlinked dominant xlinked recessive ylinked inheritance presentation pattern depends sex parent child see sex linkage since one copy chromosome ylinked traits dominant recessive additionally forms dominance incomplete dominance gene variant partial effect compared present chromosomes codominance different variants chromosome show associated traits dominance key concept mendelian inheritance classical genetics letters punnett squares used demonstrate principles dominance teaching use uppercase letters dominant alleles lowercase letters recessive alleles widely followed convention classic example dominance inheritance seed shape peas peas may round associated allele r wrinkled associated allele r case three combinations alleles genotypes possible rr rr rr rr homozygous individuals round peas rr homozygous individuals wrinkled peas rr heterozygous individuals r allele masks presence r allele individuals also round peas thus allele r dominant allele r allele r recessive allele r dominance inherent allele traits phenotype strictly relative effect two alleles given gene function one allele dominant second allele gene recessive third codominant fourth additionally one allele may dominant one trait others dominance differs epistasis phenomenon allele one gene masking effect alleles different gregor johann mendel father genetics promulgated idea however widely known early twentieth century mendel observed variety traits garden peas appearance seeds seed pods plants two discrete phenotypes round versus wrinkled seeds yellow versus green seeds red versus white flowers tall versus short plants bred separately plants always produced phenotypes generation generation however lines different phenotypes crossed interbred one one parental phenotypes showed offspring green round red tall however hybrid plants crossed offspring plants showed two original phenotypes characteristic ratio common phenotype parental hybrid plants mendel reasoned parent first cross homozygote different alleles one parent aa parent aa contributed one allele offspring result hybrids heterozygotes aa one two alleles hybrid cross dominated expression masked final cross two heterozygotes aa x aa would produce aa aa aa offspring genotype ratio first two classes showing phenotype last showing phenotype thereby producing phenotype ratio mendel use terms gene allele phenotype genotype homozygote heterozygote introduced later introduce notation capital lowercase letters dominant recessive alleles respectively still use today british population geneticist ronald fisher proposed dominance acted based natural selection contribution modifier genes american geneticist sewall wright responded stating dominance simply physiological consequence metabolic pathways relative necessity gene animals plants paired chromosomes described diploid two versions chromosome one contributed mothers ovum fathers sperm known gametes described haploid created meiosis gametes fuse fertilization sexual reproduction new single cell zygote divides multiple times resulting new organism number pairs chromosomes nongamete cell parents mammalian genetics autosomal dominant disorders pedigrees demonstrate vertical pattern inheritance chromosome matching homologous pair structurally similar similar dna sequence loci singular locus dna chromosome functions series discrete genes influence various traits thus gene also corresponding homologue may exist different versions called alleles alleles locus two homologous chromosomes may identical different example blood type humans determined abo gene encodes variants enzyme creates b ab blood type located long q arm chromosome nine three different alleles could present locus two present individual one inherited mother one two alleles given gene identical organism called homozygote said homozygous respect gene instead two alleles different organism heterozygote heterozygous genetic makeup organism either single locus genes collectively called genotype genotype organism directly indirectly affects molecular physical traits individually collectively called phenotype heterozygous gene loci two alleles interact produce phenotypecitation needed complete dominance effect one allele heterozygous genotype completely masks effect allele masks considered dominant allele masked allele considered complete dominance heterozygotes phenotype indistinguishable dominant homozygotes phenotype classic example complete dominance inheritance seed shape pea shape peas peas may round associated allele r wrinkled associated allele r case three combinations alleles genotypes possible rr rr rr rr rr homozygous rr heterozygous rr individuals round peas rr individuals wrinkled peas rr individuals r allele masks presence r allele individuals also round peas thus allele r completely dominant allele r allele r recessive allele r incomplete dominance also called partial dominance semidominance intermediate inheritance occasionally incorrectly codominance reptile occurs phenotype heterozygous genotype distinct often intermediate phenotypes homozygous genotypes phenotypic result often appears blended form characteristics heterozygous state example snapdragon flower color homozygous either red white red homozygous flower paired white homozygous flower result yields pink snapdragon flower pink snapdragon result incomplete dominance similar type incomplete dominance found four oclock plant wherein pink color produced truebred parents white red flowers crossed quantitative genetics phenotypes measured treated numerically heterozygotes phenotype exactly numerically two homozygotes phenotype said exhibit dominance ie

locus betaglobin component hemoglobin three molecular phenotypes hbahba hbahbs hbshbs distinguishable protein electrophoresis medical condition produced heterozygous genotype called sicklecell trait milder condition distinguishable sicklecell anemia thus alleles show incomplete dominance respect anemia see gene loci molecular level alleles expressed codominantly transcribed rna codominance allelic products coexist phenotype different incomplete dominance quantitative interaction allele products produces intermediate phenotype example codominance red homozygous flower white homozygous
