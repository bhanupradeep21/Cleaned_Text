gene set enrichment analysis gsea also called functional enrichment analysis pathway enrichment analysis method identify classes genes proteins overrepresented large set genes proteins may association different phenotypes eg different organism growth patterns diseases method uses statistical approaches identify significantly enriched depleted groups genes transcriptomics technologies proteomics results often identify thousands genes used researchers performing highthroughput experiments yield sets genes example genes differentially expressed different conditions often want retrieve functional profile gene set order better understand underlying biological processes done comparing input gene set bins terms gene ontology statistical test performed bin see enriched input genes completion human genome project problem interpret analyze remained order seek genes associated diseases dna microarrays used measure amount gene expression different cells microarrays thousands different genes carried comparisons results two different cell categories eg normal cells versus cancerous cells however method comparison sensitive enough detect subtle differences expression individual genes diseases typically involve entire groups multiple genes linked single biological pathway additive change expression within gene sets leads difference phenotypic expression gene set
