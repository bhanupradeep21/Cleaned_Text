musculoskeletal injury refers damage muscular skeletal systems usually due strenuous activity includes damage skeletal muscles bones tendons joints ligaments affected soft one study roughly approximately adults received musculoskeletal injury sort within musculoskeletal injury spans large variety medical specialties including orthopedic surgery diseases arthritis requiring surgery sports emergency medicine acute presentations joint muscular pain rheumatology rheumatological diseases affect joints rheumatoid arthritis musculoskeletal injuries affect part human body including bones joints cartilages ligaments tendons muscles soft symptoms include mild severe aches low back pain numbness tingling atrophy injuries result repetitive motions actions period tendons connect muscle bone whereas ligaments connect bone tendons ligaments play active role maintain joint stability controls limits joint movements injured tendons ligaments detrimentally impact motor continuous exercise movement musculoskeletal injury result chronic inflammation progression permanent damage many cases healing period musculoskeletal injury period healing area completely immobile castinduced muscle atrophy occur routine sessions physiotherapy cast removed help return strength limp muscles tendons alternately exist different methods electrical stimulation immobile muscles induced device placed underneath cast helping prevent preventative measures include correcting modifying ones postures avoiding awkward abrupt beneficial rest post injury prevent aggravation three stages progressing musculoskeletal injury cause disability first stage arises injury whether overexertion fatigue muscle second stage involves individuals ability detrimentally affected disability affects physical cognitive functions final stage decision individuals decision return work post recovery musculoskeletal injuries compromise movement physical ability ultimately degrades ones professional injury described mechanical disruption tissues resulting despite fact tissues selfrepair muscle degradation occurs repeated prolonged overuse strain injuries occur work physical activity daily repetitive motions strain musculoskeletal systems continued improper form result chronic inflammation progression permanent injuries compromise individuals posture physical abilities including fine motor nerves play important role repetitive strain injuries nerves get pulled injured soft tissues ultimately affecting motor pressure nerve impair blood flow impair either distal proximal points first injury cause tendons connect muscle bone whereas ligaments connect bone tendons ligaments play active role maintain joint stability controls limits joint movements injured tendons ligaments detrimentally impact motor injuries associated repetitiveuse activities include tennis elbow tendonitis wrist injuries myelopathy low back injuries lower leg ankle repetitive use injuries result rapid continuous movements long duration postures without adequate excessive muscle use results fatigue limits movement acute injury traced back specific incident causing immediate pain often hand chronic injury distinct origin develops slowly persistent long lasting accompanied dull pain aches shoulder joint allows arm poor posture lead nerve repetitive shoulder movements overhead swinging throwing circling movement cause musculoskeletal cases result spinal cord damage levels producing myelopathy dramatically compromise overall movements arm legs well fine motor injury rotator cuff result trauma old age complete partial tears frequent older patients caused degeneration wrist mobility often restricted due inflammation forearm muscles contract tighten due wrist dislocations occur capitate carpal fractures caused falling outstretched hand wrist hyperextended ulnar deviation component swelling median nerve tissue leads nerve entrapment ultimately resulting restriction movement symptoms include pain numbness dequervains tenosynovitis form tendinitis muscles move leg pain transferred pain backs foot injuries including plantar fasciitis another source pain associated withstanding long three major tendons maintain stability ankle joint anterior extensors medial flexors lateral peroneal tendons facilitate movement around ankle foot malleolar fractures related ankle twisting shearing injury fractures often associated ligament ankle sprain lead spectrum soft tissue impingement reducing motion spinal column five sections consisting thirty three individual vertebrae separated cushioning discs upper three sections movable lower two nerve compression result poor posture prolonged computer use example repetitive strain injury affects musculoskeletal whiplash injury whereby force causes strain capsule ligaments apophyseal joints cervical hyperflexion common mechanism injury cervical spine associated anterior compression vector posterior distraction injuries associated diving injuries falls car anterior compression vector results mild height loss whereas hyperextension often occurs posterior displacement head car severe hyperextension injury leads pinching spinal cord along posterior margin upper arm forearm meet form elbow examples injuries affected elbow include carpal tunnel syndrome radial tunnel syndrome tennis elbow due tendon ligament damage overuse distal humeral fractures related high energy trauma falling height motor vehicle accident results stiffness restricted range elbow dislocation radial head neck fractures common one falls outstretched elbow dislocations divided two categories simple complex simple dislocations defined soft tissue injury whereas complex involves preventing injuries workers essential maintain effective organisational repetitive injuries prevented early medical intervention effective way prevent permanent injuries prevented understanding proper body correcting ones postures avoiding abrupt awkward movements avoid acute taking breaks change position moving instead remaining static also reduce risk daily body stretches help elevate pain hamstrings back creating healthy awareness social media celebrities allow individuals create healthy practices ultimately prevent essential work environment comply safety standards workplaces upper management implement safety precautions making health safety primary implementation company policies procedures case serious incident strategies substances abuse programs effective reducing potential musculoskeletal injuries prevented develop become heat cold used facilitate healing process applied immediately acute injury overuse strain reduce pain healthy workspace also substantially important including floor surfaces ergonomic seating working heights working rates task understanding symptoms repetitive strain injuries numbness arms hands legs aches pains joints shoulder back pain tingling burning arms legs feet allow individual selfdiagnose seek medical attention prevent pain bodys natural way alert individual important rest ignored lead problems crucial aggravate injury compromise ones physical movement detrimentally impact general sustaining secondary injury large risk whilst recovering initial injuries often limit physical activity result immobilisation significant factor symptoms vary numbness tingling atrophy weakness ultimately lead permanent damage neural injury recovery acute strokes compensated help medical repeating motions actions whilst performing activity increases individuals risk accumulating acute musculoskeletal injuries factors affect sustaining injuries include duration activity force required complete activity environment workplace work although specially advised exercises stretching promotes blood circulation increase range motion ultimately help decrease muscle immune system natural mechanism manages injuries musculoskeletal system inflammation redness swollen tissue part healing process process new cells generated form new macronutrients essential components tissue proteins carbohydrates fats crucial new muscle tissues water allows biochemical processes take place including elimination waste toxins via sweat hand micro nutrients include vitamins minerals enzymes protect cells dna oxidation damages evident inflammation response recovery recovery enhanced activities make
