vertebrates thoracic vertebrae compose middle segment vertebral column cervical vertebrae lumbar humans twelve thoracic vertebrae intermediate size cervical lumbar vertebrae increase size going towards lumbar vertebrae lower ones much larger uppercitation needed distinguished presence facets sides bodies articulation heads ribs well facets transverse processes except eleventh twelfth articulation tubercles ribs convention human thoracic vertebrae numbered first one located closest skull others going spine toward lumbar region general characteristics second eighth thoracic vertebrae first ninth twelfth vertebrae contain certain peculiarities detailed bodies middle thoracic region heartshaped broad anteroposterior transverse direction ends thoracic region resemble respectively cervical lumbar vertebrae slightly thicker behind front flat convex side side front deeply concave behind slightly constricted laterally front present either side two costal demifacets one near root pedicle front inferior vertebral notch covered cartilage fresh state vertebrae articulated one another form intervening intervertebral fibrocartilages oval surfaces reception heads ribs pedicles directed backward slightly upward inferior vertebral notches large size deeper region vertebral column laminae broad thick imbricated say overlap subjacent vertebrae like tiles roof connect pedicles surround protect spinal cord intervertebral foramen small circular two intervertebral level one right one left exiting nerve roots vertebral foramen large opening posterior vertebral body also known spinal canal contains protects spinal cord thoracic level spinous process long triangular coronal section directed obliquely downward arising lamina ending tuberculated extremity processes overlap fifth eighth less oblique direction superior articular processes thin plates bone projecting upward junctions pedicles laminae articular facets practically flat directed backward little lateralward upward inferior articular processes fused considerable extent laminae project slightly beyond lower borders facets directed forward little medialward downward transverse processes arise arch behind superior articular processes pedicles thick strong considerable length directed obliquely backward lateralward ends clubbed extremity front small concave surface articulation tubercle rib first thoracic vertebra either side body entire articular facet head first rib demifacet upper half head second rib body like cervical vertebra broad concave lipped either side superior articular surfaces directed upward backward spinous process thick long almost horizontal transverse processes long upper vertebral notches deeper thoracic vertebrae thoracic spinal nerve passes underneath thoracic spinal nerve passes underneath second thoracic vertebra larger first thoracic vertebra thoracic spinal nerve passes underneath fourth thoracic vertebra together fifth level sternal angle thoracic spinal nerve passes underneath fifth thoracic vertebra together fourth level sternal angle human trachea divides two main bronchi level thoracic vertebra may also end higher lower depending breathing thoracic spinal nerve passes underneath thoracic spinal nerve passes underneath thoracic spinal nerve passes underneath eighth thoracic vertebra together ninth thoracic vertebra level xiphisternum thoracic spinal nerve passes underneath ninth thoracic vertebra may demifacets subjects however two demifacets either side occurs tenth doesnt facets demifacets upper part thoracic spinal nerve passes underneath xiphisternum xiphoid process sternum level axial plane tenth thoracic vertebra entire articular facet demifacet either side placed partly lateral surface pedicle doesnt kind facet following ribs one facet heads thoracic spinal nerve passes underneath eleventh thoracic vertebra body approaches form size lumbar vertebrae articular facets heads ribs medium size placed chiefly pedicles thicker stronger next vertebra part thoracic region spinous process short nearly horizontal direction transverse processes short tuberculated extremities articular facets thoracic spinal nerve passes underneath twelfth thoracic vertebra general characteristics eleventh may distinguished inferior articular surfaces convex directed lateralward like lumbar vertebrae general form body laminae spinous process resembles lumbar vertebrae transverse process subdivided three elevations superior inferior lateral tubercles superior inferior correspond mammillary accessory processes lumbar vertebrae traces similar elevations found transverse processes tenth eleventh thoracic vertebrae thoracic spinal nerve passes underneath animals number thoracic vertebrae vary example marsupials koalas common among mammals horses tapirs rhinoceroses elephants extremes mammals marked certain sloths cetaceans position thoracic vertebrae animation left bones around thoracic vertebrae
