double fertilization complex fertilization mechanism flowering plants angiosperms process involves joining female gametophyte megagametophyte also called embryo sac two male gametes sperm begins pollen grain adheres stigma carpel female reproductive structure flower pollen grain takes moisture begins germinate forming pollen tube extends toward ovary style tip pollen tube enters ovary penetrates micropyle opening ovule pollen tube proceeds release two sperm embryo sac cells embryo sac unfertilized ovule number arranged form top bottom ie antipodal cells polar central cells synergids egg cell one sperm fertilizes egg cell sperm combines two polar nuclei large central cell megagametophyte haploid sperm haploid egg combine form diploid zygote process called syngamy sperm two haploid polar nuclei large central cell megagametophyte form triploid nucleus triple fusion plants may form polyploid nuclei large cell gametophyte develop endosperm nutrientrich tissue provides nourishment developing embryo ovary surrounding ovules develops fruit protects seeds may function disperse two central cell maternal nuclei polar nuclei contribute endosperm arise mitosis single meiotic product gave rise egg maternal contribution genetic constitution triploid endosperm double sperm study conducted plant arabidopsis thaliana migration male nuclei inside female gamete fusion female nuclei documented first time using vivo imaging genes involved migration fusion process also evidence double fertilization gnetales nonflowering seed plants double fertilization discovered century ago sergei nawaschin l√©on guignard france made discovery independently lilium martagon fritillaria tenella used first observations double fertilization made using classical light microscope due limitations light microscope many unanswered questions regarding process double fertilization however development electron microscope many questions answered notably observations made group w jensen showed male gametes cell walls plasma membrane gametes close plasma membrane cell surrounds inside pollen far rudimentary form double fertilization occurs sexual reproduction order gymnosperms commonly known specifically event documented ephedra gnetum subset ephedra nevadensis single binucleate sperm cell deposited egg cell following initial fertilization event second sperm nucleus diverted fertilize additional egg nucleus found egg cytoplasm seed plants second ventral canal nucleus normally found functionally gnetum gnemon numerous free egg nuclei exist female cytoplasm inside female gametophyte succeeding penetration mature female gametophyte pollen tube female cytoplasm free nuclei move surround pollen tube released binucleate sperm cell two sperm nuclei join free egg nuclei produce two viable zygotes homologous characteristic families ephedra families second fertilization event produces additional diploid embryo supernumerary embryo later aborted leading synthesis one mature additional fertilization product ephedra nourish primary embryo female gametophyte responsible nutrient primitive process double fertilization gymnosperms results two diploid nuclei enclosed egg cell differs angiosperm condition results separation egg cell comparative molecular research genome g gnemon revealed gnetophytes closely related conifers rejection anthophyte hypothesis identifies gnetales angiosperms sister taxa leads speculation process double fertilization product convergent evolution arose independently among gnetophytes vitro double fertilization often used study molecular interactions well aspects gamete fusion flowering plants one major obstacles developing vitro double fertilization male female gametes confinement sperm pollen tube egg embryo sac controlled fusion egg sperm already achieved poppy pollen germination pollen tube entry double fertilization processes observed proceed normally fact technique already used obtain seeds various flowering plants named testtube fertilization female gametophyte megagametophyte participates double fertilization angiosperms haploid called embryo sac develops within ovule enclosed ovary base carpel surrounding megagametophyte one two integuments form opening called micropyle megagametophyte usually haploid originates usually diploid megaspore mother cell also called megasporocyte next sequence events varies depending particular species species following events occur megasporocyte undergoes meiotic cell division producing four haploid megaspores one four resulting megaspores survives megaspore undergoes three rounds mitotic division resulting eight cells eight haploid nuclei central cell two nuclei called polar nuclei lower end embryo sac consists haploid egg cell positioned middle two haploid cells called synergids synergids function attraction guidance pollen tube megagametophyte micropyle upper end megagametophyte three antipodal cells male gametophytes microgametophytes participate double fertilization contained within pollen grains develop within microsporangia pollen sacs anthers stamens microsporangium contains diploid microspore mother cells microsporocytes microsporocyte undergoes meiosis forming four haploid microspores eventually develop pollen grain microspore undergoes mitosis cytokinesis order produce two separate cells generative cell tube cell two cells addition spore wall make immature pollen grain male gametophyte matures generative cell passes tube cell generative cell undergoes mitosis producing two sperm cells pollen grain matured anthers break open releasing pollen pollen carried pistil another flower wind animal pollinators deposited stigma pollen grain germinates tube cell produces pollen tube elongates extends long style carpel ovary sperm cells released megagametophyte double fertilization proceeds httpsenwikipediaorgwikidoublefertilization
