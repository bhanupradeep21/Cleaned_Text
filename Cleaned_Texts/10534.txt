typically follows benign clinical course viral meningitis evidence bacteria present cerebral spinal fluid csf therefore lumbar puncture csf analysis often needed identify cases specific treatment

meningitis typically acquired sick contacts however cases people infected viruses may cause meningitis actually develop viruses cause meningitis viral meningitis mostly caused infectious agent colonized somewhere people already immunocompromised state highest risk pathogen common examples immunocompromised individuals include hiv cancer diabetes malnutrition certain genetic disorders patients potential sites include skin respiratory tract gastrointestinal tract nasopharynx genitourinary tract organism invades submucosa sites invading host defenses local immunity physical barriers phagocytes pathogen invasion immune system infectious agent enter central nervous system cause meningeal disease via invading bloodstream retrograde neuronal pathway direct contiguous immune cells damaged endothelial cells release matrix metalloproteinases mmps cytokines nitric oxide mmps induce vasodilation cerebral vasculature cytokines induce capillary wall changes blood brain barrier leads expression leukocyte receptors thus increasing white blood cell binding barrier meninges create brain bloodstream normally protect brain bodys immune system damage meninges endothelial cells increases cytotoxic reactive oxygen species production damages pathogens well nearby meningitis barrier disrupted viruses entered brain isolated immune system leads elevated intracranial pressure cerebral edema meningeal irritation neuronal diagnosis viral meningitis made clinical history physical exam several diagnostic kernig brudzinski signs may elucidated specific physical exam maneuvers help diagnose meningitis importantly however cerebrospinal fluid csf collected via lumbar puncture also known spinal tap fluid normally surrounds brain spinal cord analyzed signs csf findings suggest viral cause meningitis include elevated white blood cell count usually cellsÂµl lymphocytic predominance combination normal glucose increasingly cerebrospinal fluid pcr tests become especially useful diagnosing viral meningitis estimated sensitivity additionally samples stool urine blood throat also help identify viral csf vs serum creactive protein procalcitonin shown elucidate whether meningitis bacterial
