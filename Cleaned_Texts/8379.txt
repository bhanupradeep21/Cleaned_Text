caused genetic mutation human chromosome contains two nearly identical genes location telomeric copy centromeric copy healthy individuals gene codes survival motor neuron protein smn name says plays crucial role survival motor neurons gene hand due variation single nucleotide undergoes alternative splicing junction intron exon transcripts coding fully functional survival motor neuron protein smnfl transcripts resulting truncated protein compound rapidly degraded individuals affected sma gene mutated way unable correctly code smn protein due either occurring exon point mutations frequently resulting functional conversion sequence almost people however least one functional copy gene still codes usual level smn protein allowing neurons survive long run however reduced availability smn protein results gradual death motor neuron cells anterior horn spinal cord brain skeletal muscles depend motor neurons neural input decreased innervation also called denervation therefore decreased input central nervous system cns decreased impulse transmission motor neurons leads decreased contractile activity denervated muscle consequently denervated muscles undergo progressive atrophy waste

respiratory system common system affected complications leading cause death sma types sma type similar respiratory problems complications arise due weakened intercostal muscles lack stimulation nerve

identified several therapeutic approaches proposed investigated primarily focus increasing availability smn protein motor main research directions follows gene therapy sma aims restoring gene function inserting specially crafted nucleotide sequence transgene cell nucleus using viral vector approach exploited first approved gene therapy sma based treatment onasemnogene approach aims modifying alternative splicing gene force code higher percentage fulllength smn protein sometimes also called gene conversion attempts convert gene functionally gene therapeutic mechanism approved medications
