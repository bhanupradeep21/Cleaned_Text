semen quality measure male fertility measure ability sperm semen accomplish fertilization semen quality involves sperm quantity quality semen quality major factor fertility cryptorchidism hypospadias testicular cancer poor semen quality make syndrome known testicular dysgenesis syndrome many factors influence sperm quality exposure temporary factors cause threemonth delay sperm quality returns normal due spermiogenesis review metaanalysis found sperm counts among western men ie men australia europe new zealand north america declined average decline per year metaanalysis found indication decline leveling amount decline among men north america men australiaeurope similar decline sperm count among men south america asia africa less men western countries though amount decline regions uncertain reasons decline known certainty may associated chemical exposure maternal smoking prenatal development pesticide exposure lifestyle changes although possible men father children old age genetic quality sperm well volume motility typically decrease advancing paternal age implicated number possible health effects one particularly wellstudied connection link advancing age autism example one study children less years found confounding variables controlled risk autism increased increasing paternal men normal level sperm production normozoospermia percentage sperm dna fragmentation positively correlated age inversely correlated progressive sperm age related effects sperm noted separate control groups recruited different geographical locations indicating dietary habits lifestyle ethnicity could play part quality sperm advanced age possible factor sperm motility health sperm men years age likewise linked increase birth defects neural tube defects hypospadias cystic kidney sperm heatsensitive endure high temperatures increases associated increased dna body compensatory mechanisms like cremaster muscle relaxing letting testicle hang away warm body sweating countercurrent exchange blood cooling inflowing blood however despite compensations activities performed often order prevent infertility due heat fever raises body temperature strike sperm quality contrary widely held beliefs evidence supports wearing tight underpants decreases fertility even elevation temperature caused wearing constrictive underwear changes sperm parameters decrease spermatogenesis changes sperm function discuss blow outside affect sperm quality already produced sperm cells furthermore testes well protected scrotum example tunica vaginalis making testes slide away external pressure rather malformed however hard enough hit close crush capillaries supply sperm producing tissue resulting permanent temporary partial total inability produce sperm affected testicle suspicion many toxic substances including several types medication hormones also constituents diet influence sperm quality chemicals known effects fertility excluded human consumption know others remain undiscovered many products come direct contact spermatozoa lack adequate testing adverse effect semen endocrine disruptors chemicals interfere endocrine hormone system report demonstrated evidence effects

dibromochloropropane dbcp caused sterility soldiers exposed dioxins dioxinlike compounds vietnam war given rise children increased rate birth phthalates ubiquitous pollutant may cause decreased sperm production exposed prenatal potential xenoestrogens associated decreased sperm quality studies bisphenol nonylphenol addition vitro studies observed altered sperm function following medications also numerous products intended exposure spermatozoa general assumption safety based absence evidence actual body also natural variations hormone concentrations giving sperm quality natural fluctuations wellcitation needed environmental mutagens associated decreased semen quality include following environmental agents associated decreased semen quality include long man abstained prior providing semen sample correlates results semen analysis also success rates assisted reproductive technology art short period time since last ejaculation long one reduce semen quality period time less one day reduces sperm count least longer periods abstinence correlate poorer study found couples man abstained days intrauterine insemination iui pregnancy rate abstinence period days produce highest pregnancy rates per iui cycle compared longer intervals ejaculatory increase pregnancy rate occurs despite lower value total motile daily sexual activity increases sperm quality men minimizing dna damage speculated result less storage time damage may semen samples obtained via sexual intercourse contain sperm sperm slightly motility slightly morphology compared semen samples obtained via masturbation sexual intercourse also generates increase ejaculate volume mainly increased secretion intercourse advantage even greater men however single factor factors intercourse advantage yet isolated explained presence visual perception physical attractiveness alone although may slight neither substantial fluctuations sex hormones explain intercourse hypothesized sexual intercourse subdues inhibition central nervous turn subduing factor still completely known sperm quality higher sample collected home collecting sperm home gives higher sperm concentration sperm count motility particularly sperm collected via sexual semen sample collected masturbation specimen early stages ejaculate clean unused sealed collection cup semen ejaculated quality deteriorates time however lifetime shortened prolonged depending environmentcitation needed sperm outside body generally life expectancy considered depend ph temperature presence air factors unpredictable smaller life expectancy inside human bodycitation needed instance sperm donors collect sample outside clinic advised handed sample one hour collection keep body temperature least room nonharmful environment outside body sterile glass number motile sperm decreases approximately per hour contrast latex condom quality decreases per hour rendering sample unusable relatively short time environment uterus fallopian tubes advantageous pregnancy resulting sperm life eight days tobacco smoking lowers sperm perhaps decreased ability attach hyaluronan egg wright et reviewed evidence smoking associated increased sperm dna damage male infertility smoking cannabis decrease sperm longterm stress also suggested practise tucking reduce sperm count sperm metaanalysis indicates mobile phone exposure affects sperm quality regarding diet malnutrition unhealthy diet lead eg zinc deficiency lowering sperm quality sperm quality better afternoon adrenalinelevels higher awakening may contribute similarly general stress lack exercise well excessive exercise minor factors professional sports semen quality parameters tend decrease training requirements increase effect differs substantially different professional sport types example water polo appears substantially less harmful semen quality longer duration sexual stimulation ejaculation slightly increases sperm males carrying robertsonian translocations chromosomes significantly higher degree sperm cell apoptosis lower concentration sperm cells also decreased forward motility normal testicular cancer leydig cell tumours sertoli cell tumours also associated reduced sperm count semen analysis typically measures number sperm per millilitre ejaculate analyzes morphology shape motility ability swim forward sperm typical ejaculate healthy physically mature young adult male reproductive age fertilityrelated problems usually contains million spermatozoa though couple hundred survive acidic environment vagina candidates successful fertilization also usually measured concentration white blood cells level fructose semen volume ph liquefaction time mans sperm mixed hamster eggs zona pellucida outer membranes removed number sperm penetrations per egg strong correlation found hamster egg penetration rates various semen parameters role hamster egg penetration test investigation causes infertility evaluated however negative result hamster test correlates lower probability mans partner becoming presence antisperm antibodies may responsible sperm agglutination reduced sperm motility abnormal postcoital test several tests presently available including
