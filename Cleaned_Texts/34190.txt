enhancements include embryo selection preimplantation genetic diagnosis cytoplasmictransfer vitrogenerated gametes physical enhancements include cosmetics plastic surgery orthodontics druginduced

means substances called nootropics potentially benefit individuals cognitive decline many different disorders may also capable yielding results cognitively healthy persons generally speaking nootropics said effective enhancing focus learning memory function mood cases physical brain development examples include huperzine bacopa uridine monophosphate rhodiola rosea pycnogenol forms dietary
