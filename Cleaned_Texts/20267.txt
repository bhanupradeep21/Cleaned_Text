invasive cribriform carcinoma breast iccb also termed invasive cribriform carcinoma rare type breast cancer accounts carcinomas ie cancers develop epithelial cells originates lactiferous duct opposed lobules form alveoli breasts mammary glands lobules make milk ducts channel breasts nipple iccb first described dixon colleagues tumor microscopic histopathological inspection cribriform ie tissue pattern consisting numerous swiss cheeselike open spaces andor sievelike small holes see adjacent latest edition world health organization termed lesions invasive cribriform carcinomas indicating definition must component invades ducts origin adjacent tissues situ ductal cancers ie cancers localized entirely within tissues origin cribriform histopathology regarded belonging group ductal carcinoma situ rarely cancers histopathological cribriform pattern develop organs prostate gland termed invasive cribriform prostate cancer cribriform prostate salivary gland termed cribriform adenocarcinoma salivary sweat glands termed primary cutaneous cribriform apocrine thyroid gland termed cribriformmorular thyroid colon termed cribriform colon lung termed cribriform pattern lung adenocarcinoma considered rare variant acinar adenocrcinoma term invasive cribriform carcinoma breast rather invasive cribriform carcinoma used order clearly distinguish cribriform carcinomas iccb clearly cancerous tumor occurs predominantly older females rare cases males many favorable clinical pathological features including low rate metastasizing distant tissues excellent earlier editions world health organization divided iccb two forms pure form sometimes termed classical ie iccb tumors cribriform areas mixed form ie iccb tumors cribriform areas remaining areas tubular histological however many studies regarded mixed iccb consisting cribriform areas remaining areas containing tubular certain histopathological patterns latter definition mixed iccb used individuals presenting iccb one large study average yearsold postmenopausal females similarly aged males average age males representing however individuals young years diagnosed disease iccb tumors small ie less centimeters centimeters largest diameters asymptomatic masses first detected palpation screening methods mammography medical ultrasound screening methods often ie cases detect areas microcalcification ie tiny deposits calcium masses relatively small percentage cases eg studies workup individuals finds tumor metastasized ie spread lymph nodes nearby axilla ie rarely individuals presented ulcerated skin lesions inverted recurrences near site iccb tumor surgically metastases distant tissues vertebral microscopic histopathology iccb tumors stained hematoxylin eosin shows cribriform areas covering tumor remaining tumor areas showing tubular andor histopathological patterns cribriform areas consist smallsized cells amphophilic ie taking hematoxylin eosin stains cytoplasm indistinct cell boundaries smalltomedium sized nuclei surrounded sharp nuclear membrane contain finely stippled chromatin ie dna coated numerous open spaces andor sievelike small holes lie cells see photomicrograph give lesions swiss cheeselike appearance spaces holes may contain microcalcifications andor mucins ie high molecular weight sugarlinked proteins normally produced secreted mammary gland found cells around spaces holes sometimes apical snouts ie small protrusions side cells faces spaces tubular areas see adjacent photomicrograph tubular carcinoma consist wellformed tubules lined mostly normal appearing tubular histopathological patterns may occur tumor types include pattern associated invasive carcinoma special uncommon cases pattern associated mucinous carcinoma invasive component tumors almost always cribriform histopathology tumor cells iccb typically slowgrowing evidenced low mitotic index ie ratio number dividing cells total number tumor cells low levels cellular protein index cell seer study

tumors based protocols used treat invasive carcinoma special treatments strictly examined individually compared effectiveness treating ibbc tumors potential metastasize distant tissues left untreated long time virtually patients cases seer review study treated surgical removal surgery typically either breastconserving surgery modified radical patients iccb may also receive adjuvant radiotherapy andor seer study treated radiotherapy chemotherapy regimens used treat iccb included triple therapy cyclophosphamide epirubicin fluorouracil double therapy docetaxel triple therapy cyclophosphamide doxorubicin recent studies virtually individuals treated adjuvant hormonal therapy letrozole anastrozole block metabolism androgen estrogens aromatase enzyme nongonad tissues thereby reduce estrogen levels tamoxifen acts indirectly inhibit estrogen individuals mixed iccb treated aggressive protocols individuals pure iccb studies suggested pure iccb tumors might better treated conservative strategies listed seer study individuals iccb pure mixed types distinguished overall survival rates ie includes deaths due iccb cause years initial treatment respectively larger tumor size presence
