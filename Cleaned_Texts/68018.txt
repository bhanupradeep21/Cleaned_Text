closedhead injury type traumatic brain injury skull dura mater remain intact closedhead injuries leading cause death children years old common cause physical disability cognitive impairment young overall closedhead injuries forms mild traumatic brain injury account estimated million brain injuries occur annually united brain injuries closedhead injuries may result lifelong physical cognitive psychological impairment thus utmost concern regards public symptoms head injury seen accident medical care necessary diagnose treat injury without medical attention injuries progress cause brain damage disability brain swelling produces symptoms often slow process symptoms may surface days weeks common symptoms closedhead injury include severe head injuries lead permanent vegetative states death therefore able recognize symptoms get medical attention important symptoms severe closedhead injury include secondary symptoms symptoms surface rehabilitation injury including social competence issues depression personality changes cognitive disabilities anxiety changes sensory perception patients suffer traumatic brain injury develop psychiatric although precise rates anxiety brain injury unknown followup study patients found patients developed panic disorder developed anxiety disorder developed specific patients recovering closedhead traumatic brain injury often suffer decreased selfesteem depression effect often attributed difficulties reentering society frustration rehabilitation process patients suffered head injuries also show higher levels unemployment lead development secondary closedhead injuries caused primarily vehicular accidents falls acts violence sports falls account brain injuries united states rates highest children ages years adults ages years head injuries common men women across every age boys aged years highest rates brain injury related hospital visits hospitalizations deaths multiple mild traumatic brain injuries sustained short period time

tool determining severity head injuries children effective predicting outcome mechanismbased tbi classification system divides traumatic brain injuries tbi closed penetrating head trauma based way person several different types treatment available suffered closedhead injury treatment type chosen depend several factors including type severity injury well effects injury course treatment differs patient include several types treatment depending patients specific needs early treatment vital recovering lost motor function injury cognitive abilities recovered regardless time past since pharmacotherapy utilization drugs treat illness several different drugs used alleviate symptoms experienced head injury including antidepressants amitriptyline sertraline use drugs associated decrease depression increased functioning social work antidiuretic called desmopressin acetate ddavp also shown improve memory performance recent studies examined preventative effects progesterone brain injuries phase iii trials currently conducted medical centers across united states preliminary results shown reduction mortality treated progesterone showed improved functional overall efficacy pharmacotherapeutic treatments dependent treatment used symptoms targeted treatment patient education shown one effective ways decrease secondary symptoms seen closedhead injuries patient education often includes working therapist review symptom management learn returning regular educational initiatives also shown decrease occurrence ptsd headinjury many patients severe injuries need therapy regain basic motor cognitive skills cognitive rehabilitation aims improve attention memory function cognitiveprocessing speed type rehabilitation used tailored patients clinical needs depending severity type injury types rehabilitation focus raising patients selfesteem giving tasks successfully completed despite cognitive changes result brain injury process help decrease secondary symptoms feelings worthlessness depression social rehabilitation programs use teambuilding exercises problemsolving activities help patients learn work many closedhead injuries prevented proper use safety equipment dangerous activities common safety features reduce likelihood experiencing brain injury include helmets hard hats car seats safety belts another safety precaution decrease persons risk brain injury drink drive allow oneself driven person drinking otherwise helmets used decrease closedhead injuries acquired athletic activities considered necessary sports american tackle football frequent head impacts normal part game however recent studies questioned effectiveness even american football helmets assumed protection helmets promotes far head impacts behavior known risk compensation net result seems increase decrease similar sports australianrules football rugby always played helmetless see far fewer traumatic brain injuries see australian rules football injuries bicycle helmets perhaps promoted variety helmet based assumption cycling without helmet dangerous activity large risk serious brain injury however available data clearly shows false cycling approximately american fatalities per year medical causes minor source fatal traumatic brain injury whose american total approximately per similarly bicycling causes americas nonfatal traumatic brain injury still bicyclehelmet promotion campaigns common many us jurisdictions enacted mandatory bicyclehelmet laws children jurisdictions canadian provinces plus australia new zealand mandate bicycle helmets even adults bicyclehelmet educational campaign directed toward children claimed increase helmet use leading claimed decrease bicyclerelated head injuries nearly however sources shown bicyclehelmet promotion reduces cycling often percyclist reduction traumatic brain estimates bicyclehelmet use american adults vary one study found american adults wear helmets riding despite decades promotion despite sport cyclists adoption helmets part uniform following commercial opposed publichealth success bicycle helmets successful attempts promote sale ski helmets results less impressive great increases helmet use yielding reduction fatalities injury reduction confined lacerations contusions minor concussions opposed serious head rare campaigns motoring unfortunately people greatly overestimate traumatic brain injury danger bicycling greatly underestimate risk motoring remains largest source traumatic brain injury developed world despite protective effects seatbelts airbags
