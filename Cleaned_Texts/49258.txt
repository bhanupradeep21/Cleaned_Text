feltys syndrome fs also called felty rare autoimmune disease characterized triad rheumatoid arthritis enlargement spleen low neutrophil count condition common aged years specifically prevalent females males caucasians african descent deforming disease causes many complications symptoms feltys syndrome similar rheumatoid arthritis affected individuals painful stiff swollen joints commonly joints hands feet arms affected individuals feltys syndrome may develop period symptoms physical findings associated rheumatoid arthritis subsided present case feltys syndrome may remain undiagnosed rare instances development feltys syndrome may precede development symptoms physical findings associated rheumatoid feltys syndrome also characterized abnormally enlarged spleen splenomegaly abnormally low levels certain white blood cells neutropenia result neutropenia affected individuals increasingly susceptible certain infections keratoconjunctivitis sicca may occur due secondary sj√∂grens syndrome individuals feltys syndrome may also experience fever weight loss andor fatigue cases affected individuals may discoloration abnormal brown pigmentation skin particularly leg sores ulcers lower leg andor abnormally large liver hepatomegaly addition affected individuals may abnormally low levels circulating red blood cells anemia decrease circulating blood platelets assist blood clotting functions thrombocytopenia abnormal liver function tests andor inflammation blood vessels cause feltys syndrome unknown found common chronic rheumatoid arthritis patients share serotype syndrome mostly present people extra articular manifestations rheumatoid arthritis people syndrome risk infection low white blood cell underlying pathogenesis feltys syndrome clearcitation needed rheumatoid arthritis autoimmune disease characterized inflammation synovial joints due attack bodys immune system condition white blood cells travel bloodstream synovial joints release proinflammatory cytokines upon arrival result chemical release causes synovial cells release harmful chemicals response well begin growth new blood vessels forming pannus pannus receives blood supply newly formed vessels grows inward invading articular cartilage bone within joint damage healthy tissue causes inflammation ultimately fluid buildup joint accumulation fluid results joints swell slowly decreasing space keeps bones touching condition treated joint space completely narrow causing ankylosis advanced stage ankylosis joint mobility completely occluded early presentation commonly seen joints hands feet disease progresses seen knees wrists hips shoulders condition affect damage several body systems eyes heart lungs blood rheumatoid arthritis condition cured symptoms treated using certain medications alone conjunction due increased inflammatory response bodys immune system condition cause reduction red white blood feltys syndrome chronic activation neutrophils progresses neutropenia unabated neutropenia decreased concentration neutrophils blood neutrophils abundant cells among white blood cells play important role immune system destroying bacteria via phagocytosis inflammatory chemicals draw neutrophils area congregate fight infection decrease number neutrophils stimulates autoimmune response leads arthritis loss destruction neutrophils leading neutropenia therefore inflammationdriven due bodys need immune splenomegaly condition spleen causing enlarged splenic condition involving felty syndrome specifically noted inflammatory splenomegaly spleen important lymphatic organ involved filtration blood discarding old damaged red blood cells well maintaining platelet levels spleen lymphatic organ means largely involved immune system immune responses spleen becomes enlarged strong sign infection somewhere body caused inflammatory conditions rheumatoid arthritis increased need production assistance white blood cells affected areas causes hyperfunction spleen increase defense activities ultimately causes hypertrophy spleen leading spleen found left upper quadrant luq peritoneal cavity due enlargement cause stress neighboring organscitation needed condition affects less
