marie maynard daly april october american biochemist first africanamerican receive phd columbia university first africanamerican woman united states earn phd daly made important contributions four areas research chemistry histones protein synthesis relationships cholesterol hypertension creatines uptake muscle daly attended hunter college high school laboratory high school girls run hunter college also encouraged pursue chemistry enrolled queens college small fairly new school flushing new york lived home save money graduated magna cum laude queens college bachelors degree chemistry upon graduation named queens college honor awarded top graduating labor shortages need scientists support war effort enabled daly garner fellowships study new york university columbia university masters phd degrees daly worked laboratory assistant queens college studying new york university masters degree chemistry completed became chemistry tutor queens college enrolled doctoral program columbia university supervised mary letitia caldwell phd thesis titled study products formed action pancreatic amylase corn starch received phd chemistry daly worked physical science instructor howard university simultaneously conducting research direction herman branson awarded american cancer society grant support postdoctoral research joined alfred e mirskys group rockefeller institute studied cell nucleus start sevenyear research program rockefeller institute medicine daly examined proteins constructed time structure function dna yet daly began working college physicians surgeons columbia university collaboration quentin b deming studied arterial continued work assistant professor biochemistry medicine albert einstein college medicine yeshiva university deming moved also served investigator american heart final years albert einstein college per dalys efforts increase minority enrollment professional graduate schools helped run martin luther king robert f kennedy program help prepare black students promoted associate daly one minority women scientists attend conference examining challenges facing minority women stem fields conference held american association advancement science resulted publication report double bind price minority woman science made recommendations recruiting retaining minority women daly member board governors new york academy sciences two fellow american association advancement science american cancer society daly designated career scientist health research council city new york daly retired albert einstein college medicine established scholarship african american chemistry physics majors queens college memory recognized national technical association one top women science engineering daly particularly interested nuclear proteins developed methods fractionation nuclear material determination composition essential separate cellular material components without destroying losing studied histones proteins found cell nuclei able show amino acid composition various histone fractions studies histones mirsky provided evidence lysinerich histones contrast argininerich histones described albrecht histones since shown important gene dalys work histones considered daly developed methods separating nuclei tissues measuring base composition purines pyrimidines desoxypentose nucleic concluded among things bases adenine guanine thymine cytosine present appreciable investigated protein including role cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein protein using radiolabeled amino acid glycine able measure protein metabolism changed feeding fasting conditions mice allowed monitor activity cytoplasm radiolabeled glycine taken cell watson crick described structure dna accepting nobel prize work watson cited one dalys papers role ribonucleoprotein protein synthesis contributing cell nucleus research field flooded funding daly colleagues earliest work relating diet health cardiac circulatory systems investigated impact cholesterol sugar nutrients first establish hypertension precursor first identify relationship cholesterol clogged important discovery understanding heart attacks especially interested hypertension affects circulatory system showed high cholesterol intake diet led clogged arteries hypertension accelerated effect studied effects diet hypertension found cholesterol sugar related investigating aging suggested smooth muscle hypertrophy due aging might causative role hypertension daly also early investigator effects cigarette smoke lungs daly began studying uptake creatine muscle cells important research topic energy recycling systems muscle uptake creatine cultured cells described conditions muscle tissues best absorbed limited information personal life motivation dalys father ivan c daly immigrated british west indies found work postal clerk eventually married helen page washington lived new york city daly born raised corona often visited maternal grandparents washington read scientists achievements grandfathers extensive library especially impressed paul de kruifs microbe hunters work influenced decision become dalys interest science also influenced father attended cornell university intention becoming chemist unable complete education due lack daly would thus complete fathers ambition majoring chemistry years later started queens college scholarship fund honor assist minority students majoring chemistry daly married took name marie maynard daly husband died died october february founding principal new elementary school mr r emmanuelcooke announced school would named dr marie daly academy excellence honor queens additionally einstein college also created annual memorial lecture called marie daly memorial celebration sponsored division biomedical sciences einstein minority scientist every year guest speakers invited give lecture highlighting diversity contribution minorities science httpsenwikipediaorgwikimariemaynarddaly
