parasitic worms also known large macroparasites adults generally seen naked eye many intestinal worms soiltransmitted infect gastrointestinal tract parasitic worms schistosomes reside blood vessels parasitic worms including leeches monogeneans ectoparasites thus classified helminths endoparasites parasitic worms live feed living hosts receive nourishment protection disrupting hosts ability absorb nutrients cause weakness disease host poses global health economic parasitic worms reproduce entirely within hosts body life cycle includes stages need take place outside helminths able survive mammalian hosts many years due ability manipulate hosts immune response secreting immunomodulatory parasitic worms produce eggs reproduction eggs strong shell protects range environmental conditions eggs therefore survive environment many months years many worms referred helminths intestinal parasites infection helminth known helminthiasis helminth infection intestinal worm infection naming

possess round flattened body ringworm dermatophytosis actually caused various fungi parasitic lifetime adult worms varies tremendously one species another generally range years see following table lifetime several years result ability manipulate immune response hosts secreting immunomodulatory helminths either hermaphroditic sex organs sexes like tapeworms flukes including blood fluke sexes differentiated like helminths produce eggs also called ova generally thousands even hundreds thousands eggs produced time female worm deposits eggs process called oviposition large variation number eggs produced different species worm one time varies range frequency egg deposition adult helminth generally daily occur six times per day taenia species adult trematodes lay smaller numbers eggs compared cestodes nematodes however egg develops miracidia thousands cercariae swimming larvae develop means one egg may produce thousands adult helminth eggs remain viable months crops many months
