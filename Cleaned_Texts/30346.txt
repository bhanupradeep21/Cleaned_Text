antibiotics professor biochemistry microbiology rutgers university four decades discovered several antibiotics introduced modern sense word name introduced procedures led development many others proceeds earned licensing patents funded foundation microbiological research established waksman institute microbiology located rutgers university busch campus piscataway new jersey usa awarded nobel prize physiology medicine ingenious systematic successful studies soil microbes led discovery streptomycin waksman foundation later sued albert schatz one phd students discoverer streptomycin minimizing schatzs role selman waksman granted acs national historic chemical landmark recognition significant work lab isolating antibiotics including streptomycin first effective treatment selman waksman born july july according old russian jewish parents nova pryluka kiev governorate russian vinnytsia oblast ukraine son fradia london jacob shortly receiving diploma fifth gymnasium odesa immigrated united states became naturalized american citizen six years waksman attended rutgers college rutgers university graduated bachelor science agriculture continued studies rutgers receiving

agriculture washington dc charles thom studying soil appointed research fellow university california berkeley awarded doctor philosophy biochemistry joined faculty rutgers university department biochemistry microbiology rutgers waksmans team discovered several antibiotics including actinomycin clavacin streptothricin streptomycin grisein neomycin fradicin candicidin candidin waksman codiscovered streptomycin albert schatz streptomycin first effective drug gramnegative first antibiotic used cure tuberculosis waksman credited coining term antibiotics describe antibacterials derived living organisms example penicillin though term used french dermatologist françois henri hallopeau describe substance opposed development lifecitation needed waksman organized division marine bacteriology woods hole oceanographic institution whoi addition task appointed marine bacteriologist served elected trustee whoi finally life trustee using half patent royalties waksman created waksman foundation meeting board trustees foundation held july urged building facility work microbiology named waksman institute microbiology located busch campus rutgers university piscataway new jersey first president foundation waksman succeeded position son byron h waksman needed waksman studying streptomyces family organisms since college student days time studying organism streptomyces griseus streptomycin isolated griseus found effective tuberculosis one waksmans graduate students albert results later confirmed elizabeth bugie gregory whose name also published streptomycin substance exhibiting antibiotic activity grampositive gramnegative bacteria schatz however bugies name second key paper regarding efficacy streptomycin tuberculosis test tubes schatz claimed bugie involved bugie also given credit work streptomycin listed patent proposal signed affidavit stating contribution discovering submitted attorney rutgers research endowment foundationcitation needed details credit discovery streptomycin usefulness antibiotic strongly contested albert schatz leading litigation however possible waksman see schatzs contribution significantly schatz saw contributions waksman noted schatz away military adding lab three months played small role discovering waksman rutgers settled court schatz resulting financial remuneration entitlement legal scientific credit codiscoverer schatz awarded patent rights claimed nobel committee made considerable mistake failing recognize schatzs contribution systematic experiments test several strains antibiotics several different disease organisms underway waksmans laboratory time classic approach explore complete matrix rows consisting antibiotics columns consisting different diseases bacteria produced antibiotic streptomycin discovered schatz farmland outside lab tested waksman however eventually came claim sole credit discoverycitation needed controversy streptomycin waksman schatz brought light challenges distributing credit scientific research discoveries prompted schools universities become involved patenting process regulations credit dispersed schools would also provide clearer lines individuals role lab minimize future litigations neomycin derived actinomycetes discovered waksman hubert lechevalier one waksmans graduate students discovery published journal waksmans research also examined role bacteria marine systems particular focus role bacteria nutrient cycles waksman examined degradation alginic waksman working cornelia carey margaret hotchkiss yvette hardman donald johnston
