holomastigotoides transferred termite termite way feeding anal secretions termites juvenile since discovery holomastigotoides species found multiple termite genera including coptotermes heterotermes prorhinotermes psammotermes possible multiple species holomastigotoides reside individual host termite species may result speciation holomastigotoides within single host species result possible cospeciation holomastigotoides holomastigotoides coneshaped one notable features holomastigotoides high density flagella cell surface reports flagella single organization flagella holomastigotoides attributed arrangement flagellar bands spiral formation around cell flagellar bands originate anterior apex cell spiral posteriorly progressively larger spirals wrapping around circumference individual flagellar band made many basal bodies arranged single row single flagellum emerges basal body giving holomastigotoides characteristic highly flagellated appearance basal bodies flagellar band linked fiber system consists three different fiber types flagellar band associated axostyle endoplasmic reticulum golgi high density external flagella helps prevent pieces ingested wood termite hindgut contacting damaging cell surfaces number flagellar bands varies based species posterior base holomastigotoides cells flagellated contain vesicles likely used phagocytosis near anterior apex cell basal bodies arranged tightly together within flagellar bands extent basal bodies overlap fiber system associated basal bodies also compressed apical region thus fiber types difficult basal bodies become widely spaced away cell apex fiber types also easier distinguish basal bodies transition flagella distally transition point indicated transition axosome found transition plate central microtubules individual holomastigotoides also possesses parabasal bodies characteristic parabasalids parabasal bodies consist golgi body parabasal fiber closely associated basal bodies flagella golgi

formation one parabasal fiber flagellar band parabasal fiber possesses dark lining suggested microtubule organizing centre size parabasal fibers decreases extend past apex point observed midregion base parabasal fibers densely concentrated cells apex axostyles closely associated parabasal fibers also accumulate fibrous ribbon long sheet looks like accordion connects basal bodies individual flagellar band individual fibrous ribbon long length individual flagellar ki fibers named distinctive shape specifically link basal bodies triplets ki fibers change shape also changes distance basal
