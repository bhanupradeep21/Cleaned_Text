neurocritical care neurointensive care medical field treats lifethreatening diseases nervous system identifies prevents treats secondary brain injury many attempts manage head injuries throughout history including trepanned skulls found ancient egypt descriptions treatments decrease brain swelling ancient greek intensive care begin centers treat poliomyelitis outbreak midtwentieth early respiratory care units utilized negative positive pressure unit called iron lung aid patients respiration greatly decreased mortality rate dr bj√∏rn aage ibsen physician denmark birthed intensive care unit used tracheostomy positive pressure manual ventilation keep polio patients alive setting influx patients limited resources one iron first neurological intensive care unit created dr dandy walker johns hopkins dr walker realized surgical patient could use specialized postoperative neurosurgical monitoring treatment unit dr walker created showed benefit postoperative patients neurologic patients came unit dr safar created first intensive care unit united states baltimore benefit specialized care respiratory cardiac icus led society critical care medicine formed body created standards extensive difficult medical problems treatments time need specialized monitoring treatments led neurologic intensive care units modern neurocritical care began develop neurocritical care society founded neurocritical care recognized neurological doctors practice type medicine called neurointensivists medical training many fields including neurology anesthesiology emergency medicine internal medicine neurosurgery common diseases treated neurointensive care units include strokes ruptured aneurysms brain spinal cord injury trauma seizures especially last long period time status epilepticus andor involve trauma patient ie due stroke fall swelling brain cerebral edema infections brain encephalitis brains spines meninges meningitis brain tumors especially malignant cases neurological oncology weakness muscles required breathe diaphragm besides dealing critical illness nervous system neurointensivists also treat medical complications may occur patients including heart lung kidneys body system including treatment infections neurological intensive care units specialized units select tertiary care centers specialized care critical ill neurological post preop neurosurgical patients goal nicus provide early aggressive medical interventions including managing pain airways ventilation anticoagulation elevated icp cardiovascular stability secondary brain injury admission criteria includes impaired consciousness impaired ability protect airway progressive respiratory weakness need mechanical ventilation seizure radiologic evidence elevated icp monitoring neurologic function patients critically ill neuroicu seeing increasing use tertiary referral hospital one main reasons neuroicus seen increased use use therapeutic hypothermia shown improve longterm neurological outcomes following cardiac neurocritical care units collaborative effort neurointensivists neurosurgeons neurologists radiologists pharmacists physician extenders nurse practitioners physician assistants critical care nurses respiratory therapists registered dietitians rehabilitation therapists social workers work together order provide coordinated care critically ill neurologic patient patients neurointensive care units nicu vulnerable due primary injury need help personal hygiene planning nursing interventions beneficial aware patient intracranial adaptive capacity ie intracranial compliance avoid development elevated icp nursing interventions performed aim benefit patient hygienic interventions preventing pressure ulcers surgery wound management endotracheal suctioning artificial ventilation needed among things though nursing interventions might well stressful result high icp therefore nurse obligation plan interventions balance achieved benefits patient wellbeing risk raised icp might cause secondary insults high icp prevented giving extra sedation intervention optimizing patients position raised head stretched neck avoid venous stasis icp mmhg important interventions performed minimize probabilities secondary hypothermia one third half people coronary artery disease episode heart stops patients heart stopped seven thirty percent leave hospital good
