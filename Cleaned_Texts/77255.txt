fragilissima among largest known coenocytes reaching centimetres name xenophyophora means bearer foreign bodies greek refers sediments called xenophyae cemented together construct tests henry bowman brady classified primitive later placed within beginning century considered independent class later new eukaryotic phylum phylogenetic studies suggest xenophyophores specialized group monothalamous singlechambered molecular study using small subunit rdna found syringammina shinkaiya form monophyletic clade closely related rhizammina molecular evidence confirmed monophyly xenophyophores study also suggested many individual genera polyphyletic similar body shapes convergently evolving multiple historically xenophyophores divided agglutinated psamminida flexible proteinaceous however cladistic analyses based molecular data suggested high amount homoplasy division psamminids stannomids well xenophyophores unicellular many nuclei many form delicate elaborate agglutinated often made

minerals vary species often include barite lead granellare shinkaiya found contain high concentrations studies found unusually high concentrations radioactive nuclides xenophyophores first reported occultammina since found true many xenophyophore species different parts little known xenophyophore reproduction assumed alternation generations takes place foraminifera however confirmed gametes form specialised part granellare may look like swollen sidebranch psammetta stalked bulb cerelasma gametes reportedly µm diameter two flagella amoebalike stage seems present also possible amoeboid stage represents amoeboid gametes found foraminifera amoeboid structures also sometimes found inside granellare juveniles occasionally found association adults psametta horseshoeshaped already covered xenophyae location initial plasma sometimes pointed adult xenophyophores species denoted sharp change type xenophyae others juvenile regular adult irregular still others flip pattern juvenile irregular adult growth episodic one observational study taking place period eight months saw threetotenfold growth specimens reticulammina labyrinthica growth occurred phases lasting days phase separated resting period approximately two months growth phases approximately synchronous specimens unclear biologically developmentally controlled evidence suggests synchrony may due chance episode growth occurred three phases first base becomes wider flatter causing surface texture become smoother original shape organism regained albeit larger finally surface texture rebuilt rapid rate growth observed suggests xenophyophores may longlived previously xenophyophores important part deep seafloor found four major ocean often found areas enhanced organic carbon flux beneath productive surface waters submarine canyons settings sloped topography eg seamounts abyssal hills continental found areas hypoxic xenophyophores found depths metres epifaunal living atop seabed one species occultammina profunda known infaunal buries centimetres deep xenophyophore densities highest soft sediments however may still found rocky substrates including basalts canyon walls manganese diet feeding ecology xenophyophores long subject speculation fragile tests deepwater habitat group makes vivo observation difficult early propositions included suspension feeding bacterial farming deposit feeding trapping particulate matter inside studies since confirmed active uptake food surrounding sediments using pseudopodia using test trap particles analysis lipid concentrations within xenophyophores revealed especially high concentrations bacteria stercomata suggesting xenophyophores utilise bacteria growing waste products order supplement study utilised isotopic labeling examine question xenophyophore feeding confirmed rapid uptake diatoms dissolved organic matter form glucose study found evidence support bacterial farming function test instead proposed aided function collection phytodetritus increasing surface area authors argued xenophyophores fill major role oceanfloor biogeochemical positivelyidentified xenophyophore fossils suggested mysterious vendozoans ediacaran period represent fossil however discovery sterols associated fossils dickinsonia cast doubt identification sterols today associated animals researchers suggest dickinsonia relatives instead ediacaran fossils palaeopascichnus intrites yelovichnus neonereites posited fossil xenophyophores linked eocene fossil benkovacina however analysis latter found neither barite crystals evidence agglutinated foraminifera study examined growth development palaeopascichnus concluded likely study pteridinum reached similar researchers suggested enigmatic graphoglyptids known early cambrian recent times could represent remains noted similarity extant xenophyophore occultammina supporting notion similar abyssal habitat living xenophyophores inferred habitat fossil graphoglyptids however large size regularity many graphoglyptids well apparent absence xenophyae fossils casts doubt modern examples paleodictyon discovered however evidence tests stercomares grannelares xenophyophore dna found trace may alternately represent burrow glass certain carboniferous fossils suggested represent remains xenophyophores due concentration barium within fossils well supposed morphological similarity however barium content later determined due diagenetic alteration material morphology specimen instead supported algal local population densities may high individuals per square metres sq ft making dominant organisms areas xenophyophores found ecosystem engineers providing habitat serving traps organic particles increasing diversity surrounding research shown areas dominated xenophyophores times number benthic crustaceans echinoderms molluscs equivalent areas lack xenophyophores xenophyophores also play commensal host number isopods eg genus hebefustis sipunculan polychaete worms nematodes harpacticoid may take semipermanent residence within xenophyophores test brittle stars ophiuroidea also appear relationship xenophyophores consistently found directly underneath top protozoans also function nurseries fish snailfish found lay eggs shelter xenophyophore starfish monoplacophorans molpadiid sea cucumbers observed feeding xenophyophores specifically monoplacophoran neopilina galatheae proposed specialised predator despite abundance relatively low amount protoplasm per unit test means xenophyophores often contribute little total xenophyophores difficult study due extreme fragility specimens invariably damaged sampling rendering useless captive study cell culture reason little known life history occur worlds oceans great numbers xenophyophores could indispensable agents process sediment deposition maintaining biological diversity benthic ecosystems scientists submersible dsv alvin depth metres alaskan continental margin gulf alaska collected spatangoid urchin cystochinus loveni cm diameter wearing cloak consisting protists creatures including living xenophyophores mainly psammina species mm fragility xenophyophores suggests urchin either carefully
