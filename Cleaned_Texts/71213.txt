prepared laboratories industrial scale acid ether ethanol mixed strong acid typically sulfuric acid acid dissociates aqueous environment producing hydronium ions hydronium ion protonates electronegative oxygen atom ethanol giving ethanol molecule positive charge nucleophilic oxygen atom unprotonated ethanol displaces water molecule protonated electrophilic ethanol molecule reforming

thus slows metabolism also inhibits metabolism drugs requiring oxidative metabolism example diazepam requires hepatic oxidization whereas oxidized metabolite oxazepam diethyl ether extremely flammable
