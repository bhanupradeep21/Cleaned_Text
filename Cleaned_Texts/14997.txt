parental care behavioural evolutionary strategy adopted animals involving parental investment made evolutionary fitness offspring patterns parental care widespread highly diverse across animal great variation different animal groups terms parents care offspring amount resources invested parents example may considerable variation amount care invested sex females may invest species males invest others investment may shared equally numerous hypotheses proposed describe variation patterns parental care exist sexes well among parental care behaviour contributes offspring survival building nest provisioning offspring food defending offspring predators reptiles may produce selfsufficient young needing parental care hatchling birds may helpless birth relying parents survival parental care beneficial increases parents inclusive fitness improving offspring survival quality reproductive since parental care costly often affects parents future survival reproductive success parents ensure investment wellspent parental care thus evolves adaptive types parental care include maternal paternal care biparental care alloparental sexual conflict known occur mating familial conflicts may continue mating parental care eggs young example conflict may arise male female parents much care provide conflict may arise siblings much care demand conflicts may arise parents offspring supply demand although parental care increases evolutionary fitness offspring receiving care produces cost parent organism energy expended caring offspring mating opportunities may costly evolves costs outweighed parental care seen many insects notably social insects ants bees wasps certain fishes mouthbrooders widely birds amphibians rarely reptiles especially widely mammals share two major adaptations care young namely gestation development embryo inside mothers body production milk care offspring males may evolve natural selection favouring parental care stronger sexual selection paternal approximately bird species males exclusively provide care eggs maleonly care prevalent variety organisms including fish amphibianscitation needed occurrence paternal care mostly associated biparental care socially monogamous mating systemscitation needed rise paternal care primates may explained mating effort maternal relief hypotheses mating effort hypothesis suggests males may provide care offspring attempt increase mating opportunities thus enhance future reproductive maternal relief hypothesis proposes males provide care reduce burdens associated reproduction female ultimately generates shorter interbirth intervals produces successful type mating system may influence paternity certainty therefore likelihood male caring true offspring paternal certainty relatively high monogamous pairbonded species males less likely caring unrelated offspring therefore greater prevalence paternal care tends exist association mating contrast paternity certainty reduced polygamous species males greater risk providing care unrelated offspring therefore compromises polygynous species single male mates one female males role caregiver therefore tends reduced conversely males may exclusively responsible caring offspring polyandrous species single female mates one evolution male parental care particularly rare nonmonogamous species predominantly investing effort mating evolutionarily effective males providing parental one hypothesis regarding evolution male parental care nonmonogamous species suggests parental behaviour correlated increased siring instance mountain gorillas gorilla beringei males upper tertile regarding frequency interaction young gorillas regardless youngs parentage fathered five times offspring males lowertwo affiliative male burying beetles nicrophorus vespilloides attracted three times females given opportunity breed provide parental care compared males presented breeding species gorilla beringei nicrophorus vespilloides indicate selection may promote male parental care nonmonogamous mammalian species female parents possess adaptations may predispose care offspring adaptations include gestation production milk invertebrates maternal care known prerequisite evolution permanent family grouping eusociality spiders permanent sociality dependent extended maternal care following females species reptiles may remain clutch provide care curling around eggs duration incubation period intricate example maternal care group seen crocodilian species mothers may stay young multiple general mammalian tendency female parents invest offspring focused development early hypotheses describe sex differences paternal care initially suggested different levels investment sex terms gamete size number may led evolution femaleonly care early hypothesis suggested females invest production fewer larger gametes compared males produce many smaller gametes maternal care would favoured females initially invested would thus stand lose continue invest biparental care tends favoured sexual selection intense adult sex ratio males females strongly two parents cooperate caring young mates must coordinated well requirements developing young demands selection biparental care behavioural strategy considered important factor driving evolution monogamy value exclusive cooperation care mutual offspring two parents outweighs potential benefits polygamy either biparental care may increase offspring survival well allow parents gain mating opportunities pair conflicting evidence whether offspring fare equally better worse receiving care two parents rather single parent one hand suggested due sexual conflict parents withhold amount care provide shift much workload possible partner case offspring may worse experimental evidence contrasts suggests parents care mutual offspring individual contributions may synergistic effects fitness young case offspring would benefit biparental biparental care particularly prevalent mammals bird species monogamous biparental care patterns birds parental care system generally attributed ability male birds engage parental behaviours exception egglaying due endothermy small size birth huge pressure infant birds grow quickly prevent energy loss since sexes able forage provision offspring therefore beneficial parents cooperate care meet requirements infant birds offspring survival ultimately increase fitness alloparental care caring nondescendant offspring seemingly altruistic reproductively costly behaviour adaptive benefits evident costs observed mammal bird defining feature eusociality found insects including various ants bees mammalian mothers alloparenting may beneficial promoting earlier weaning infants long earlier weaning compromise infant survival strategy results shorter interbirth intervals increased reproductive success frequent alloparenting may provide mothers opportunities feed without young may ultimately increase net energy gains permits invest energy milk synthesis however potential costs alloparenting may include expenditure time resources caring nondescendant offspring apparent direct benefits offspring experience alloparental care may benefit increased protection predators learning group dynamics social eusocial insects evolution caste system driven workers sacrifice personal reproductive fitness assist reproductive success colony indirect fitness benefits gained instead assisting related members may best interest worker forgo personal reproduction participate alloparenting rearing drones enhanced likelihood males colony ultimately mate queen would provide greater chance colonys genes represented future similarly worker ants tend raise sisters rather daughters due greater relatedness survival colony believed main reward drives altruism parental care frequently observed invertebrate species dipterans oviposition instead commonly observed adults lay eggs leaving hatch develop larva pupa adults example phormia regina adults lay eggs preferentially carrion though biparental maleonly care rarely observed femaleonly care exist insects including hymenoptera ants bees wasps invest substantial effort caring young type amount care invested varies widely solitary wasps potter wasps eumeninae build nests young provisioning food often caterpillars caught mother nests sealed young live food leave nest contrast social wasps honeybees raise young substantial colonies eggs laid mainly queens mothers young cared mainly workers sisters outside hymenoptera parental care found among burying beetles magnificent salt subdued

frog offspring holding mouth extended periods time mouthbrooding evolved independently several different families fish including cardinalfish sea catfish bagrid catfish cichlids snakeheads jawfishes gouramis equal prevalence femaleonly maleonly care amphibians however biparental care provisioning animal group tends rare offspring guarding prevalent example frog species bibrons toadlet male frogs

several parental behavior also observed cunninghams skink viviparous lizard protects offspring birds distinctive way care young bird species display biparental care including species alloparental care

towards rearing offspring benefits offsprings evolutionary fitness cost parents ability invest components species fitness parental care requires resources one parents increases fitness offspring resources thus invested parents survival growth future reproduction therefore parental care evolve species requires care animal groups produce selfsufficient young thus parental care required species require care tradeoffs exist regards parental investment directed much care provided since resources time example strategy parental care involves parents choosing give relatively small number offspring increased chance surviving reproduce may accordingly evolved produce small number zygotes time possibly ideal amount parental investment would guarantee survival quality parents need trade investment current future reproductive events since parental care increases offspring survival expense parents ability invest future broods nonetheless evidence suggesting mammals provinding male care actually leads fecund females thus caring offspring lead number predation offspring species habitattype two potential proximate causes evolution parental generally parental care expected evolve previous state care costs providing care outweighed benefits caring parent example benefit increased offspring survival quality exceed decreased chance survival future reproductive success parent parental care may evolve therefore parental care favoured required offspring benefits care types parental care amount resources invested parents vary considerably across animal kingdom evolution maleonly femaleonly biparental alloparental care different groups animals may driven multiple factors firstly different groups may diverse physiological evolutionary constraints may predispose one sex care example mammary glands may make female mammals preadapted exclusively provide nutritional care secondly costs benefits care sex may influenced ecological conditions mating opportunities thirdly operational adult sex ratios may influence sex mating opportunities thus predisposes one sex care furthermore parenting decisions may influenced confidence either sex genetic parent offspring paternity type mating system may influence sex provides care monogamous species establish longterm pairbonds parents likely cooperate caring offspring polyandrous mating systems paternal maleonly care tends evolve conversely polygynous mating systems associated little male contribution males rarely provide care offspring promiscuous mating systems since high paternity male care prevalent species external fertilisation female care common internal explanations include suggestion trivers depends paternity may less internal fertilisation unless male undertakes mate guarding female lays eggs gives second explanation richard dawkins r carlisles theory order gamete release therefore opportunity parent desert may influence sex provides internal fertilisation may provide male parent opportunity desert first seen bird mammal species roles may reversed external fertilisation fish males often wait female lays eggs fertilise prevent small gametes floating away allows female desert first leave male parents care thirdly george c williamss hypothesis indicates association embryos may predispose one sex care offspring internal fertilisation occurring mother female parent closely associated embryo may preadapted care young external fertilisation eggs often laid female males needed male territoriality particularly common external fertilisation therefore male closely associated embryos males may defend territories thereby incidentally defend eggs young may preadapt males provide care male care consequently involves less opportunity costs case since males still attract mates simultaneously guarding territory eggs females may even attracted preferentially select mate males already eggs male territoriality internal fertilisation exists bird species nest size nest building behaviour two sexually selected traits may attract female males territory mating since female lays eggs nest within males territory paternal care may evolve even though fertilisation increasing parental investment one young benefits particular offspring decreases resources offspring possibly decreasing parental hence tradeoff exists offspring quantity quality within parent disperses limited resources thinly among many offspring survive alternatively parent uses resources generously among one small brood reduces ability parent invest future therefore theoretical optimal brood size maximises productivity groups biparental care sexual conflict much care provided either parent temporarily removed parent may increase work demonstrates parents capacity work harder provide greater levels care one parent may tempted cheat relying parent biparental care key theoretical prediction parents respond reduced partner effort incomplete compensation parent put fair share work suffers reduced fitness offspring receive less resources parents experimentally demonstrated one parent sufficient parents may need care offspring parent would like minimise level care must invest expense parent one parent die cease providing care remaining partner may obliged desert eggs young extent parental care provided current brood may also influenced prospects future reproduction field experiments passerine bird species indicated areas broods fed extra carotenoids mouths became redder consequently enhanced begging displays led parents increase provisioning likely redder mouths indicated offspring healthier thus worth investing territories adults also provided carotenoidrich sugar diets increased likelihood second brood season since parents second broods respond increased begging signals current brood indicates parents strategically vary sensitivity current broods demands relation future prospects reproducing act eating ones offspring filial cannibalism may adaptive behaviour parent use extra source food parents may eat part brood enhance parental care current brood alternatively parents may eat whole brood cut losses improve future reproductive theory parent invest paired mate high phenotypic genetic quality explained differential allocation shown experimentation zebra finches males made attractive females experimentally giving red leg bands females increased provisioning raised young paired attractive males compared paired less attractive males blue green leg experimentation mallard ducks displayed females lay larger eggs increase provisioning paired attractive female peacocks also shown lay eggs mating males possess elaborate furthermore female birds generally likely care offspring males spend time nest building build elaborate nests consequence reproductive success males tends increase nest size building therefore differential allocation expected offspring pairings would likely inherit quality attractive parent attractiveness signifies genetic quality differential allocation may also work way around parents may invest less offspring paired unattractive mates reducing amount care invested offspring individuals may save resources future reproductive attempts attractive differential allocation mostly expected females since many animal groups females choosy assessing potential mates however many bird species males known involved caring young may lead differential allocation males well httpsenwikipediaorgwikiparentalcare
