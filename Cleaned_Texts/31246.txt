bowel resection enterectomy enter ectomy surgical procedure part intestine bowel removed either small intestine large intestine often word enterectomy reserved sense small bowel resection distinction colectomy covers sense large bowel resection bowel resection may performed treat gastrointestinal cancer bowel ischemia necrosis obstruction due scar tissue volvulus hernias patients require ileostomy colostomy procedure alternative means complications procedure may include anastomotic leak dehiscence hernias adhesions causing partial complete bowel obstruction depending part much intestines removed may digestive metabolic challenges afterward short bowel syndrome types enterectomy named according relevant bowel segment anatomy surgical technique bowel resection varies based location removed segment whether surgery due malignancy sections describe resection nonmalignant causes malignancy may require extensive tissue resection beyond described bowel resection may done open surgery long incision abdomen may also done laparoscopically robotically creating several small incisions abdomen surgical instruments abdomen accessed one methods surgery may procede abdomen accessed surgeon runs small bowel viewing entire small bowel ligament treitz ileocecal valve allows total evaluate small bowel identify pathologic sections area concern located two small holes created mesentery either end segment holes used place surgical stapler across bowel separate segment injured bowel healthy bowel end bowel dissected away mesentery following remaining bowel observed verify continued blood flow resection surgeon create anastomosis two ends bowel following hole mesentery created removing section bowel closed sutures prevent internal herniation resected section bowel removed abdomen abdomen closed concludes right left colon sit retroperitoneum access space incision made along line toldt colon mobilized retroperitoneum care taken avoid injury ureters duodenum surgery follows steps small bowel resection however due colons placement retroperitoneum dissection often required allow tension free small bowel colon cancer may require surgical small bowel cancer often presents late course due nonspecific symptoms poor survival rates risk factors small bowel cancer include genetically inherited polyposis syndromes age sixty years history crohns celiac disease cases present stage iv show survival benefit surgical resection clear margins recommended surgical resection also include lymph node sampling minimum nodes groups extolling extensive resection evaluation determines cancer stage iv surgical intervention longer curative used symptom colon cancer third common cancer second common cause cancer death due prevalence screening protocols created prevention disease screening colonoscopies without polypectomy shown decrease cancer morbidity cancer advanced polypectomy possible surgical resection necessary using imaging pathologic evaluation resected tissue tumor may staged using ajcc surgical resection tumors staging curative purposes requires removal local blood vessel lymph nodes standard lymph node resection includes three consecutive levels lymph nodes known addition surgery adjuvant chemotherapy may used decrease risk recurrence chemotherapy standard stage iii cancer case dependant stage ii palliative stage diet high processed food surgery drinks also shown increase recurrence stage iii colon bowel obstructions commonly secondary adhesions hernias cancer bowel obstruction emergency requiring immediate surgery original testing imaging include blood tests electrolyte levels abdominal xrays ct scans treatment often begins iv fluids correct electrolyte imbalances obstructions may complicated ischemia perforation bowel cases surgical emergencies often require bowel resection remove cause adhesions common causes obstruction frequently resolve without causes bowel obstruction include volvulus strictures inflammation intussusception exhaustive list bowel perforation presents abdominal pain free air abdomen standing xray depending cause size perforations may medically surgically managed common causes perforation cancer diverticulitis peptic ulcer disease caused cancer bowel perforation typically requires surgery including resection blood lymph supply cancerous area possible perforation site tumor perforation may contained tumor self resolve without surgery however surgery may required later malignancy perforation tumor usually requires immediate surgery due release fecal material abdomen perforated diverticulitis often requires surgery due risks infection recurrence recurrent diverticulitis may required resection even absence perforation bowel resection repair typically initiated earlier patients signs infection elderly immunocompromised severe peptic ulcer disease may cause perforation bowel rarely requires bowel resection peptic ulcer disease caused stomach acid overwhelming protection mucous production risk factors include h pylori infection smoking nsaid use standard treatment medical management endoscopy followed surgical omental patch repair rare cases omental patch fails bowel resection may become traumatic injuries whether blunt force car accidents penetrating wounds gunshot wounds stabbings may also cause bowel perforation ischemia requiring emergency surgery initial evaluation trauma includes fast ultrasound exam followed contrast ct abdomen stable patients common bowel injury trauma perforation repaired rather resected injury involves less half bowel circumference involve loss blood supply resection indicated extensive ischemic bowel ischemia caused decreased absent blood flow celiac superior mesenteric inferior mesenteric arteries combination thereof untreated acute mesenteric ischemia cause bowel necrosis affected area requires emergent surgery survival without endovascular operative intervention around ischemic bowel injury often requires multiple surgeries days apart allow bowel recovery increase odds successful anastomotic leak fault surgical connection two remaining sections bowel resection performed allows bowel contents leak abdomen anastomotic leaks may cause infection abscess development organ failure untreated surgical steps taken prevent leaks possible include creating anastomoses minimal tension connection aligning bowel prevent twisting bowel anastomosis however believed leaks caused poor healing surgical technique risk factors poor healing anastomosis include obesity diabetes mellitus treatment leak includes antibiotics placement drain near leak developing abscess stenting anastomosis surgical repair creating ileostomy abdominal surgery may result incisional hernia abdomen accessed hernias develop fascia abdominal cavity separates surgical closure may due suture failure poor wound healing risk factors include obesity smaller closure stitches use mesh closing open surgeries may decrease risk hernia occurrence however use mesh limited surgery performed contamination risk colon resected hernias may form mesenteric defect common gastric bypass surgery internal hernias may cause ischemia require emergency surgery resolve common complication abdominal surgeries adhesions adhesions bands scar tissue form surgery injury abdomen displace obstruct areas bowel approximately emergency surgeries due adhesive bowel obstruction possible managed without surgery iv fluids ng tube drain stomach intestines bowel rest eating obstruction resolves signs bowel ischemia perforation present emergency surgery required laparoscopic adhesiolysis common surgery used bowel rest medical management fail resolve large amounts small bowel resected cause short bowel syndrome short bowel syndrome failure absorption nutrients due resection portions small bowel limited single nutrient total malabsorption distal ileum resected commonly causes mild form short bowel syndrome deficiency vitamin entire small bowel resected cause chronic acute form lasts one month following bowel resection symptoms include diarrhea malabsorption metabolic derangements treated primarily iv fluids electrolyte replacement acute short bowel syndrome followed adaptation phase last two years time small bowel slows movement bowel contents allow absorption half patients short bowel syndrome progress chronic disease chronic short bowel syndrome may require total parenteral nutrition chronic central line use may cause complications bacteremia sepsis complications short bowel syndrome chronic diarrhea high
