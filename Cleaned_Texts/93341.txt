evolutionary developmental biology inversion refers hypothesis course animal evolution structures along dorsoventral dv axis taken orientation opposite ancestral form inversion first noted french zoologist étienne geoffroy sainthilaire dissected crayfish arthropod compared vertebrate body plan idea heavily criticised periodically resurfaced supported molecular embryologists early french zoologist étienne geoffroy sainthilaire noted organization dorsal ventral structures arthropods opposite mammals five decades later light darwins theory descent modification german zoologist anton dohrn proposed groups arose common ancestor possessed body plan similar modern annelids ventral nerve cord dorsal whereas arrangement retained arthropods protostomes chordate deuterostomes nerve cord located dorsally heart ventrally inversion hypothesis met scornful criticism time proposed periodically resurfaced however modern molecular embryologists suggest recent findings support idea inversion addition simple observation dorsoventral axes protostomes chordates appear inverted respect molecular biology provides support inversion hypothesis notable piece evidence comes analysis genes involved establishing dv axis two fruit fly drosophila melanogaster well protostomes βtype transforming growth factor tgfβ family member decapentaplegic dpp expressed dorsally thought suppress neural fate ventral side embryo dpp inhibitor short gastrulation sog expressed thus allowing nervous tissue form ventrally chordates dpp homolog expressed prospective ventral nonneural part embryo several soglike bmp inhibitors chordin noggin follistatin expressed patterning genes also show conserved domains expression neural patterning genes vnd ind msh netrin expressed drosophila ventral nerve cells midline mesectoderm chordate homologs genes netrin expressed dorsal neural tube furthermore gene expressed early cells become heart drosophila dorsally chordates additional support comes work development polychaete annelid platynereis dumerilii another protostome even drosophila pattern centralnervoussystem development strikingly similar vertebrates also evidence leftright asymmetry vertebrates highly conserved nodal signaling pathway acts left side body determining leftright asymmetries internal organs sea urchins signaling pathway acts right side even shown opposing rightsided signal regulating leftright asymmetry vertebrates ie bmp signaling pathway activated left side sea urchin suggesting axial inversion evolution basal deuterostome chordate amphioxus nodal signaling pathway amphioxus left side embryo situation sea urchins like echinoderms radiallysymmetric adults bilaterallysymmetric larvae since sea urchins deuterostomes suggests ancestral deuterostome shared orientation protostomes dorsoventral inversion originated ancestral chordate evidence invertebrate chordates also inverted ascidian larvae dorsal mouth one would expect amphioxus odd feature mouth appears left side migrates ventral biologist thurston lacalli speculates may recapitulation migration mouth dorsal ventral side biologists proposed hemichordates specifically enteropneusta may represent intermediate body plan evolution inverted state though considered deuterostomes dorsoventral axis hemichordates retains features protostomes chordates example enteropneusts ectodermallyderived dorsal nerve cord collar region proposed homologous chordate neural tube however also ventral nerve cord dorsal contractile vessel similar furthermore relative positions intermediate structures hemichordates hepatic organs ventral pygochord proposed homologous chordatedefining retained inverted nüblerjung arendt argue principal innovation chordate lineage obliteration mouth neural side hemichordates arthropods annelids development new mouth nonneural ventral idea dorsoventral axis inversion appears supported morphological molecular data others proposed alternative plausible hypotheses reviewed gerhart one assumption inversion hypothesis common ancestor protostomes chordates already possessed organized central nervous system located one pole dorsoventral axis alternatively ancestor may possessed diffuse nerve net several bundles nervous tissue distinct dorsoventral localization would mean apparent inversion simply result concentration central nervous system opposite poles independently lineages leading protostomes chordates lacalli suggested scenario ancestor single opening digestive system neural nonneural mouths arose independently protostomes chordates hypothesis need inversion martindale henry propose ctenophorelike ancestor biradial rather bilateral concentrated nerve cord two anal pores opposite sides animal addition terminal gut one pores became mouth protostomes became mouth deuterostomes would also preclude inversion another alternative proposed von salviniplawen states ancestor twopart nervous system one part concentrated diffuse nervous systems protostome deuterostome descendants ancestor may arisen independently two distinct axial twist theory proposes whole body anterior region head theories de lussanet also explain presence optic chiasm vertebrates contralateral organization forebrain one supported developmental evidence even explains asymmetric organization heart
