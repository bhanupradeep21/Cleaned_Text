specimen making holotype gsc housed museum geological survey preserving carapace segments discovered guelph formation elora canada british blacksmith archaeologist david boyle many years collected fossils formation fossil brought museum geological survey canada trustees persons position trust elora school museum described joseph frederick whiteaves british paleontologist erected new species genus eurypterus e boylei whose specific name honors american paleontologists john mason clarke rudolf ruedemann identified e boylei aberrant form sufficiently different eurypterus subgenus tylopterus favored features like short compact body general thick calcareouschitinous integument e boylei unlike eurypterus chitinous also compared species eurypterid species woodwardopterus scabrosus hibbertopterus stevensoni part eurypterus ornamentation also thick calcium characteristic also present gerontic elder specimens anthraconectes today recognized synonym adelophthalmus clarke ruedemann denied close relationship subgenera since lived different marine conditions anthraconectes lived brackish fresh water tylopterus lived saline water name tylopterus composed ancient greek words τύλη túlē knot πτερόν pteron wing therefore translated knot norwegian paleontologist geologist leif størmer replaced name tylopterus tylopterella preoccupied name originally coined curculionid beetle genus tylopterus introduced french entomologist guillaume capiomont tylopterella would begin appear scientific papers separate genus eurypterus apparent status separate genus reaffirmed american paleontologist erik norman kjellesvigwaering claimed tylopterella differed eurypterid genus peculiar species stylonurus menneri assigned tylopterella russian paleontologist nestor ivanovich novojilov based possession paired tubercles tergites characteristic dubiously present one specimen however species redescribed study led british paleontologist david j marshall determining represent eurypterid new chasmataspidid genus named dvulikiaspis thus rendering tylopterella monotypic tylopterella classified part family onychopterellidae clade group within monotypic superfamily onychopterelloidea includes single species boylei silurian guelph formation elora originally described species tylopterella recognized different subgenus british professor scott simpson compared tubercles drepanopterus abonensis tylopterella recognizing validity genus reluctantly basis known specimen tylopterella could referred drepanopterus kjellesvigwaering identified tylopterella genus due similarities erieopterus microphthalmus e eriensis suggested boylei could descended directly tylopterella classified part family eurypteridae american paleontologist victor p tollerton classified incertae sedis taxon unclear relationships due scarce material lack obvious features however british geologist paleobiologist james c lamsdell created new superfamily onychopterelloidea family onychopterellidae assigning tylopterella onychopterella latter family characterized presence spines second fourth pairs appendages lack spines fifth sixth except occasionally spurs eighth podomere leg segment sixth appendage shape carapace lateral eyes lanceolate styliform telson lamsdell rejected alliance drepanopterus alkenopterus assigned onychopterellidae three years later detection movable spine swimming leg rather simple projection protruding body part previously cladogram based larger study simplified show eurypterids phylogenetic analysis carried lamsdell showcasing basal members eurypterina
