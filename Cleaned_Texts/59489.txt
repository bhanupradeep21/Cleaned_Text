pollen mix came plant species typical area drop us government responded findings arguing pollen added deliberately order make substance could easily inhaled ensure retention toxins human meselson responded idea stating rather farfetched imagine somebody would produce chemical weapon gathering pollen predigested fact pollen originated southeast asia meant soviet union could manufactured
