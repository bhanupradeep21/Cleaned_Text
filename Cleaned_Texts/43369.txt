penile injury medical emergency afflicts penis common injuries include fracture avulsion injury strangulation entrapment penetrating blunt traumas combined make approximately civilian penile injuries burns accidents making remaining penile fractures result rupture tunica albuginea fairly rare cooccur partial complete urethral rupture though urethral damage occurs fractures treated emergency surgery diagnosed ultrasound especially pediatric penile fractures caused trauma erect penis typically suddenly bending laterally penetrative intercourse receptive partner top penetrating partner masturbation characterized loud popping sound time injury result tunica albuginea rupturing symptoms include severe pain loss erection symptoms urethral injury include hematuria blood meatus left untreated complications result cases include permanent curvature penis fistula urethral diverticulum priapism erectile degloving avulsion injuries involve removal penis skin serious medical emergency treatment injuries involves either closure torn skin skin graft replace skin lost injury skin grafts constructed attempt preserve erectile function strangulation injuries penis also called incarceration injuries caused hair rubber bands objects second common soft tissue injury hair strangulation may hard diagnose due anatomy penis hair causing strangulation may hidden coronal sulcus adults strangulation injuries require medical treatment caused variety objects typically used purpose sexual gratification extending time erection enuresis including metal rings must removed specialized cutting instruments object also removed decompressing vasculature penis compressed variety complications result strangulation injuries depending whether veins arteries compressed including mild reversible vascular obstruction ischemic necrosis gangrene kidney damage lymphedema ulceration urethrocutaneous fistula loss sensation urethral injury sepsis penile strangulation injuries require medical attention rare since first description approximately reported cases though usually acute cases chronic strangulation acute cases lasting one month various objects involved cases strangulation common softtissue injury entrapment injury involving penis caught zipper injuries particularly common young children uncircumcised always superficial treated removing zipper local anesthesia using bone cutter lubrication hacksaw dismantling zipper removing affected tissue prevented situations treated promptly affected tissue swell become cases emergency circumcision softtissue injuries penis caused burns animal bites human animal bites common children dogs common animals involved though typically severe animal bites cause amputation treatment animal bites human bites involves antibiotic treatment closure wounds secondary intention penis burns severe often require specialized care burn unit prevent contractures severe scarring complications including lymphedema hypospadias treatment involve debridement skin grafts antibiotics use suprapubic catheter thin skin penis susceptible fullthickness thirddegree burns burns penis typically cooccur severe burns thermal penis burns first second degree burns caused flame caused grease boiling water electrical burns typically deeper thermal burns require extensive tissue amputation penis either partial complete often selfinflicted people psychiatric disorders may occur trauma assault mechanical accident injuries treated reimplantation possible without anastomosis vasculature restore erectile function skin necrosis loss sensation common complications treatment microsurgery vasculature decreases risk necrosis klingsor syndrome psychiatric disorder causes selfharm involve penis paranoid schizophrenia eating disorders psychotic breaks also associated penile cases transgender people able access genital surgery may selfamputate favorable prognostic factors replantation amputated penises include short ischemic time clean incision opposed crush injury ragged replantation amputated penis done hours injury though fewer hours cold ischemia hours warm ischemia leads best outcomes replantation possible desired penile stump closed phalloplasty could performed penetrating injuries caused accidents sexual activities typically foreign objects inserted urethra weapons ie bullets wartime stabbing injuries varying severity superficial affect corpora cavernosa soft tissue andor cases urethra foreign objects may removed like penetrating object soft tissue using forceps gentle traction however foreign object inserted urethra damaged urethra transversely urethography used avoid injury urinary tract removing penetrating injuries make approximately civilian penile causes penile injury mostly causes trauma however penile injury likely occur sexual intercourse masturbation traumas nocturnal erections sleeping positions another cause penile injury industrial automobile accidents also cause penile injury selfinjury may also affect penile trauma diagnosed history physical examination hearing snapping popping sound immediate penile pain swollen bruised often known eggplant deformity may notice blood urethral cases ultrasonography indicate extent injury help clinician decide injured person needs surgical important rule urethral injury penile injury urological emergency may result significant morbidity left type injury dictates treatment however surgery common treatment traumatic penile injury warrant emergency repairing surgery prevent complications maintain functionality penis sexually urologically catheterization usually part treatment penis injuries urethra intact urethral catheterization may used injured suprapubic catheterization used injuries including animal bites also treated antibiotics irrigation rabies common complications penile injury erectile dysfunction abnormal penile curvature penile abscess formation fibrotic plaques painful erection urethral stricture
