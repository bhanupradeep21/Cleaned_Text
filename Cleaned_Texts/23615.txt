encephalopathy ɛnˌsɛfəˈlɒpəθi ancient greek ἐνκέφαλος brain πάθος suffering means disorder disease brain especially chronic degenerative modern usage encephalopathy refer single disease rather syndrome overall brain dysfunction syndrome many possible organic inorganic causes hallmark encephalopathy altered mental state delirium characteristic altered mental state impairment cognition attention orientation cycle altered state consciousness may range failure selective attention hypervigilance may present without cognitive deficits headache epileptic seizures myoclonus involuntary twitching muscle group muscles asterixis flapping tremor hand wrist depending type severity encephalopathy common neurological symptoms loss cognitive function subtle personality changes inability concentrate neurological signs may include dysarthria hypomimia problems movements clumsy slow ataxia neurological signs may include involuntary grasping sucking motions nystagmus rapid involuntary eye movement jactitation restlessness bedcitation needed respiratory abnormalities cheynestokes respiration cyclic waxing waning tidal volume apneustic respirations posthypercapnic apnea focal neurological deficits less wernicke encephalopathy cooccur korsakoff alcoholic syndrome characterized amnesticconfabulatory syndrome retrograde amnesia anterograde amnesia confabulations invented memories poor recall antinmda receptor encephalitis common autoimmune encephalitis cause paranoid grandiose delusions agitation hallucinations visual auditory bizarre behavior fear shortterm memory loss hiv encephalopathy lead dementia many types encephalopathy examples include chemotherapy medication example fludarabine cause permanent severe global ifosfamide cause severe encephalopathy reversible stopping use drug starting use methylene bevacizumab endothelial growth factor medication cause posterior reversible encephalopathy therapeutic interventions doubleedged swords benefits adverse effects pharmacotherapy exception shortly introduction conventional antipsychotic drugs clinical practice relatively rare serious complications hyperthermia muscle rigidity autonomic instability disturbed mental status recognized develop patients treated antipsychotics type encephalopathy induced use antipsychotics referred neuroleptic malignant syndrome nms almost physicians prescribing antipsychotics nowadays aware adverse phenomenon another wellknown type encephalopathy associated psychotropic drug therapy serotonin toxicity st serotonin syndrome ss characterized autonomic neuromuscular symptoms altered mental status contrast idiosyncratic nature nms st spectrum pathophysiological state assumed derive excess serotonergic neural transmission caused serotoninrelated psychotropic agents two decades pharmacotherapy psychotropic drugs mentally ill patients dramatically changed classical prototypal antipsychotics antidepressants replaced atypical antipsychotics selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssris respectively newly developed psychotropic drugs generally safer tolerable older drugs however atypical antipsychotics free risk development nms explosive prevalence ssris prescribed depression also number psychiatric diagnoses anxiety eating impulsecontrol personality disorders may increase incidence st therefore two pathological states still remain major adverse effects psychotropic drugs involving altered functioning central nervous system cns clinicians prescribing psychoactive drugs pay attention popularity ssris also increased case reports patients experiencing discontinuation syndrome sometimes includes cns symptoms like anxiety irritability chapter author provides comprehensive overview mentioned adverse effects affecting cns function associated psychotropic pharmacotherapy addition several pathological conditions potentially causing encephalopathic symptoms psychiatric patients treated psychotropic drugs eg hyponatremia valproateinduced hyperammonemia transient splenial lesion corpus callosum also describedcitation needed blood tests cerebrospinal fluid examination lumbar puncture also known spinal tap brain imaging studies electroencephalography eeg neuropsychological testing similar diagnostic studies may used differentiate various causes encephalopathy diagnosis frequently clinical set tests give diagnosis entire presentation illness nonspecific test results informs experienced clinician diagnosis treatment varies according type severity encephalopathy anticonvulsants may prescribed reduce halt seizures changes diet nutritional supplements may help people severe cases dialysis organ replacement surgery may needed sympathomimetic drugs increase motivation cognition motor performance alertness persons encephalopathy caused brain injury chronic infections strokes brain encephalopathy caused untreated celiac disease nonceliac gluten sensitivity glutenfree diet stops progression brain damage improves treating underlying cause disorder may improve reverse symptoms however cases encephalopathy may cause permanent structural changes irreversible damage brain permanent deficits considered form stable dementia encephalopathies fatal encephalopathy difficult term used denote either disease finding ie observable sign person referring finding encephalopathy refers permanent brain injury reversible one due direct injury brain illness remote brain individual findings cause clinician refer person encephalopathy include intellectual disability irritability agitation delirium confusion somnolence stupor coma psychosis describing person clinical picture encephalopathy specific description referring disease encephalopathy refers wide variety brain disorders different etiologies prognoses implications example prion diseases cause transmissible spongiform encephalopathies invariably fatal encephalopathies reversible number causes including nutritional deficiencies
