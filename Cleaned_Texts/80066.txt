cushing reflex also referred vasopressor response cushing effect cushing reaction cushing phenomenon cushing response cushings law physiological nervous system response increased intracranial pressure icp results cushings triad increased blood pressure irregular breathing usually seen terminal stages acute head injury may indicate imminent brain herniation also seen intravenous administration epinephrine similar first described detail american neurosurgeon harvey cushing cushing reflex classically presents increase systolic pulse pressure reduction heart rate bradycardia irregular caused increased pressure inside symptoms indicative insufficient blood flow brain ischemia well compression response rising intracranial pressure icp respiratory cycles change regularity rate different patterns indicate different location brain injury increase ventilation exhibited increase rate rather depth ventilation cushing reflex often associated slow irregular result defective regulation heart rate blood pressure physiologic response decreased blood flow peripherally present mayer waves simply pathologic waves seen hr tracings ie arterial lines electrocardiograph ecg etc reflect decreased intravascular blood flow decreased flow often causes reflexive htn hypertension increase blood pressure despite actual decrease intravascular whenever cushing reflex occurs high probability death seconds minutes result cushing reflex indicates need immediate care since presence good detector high icp often useful medical field particularly neurosurgery performed brain always likelihood raised intracranial pressure may occur early recognition crucial well patient although direct measurement icp possible always accurate past physicians nurses relied hemodynamic changes bradycardia late phase reflex identify icp increase initial stage cushing reflex bradycardia combined hypertension discovered offered much reliable swift warning sign high found hypertension bradycardia occurred time cerebral perfusion pressure cpp dropped mmhg due raised icp also cushing reflex known arise acute prolonged raises icp thus used tool physicians differentiate acute chronic rises also reported presence cushing reflex due icp increase could allow one conclude ischemia occurred posterior cranial finally cushing reflex may one many ways identify patient rejected transplanted organ aside innate autoimmune response ischemia cranial region detected transplanted organ presence cushing reflex due icp indicate ischemia may occurring due foreign organ rejectioncitation needed first postulated harvey cushing raised intracranial pressure primary cause cushing furthermore continued moderate increases cranial pressure allows cushing reflex occur contrast rapid dramatic pressure rises allow mechanism reflex sufficiently take elevated intracranial pressure result numerous pathways brain impairment including subarachnoid hemorrhages ischemia meningitis trauma including concussions hypoxia tumors stroke one study confirmed raised icp due subarachnoid hemorrhaging causes mechanical distortion brainstem specifically medulla due mechanism cushing reflex brainstem distortion swiftly followed sympathetic nervous system addition typical neurosurgical procedures patients especially involving neuroendoscopic techniques frequent washing ventricles known cause high intracranial cushing reflex also result low cpp specifically cpp normally falls mmhg adult human mmhg childrencitation needed brain plateau wave changes also associated cushing reflex waves characterized acute rises icp accompanied decrease cerebral perfusion pressure found cushing reflex occurs brain plateau wave changes erased due disappearance high cushing reflex complex seemingly reflex begins event causes increased intracranial pressure icp since cerebrospinal fluid located area surrounded skull increased icp consequently increases pressure fluid pressure cerebral spinal fluid eventually rises point meets gradually exceeds mean arterial blood pressure map icp exceeds map arterioles located brains cerebrum become compressed compression results diminished blood supply brain condition known cerebral increase icp sympathetic nervous system parasympathetic nervous system activated first stage reflex sympathetic nervous system stimulation much greater parasympathetic sympathetic response activates adrenergic receptors causing constriction bodys constriction raises total resistance blood flow elevating blood pressure high levels known hypertension bodys induced hypertension attempt restore blood flow ischemic brain sympathetic stimulation also increases rate heart contractions cardiac increased heart rate also known tachycardia combined hypertension first stage cushing reflexcitation needed meanwhile baroreceptors aortic arch detect increase blood pressure trigger parasympathetic response via vagus nerve induces bradycardia slowed heart rate signifies second stage bradycardia may also caused increased icp due direct mechanical distortion vagus nerve subsequent parasympathetic responsecitation needed furthermore reflexive increase parasympathetic activity thought contribute formation cushing ulcers stomach due uncontrolled activation parietal cells blood pressure expected remain higher pressure raised cerebral spinal fluid continue allow blood flow brain pressure rises point overcomes resisting pressure compressed artery blood allowed providing oxygen hypoxic area brain increase blood pressure sufficient compensate compression artery infarction raised icp tachycardia endogenous stimulus result distortion andor increased pressure brainstem since brainstem controls involuntary breathing changes homeostasis often results irregular respiratory pattern andor third final stage reflex role central chemoreceptors cushing reflex unclear normal pressure responses chemoreceptors baroreceptors work together increase decrease blood pressure cushing reflex central chemoreceptors likely involved detection ischemia contributing sympathetic surge hypertension first phase reflex work opposition baroreceptors contributing combined high sympathetic parasympathetic raised intracranial pressure ultimately result shifting crushing brain tissue detrimental physiological wellbeing patients result cushing reflex lastditch effort body maintain homeostasis brain widely accepted cushing reflex acts baroreflex homeostatic mechanism maintenance blood pressure cranial specifically reflex mechanism maintain normal cerebral blood flow pressure stressful situations ischemia subarachnoid hemorrhages case report patient underwent spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage demonstrated cushing reflex played part maintaining cerebral perfusion pressure cpp cerebral blood eventually icp drops level range state induced hypertension form cushing reflex longer required cushing reflex aborted cpp maintained also shown increase mean arterial pressure due hypertension characteristic reflex cause normalization effect protective especially increased intracranial pressure creates drop cppcitation needed cushings triad clinical triad variably defined

naunyn german pathologist contemporary cushing made remarks claiming cushing neither cited cushings research expanded results found original although lot progress made since harvey cushing first expanded knowledge known cushing reflex still many aspects research remain seen exact pathogenesis disease remains possibility intracranial pressure icp may sole cause cushing reflex per se came

fellow researchers showed cushing reflex directed autonomic nervous system since physiological change balance sympathetic nervous system parasympathetic nervous however specific relation autonomic nervous system response cushing reflex symptoms yet determined rate respiration affected cushing reflex though respiratory changes induced still area needs researchers reported apnea others reported increased respiratory researchers found increases respiratory rate follow icp decreases others say response icp one must also take account use anesthetics early research initially performed animals patients anesthesia used experiments led respiratory depression might effect early experiments also put animal subjects artificial ventilation allowing limited conclusions respiration cushing use anesthetics proposes ideas future research since creation cushing response difficult create basal conditions without researchers also suggested longterm effect cushing thus far observed immediate acute response evidence suggest effects could prolonged longterm raise blood heightened sensitivity neurological response systems leading arterial hypertension also possible although cushing reflex
