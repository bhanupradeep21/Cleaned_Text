mcgurk effect perceptual phenomenon demonstrates interaction hearing vision speech perception illusion occurs auditory component one sound paired visual component another sound leading perception third visual information person gets seeing person speak changes way hear person getting poorquality auditory information goodquality visual information may likely experience mcgurk integration abilities audio visual information may also influence whether person experience effect people better sensory integration shown susceptible many people affected differently mcgurk effect based many factors including brain damage disorders first described paper harry mcgurk john macdonald titled hearing lips seeing voices nature december effect discovered accident mcgurk research assistant macdonald asked technician dub video different phoneme one spoken conducting study infants perceive language different developmental stages video played back researchers heard third phoneme rather one spoken mouthed effect may experienced video one phonemes production dubbed soundrecording different phoneme spoken often perceived phoneme third intermediate phoneme example syllables baba spoken lip movements gaga perception dada mcgurk macdonald originally believed resulted common phonetic visual properties b two types illusion response incongruent audiovisual stimuli observed fusions ba auditory ga visual produce da combinations ga auditory ba visual produce brains effort provide consciousness best guess incoming information coming eyes ears contradictory instance eyes visual information greater effect brain thus fusion combination responses vision primary sense speech perception multimodal means involves information one sensory modality particular audition vision mcgurk effect arises phonetic processing integration audio visual information happens early speech mcgurk effect robust knowledge seems little effect ones perception different certain optical illusions break one sees people including researching phenomenon twenty years experience effect even aware taking exception people identify said lip reading alone people quite limited ability identify speech visualonly extensive phenomenon ability visual speech increase intelligibility heard speech noisy visible speech also alter perception perfectly audible speech sounds visual speech stimuli mismatched auditory normally speech perception thought auditory however use information immediate automatic large degree therefore despite widely accepted true speech something speech perceived senses working together seeing touching listening face brain often unaware separate sensory contributions therefore comes recognizing speech brain differentiate whether seeing hearing incoming also examined relation witness testimony wareham wrights study showed inconsistent visual information change perception spoken utterances suggesting mcgurk effect may many influences everyday perception limited syllables effect occur whole effect daily interactions people unaware research area provide information theoretical questions also provide therapeutic diagnostic relevance disorders relating audio visual integration speech hemispheres brain make contribution mcgurk work together integrate speech information received auditory visual senses mcgurk response likely occur righthanded individuals face privileged access right hemisphere words left people callosotomies done mcgurk effect still present significantly people lesions left hemisphere brain visual features often play critical role speech language people lesions left hemisphere brain show greater mcgurk effect normal visual information strongly influences speech perception lack susceptibility mcgurk illusion left hemisphere damage resulted deficit visual segmental speech people right hemisphere damage impairment visualonly audiovisual integration tasks exhibited although still able integrate information produce mcgurk integration appears visual stimuli used improve performance auditory signal impoverished therefore mcgurk effect exhibited people damage right hemisphere brain effect strong normal group dyslexic individuals exhibit smaller mcgurk effect normal readers chronological age showed effect readinglevel agematched dyslexics particularly differed combination responses fusion smaller mcgurk effect may due difficulties dyslexics perceiving producing consonant children specific language impairment show significantly lower mcgurk effect average use less visual information speech perception reduced attention articulatory gestures trouble perceiving auditoryonly children autism spectrum disorders asd showed significantly reduced mcgurk effect children however stimulus nonhuman example bouncing tennis ball sound bouncing beach ball scored similarly children without younger children asd show reduced mcgurk effect however diminishes age individuals grow effect show becomes closer suggested weakened mcgurk effect seen people asd due deficits identifying auditory visual components speech rather integration said components although distinguishing speech components speech components may isomorphic integrating adults languagelearning disabilities exhibit much smaller mcgurk effect people influenced visual input therefore people poor language skills produce smaller mcgurk effect reason smaller effect population may uncoupled activity anterior posterior regions brain left right cerebellar basal ganglia etiology also possible patients alzheimers disease ad smaller mcgurk effect exhibited often reduced size corpus callosum produces hemisphere disconnection less influence visual stimulus seen patients ad reason lowered mcgurk mcgurk effect pronounced schizophrenic individuals nonschizophrenic individuals however significantly different schizophrenia slows development audiovisual integration allow reach developmental peak however degradation schizophrenics likely rely auditory cues visual cues speech people aphasia show impaired perception speech conditions visualonly auditoryonly audiovisual therefore exhibited small mcgurk greatest difficulty aphasics visualonly condition showing use auditory stimuli speech small study per group showed apparent difference individuals bipolar disorder without respect mcgurk effect however people bipolar disorder showed significantly lower scores lipreading task may suggest neural pathways formed activated integration auditory visual speech information individuals bipolar disorder different compared people without mental discrepancy vowel category significantly reduced magnitude mcgurk effect fusion auditory tokens dubbed onto visual articulations compatible could wide range articulatory configurations whereas makes much easier subjects detect discrepancies vowel contexts produce strongest effect produces moderate effect u almost mcgurk effect stronger right side speakers mouth viewers left people tend get visual information right side speakers mouth left even whole relates hemispheric attention factors discussed brain hemispheres section mcgurk effect weaker visual distractor present listener attending visual attention modulates audiovisual speech another form distraction movement speaker stronger mcgurk effect elicited speakers facehead motionless rather strong mcgurk effect seen clickvowel syllables compared weak effects isolated shows mcgurk effect happen nonspeech phonological significance necessary condition mcgurk effect occur however increase strength females show stronger mcgurk effect males women show significantly greater visual influence auditory speech men brief visual stimuli difference apparent full another aspect regarding gender issue male faces voices stimuli comparison female faces voices stimuli although difference strength mcgurk effect either male face dubbed female voice vice versa still difference strength mcgurk knowing voice hear different face see even different genders doesnt eliminate mcgurk subjects familiar faces speakers less susceptible mcgurk effect unfamiliar faces hand difference regarding voice semantic congruency significant impact mcgurk effect experienced often rated clearer semantically congruent condition relative incongruent person expecting certain visual auditory appearance based semantic information leading mcgurk effect greatly mcgurk effect observed listener also speaker looking oneself mirror articulating visual stimuli listening another auditory stimulus strong mcgurk effect condition listener speaks auditory stimuli softly watching another person articulate conflicting visual gestures mcgurk effect still seen although temporal synchrony necessary mcgurk effect subjects still strongly influenced auditory stimuli even lagged visual stimuli milliseconds point mcgurk effect begins less tolerance lack synchrony auditory stimuli preceded visual order produce significant weakening mcgurk effect auditory stimuli precede visual stimuli milliseconds lag mcgurk effect greatly reduced attention diverted tactile task touching touch sensory perception like vision audition therefore increasing attention touch decreases attention auditory visual senses eyes need fixate order integrate audio visual information speech difference mcgurk effect listener focusing anywhere speakers effect appear listener focuses beyond speakers order mcgurk effect become insignificant listeners gaze must deviate speakers mouth least whatever language listeners rely visual information degree speech perception mcgurk effects intensity differs across languages english spanish german italian turkish language listeners experience robust mcgurk effect japanese chinese listeners research mcgurk effect languages english japanese smaller mcgurk effect occurs japanese listeners english cultural practice face avoidance japanese people may diminish mcgurk effect well tone syllabic structures could also chinese listeners less susceptible visual cues similar japanese produce smaller effect english studies also show japanese listeners show developmental increase visual influence six english children japanese listeners identify incompatibility visual auditory stimuli better english greater ability could relate japaneses lacking consonant regardless listeners languages resort visual stimuli speech unintelligible mcgurk effect applies mcgurk effect works listeners every tested experiments conducted involving hardofhearing individuals individuals cochlear implants individuals tend weigh visual information speech heavily auditory comparison normalhearing individuals different unless one syllable regarding mcgurk experiment responses cochlearimplanted users produced responses normalhearing individuals auditory bilabial stimulus dubbed onto visual velar however auditory dental stimulus dubbed onto visual bilabial stimulus responses quite different mcgurk effect still present individuals impaired hearing using cochlear implants although quite different aspects measuring infants attention certain audiovisual stimuli response consistent mcgurk effect minutes couple days old infants imitate adult facial movements within weeks birth infants recognize lip movements speech point integration audio visual information happen proficient first evidence mcgurk effect seen four months however evidence found process habituating infant certain stimulus changing stimulus part bavoicedvavisual davoicedvavisual response simulates mcgurk effect becomes strength mcgurk effect displays developmental
