kidney failure also known endstage kidney disease medical condition kidneys longer adequately filter waste products blood functioning less normal kidney failure classified either acute kidney failure develops rapidly may resolve chronic kidney failure develops slowly often symptoms may include leg swelling feeling tired vomiting loss appetite complications acute chronic failure include uremia hyperkalaemia volume complications chronic failure also include heart disease high blood pressure causes acute kidney failure include low blood pressure blockage urinary tract certain medications muscle breakdown hemolytic uremic causes chronic kidney failure include diabetes high blood pressure nephrotic syndrome polycystic kidney diagnosis acute failure often based combination factors decreased urine production increased serum diagnosis chronic failure based glomerular filtration rate gfr less need renal replacement also equivalent stage chronic kidney treatment acute failure depends underlying treatment chronic failure may include hemodialysis peritoneal dialysis kidney hemodialysis uses machine filter blood outside peritoneal dialysis specific fluid placed abdominal cavity drained process repeated multiple times per kidney transplantation involves surgically placing kidney someone else taking immunosuppressant medication prevent recommended measures chronic disease include staying active specific dietary depression also common among patients kidney failure associated poor outcomes including higher risk kidney function decline hospitalization death recent pcorifunded study patients kidney failure receiving outpatient hemodialysis found similar effectiveness nonpharmacological pharmacological treatments united states acute failure affects per people chronic failure affects people per people newly developing condition acute failure often reversible chronic failure often appropriate treatment many chronic disease continue kidney failure divided two categories acute kidney failure chronic kidney failure type renal failure differentiated trend serum creatinine factors may help differentiate acute kidney failure chronic kidney failure include anemia kidney size sonography chronic kidney disease generally leads anemia small kidney sizecitation needed acute kidney injury aki previously called acute renal failure rapidly progressive loss renal generally characterized oliguria decreased urine production quantified less ml per day less mlkgh children less mlkgh infants fluid electrolyte imbalance aki result variety causes generally classified prerenal intrinsic postrenal many people diagnosed paraquat intoxication experience aki sometimes requiring hemodialysiscitation needed underlying cause must identified treated arrest progress dialysis may necessary bridge time gap required treating fundamental causescitation needed chronic kidney disease ckd also develop slowly initially show ckd long term consequence irreversible acute disease part disease progressioncitation needed ckd divided different stages according estimated glomerular filtration rate egfr egfr normal egfr decreased less acute kidney injuries present top chronic kidney disease condition called acuteonchronic kidney failure aocrf acute part aocrf may reversible goal treatment aki return person baseline kidney function typically measured serum creatinine like aki aocrf difficult distinguish chronic kidney disease person monitored physician baseline ie past blood work available comparisoncitation needed symptoms vary person person someone early stage kidney disease may feel sick notice symptoms occur kidneys fail filter properly waste accumulates blood body condition called azotemia low levels azotaemia may produce symptoms disease progresses symptoms become noticeable failure sufficient degree cause symptoms kidney failure accompanied noticeable symptoms termed symptoms kidney failure include acute kidney injury previously known acute renal failure aki usually occurs blood supply kidneys suddenly interrupted kidneys become overloaded toxins causes acute kidney injury include accidents injuries complications surgeries kidneys deprived normal blood flow extended periods time heartbypass surgery example one procedurecitation needed drug overdoses accidental chemical overloads drugs antibiotics chemotherapy along bee may also cause onset acute kidney injury unlike chronic kidney disease however kidneys often recover acute kidney injury allowing person aki resume normal life people acute kidney injury require supportive treatment kidneys recover function often remain increased risk developing future kidney among accidental causes renal failure crush syndrome large amounts toxins suddenly released blood circulation long compressed limb suddenly relieved pressure obstructing blood flow tissues causing ischemia resulting overload lead clogging destruction kidneys reperfusion injury appears release crushing pressure mechanism believed release bloodstream muscle breakdown products notably myoglobin potassium phosphorus products rhabdomyolysis breakdown skeletal muscle damaged ischemic conditions specific action kidneys fully understood may due part nephrotoxic metabolites myoglobincitation needed chronic kidney failure numerous causes common causes chronic failure diabetes mellitus longterm uncontrolled polycystic kidney disease another wellknown cause chronic failure majority people affected polycystic kidney disease family history disease systemic lupus erythematosus sle also known cause chronic kidney failure genetic illnesses cause kidney failure wellcitation needed overuse common drugs ibuprofen acetaminophen paracetamol also cause chronic kidney infectious disease agents hantavirus attack kidneys causing kidney gene proposed major genetic risk locus spectrum nondiabetic renal failure individuals african origin include hivassociated nephropathy hivan primary nonmonogenic forms focal segmental glomerulosclerosis hypertension affiliated chronic kidney disease attributed two western african variants shown associated end stage kidney disease african americans hispanic chronic kidney failure measured five stages calculated using persons gfr glomerular filtration rate stage ckd mildly diminished renal function overt symptoms stages need increasing levels supportive care medical providers slow treat renal dysfunction people stage kidney failure usually require preparation towards active treatment order survive stage ckd considered severe illness requires form renal replacement therapy dialysis kidney transplant whenever feasiblecitation needed normal gfr varies according many factors including sex age body size ethnic background renal professionals consider glomerular filtration rate gfr best overall index kidney national kidney foundation offers easy use online gfr anyone interested knowing glomerular filtration rate serum creatinine level simple blood test needed use calculator advancement modern medicine renal failure often referred uremic poisoning uremia term contamination blood urea presence excessive amount urea blood starting around included reduced urine output thought caused urine mixing blood instead voided urethracitation needed term uremia used illness accompanying kidney two urinary indices fractional sodium excretion fena index renal failure index renal failure index equal urine sodium times plasma creatinine divided urine fena score greater renal failure index rfi greater helpful confirming acute renal end stage renal failure undergo haemodialysis higher risk spontaneous intraabdominal bleeding general population nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia meanwhile undergoing peritoneal dialysis higher chance developing peritonitis gastrointestinal perforation however rate acute pancreatitis differ general treatment acute kidney injury depends treatment chronic kidney failure may include renal replacement therapy hemodialysis peritoneal dialysis kidney nondiabetics people type diabetes low protein diet found preventive effect progression chronic kidney disease however effect apply people type whole food plantbased diet may help people kidney high protein diet either animal plant sources appears negative effects kidney function least short people receive earlier referrals nephrology specialist meaning longer time must start dialysis shorter initial hospitalization reduced risk death start methods reducing disease progression include minimizing exposure nephrotoxins nsaids
