ethological concept speciestypical behavior based premise certain behavioral similarities shared almost members behaviors unique certain species speciestypical simply characteristic speciestypical behaviors almost always result similar nervous systems organisms species created influenced species genetic code social natural environment hence strongly influenced classic example speciestypical behavior breast crawl vast majority human newborns placed reclined mothers abdomen find begin suckle one mothers breasts without speciestypical behaviors sometimes tied certain structures brain murphy maclean hamilton gave hamsters brain lesions birth destroy certain brain discovered hamsters still expressed speciestypical behavior without neocortex lost much speciestypical play maternal behaviors deprived midline limbic likewise squirrel monkeys lose globus pallidus ability engage certain sexual behavior eg thighspreading grointhrusting either eliminated scientists may also use stimulation discover role structure speciestypical behavior experiment physiologist walter hess used electrode stimulate certain part resting cats brainstem immediately stimulation cat stood arched back erect speciestypical behavior cats engage behavior lasted long stimulation lasted ended soon stimulation later experiments revealed even part brain stimulated amount energy period time intensity elicited behavior changes depending context behavioral physiologist erich von holst attached electrode one part chickens briefly stimulated without unusual environmental factors chicken briefly stimulated presence human fist chicken reacted slightly threatening posture presence weasel chicken took threatening pose feathers brainstem case elicits speciestypical behavior appropriate surrounding presence density certain chemical receptors cranial structures brainstem often determines importance one speciestypical behavior another example monogamous prairie voles high density oxytocin receptors otrs nucleus accumbens nonmonogamous meadow voles manner hormones alter receptors important behavioral regulator example gonads affect otrs different rodents female rats gonadal estrogen increases level otr binding ovarian cycle maximizes amount estrogen bloodstream causes otrs appear ventrolateral regions structure called ventromedial turn increases likelihood female rat engage certain speciestypical sexual activity increasing sexual effect regulatory mechanism differs species though gonadectomy would decrease gonadal steroids would increase sexual receptivity female rat things would opposite impacts female speciestypical behavior learned parents also sometimes product fixed action pattern also known innate releasing mechanism irm instances neural network programmed create hardwired instinctive behavior response external stimulus blind child hears news makes happy shes likely smile response never taught smile never learned behavior seeing others similarly kittens shown picture cat threatening posture arch backs bare teeth sometimes even hiss even though theyve never seen another cat many irms explained theory adaptive behavior helps species survive long enough fruitful multiply cat hissing order discourage attack another creature genes coded brain circuits likely passed heavily studied example fixed action pattern feeding behavior helisoma trivolvis pulmonata type snail study shown intricate connections within buccal ganglia see nervous system gastropods form central system whereby sensory information stimulates feeding helisoma specifically unique system communication three classes neurons buccal ganglia responsible forming neural network influences speciestypical behavior altered experience shown experiments aplysia californica sea gills stimulated novel manner withdraws shell sake speciestypical behavior stimuli novel eg weak jet water applied repeatedly gills aplysia longer withdraws gone habituation process response stimulus becomes weaker exposure occurs changes nervous system neurons communicate one another synapses consist tip communicating cell presynpatic membrane tip receiving cell postsynaptic membrane space two synaptic presynaptic membrane stimulated influx calcium ions releases chemical called neurotransmitter travels synaptic cleft order bind postsynaptic membrane thereby stimulate receiving habituation fewer calcium ions brought presynaptic membrane meaning less neurotransmitter released meaning stimulation receiving cell strong meaning action supposed stimulate likewise number synapses related certain behavior decreases creature habituates also resulting weaker structure synapse altered number ways weaken communication eg decreased number neurotransmitter receptors postsynaptic processes

feel emotions often elicit certain behaviors behaviors facilitate survival different species physiologically adapted consume different foods must acquired different ways manner feed must correspond unique characteristics species complex nervous systems esp mammals addition acting based instinct basic sensory stimuli need learn engage certain activities ways nervous systems develop frequently adept learning certain behaviors specific times lives reproduction activity takes place members species order interact reproduce successfully members species must share common behaviors speciestypical reproductive behaviors specific reproductive activity two animals different species perceive world different ways nervous systems species develop concert certain anatomical features order produce
