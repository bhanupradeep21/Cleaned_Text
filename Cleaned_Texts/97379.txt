suggested enigmatic fragmentary bruhathkayosaurus possibly weighed tonnes short argentinosaurus definitely massive animal disagreement whether largest known titanosaur puertasaurus futalognkosaurus dreadnoughtus paralititan antarctosaurus giganteus alamosaurus considered comparable size argentinosaurus although others found notably carballido colleagues considered argentinosaurus smaller patagotitan since latter greater area enclosed neural spine diapophyses parapophyses anterior dorsal however paul found patagotitan smaller argentinosaurus due latters dorsal column considerably longer even argentinosaurus largestknown titanosaur sauropods including maraapunisaurus giant mamenchisaurid may larger although known scant remains diplodocids supersaurus may exceeded argentinosaurus length despite considerably less mass blue whale however greater tonnes short still exceeds known argentinosaurus likely possessed dorsal vertebrae like vertebrae enormous even

complex pattern numerous airfilled chambers camellate bone among sauropods especially pronounced largest longestnecked dorsal sacral vertebrae large cavities measuring centimetres dorsal ribs tubular cylindrical shape contrast bonaparte coria description noted ribs hollow unlike many sauropods later authors argued hollowing could also due erosion death argentinosaurus like many probably six sacral vertebrae hip region although last one preserved centra second fifth sacral vertebrae much reduced size considerably smaller centrum first sacral sacral ribs curved downwards second sacral rib larger preserved sacral ribs though size first unknown due incomplete preservation original position known dorsal vertebrae within vertebral column disputed dissenting configurations suggested bonaparte
