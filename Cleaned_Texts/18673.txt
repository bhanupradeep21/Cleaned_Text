sivaladapis genus adapiform primate lived asia middle sivaladapis extinct adapiform primate genus belongs family two species sivaladapis currently recognized nagrii sivaladapis considered one latest surviving genera adapiform primates existing well miocene south asia compared adapiform primates fossil record sivaladapis limited lacking cranial postcranial fossil material genus known exclusively isolated fossil teeth partial dentaries maxillae recovered chinji formation siwalik group india nagrii palaeindicus considered fairly large adapiforms bodysize estimates ranging prominent welldeveloped shearing crests molars premolars suggests genus adapted predominately folivorous diet subsisting fibrous hypothesized extinction sivaladapis around million years ago result immigration leafeating colobine monkeys south asia directly competed sival refers middle siwalik deposits indian subcontinent adapis referring type genus adapiformes fossiliferous siwalik deposits india pakistan known paleontologists decades producing plethora vertebrate fossils since early century british paleontologist guy e pilgrim described identified procyonid carnivore partial dentary collected lower siwalik deposits pakistan naming sivanasua description identified maximum two lower molars informed identification fossil procyonid affinities shortly pilgrims description ge lewis yale peabody museum recovered single lower molar nargi horizon middle siwalik deposits recognized morphology isolated tooth lorisid primate affinity named indraloris lulli however lacked sufficient fossil material make adequate anatomical comparisons place systematically ian tattersall american museum natural history recognized similarity morphology shared sivanasua additional fossil material sivanasua recovered middle siwalik deposits india allowed direct comparison indraloris additional fossils demonstrated dental formula sivanasua included maximum three lower molars two pilgrim initially described diagnostic feature procyonid carnivores loss resulting lower dental formula including lower molars moreover additional indraloris material lacked key synapomorphies aligning lorisid primates eg toothcomb pointed adapiform affinity instead thus additional fossils subsequent anatomical comparisons demonstrated sivanasua procyonid carnivore rather showed adapiform affinities sivanasua indraloris closely related represent two distinct adapiform genera acknowledging adapiform affinities gingerich renamed previously identified sivanasua material sivaladapis recognized two distinct species nagrii formerly sivanasua palaeindicus formerly sivanasua year gingerich sahni recognized two species thomas verma placed narigii palaeindicus species belonging genus indraloris subfamily sivaladapinae later promoted family level gingerich sahni assigned nagrii type species holotype nagrii represented partial right dentary preserves gsi collected middle siwaliks nagri formation near haritalyangar india holotype palaeindicus represented partial right dentary preserving gsi collected lower siwaliks chinji formation near chinji pakistan roughly million years mass extinction event cretaceouspaleogene boundary eliminated many organisms including nonavian dinosaurs adapiform primates appear simultaneously fossil record holarctic along many mammalian lineages rapidly evolved diversified adapiform omomyid primates first true primates appearing earliest eocene around million years within broader adapiform radiation sivaladapidae represents monophyletic group containing several genera species synapomorphies distinguishing recognized adapiform families key features differentiating sivaladapids adapiforms include upper molar shearing crests twinning hypolconulid entoconid lower molars continuous lingual cingulum upper molars within sivaladapidae three subfamilies currently recognized subfamilies distinguished containing sivaladapid genera exclusively share distinct morphology inherited recent common ancestor subfamilies also follow general sequence geologic age example hoanghoniines restricted eocene sivaladapiines found exclusively miocene deposits qi beard recovered new sivaladapid fossils late eocene gongkang formation china named guangxilemur described intermediate morphology age phylogenetic analysis guangxilemur recovered intermediate position eocene hoanghoniines miocene much research focused resolving evolutionary relationships within phylogenetic affinities within broader adapiform radiation still unclear derived features sivaladapis include following traits sivaladapis dental formula upper premolars become molarized front back cusps become numerous complex morphology well single rooted double rooted three roots upper molars display shearing crests sharp ectoloph supported welldeveloped distinct stylar cusps connected via buccal cingulum prominent lingual cingulum surrounds protocone hypocone unlike early eocene hoanghoniines sivaladapis derived fused mandible lower incisors highcrowned spatulate slightly larger size differences preserved lower canines sivaladapis suggests possible sexual dimorphism genus single rooted caniniform honing facet upper canine double rooted prominent protoconid paracristid orients anteriorly accessory crests run protoconid curve base crown short talonid completely molarized lacks entoconid open trigonid lower molars sivaladapis extremely highcrowned several prominent crests paraconids reduced crestlike entoconids take pointed given dental morphology ie upper lower molar cusps crests facilitate combination puncturing shearing occlusion inferred sivaladapis welladapted highly folivorous diet fibrous leaves moreover absence hypocone suggests grinding functional priority
