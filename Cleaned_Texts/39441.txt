several notable traits evolved within family including shortening skull arms well peculiarities cervical caudal vertebrae pronounced carnotaurus though relationships within abelisauridae debated

majungasaurus aucasaurus carnotaurus ilokelesia skorpiovenator ekrixinatosaurus carnotaurus known carnivorous bipedal animal pair horns frontal use horns entirely clear several interpretations revolved around use fighting conspecifics killing prey though use display courtship recognition members species possible greg paul proposed horns butting weapons small orbita would minimized possibility hurting eyes gerardo mazzetta colleagues suggested carnotaurus used horns way similar rams calculated neck musculature strong enough absorb force two individuals colliding heads frontally speed ms fernando novas interpreted several skeletal features adaptations delivering blows headas suggested shortness skull might made head movements quicker reducing moment inertia muscular neck would allowed strong head blows also noted enhanced rigidity strength spinal column may evolved withstand shocks conducted head neckat studies suggest rivaling carnotaurus deliver rapid head blows pushed slowly upper sides mazzetta colleagues argued horns may device distribution compression forces without damage brain supported flattened upper sides horns strongly fused bones top skull inability skull survive rapid head rafael delcourt suggested horns could used either slow headbutting shoving seen modern marine iguana blows opponents neck flanks seen modern latter possibility previously proposed related majungasaurus conference gerardo mazzetta colleagues propose horns might also used injure kill small prey though horn cores blunt may similar form modern bovid horns keratinous covering however would reported example horns used hunting weapons analyses jaw structure carnotaurus mazzetta colleagues suggest animal capable quick bites strong quick bites important strong bites capturing small prey shown studies modernday researchers also noted high degree flexibility kinesis within skull especially lower jaw somewhat similar modern snakes elasticity jaw would allowed carnotaurus swallow small prey items whole addition front part lower jaw hinged thus able move pressed downwards teeth would projected forward allowing carnotaurus spike small prey items teeth curved upwards backward projecting teeth would hindered caught prey mazzetta colleagues also found skull able withstand forces appear tugging large prey carnotaurus may therefore fed mainly relatively small prey also able hunt large mazzetta colleagues estimated bite force around study estimating bite force different dinosaurs suggests bite force carnotaurus around newtons anterior portion jaws slightly higher previous estimate posterior bite force back jaws meanwhile estimated interpretation questioned françois therrien colleagues found biting force carnotaurus twice american alligator may strongest bite living tetrapod researchers also noted analogies modern komodo dragons flexural strength lower jaw decreases towards tip linearly indicating jaws suited high precision catching small prey delivering slashing wounds weaken big prey consequence according study carnotaurus must mainly preyed upon large animals possibly cerroni colleagues argued flexibility restricted lower jaw thickened skull roof ossification several cranial joints suggest skull little robert bakker found carnotaurus mainly fed upon large prey especially sauropods noted several adaptations short snout relatively small teeth strong back skull independently evolved allosaurus features suggest upper jaw used like serrated club inflict wounds big sauropods would weakened repeated mazzetta colleagues presumed carnotaurus swift runner arguing thigh bone adapted withstand high bending moments running ability animals leg withstand forces limits top speed running adaptations carnotaurus would better
