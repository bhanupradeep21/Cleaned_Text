harry carlisle published first structure steroid cholesteryl iodide worked cholesteryls since days doctoral hodgkin colleagues including biochemist barbara low solved structure penicillin demonstrating contrary scientific opinion time contains βlactam ring work published hodgkin first encountered vitamin one structurally complex vitamins known created new crystals vitamin first discovered merck earlier year structure time almost completely unknown hodgkin discovered contained cobalt realized structure actualization could determined xray crystallography analysis large size molecule fact atoms largely unaccounted challenge structure analysis previously crystals deduced presence ring structure crystals pleochroic finding later confirmed using xray crystallography study published hodgkin described lawrence bragg significant breaking sound scientists merck previously crystallised published refractive indices final structure hodgkin later awarded nobel prize published insulin one hodgkins extraordinary research projects began offered small sample crystalline insulin robert robinson hormone captured imagination intricate wideranging effect body however stage xray crystallography developed far enough cope complexity insulin molecule others spent many years improving technique took years taking first photograph insulin crystal xray crystallography computing techniques able tackle larger complex molecules like insulin hodgkins dream unlocking structure insulin put hold finally able work team young international scientists uncover structure first time hodgkins work insulin instrumental paving way insulin massproduced used large scale treatment type one type two went cooperate laboratories active insulin research giving advice traveling world giving talks insulin importance future diabetes solving structure insulin two important implications treatment diabetes making mass production insulin possible allowing scientists alter structure insulin create even better drug options patients going hodgkins softspoken gentle modest demeanor hid steely determination achieve ends whatever obstacles might stand way inspired devotion students colleagues even junior knew simply dorothy structural studies biologically important molecules set standards field much development work life made fundamental contributions understanding molecules carry tasks living system hodgkins mentor professor john desmond bernal greatly influenced life scientifically politically personally bernal key scientific adviser uk government second world war also open vocal member communist party faithful supporter soviet regime invasion hungary chemist believed equal opportunity women laboratory hodgkin extended work began biological molecules including sterols helped
