etccitation needed currently specific cure treatment malouf syndrome however ways manage symptoms associated order treat dilated cardiomyopathy doctors normally use combination drugs depending symptoms might need two following list drugs used treat dilated cardiomyopathy angiotensinconverting enzyme ace inhibitors type medicine enlarges blood vessels lowers blood pressure order improve individuals blood flow type medicine cause dry cough low blood pressure low white blood cell count kidney liver problems angiotensin ii receptor blockers arbs alternative drug used person tolerate ace inhibitors drug cause diarrhea muscle cramps dizziness sacubitrilvalsartan entresto type drug combines arbs another medicinal drug help pump blood heart rest body drug mainly people chronic heart failure betablockers type drug slows heart rate lowers blood pressure medication may also prevent harmful effects stress hormones side effects medication include dizziness low blood pressure diuretics type drug removes excess fluid salt body well lungs digoxinlanoxin purpose drug strengthen heart muscle contractions slow heartbeat drug reduce heart failure symptoms improve ability active ivabradinecorlanor drug restores normal heartbeat slowing regulating heart rate bloodthinning medications anticoagulants type drug helps preventing blood clots cause bruising bleeding also therapeutic devices available specifically use devices implemented help treat dilated cardiomyopathy therapeutic biventricular pacemaker device sends electrical signals order control contractions left right ventricles implantable cardioverterdefibrillators icd device monitors heartbeat sends electric shocks control rapid abnormal heartbeats device also serve pacemaker left ventricular assist devices lvad device attached heart either abdomen chest order help weakened heart pump blood hypergonadotropic hypogonadism treated hormone replacement therapy consists taking medications containing hormone body lacking testosterone estrogen progesterone pituitary hormones replace ones body longer produces medication come form pills patches gels even injectionscitation needed prevalence malouf syndrome unknown moment fully defined families around world whose members cardiogential syndrome found literature however prevalence familial dilated cardiomyopathy ranges cases identifiable genetic dilated cardiomyopathy originally classified rare disease possibility familiar substrate ignored dilated cardiomyopathy later found major cause heart failure especially among young dilated cardiomyopathy began identified systemic condition rather isolated even despite major efforts contributions incidence prevalence dilated cardiomyopathy remain httpsenwikipediaorgwikimaloufsyndrome
