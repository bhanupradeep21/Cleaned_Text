exploring benefits urban forestry regional needs study australias capital canberra explored opportunities living infrastructure could provide mitigate conditions like increasing temperature drought authors identified urban forests one four kinds living infrastructure potential provide ecosystems services like cooling carbon sequestration improved hopeful high quality urban forest provide benefits authors emphasized importance planning collaboration across diverse stakeholders successful adelaide located south australias driest state examined potential green roofs combat urban heat island effect study found significant reductions temperature electricity usage cost addition green roofs made researchers concluded green roofs similar green infrastructure potential mitigate urban heat island effects however climate change impacts also bring challenges existing urban forest study southeastern australian suburbs showed half existing tree species considered vulnerable heat andor
