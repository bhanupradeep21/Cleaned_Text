neurosarcoidosis sometimes shortened neurosarcoid refers type sarcoidosis condition unknown cause featuring granulomas various tissues type involving central nervous system brain spinal cord neurosarcoidosis many manifestations abnormalities cranial nerves group twelve nerves supplying head neck area common may develop acutely subacutely chronically approximately percent people sarcoidosis organs eg lung develop central nervous system involvement percent people sarcoidosis neurosarcoidosis alone without involvement organs diagnosis difficult test apart biopsy achieving high accuracy rate treatment first case sarcoidosis involving nervous system reported abnormalities cranial nerves present percent cases common abnormality involvement facial nerve may lead reduced power

decreased sensation face trigeminal nerve hearing loss vertigo vestibulocochlear nerve swallowing problems glossopharyngeal nerve weakness shoulder muscles accessory nerve tongue hypoglossal nerve visual problems may also result papilledema swelling optic disc due obstruction granulomas normal cerebrospinal fluid csf seizures mostly tonicclonicgrand mal type present percent may presenting

lead abnormalities function area instance involvement internal capsule would lead weakness one two limbs one side body granulomas large exert mass effect cause headache increase risk seizures obstruction flow cerebrospinal fluid cause headaches visual symptoms mentioned features raised intracranial pressure involvement spinal cord rare lead abnormal sensation weakness one limbs cauda equina symptoms incontinence urine stool decreased sensation granulomas pituitary gland produces numerous hormones rare leads symptoms hypopituitarism amenorrhoea cessation menstrual cycle diabetes insipidus dehydration due inability concentrate urine hypothyroidism decreased activity thyroid hypocortisolism deficiency psychiatric problems occur percent cases many different disorders reported eg depression psychosis peripheral neuropathy reported percent cases symptoms due sarcoidosis organs may uveitis inflammation uveal layer eye dyspnoea shortness breath arthralgia joint pains lupus pernio red skin rash usually face erythema nodosum red skin lumps usually shins symptoms liver involvement jaundice heart involvement heart sarcoidosis disease unknown cause leads development granulomas various organs lungs typically involved organs may equally affected subforms sarcoidosis l√∂fgren syndrome may particular precipitant specific course unknown characteristics predispose sarcoidosis patients brain spinal cord diagnosis neurosarcoidosis often difficult definitive diagnosis made biopsy surgically removing tissue sample risks associated brain biopsies avoided much possible investigations may performed symptoms mentioned computed tomography ct magnetic resonance imaging mri brain lumbar puncture electroencephalography eeg evoked potential ep studies diagnosis sarcoidosis suspected typical xray ct appearances chest may make diagnosis likely elevations angiotensinconverting enzyme calcium blood make sarcoidosis likely past kveim test used diagnose sarcoidosis obsolete test high percent sensitivity required spleen tissue known sarcoidosis patient injected skin suspected biopsy suspicious lesions brain elsewhere considered useful definitive diagnosis neurosarcoidosis tissue sample would demonstrate granulomas collections inflammatory cells rich epithelioid cells surrounded immune system cells eg plasma cells mast cells biopsy may performed distinguish mass lesions tumours eg mri gadolinium enhancement useful neuroimaging test may show enhancement pia mater white matter lesions may resemble lesions seen multiple lumbar puncture may demonstrate raised protein level pleiocytosis ie increased presence lymphocytes neutrophil granulocytes oligoclonal bands various tests eg ace level csf little added recent papers propose classify neurosarcoidosis diagnoses likelihood neurosarcoidosis confirmed generally treated glucocorticoids prednisolone effective dose may gradually reduced although many patients need remain steroids longterm frequently leading sideeffects diabetes osteoporosis methotrexate hydroxychloroquine cyclophosphamide pentoxifylline thalidomide infliximab reported effective small studies patients unresponsive medical treatment radiotherapy may required granulomatous tissue causes obstruction mass effect neurosurgical intervention sometimes necessary seizures prevented anticonvulsants psychiatric phenomena may treated medication usually employed phenomena occurring neurosarcoid facial nerve involvement known good prognosis good response treatment longterm treatment usually necessary mortality rate estimated sarcoidosis prevalence per general population however though gg genotype gene found times higher odds sarcoidosis compared ag genotype aa genotype times lower furthermore common variable immunodeficiency cvid may even higher risk one study cvid patients found eight sarcoidosis suggesting high prevalence cvid populations one given less percent sarcoidosis neurological involvement possibly later disease course neurosarcoidosis prevalence less four per condition commonly affects young adults sexes although studies reported cases females incidence highest individuals younger peaks agegroup years second peak observed women sarcoidosis occurs throughout world races average incidence men women disease prevalent northern european countries highest annual incidence found sweden iceland united states sarcoidosis common people african descent caucasians annual incidence reported variable incidence neurosarcoidosis world may least partially attributable lack screening programs certain regions world overshadowing presence granulomatous diseases tuberculosis may interfere diagnosis sarcoidosis may also differences severity disease people different ethnicities several studies suggest presentation people african origin may severe disseminated caucasians likely asymptomatic manifestation appears slightly different according race sex erythema nodosum far common men
