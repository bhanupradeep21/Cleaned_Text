protein primary structure linear sequence amino acids peptide convention primary structure protein reported starting aminoterminal n end carboxylterminal c end protein biosynthesis commonly performed ribosomes cells peptides also synthesized laboratory protein primary structures directly sequenced inferred dna sequences amino acids polymerised via peptide bonds form long backbone different amino acid side chains protruding along biological systems proteins produced translation cells ribosomes organisms also make short peptides nonribosomal peptide synthesis often use amino acids standard may cyclised modified crosslinked peptides synthesised chemically via range laboratory methods chemical methods typically synthesise peptides opposite order starting cterminus biological protein synthesis

naturally occurring amino acids well mixtures ambiguous amino acids similar nucleic acid peptides directly sequenced inferred dna sequences large sequence databases exist collate known protein sequences general polypeptides unbranched polymers primary structure often specified sequence amino acids along backbone however proteins become crosslinked commonly disulfide bonds primary structure also requires specifying crosslinking atoms eg specifying cysteines involved proteins disulfide bonds crosslinks include desmosine chiral centers polypeptide chain undergo racemization although change sequence affect chemical properties sequence particular lamino acids normally found proteins spontaneously isomerize c α displaystyle mathrm calpha atom form damino acids cleaved proteases additionally proline form stable transisomers peptide bond additionally protein undergo variety posttranslational modifications briefly summarized nterminal amino group polypeptide modified covalently

listed important modification primary structure peptide cleavage chemical hydrolysis proteases proteins often synthesized inactive precursor form typically nterminal cterminal segment blocks active site protein inhibiting function protein activated cleaving inhibitory peptide proteins even power cleave typically hydroxyl group serine rarely threonine thiol group cysteine residue attack carbonyl carbon preceding peptide bond forming tetrahedrally bonded intermediate classified hydroxyoxazolidine serthr hydroxythiazolidine cys intermediate intermediate tends revert amide form expelling attacking group since amide form usually favored free energy presumably due strong resonance stabilization peptide group however additional molecular interactions may render amide form less stable amino group expelled instead resulting ester serthr thioester cys bond place peptide bond chemical reaction called acyl shift esterthioester bond resolved several ways compression amino acid sequences
