affected qualities individual environmental situational factors therefore social behavior arises result interaction organism environment means regards humans social behavior determined individual characteristics person situation major aspect social behavior communication basis survival social behavior said determined two different processes either work together oppose one another dualsystems model reflective impulsive determinants social behavior came realization behavior determined one single factor instead behavior arise consciously behaving awareness intent pure impulse factors determine behavior work different situations moments even oppose one another times one behave specific goal mind times behave without rational control driven impulse also distinctions different types social behavior mundane versus defensive social behavior mundane social behavior result interactions daytoday life behaviors learned one exposed different situations hand defensive behavior arises impulse one faced conflicting social behavior constantly changes one continues grow develop reaching different stages life development behavior deeply tied biological cognitive changes one experiencing given time creates general patterns social behavior development social behavior influenced situation individuals characteristics development behavior due combination two temperament child along settings exposed culture parents individuals influence socialization children play large role development childs social behavior parents caregivers typically decide settings situations child exposed various settings child placed example playground classroom form habits interaction behavior insomuch child exposed certain settings frequently others takes particular precedence influence setting people child must interact age sex times emotions also play large role development social behavior intertwined way individual behaves social interactions emotion understood various verbal nonverbal displays thus plays large role communication many processes occur brain underlay emotion often greatly correlate processes needed social behavior well major aspect interaction understanding person thinks feels able detect emotional states becomes necessary individuals effectively interact one another behave child continues gain social information behavior develops one must learn behave according interactions people relevant certain setting therefore begin intuitively know appropriate form social interaction depending situation therefore behavior constantly changing required maturity brings child must learn balance desires people interact ability correctly respond contextual cues understand intentions desires another person improves said individual characteristics child temperament important understanding individual learns social behaviors cues given learnability consistent across studying patterns biological development across human lifespan certain patterns wellmaintained across humans patterns often correspond social development biological changes lead respective changes pre postnatal infancy behavior infant correlated caregiver development social behavior influenced mothers reactions childrens emotional infancy already development awareness stranger case individual able identify distinguish come childhood individual begins attend peers communication begins take verbal form one also begins classify basis gender qualities salient like race child reaches school age one typically becomes aware structure society regards gender gender plays role become reliant verbal forms communication likely form groups become aware role within puberty general relations among opposite sex individuals much salient individuals begin behave according norms situations increasing awareness sex stereotypes go along individual begins choose much align stereotypes behaves either according stereotypes also time individuals often form sexual individual reaches child rearing age one must begin undergo changes within behavior accordance major lifechanges developing family potential new child requires parent modify behavior accommodate new member come senescence retirement behavior stable individual often established social circle whatever may committed social advent field social cognitive neuroscience came interest studying social behaviors correlates within brain see happening beneath surface organisms act social although debate particular regions brain responsible social behavior claimed paracingulate cortex activated one person thinking motives aims another means understanding social world behaving accordingly medial prefrontal lobe also seen activation social research discovered studies rhesus monkeys amygdala region

prefrontal cortex occur infancyearly life development proper moral social behavior effected thus along neural correlates research investigated happens within body potentially modulates social behavior vasopressin posterior pituitary hormone seen potentially play role affiliation young rats along young rats vasopressin also associated paternal behavior prairie voles efforts made connect animal research humans found vasopressin may play role social responses males human oxytocin also seen correlated positive social behavior elevated levels shown potentially help improve social behavior may suppressed due stress thus targeting levels oxytocin may play role interventions disorders deal atypical social along vasopressin serotonin also inspected relation social behavior humans found associated human feelings social connection see drop serotonin one socially isolated feelings social isolation serotonin also associated social positive affect emotion seen large impact social behavior particularly inducing helping behavior cooperation studies shown even subtly inducing positive affect within individuals caused greater social behavior helping phenomenon however onedirectional positive affect influence social behavior social behavior influence positive social behavior typically seen changing behaviors relevant situation hand acting appropriately setting one however advent electronic media people began find situations may exposed everyday life novel situations information presented electronic media formed interactions completely new people people typically behaved line setting facetoface interaction lines become blurred comes electronic media led cascade results gender norms started merge people coming contact information never exposed facetoface interaction political leader could longer tailor speech one audience speech would translated heard anyone media people longer play drastically different roles put different situations situations overlap information readily available communication flows quickly fluidly media causing behavior merge media also shown impact promoting different types social behavior prosocial aggressive behavior example violence shown media seen lead aggressive behavior research also done investigating media portraying positive social acts prosocial behavior could lead helping behavior viewers general learning model established study process translating media behavior works model suggests link positive media prosocial behavior violent media aggressive behavior posits mediated characteristics individual watching along situation model also presents notion one exposed type media long periods time could even lead changes within personality traits forming different sets knowledge may behaving various studies looking specifically video games prosocial content effect behavior shown exposure influenced subsequent helping behavior videogame processes underlay effect point prosocial thoughts readily available playing video game related thus person playing game likely behave effects found video games also music people listening songs involving aggression violence lyrics likely act aggressive likewise people listening songs related prosocial acts relative song neutral lyrics shown express greater helping behaviors empathy songs played restaurants even led increase tips given relative heard neutral conformity refers behavior individual unconsciously pressured group make behavior tend consistent majority people generally speaking larger group size easier individuals display conformity behaviors individuals may submit group two reasons first gain acceptance group normative social influence second obtain important information group informational social
