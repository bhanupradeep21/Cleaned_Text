cannibalism act consuming another individual species food cannibalism common ecological interaction animal kingdom recorded human cannibalism well documented ancient recent rate cannibalism increases nutritionally poor environments individuals turn members species additional food cannibalism regulates population numbers whereby resources food shelter territory become readily available decrease potential competition although may benefit individual shown presence cannibalism decreases expected survival rate whole population increases risk consuming negative effects may include increased risk pathogen transmission encounter rate hosts cannibalism however result extreme food shortage artificialunnatural conditions may also occur natural conditions variety cannibalism prevalent aquatic ecosystems approximately organismsvague engage cannibalistic activity point life cannibalism restricted carnivorous species also occurs herbivores sexual cannibalism normally involves consumption male female individual forms cannibalism include sizestructured cannibalism intrauterine cannibalism behavioral physiological morphological adaptations evolved decrease rate cannibalism individual environments food availability constrained individuals receive extra nutrition energy use members species also known conspecifics additional food source would turn increase survival rate cannibal thus provide evolutionary advantage environments food example female fletchers frogs lay eggs ephemeral pools lack food resources therefore order survive tadpoles within clutch forced consume exploit conspecifics available source nutrition study conducted another amphibian wood frog tadpoles showed exhibited cannibalistic tendencies faster growth rates higher fitness levels increase size growth would give added benefit protection potential predators cannibals give advantage competing nutritional benefits cannibalism may allow efficient conversion conspecific diet reusable resources fully herbaceous diet herbaceous diets may consist excess elements animal expend energy get rid facilitates faster development however tradeoff may occur may less time ingest acquired resources studies shown noticeable size difference animals fed high conspecific diet smaller compared fed low conspecific hence individual fitness could increased balance developmental rate size balanced studies showing achieved low conspecific cannibalism regulates population numbers benefits cannibalistic individual kin resources extra shelter territory food freed thereby increasing fitness lowering crowding however case cannibal recognizes kin wont hinder future chances perpetuating genes future generations elimination competition also increase mating opportunities allowing spread individuals genes animals diets consisting predominantly conspecific prey expose greater risk injury expend energy foraging suitable prey compared noncannibalistic predators often target younger vulnerable however time necessitated selective predation could result failure meet predators selfset nutritional addition consumption conspecific prey may also involve ingestion defense compounds hormones capacity impact developmental growth cannibals hence predators normally partake cannibalistic diet conditions alternative food sources absent readily available failure recognize kin prey also disadvantage provided cannibals target consume younger individuals example male stickleback fish may often mistake eggs competitors eggs hence would inadvertently eliminate genes available gene kin recognition observed tadpoles spadefoot toad whereby cannibalistic tadpoles clutch tended avoid consuming harming siblings eating act cannibalism may also facilitate trophic disease transmission within population though cannibalistically spread pathogens parasites generally employ alternative modes cannibalism potentially reduce prevalence parasites population decreasing number susceptible hosts indirectly killing parasite shown studies risk encountering infected victim increases higher cannibalism rate though risk drops number available hosts however case risk disease transmission cannibalism ineffective method disease spread cannibalism animal kingdom normally oneonone interaction spread disease requires group cannibalism thereby rare disease evolved rely solely cannibalism spread usually different means transmission direct contact maternal transmission coprophagy necrophagy different infected individuals likely consumed noninfected individuals thus research suggested spread disease may limiting factor prevalence cannibalism examples diseases transmitted cannibalism mammals include kuru prion disease degenerates disease prevalent papua new guinea tribes practiced endocannibalism cannibalistic funeral rituals consume brains infected cerebellar dysfunctional disease symptoms including broadbased gait decreased motor activity control however disease long incubation period symptoms may appear years bovine spongiform encephalopathy mad cow disease another prion disease usually caused feeding contaminated bovine tissue neurodegenerative disease could spread humans individual consume contaminated beef spread parasites nematodes may also facilitated cannibalism eggs parasites transferred easily one host forms diseases include sarcocystis iridovirus reptiles amphibians granulosus virus chagas disease microsporidia insects stained prawn disease white pot syndrome helminthes tapeworms crustaceans cannibalism may become apparent direct competition limited resources forces individuals use conspecific individuals additional resource maintain metabolic hunger drives individuals increase foraging rates turn decreases attack threshold tolerance conspecific individuals resources dwindle individuals forced change behaviour may lead animal confrontation cannibalism rates increase increasing population density becomes advantageous prey conspecific organisms forage encounter rate predator prey increases making cannibalism convenient beneficial foraging within environment time dynamics within population change cannibalistic tendencies may receive additional nutritional benefits increase size ratio predator presence smaller prey prey vulnerable stage life cycle increases chances cannibalism occurring due reduced risk feedback loop occurs increasing rates cannibalism decreases population densities leading increased abundance alternative food sources making beneficial forage within environment cannibalism population numbers foraging rates increase carrying capacity resource area may reached thus forcing individuals look resources conspecific prey sexual cannibalism present largely spiders invertebrates including refers killing consumption conspecific sexual partners courtship copulation normally female consumes conspecific male organism though reported cases male consuming adult female however recorded laboratory sexual cannibalism recorded female redback spider black widow spider praying mantis scorpion among others species spiders consumption male individual occurs copulation male fails transfer sperm may due mistaken identity case orb weaving spider holds little tolerance spider present web may mistake vibrations prey reasons male consumption mating may include female choice nutritional advantages size male spider may play part determining reproductive success smaller males less likely consumed precopulation however larger males may able prevent smaller ones gaining access exists conflict interest males females females may inclined turn cannibalism source nutritional intake males interest mostly focused ensuring paternity future found cannibalistic females produced offspring greater survival rates noncannibalistic females cannibals produced greater clutches larger egg hence species male dark fishing spider family dolomedes selfsacrifice spontaneously die copulation facilitate consumption female thereby increasing chance survivorship future sexual dimorphism theorised arisen sexual selection smaller males captured easily larger males however also possible sexual cannibalism occurs due difference size male data comparing female male spider body length shows little support prior theory much correlation body size presence sexual cannibalism species spiders partake sexual cannibalism exhibit size avoidance sexual cannibalism present males certain species increase rate survival whereby male uses cautionary methods lower risk male orb weaving spiders would often wait females moult finish eating attempting initiate mating females less likely males vulnerable postcopulation consumption may gather mating thread generate mechanical tension could use spring away insemination spiders crab spider may tangle females legs webs reduce risk female capturing male choice common mantids whereby males observed choose fatter females due reduced risk attack hesitant
