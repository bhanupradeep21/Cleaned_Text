diabetic neuropathy various types nerve damage associated diabetes mellitus symptoms depend site nerve damage include motor changes weakness sensory symptoms numbness tingling pain autonomic changes urinary symptoms changes thought result microvascular injury involving small blood vessels supply nerves vasa nervorum relatively common conditions may associated diabetic neuropathy include distal symmetric polyneuropathy third fourth sixth cranial nerve mononeuropathy mononeuropathy multiplex diabetic amyotrophy autonomic neuropathy diabetic neuropathy affect peripheral nerves including sensory neurons motor neurons autonomic nervous system therefore diabetic neuropathy potential affect essentially organ system cause range symptoms several distinct syndromes based organ systems affectedcitation needed longer nerve fibers affected greater degree shorter ones nerve conduction velocity slowed proportion nerves length syndrome decreased sensation loss reflexes occur first toes foot extend upward usually described glovestocking distribution numbness sensory loss dysesthesia nighttime pain pain feel like burning pricking sensation achy dull pins needles sensation common loss proprioception sense limb space affected early patients feel stepping foreign body like splinter developing callus illfitting shoe consequently risk developing ulcers infections feet legs lead amputation similarly patients get multiple fractures knee ankle foot develop charcot joint loss motor function results dorsiflexion contractures toes loss interosseous muscle function leads contraction digits socalled hammer toes contractures occur foot also hand loss musculature makes hand appear gaunt skeletal loss muscular function progressivecitation needed autonomic nervous system composed nerves serving heart lungs blood vessels bone adipose tissue sweat glands gastrointestinal system genitourinary system autonomic neuropathy affect organ systems one commonly recognized autonomic dysfunction diabetics orthostatic hypotension becoming dizzy possibly fainting standing due sudden drop blood pressure case diabetic autonomic neuropathy due failure heart arteries appropriately adjust heart rate vascular tone keep blood continually fully flowing brain symptom usually accompanied loss respiratory sinus arrhythmia usual change heart rate seen normal breathing two findings suggest autonomic neuropathycitation needed gastrointestinal manifestations include gastroparesis nausea bloating diarrhea many diabetics take oral medication diabetes absorption medicines greatly affected delayed gastric emptying lead hypoglycemia oral diabetic agent taken meal get absorbed hours sometimes days later normal low blood sugar already sluggish movement small intestine cause bacterial overgrowth made worse presence hyperglycemia leads bloating gas diarrheacitation needed urinary symptoms include urinary frequency urgency incontinence retention retention urine urinary tract infections frequent urinary retention lead bladder diverticula kidney stones reflux nephropathycitation needed cranial nerves affected neuropathies oculomotor nerve cranial nerve cniii common oculomotor nerve controls muscles move eye except lateral rectus superior oblique muscles also serves constrict pupil open eyelid onset diabetic third nerve palsy usually abrupt beginning frontal pain around eye double vision oculomotor muscles innervated third nerve may affected control pupil size usually wellpreserved early parasympathetic nerve fibers within cniii influence pupillary size found periphery nerve terms crosssectional view makes less susceptible ischemic damage closer vascular supply sixth nerve abducens nerve innervates lateral rectus muscle eye moves eye laterally also commonly affected fourth nerve trochlear nerve innervates superior oblique muscle moves eye downward involvement unusual damage specific nerve thoracic lumbar spinal nerves occur may lead painful syndromes mimic heart attack gallbladder inflammation appendicitis diabetics higher incidence entrapment neuropathies carpal tunnel syndrome following processes thought involved development diabetic neuropathy vascular neural diseases closely related blood vessels depend normal nerve function nerves depend adequate blood flow first pathological change small blood vessels narrowing blood vessels disease progresses neuronal dysfunction correlates closely development blood vessel abnormalities capillary basement membrane thickening endothelial hyperplasia contribute diminished oxygen tension hypoxia neuronal ischemia wellestablished characteristic diabetic neuropathy blood vessel opening agents eg ace inhibitors lead substantial improvements neuronal blood flow corresponding improvements nerve conduction velocities thus small blood vessel dysfunction occurs early diabetes parallels progression neural dysfunction may sufficient support severity structural

tests small fiber neuropathy measured qst sudomotor function tests electrochemical skin conductance indicated assess early signs diabetic autonomic diabetic neuropathy encompasses series different neuropathic syndromes categorized diabetic neuropathy largely prevented maintaining blood glucose levels lifestyle enhanced glucose control methods include frequent subcutaneous insulin administration continuous insulin infusion oral antidiabetic agents lifestyle modifications may include exercise alone combination dietary modifications enhanced glucose control prevents development clinical neuropathy reduces nerve abnormalities type diabetes delays onset neuropathy types diabetes however methods may increase likelihood experiencing hypoglycemic event many aggressive methods require frequent insulin use associated excessive risk treatment early manifestations sensorimotor polyneuropathy involves improving glycemic tight control blood glucose reverse changes diabetic neuropathy
