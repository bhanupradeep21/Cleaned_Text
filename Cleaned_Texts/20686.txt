human vasopressin also called antidiuretic hormone adh arginine vasopressin avp hormone synthesized avp gene peptide prohormone neurons converted avp travels axon terminating posterior pituitary released vesicles circulation response extracellular fluid hypertonicity hyperosmolality avp two primary functions first increases amount solutefree water reabsorbed back circulation filtrate kidney tubules nephrons second avp constricts arterioles increases peripheral vascular resistance raises arterial blood third function possible avp may released directly brain hypothalamus may play important role social behavior sexual motivation pair bonding maternal responses vasopressin induces differentiation stem cells cardiomyocytes promotes heart muscle short halflife vasopressin regulates tonicity body fluids released posterior pituitary response hypertonicity causes kidneys reabsorb solutefree water return circulation tubules nephron thus returning tonicity body fluids toward normal incidental consequence renal reabsorption water concentrated urine reduced urine volume avp released high concentrations may also raise blood pressure inducing moderate avp also may variety neurological effects
