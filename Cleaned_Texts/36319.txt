marion buckwalter american neurologist neuroscientist professor neurology neurosurgery stanford university school medicine buckwalter studies inflammatory responses affect brain recovery injury insult specific emphasis neuroimmune glial cell response stroke buckwalter pursued undergraduate degree biological chemistry university chicago completed bachelors science pursued mdphd training university michigan ann arbor department human mentorship sally camper buckwalter helped localize specific disease causing mutations mouse completed dual degree training pursued clinical training university california san buckwalter completed internship medicine residency neurology ucsf medical center becoming board certified neurology psychiatry buckwalter conducted fellowship training neurological critical care ucsf completing training buckwalter conducted postdoctoral fellowship neurology neurological sciences stanford university school mentorship tony wysscoray buckwalter explored impacts brain inflammation neuroimmune signalling brain phd university michigan buckwalter localized various genes mouse genome first identified location ames dwarf df mutation mouse chromosome via intersubspecific buckwalter colleagues mapped first time location subunit gaba receptor well interferon regulatory factor mouse chromosome following buckwalter mapped candidate genes spasmodic recessive mutation mouse chromosome evaluated candidate mutated genes leading behavioral abnormalities associated mutation fine motor tremors leg clasping found recombination analyses spasmodic mutation maps gene coding glycine receptor subunit point mutation decreases glycine receptor much buckwalters postdoctoral research focused exploring effects transforming growth factor beta tgfb signalling human data showing increases tgfb mrna correlating degree cerebrovascular amyloid deposition brain prompted buckwalter explore tgfb might implicated cerebrovascular pathology found overexpression tgfb astrocytes lead alzheimers disease like abnormalities led decreased cerebral blood flow limbic since tgfb also rapidly increased aging injury buckwalter colleagues proposed may play role decreasing hippocampal found overexpression tgfb astrocytes almost completely blocked neurogenesis hippocampus appears exert effects early stages neurogenesis differentiation either neurons buckwalter colleagues later explored tgf affects cell recruitment brain meninges parenchyma models alzheimers found increased tfgb addition increases amyloid precursor protein led increased cell

stroke collaborative action network cofounder stroke recovery program buckwalter also principal investigator buckwalter lab focuses exploring neuroimmune landscape brain insult injury guide stroke recovery treatments therapeutic buckwalter explores astrocytes regulate inflammation brain stroke transforming growth factor beta tgfb signalling limit immune responses brain injury infection central peripheral effects stroke immune lab stanford buckwalter exploring pleiotropic nature tgfb brain tgfb appears neuroprotective stroke orchestrating glial scarring regulating local immune landscape brain buckwalter lab wanted see process changes found activated macrophages microglia predominant sources tgfb stroke astrocytes macrophages microglia upregulate tgfb dependent signalling stroke whereas neurons oligodendrocytes moreover increases tgfb signalling increase exploration effects overexpression highlighted striking effects tgfb neural landscape long along sheena josselyn paul frankland buckwalter helped discover tgfb led volumetric expansion hippocampus associated defects spatial context infection however tgfb appears play critical role moderating immune buckwalter colleagues showed upon infection toxoplasma gondii tgfb critical preventing overinfiltration immune cells actually helps limit neuronal injury similarly acute stroke astrocyte mediated tgfb signalling appeared limit neuroinflammation preserve brain acute astrocytic responses tfgb seem mediate brains antiinflammatory response buckwalter colleague frank longo developed small molecule tropomyosinrelated kinase b agonist tested effects stroke found promoted neurogenesis administered days poststroke significantly improved recovery improving limb speed accelerating return normal gate explore underlying causes poststroke associated dementia buckwalter probed b lymphocyte response stroke found b lymphocytes infiltrate brain found neuropil associated aberrant ltp cognitive
