josé manuel rodríguez delgado august september spanish professor neurophysiology yale university famed research mind control electrical stimulation rodríguez delgado born ronda province málaga spain received doctor medicine degree university madrid outbreak spanish civil war spanish civil war joined republican side served medical corpsman medical student rodríguez delgado held concentration camp five months war serving camp repeat md degree gained phd ramón cajal institute madrid rodríguez delgados father eye doctor planned follow footsteps however discovered writings santiago ramón cajal nobel laureate spent time physiology laboratory delgado longer wanted eye doctor delgado became captivated many mysteries brain little known little known rodríguez delgado fellowship yale university department physiology direction john f fulton rodríguez delgado accepted position physiology department time headed john fulton coauthored first paper implanting electrodes spanish minister education villar palasí asked rodríguez delgado help organize new medical school autonomous university madrid rodríguez delgado accepted palasís proposal relocated spain wife two children rodríguez delgado last moved wife caroline san diego california death september rodríguez delgados research interests centered use electrical signals evoke responses brain earliest work cats later experiments monkeys humans including psychiatric much rodríguez delgados work invention called stimoceiver radio joined stimulator brain waves receiver monitored eeg waves sent back separate radio channels stimoceivers small halfdollars allowed subject experiment full freedom movement allowing experimenter control experiment great improvement early equipment included visual disturbance whose wires ran brain bulky equipment recorded data delivered desired electrical charges brain early equipment allowing free range movement also cause infection many stimoceiver could used stimulate emotions control behavior according rodríguez delgado stimulation different points amygdala hippocampus four patients produced variety effects including pleasant sensations elation deep thoughtful concentration odd feelings super relaxation colored visions responses rodríguez delgado stated brain transmitters remain persons head life energy activate brain transmitter transmitted way radio using stimoceiver rodríguez delgado found could elicit emotions could also elicit specific physical reactions specific physical reactions movement limb clenching fist achieved rodríguez delgado stimulated motor cortex humans whose implants stimulated produce reaction unable resist reaction one patient said guess doctor electricity stronger one rodríguez delgados promising finds related area called septum verum structure within brains limbic system area stimulated rodríguez delgado produced feelings strong euphoria euphoric feelings sometimes strong enough overcome physical pain rodríguez delgado created many inventions called technological wizard one yale colleagues stimoceiver rodríguez delgado also created chemitrode implantable device released controlled amounts drug specific brain areas rodríguez delgado also invented early version cardiac rhode island rodríguez delgado work closed mental hospital chose patients desperately ill patients whose disorders resisted previous treatments implanted electrodes patients either schizophrenics determine best placement electrodes within human patients delgado initially looked work wilder penfield studied epileptics brains well earlier animal experiments studies braindamaged famous example stimoceiver action occurred córdoba bull breeding ranch rodríguez delgado stepped ring bull stimoceiver implanted within brain bull charged delgado pressed remote control button caused bull stop charge always one theatrics taped stunt seen region brain rodríguez delgado stimulated pressed handheld transmitter caudate nucleus region chosen stimulated caudate nucleus involved controlling voluntary rodríguez delgado claimed stimulus caused bull lose aggressive instinct argued easier block motor control motivation feelings however public understood mind control although bull incident widely mentioned popular media rodríguez delgado believed experiment female chimpanzee named paddy significant paddy fitted stimoceiver linked computer detected brain signal called spindle emitted part brain called amygdala spindle recognized stimoceiver sent signal central gray area paddys brain producing aversive reaction case aversive reaction unpleasant painful feeling result aversive reaction stimulus negative feedback within hours brain producing fewer spindles result negative result paddy became quieter less attentive less motivated behavioral testing although paddys reaction exactly ideal rodríguez delgado hypothesized method used paddy could used others stop panic attacks seizures disorders controlled certain signals within josé rodríguez delgado authored scientific publications within two decades electrical stimulation cats monkeys patients psychotic nonpsychotic new york times featured experiments front page rodríguez delgado implanted stimoceiver caudate nucleus fighting bull could stop animal midway would come running towards waving invited write book physical control mind toward psychocivilised society fortyfirst volume series entitled world perspectives edited ruth nanda anshen rodríguez delgado discussed managed tame civilize surrounding nature arguing time civilize inner book centre controversy since tone book challenging philosophical speculations went beyond data intent encourage less cruelty benevolent happier better man however clashed religious sentiments josé rodríguez delgado continued publish research philosophical ideas articles books next quarter century wrote articles six books final book named happiness
