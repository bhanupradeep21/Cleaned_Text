using different ip address using search engines often collected information users habits create profile helps search engine decide links show different search queries submitted user ads target interesting development field invention automated learning also known machine learning using search engines refine profiling models accurately predict given user may want click ab testing results offered users measuring reactions companies like google netflix youtube amazon started personalizing results one notable example google scholar takes account publication history user order produce

scholars recognized ethical concerns regarding search engine privacy collection user data search engines viewed positive practice allows search engine personalize implies users would receive relevant results shown relevant advertisements data past search queries location information clicks used create profile also search engines generally free charge users remain afloat one main sources revenue effective targeted collection user data also seen overreach private companies financial gain intrusive surveillance tactic search engines make money using targeted advertising advertisers willing pay premium present ads receptive consumers also search engine collects catalogs large amounts data users potential leaked accidentally breached government also subpoena user data search engines databases search query database information may also subpoenaed private litigants use civil cases divorces employment one major controversy regarding search engine privacy aol search data leak academic research purposes aol made public list million search queries made unique although assigned unique identification numbers users instead attaching names query still possible ascertain true identities many users simply analyzing searched including locations near names friends family notable example new york times identified thelma arnold reverse users also sometimes ego searches search see information internet making even easier identify supposedly anonymous many search queries released aol incriminating seemingly extremely private kill wife adopt suicide data since used several experiments attempt measure effectiveness user privacy google yahoo subjects chinese hack google responded situation seriously hiring new cybersecurity engineers investing heavily securing user data yahoo took much lax google started paying hackers find vulnerabilities took yahoo follow yahoo also identified snowden data leaks common hacking target spies various nations yahoo still give newly hired chief information

hack yahoo steal user yahoo breaches largest october google data breach potentially affected accounts led shutdown google government may want subpoena user data search engines number reasons big threat user wanted part defense copa google refused protecting online privacy children may honorable goal concerns whether government access personal data achieve times may want national security purposes access big databases search queries order prevent terrorist attacks common example whatever reason clear fact search engines create maintain databases user data makes possible government access another concern regarding government access search engine user data function creep term refers data originally collected government national security purposes may eventually used purposes debt would indicate many government overreach protections search engine user privacy started developing recently government increasingly side wants ensure search engines retain data making users less protected data available anyone different although popular route privacy centered user take simply start using privacy oriented search engine duckduckgo search engine maintains privacy users collecting data tracking may sound simple users must take account tradeoff privacy relevant results deciding switch search engines results search queries different search engine search history aid personalization mozilla known beliefs protecting user privacy firefox mozilla firefox users capability delete tracking cookie google places computer making much harder google group firefox also button called clear private allows users control settings internet explorer users option well using browser like google chrome safari users also option browse incognito private browsing modes respectively

deleting browsing history delete information search engine companies delete data associated account clear browsing history companies delete user data usually delete keeping records used search innovative solution proposed researchers viejo castellàroca social network solution whereby user profiles plan user would belong group network people use search engine every time somebody wanted submit search query would passed another member group submit behalf someone submitted would ideally lead search queries divvied equally members network way search engine make useful profile individual user group since way discern query actually belonged user google spain v aepd case established people right request search engines delete personal information search results compliance european data protection regulations process simply removing certain search results called effective protecting privacy wish information accessed anyone using search engine necessarily protect contextual integrity search data highly sensitive compromising reordering search results another option people would able rank relevant certain data given point time would alter results given someone searched sort diy option privacy minded users use software like tor anonymity network tor functions encrypting user data routing queries thousands relays process effective masking ip addresses slow speed tor may work mask ip addresses also studies show simulated attacker software could still match search queries users even anonymized using unlinkability indistinguishability also wellknown solutions search engine privacy although proven somewhat ineffective actually providing users anonymity search unlinkability indistinguishability solutions try anonymize search queries user made therefore making impossible search engine definitively link specific query specific user create useful profile done couple different ways another way user hide information ip address search engine unlinkability solution perhaps simple easy user user using vpn although still guarantee total privacy search one way user use plugin software generates multiple different search queries every real search query user indistinguishability solution functions obscuring real searches user makes search engine tell queries softwares difficult search engine use data collects user things like target ads internet search engines relatively recent creations solid legal framework privacy protections terms search engines put place however scholars write implications existing laws privacy general inform right privacy search engine users developing field law several lawsuits respect privacy search engines expected afford users fourth amendment well known protections offers citizens unreasonable searches seizures
