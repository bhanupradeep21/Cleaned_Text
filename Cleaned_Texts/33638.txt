twostreams hypothesis model neural processing vision well hypothesis given initial characterisation paper david milner melvyn goodale argues humans possess two distinct visual recently seems evidence two distinct auditory systems well visual information exits occipital lobe sound leaves phonological network follows two main pathways streams ventral stream also known pathway leads temporal lobe involved object visual identification recognition dorsal stream pathway leads parietal lobe involved processing objects spatial location relative viewer speech repetition several researchers proposed similar ideas previously authors credit inspiration work blindsight weiskrantz previous neuroscientific vision research schneider first proposed existence two visual systems localisation identification ingle described two independent visual systems frogs ettlinger reviewed existing neuropsychological evidence distinction moreover trevarthen offered account two separate mechanisms vision monkeys back ungerleider mishkin distinguished dorsal ventral streams processing spatial visual features respectively lesion studies monkeys proposing original vs though framework superseded milner goodale remains one hugely influential source information informed model experimental work exploring extant abilities visual agnosic patient df first influential report came goodale colleagues work still published two decades focus criticism model due perceived overreliance findings single case goodale amassed array anatomical neuropsychological electrophysiological behavioural evidence model according data ventral perceptual stream computes detailed map world visual input used cognitive operations dorsal action stream transforms incoming visual information requisite egocentric headcentered coordinate system skilled motor planning model also posits visual perception encodes spatial properties objects size location relative objects visual field words utilizes relative metrics scenebased frames reference visual action planning coordination hand uses absolute metrics determined via egocentric frames reference computing actual properties objects relative observer thus grasping movements directed towards objects embedded sizecontrastambiguous scenes shown escape effects illusions different frames references metrics involved perception illusion versus execution grasping proposed similar dualprocess model vision described eight main differences two systems consistent twosystem models dorsal stream proposed involved guidance actions recognizing objects space dorsal stream projects primary visual cortex posterior parietal cortex initially termed pathway since thought dorsal stream processes information regarding spatial properties however later research conducted famous neuropsychological patient patient df revealed dorsal stream responsible processing visual information needed construct representations objects one wishes manipulate findings led nickname dorsal stream updated dorsal stream interconnected parallel ventral stream stream runs downward temporal lobe dorsal stream involved spatial awareness guidance actions eg reaching two distinct functional contains detailed map visual field also good detecting analyzing movements dorsal stream commences purely visual functions occipital lobe gradually transferring spatial awareness

visual somatosensory information integrated damage posterior parietal cortex causes number spatial disorders including ventral stream associated object recognition form representation also described stream strong connections medial temporal lobe associated longterm memories limbic system controls emotions dorsal stream deals object locations motion ventral stream gets main input parvocellular opposed magnocellular layer lateral geniculate nucleus thalamus neurons project sublayers successively ventral pathway goes areas inferior temporal lobe pit posterior inferotemporal cit central inferotemporal ait anterior inferotemporal visual area contains full representation visual space contains neurons whose receptive fields together represent entire visual field visual information
