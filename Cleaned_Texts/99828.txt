gynodioecy rare breeding system found certain flowering plant species female hermaphroditic plants coexist within population gynodioecy evolutionary intermediate hermaphroditism exhibiting female male parts dioecy two distinct morphs male female gynodioecy sometimes considered mixed breeding system comparable trioecy also considered dimorphic sexual system alongside dioecy gynodioecy occurs result genetic mutation inhibits hermaphroditic plant producing pollen keeping female reproductive parts intact gynodioecy extremely rare fewer angiosperm species exhibiting breeding system notable taxa exhibit gynodioecious mating system include beta vulgaris wild beet lobelia siphilitica silene lamiaceae gynodioecy often referred evolutionary intermediate state hermaphroditism dioecy however evidence intermediate state gynodioecy investigated biologists dating far back charles gynodioecy evolve hermaphroditism due certain environmental factors enough resources population allocated female functions hermaphroditic species gynodioecy ensue hand resources favor hermaphrodites male functions androdioecy result high rate selfpollination population facilitates maintenance gynodioecy increasing inbreeding costs thus rate inbreeding increases population likely gynodioecy occur hermaphroditic plants may able reproduce many species research shown species either gynodioecious selfincompatible rarely cooccurrence two therefore gynodioecy selfincompatibility tend prevent others maintenance selfincompatibility plants helps maintain androdioecy plants since males competition hermaphrodites fertilize ovules selfincompatibility leads loss gynodioecy since neither hermaphrodites females deal inbreeding two scenarios proposed explain evolutionary dynamics maintenance gynodioecy first scenario known balancing selection theory considers genetic factors control gynodioecy long evolutionary time scales balancing selection leads cycles explain normal sex ratios gynodioecious populations second scenario known epidemic dynamics involves arrival loss new cytoplasmic male sterility genes new populations genes invade hermaphrodite populations eventually result gynodioecy determined result genetic mutation stops plant producing pollen still allows normal female reproductive plants nuclear genes inherited parents cytoplasmic genes come mother allows male gametes smaller motile female gametes larger makes sense plants hermaphrodites since sessile unable find mates easily animals cytoplasmic male sterility genes usually found mitochondrial genome show established female fertility slightly hermaphroditic fertility female needs make slightly better seeds hermaphrodites since mitochondrial genome maternally research done plants shown hermaphroditic plants constant battles organelle genes trying kill male parts plant species male killer genes observed male sterility genes cause plants grow anthers stunted withered result produce pollen plants nuclear fertility restoring genes counteract work male sterility genes maintaining hermaphroditic state plant however species plants male sterility genes win battle nuclear fertility restoring genes gynodioecy maize farmers take advantage gynodioecy produce favorable hybrid maize seeds farmers deliberately make use gynodioecy develops maize resulting population malesterile femalefertile individuals introduce new strain malesterile individuals breeders able collect favorable hybrid gynodioecy rare widely distributed sexual system angiosperm species gynodioecy found least different angiosperm families less angiosperms species earth one likely explanation rarity due limited evolution since females disadvantage compared hermaphrodites never able evolve quickly addition gynodioecy rare mechanisms favor females cause gynodioecy populations operate plant lineages others reason variation rarity gynodioecy stems certain phenotypic traits ecological factors promote favor presence female plants population example herbaceous growth form much highly favored gynodioecious species lamiaceae compared woody herbaceous growth form also associated reduced pollen limitationclarification needed increased selffertilization reduced pollen limitation may decrease seed quantity quality woody growth form lamiaceae pollenlimited thus produce fewer seeds seeds lower quality thus favoring female herbaceous growth gynodioecy rare sexual systems evolutionarily liable change certain lineages comparison otherscitation needed estimated gynodioecy occurs silene theoretically hermaphrodites evolutionary reproductive advantage females population naturally produce offspring hermaphrodites transmit genes pollen ovules whereas females transmit genes via ovules thus order females remain viable population would twice successful hermaphrodites would appear gynodioecy persist order maintained females need sort reproductive advantage hermaphroditic population known female compensation female female advantage includes increase saved energy producing pollen making seedlings higher quality since hermaphrodite seedlings susceptible homozygous deleterious alleles additional advantages include flowers higher fruit set higher total seed production heavier seeds better germination rates inbreeding depression found important factor maintenance gynodioecy endemic hawaiian shrub schiedea adamantis occurring single population diamond head crater inbreeding depression due selfing hermaphrodites considered caused presence many mutations small following species higher taxa observed
