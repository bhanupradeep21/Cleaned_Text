ecology community group association populations two different species occupying geographical area time also known biocoenosis biotic community biological community ecological community life assemblage term community variety uses simplest form refers groups organisms specific place time example fish community lake ontario industrialization community ecology synecology study interactions species communities many spatial temporal scales including distribution structure abundance demography interactions coexisting primary focus community ecology interactions populations determined specific genotypic phenotypic characteristics important understand origin maintenance consequences species diversity evaluating community community ecology also takes account abiotic factors influence species distributions interactions eg annual temperature soil example plant communities inhabiting deserts different found tropical rainforests due differences annual precipitation humans also affect community structure habitat disturbance introduction invasive species deeper level meaning value community concept ecology debate communities traditionally understood fine scale terms local processes constructing destructing assemblage species way climate change likely affect makeup grass recently local community focus criticized robert ricklefs professor biology university missouri author disintegration ecological community argued useful think communities regional scale drawing evolutionary taxonomy species clades evolve others go today community ecology focuses experiments mathematical models however used focus primarily patterns organisms example taxonomic subdivisions communities called populations functional partitions called guilds within community species occupies niche species niche determines interacts environment around role within community different niches species able known niche partitioning example time day species hunts prey hunts niche partitioning reduces competition species able coexist suppress growth limit growth species competition within species greater competition species intraspecific competition greater interspecific number niches present community determines number species present two species niche eg food demands one species outcompetes niches filled higher biodiversity community species trophic level position food chain web bottom food web autotrophs also known primary producer producers provide energy photosynthesis chemosynthesis plants primary producers next level herbivores primary consumers species feed vegetation energy source herbivores consumed omnivores carnivores species secondary tertiary consumers additional levels trophic scale come smaller omnivores carnivores eaten larger ones top food web apex predator animal species consumed community herbivores omnivores carnivores basic example food chain grass rabbit fox food chains become complex species present often food webs energy passed trophic levels energy lost level due ecological trophic level organism change based species present example tuna apex predator eating smaller fish mackerel however community shark species present shark becomes apex predator feeding decomposers play role trophic pyramid provide energy source nutrients plant species community decomposers fungi bacteria recycle energy back base food web feeding dead organisms trophic guild group species community utilize resources similar way organisms guild experience competition due shared closely related species often guild due traits inherited common descent common ancestor however guilds exclusively composed closely related carnivores omnivores herbivores basic examples guilds precise guild would vertebrates forage ground dwelling arthropods would contain certain birds flowering plants pollinator also form certain species greater influence community direct indirect interactions species population influential species affected abiotic biotic disturbances species important identifying communities ecology loss species results large changes community often reducing stability community climate change introduction invasive species affect functioning key species thus knockon effects community processes industrialization introduction chemical pollutants environments forever altered communities even entire foundation species largely influence population dynamics processes community creating physical changes environment species occupy trophic level tend red mangrove foundation species marine communities mangroves root provides nursery grounds young fish whitebark pine pinus albicaulis foundation species post fire disturbance tree provides shade due dense growth enabling regrowth plant species community growth prompts return invertebrates microbes needed decomposition whitebark pine seeds provide food grizzly keystone species disproportionate influence community species keystone species tend higher trophic levels often apex predator removal keystone species causes topdown trophic cascades wolves keystone species apex predator yellowstone national park loss wolf population overhunting resulted loss biodiversity community wolves controlled number elks park predation without wolves elk population drastically increased resulting overgrazing negatively affected organisms park increased grazing elks removed food sources animals present wolves since reintroduced return park community optimal functioning see wolf reintroduction history wolves yellowstone details case study marine example keystone species pisaster ochraceus starfish controls abundance mytilus californianus allowing enough resources species ecosystem engineer species maintains modifies creates aspects community cause physical changes habitat alter resources available organisms dam building beavers ecological engineers cutting trees form dams alter flow water community changes influence vegetation riparian zone studies show biodiversity burrowing beavers creates channels increasing connections habitats aids movement organisms community community structure composition community often measured biological networks food food webs map showing species networks energy links species together trophic holistic theory refers idea community defined interactions organisms species interdependent playing vital role working community due communities repeatable easy identify similar abiotic factors controlling throughout frederic clements developed holistic organismic concept community superorganism discrete unit sharp clements proposed theory noticing certain plant species regularly found together habitats concluded species dependent formation communities nonrandom involves holistic theory stems greater thinking refers system many parts required system function henry gleason developed individualistic also known open continuum concept community abundance population species changing gradually along complex environmental species changes independently relation species present along association species random due coincidence varying environmental conditions species probability arriving becoming established along gradient influence community individualistic theory proposes communities exist continuous entities addition discrete groups referred holistic theory stephen p hubbell introduced neutral theory ecology confused neutral theory molecular evolution within community metacommunity species functionally equivalent abundance population species changes stochastic demographic processes ie random births equivalence species community leads ecological drift ecological drift leads species populations randomly fluctuating whilst overall number individuals community remains constant individual dies equal chance species colonising plot stochastic changes cause species within community go extinct however take long time many individuals species species coexist similar resources conditions apply filter type species present community population adaptive value competitive dispersal abilities resources demand local regional composition represent balance speciation dispersal increase diversity random extinctions decrease species interact various ways competition predation parasitism mutualism commensalism etc organization biological community respect ecological interactions referred community structure species compete finite resources considered important limiting factor population size biomass species richness many types competition described proving existence interactions matter debate direct competition observed individuals populations species little evidence competition driving force evolution large predation hunting another species food positivenegative interaction predator species benefits prey species harmed predators kill prey eating also known kill consume example hawk catching killing mouse predators parasites feed prey alive example vampire bat feeding cow parasitism however lead death host organism time another example feeding plants herbivores example cow grazing herbivory type predation plant prey example attempt dissuade predator eating plant pumping toxin plant leaves may cause predator consume areas plant consume plant predation may affect population size predators prey number species coexisting community predation specialist example least weasel predates solely field vole generalist eg polar bear primarily eats seals switch diet birds seal population species solitary group predators advantage hunting group means bigger prey taken however food source must shared wolves group predators whilst tigers solitary predation density dependant often leading population cycles prey abundant predator species increases thus eating prey species causing prey population decline due lack food predator population declines due lack predation prey population increases see equations details wellknown example lynxhare population cycles seen predation result coevolution evolutionary arms race prey adapts avoid predator predator evolves example prey species develops toxin kills predator predator evolves resistance toxin making longer lethal mutualism interaction species species benefit example rhizobium bacteria growing nodules roots legumes relationship plant bacteria endosymbiotic bacteria living roots legume plant provides compounds made photosynthesis bacteria used energy source whilst rhizobium nitrogen fixing bacteria providing amino acids ammonium insects pollinating flowers angiosperms another example many plants dependent pollination pollinator pollinator transfers pollen male flower females stigma fertilises flower enables plant reproduce bees honeybees commonly known pollinators bees get nectar plant use energy source untransferred pollen provides protein bee plant benefits fertilisation whilst bee provided commensalism type relationship among organisms one organism benefits organism neither benefited harmed organism benefited called commensal organism neither benefited harmed called host example epiphytic orchid attached tree support benefits orchid neither harms benefits tree type commensalism called inquilinism orchid permanently lives tree phoresy another type commensalism commensal uses host solely transport many mite species rely another organism birds mammals metabiosis final form commensalism commensal relies host prepare environment suitable life example kelp root like system called holdfast attaches seabed rooted provides molluscs sea snails home protects opposite commensalism amensalism interspecific relationship product one organism negative effect another organism original organism example interaction tadpoles common frog freshwater snail tadpoles consume large amounts microalgae making algae less abundant snail algae available snail also lower quality tadpole therefore negative effect snail without gaining noticeable advantage snail tadpoles would obtain amount food without presence older taller tree inhibit growth smaller trees new sapling growing shade mature tree struggles get light photosynthesis mature tree also welldeveloped root system helping outcompete sapling nutrients growth sapling therefore impeded often resulting death relationship two trees amensalism mature tree unaffected presence smaller parasitism interaction one organism host harmed parasite benefits parasitism symbiosis longterm bond parasite feeds host takes resources host parasites live within body tapeworm bodys surface example headlice malaria result parasitic relationship female anopheles mosquito plasmodium mosquitos get parasite feeding infected vertebrate inside mosquito plasmodium develops midguts wall developed zygote parasite moves salivary glands passed vertebrate species example mosquito acts vector malaria parasite tends reduce mosquitos lifespan inhibits production second example parasitism brood parasitism cuckoos regularly type parasitism cuckoos lay eggs nest another species birds host therefore provides cuckoo chick unable tell cuckoo chicks eject hosts young nest meaning get greater level care resources parents rearing young costly reduce success future offspring thus cuckoo attempts avoid cost brood similar way predation parasitism lead evolutionary arms race host evolves protect parasite parasite evolves overcome neutralism species interact interaction noticeable effects either species involved due interconnectedness communities true neutralism rare examples neutralism ecological systems hard prove due
