pulmonary function testing pft complete evaluation respiratory system including patient history physical examinations tests pulmonary function primary purpose pulmonary function testing identify severity pulmonary pulmonary function testing diagnostic therapeutic roles helps clinicians answer general questions patients lung disease pfts normally performed pulmonary function technician respiratory therapist respiratory physiologist physiotherapist pulmonologist general practitioner pulmonary function testing diagnostic management tool used variety reasons pulmonary function testing patients neuromuscular disorders helps evaluate respiratory status patients time diagnosis monitor progress course evaluate possible surgery gives overall idea duchenne muscular dystrophy associated gradual loss muscle function time involvement respiratory muscles results poor ability cough decreased ability breathe well leads collapse part lung leading impaired gas exchange overall insufficiency lung spirometry includes tests pulmonary mechanics measurements fvc fef values forced inspiratory flow rates fifs mvv measuring pulmonary mechanics assesses ability lungs move huge volumes air quickly airways identify airway obstructioncitation needed measurements taken spirometry device used generate pneumotachograph help assess lung conditions asthma pulmonary fibrosis cystic fibrosis chronic obstructive pulmonary disease physicians may also use test results diagnose bronchial hyperresponsiveness exercise cold air pharmaceutical helium dilution technique measuring lung volumes uses closed rebreathing technique based assumptions known volume concentration helium air begin closed spirometer patient helium lungs equilibration helium occur spirometer lungscitation needed nitrogen washout

untoward reactions value test data weighed potential hazards complications include dizziness shortness breath coughing pneumothorax inducing asthma indications pulmonary function test done include recent heart attack stroke head injury aneurysm subjects measurements height weight taken spirometry determine predicted values additionally history smoking recent illness medications takencitation needed order forced vital capacity considered accurate conducted three times peak sharp flowvolume curve exhalation time longer seconds reproducibility pft determined comparing values forced vital capacity fvc forced expiratory volume second difference highest values two fvcs need within ml fvc less l difference highest two values must within ml lastly difference two highest values also within
