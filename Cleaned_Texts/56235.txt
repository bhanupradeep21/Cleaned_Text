infantile esotropia ocular condition early onset one either eye turns inward specific subtype esotropia subject much debate amongst ophthalmologists regard naming diagnostic features treatment historically term congenital strabismus used describe constant esotropias onset birth six months age however term felt inadequate classification covered variety esotropias different causes features prognoses american ophthalmologist gunter k von noorden discussed described essential infantile described condition early acquired congenital although congenital factors may favor development ages
