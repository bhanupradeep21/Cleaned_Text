although recent years term applied animals birthplace recent usage refers animals returning area breed despite born migratory species demonstrate site fidelity reusing stopovers staging points wintering known reasons organisms philopatric would mating reproduction survival migration parental care resources etc species animals individuals benefit living depending species individuals vulnerable predation likely difficulty finding resources food therefore living groups increases species chances survival correlates finding resources reproducing depending species returning birthplace particular species occupies territory favorable option birthplaces animals serve territory return feeding refuge like fish coral animal behavior study conducted paul greenwood overall female mammals

colony interaction two breeding fidelity also well documented among species migrate disperse reaching maturity birds particular disperse fledglings take advantage exceptional navigational skills return previous philopatric individuals exhibit learning behaviour return location following years breeding attempt evolutionary benefits learning evident individuals risk searching better site lower fitness persist poor site philopatry homogenous within species individuals far likely exhibit philopatry breeding habitat similarly nonmigratory populations likely philopatric species exhibit lifelong monogamous pair bonds even outside breeding season bias sex however among polygynous species disperse including find single mate per breeding season much higher rate breedingsite philopatry males females among birds opposite bias among many possible explanations sex bias posited earliest accepted hypothesis attributing bias intrasexual competition territory widely accepted hypothesis proposed greenwood among birds males invest highly protecting resources territory males consecutive seasons male returns territory higher fitness one females free disperse assess males conversely mammals predominant mating system one matrilineal social males generally invest little raising offspring compete mates rather resources thus dispersing result reproductive enhancement greater access females available hand cost dispersal females high thus philopatric hypothesis also applies natal philopatry primarily concerned breedingsite fidelity recent hypothesis builds greenwood findings suggesting parental influence may play large role birds lay eggs adult females risk cuckolded daughters thus would drive hand young male mammals pose threat dominant father driven disperse natal philopatry commonly refers return area animal born animals remaining natal territory form breedingsite philopatry debate evolutionary causes remains unsettled outcomes natal philopatry may speciation cases nondispersing animals cooperative breeding natal philopatry common form philopatry females decreases competition mating increases rate reproduction higher survival rate natal philopatry also leads kinstructured population population genetically related less related individuals species also lead inbreeding higher rate natural sexual selection within exact causes evolution natal philopatry unknown two major hypotheses proposed shields suggested philopatry way ensuring inbreeding hypothesis known optimalinbreeding argued since philopatry leads concentration related individuals birth areas thus reduced genetic diversity must advantage inbreeding otherwise process would evolutionary detrimental would prevalent major beneficial outcome hypothesis protection local gene complex finely adapted local another proposed benefit reduction cost meiosis recombination hypothesis nonphilopatric individuals would maladapted multigenerational time philopatry within species could become fixed evidence optimalinbreeding hypothesis found outbreeding depression outbreeding depression involves reduced fitness result random mating occurs due breakdown coadapted gene complexes combining allele cross well different however important note outbreeding depression becomes detrimental longer temporally subpopulations separated hypothesis provide initial mechanism evolution natal second hypothesis explains evolution natal philopatry method reducing high costs dispersal among offspring review records natal philopatry among passerine birds found migrant species showed significantly less site fidelity sedentary among migratory species cost dispersal paid either way optimalinbreeding hypothesis correct benefits inbreeding result philopatry among species inbreeding depression phenomenon whereby deleterious alleles become fixed easily within inbreeding inbreeding depression demonstrably costly accepted scientists greater cost outbreeding within species also found variation rates philopatry migratory populations exhibiting low levels philopatry suggesting ecological cost dispersal rather genetic benefits either inbreeding outbreeding driver natal philopatrycitation needed number hypotheses exist one philopatry method migratory species ensuring sexes interact breeding areas breeding actually second philopatry provides much higher chance breeding success strict habitat requirements whether due precisely adapted genome mean individuals return site familiar may success either defending locating hypothesis justify whether philopatry due innate behaviour individual learning however shown species older individuals show higher site neither hypotheses widely accepted optimalinbreeding dispersal hypotheses existence indicates evolutionary causes natal philopatry still conclusively demonstratedcitation needed major outcome multigenerational natal philopatry genetic divergence ultimately speciation without genetic exchange geographically reproductively isolated populations may undergo genetic drift speciation evident islands mobile islandbreeding animals finding new breeding location may beyond means combination small population may occur due recent colonisation simply restricted space genetic drift occur shorter timescales observable mainland species high levels endemism islands attributed substantial evidence speciation due natal philopatry gathered studies islandnesting albatross genetic difference often detected microsatellites mitochondrial dna animals spend much time sea return land breed exhibit high levels natal philopatry subsequent genetic drift populations many species albatross breed years leaving birth island return fly hundreds thousands kilometres high levels natal philopatry demonstrated via markrecapture data example laysan albatross phoebastria immutabilis study returned exactly nest consecutive sitespecificity lead speciation also observed earliest stages process shy albatross thalassarche cauta cauta shown genetic differences microsatellites three breeding colonies located coast differences currently sufficient propose identifying populations distinct species however divergence likely continue without outbreeding isolated populations show evidence genetic genetic homogeneity attributed one two explanations indicate natal philopatry absolute within species firstly lack divergence may due founder effects explains individuals start new populations carry genes source population short evolutionary timescales period time passed insufficient divergence may occurred example study mitochondrial dna microsatellites found significant difference colonies blackbrowed albatross melanophrys falkland islands campbell island despite sites thousands kilometres observational evidence whitecapped albatross cauta steadi making attempts build nests south atlantic island species never previously recorded demonstrate range extension roaming subadult birds secondly may sufficient gene exchange prevent divergence example isolated yet geographically close populations buller albatross bulleri bulleri shown genetically evidence recently first time supported markrecapture data showed one bird marked one two breeding islands nesting islandcitation needed due dispersal capabilities albatross distance populations appear determining factor actual speciation likely occur slowly selective pressures animals vast majority lives spent sea small mutational changes nonnuclear dna become fixed small populations likely major driver speciation minimal structural morphological difference genetically distinct populations evidence random genetic drift rather directional evolution due natural selective speciation natal philopatry selfreinforcing process genetic differences sufficient different species may unable interbreed produce viable offspring result breeding could occur anywhere except natal island strengthening philopatry ultimately leading even greater genetic divergencecitation needed philopatric species migrate may evolve breed cooperatively kin selection cooperative breeding form explains individual offspring provide care offspring produced animals
