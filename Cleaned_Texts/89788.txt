transplant rejection occurs transplanted tissue rejected recipients immune system destroys transplanted tissue transplant rejection lessened determining molecular similitude donor recipient use immunosuppressant drugs transplant rejection classified three types hyperacute acute types differentiated quickly recipients immune system activated specific aspect aspects immunity hyperacute rejection form rejection manifests minutes hours following caused presence preexisting antibodies recipient recognize antigens donor antigens located endothelial lining blood vessels within transplanted organ antibodies bind lead rapid activation complement irreversible damage via thrombosis subsequent graft necrosis tissue left implanted fail work could lead high fever malaise immune system acts foreign graft failure secondary hyperacute rejection significantly decreased incidence result improved pretransplant screening antibodies donor preformed antibodies may result prior transplants prior blood transfusions pregnancy hyperacute rejection commonly antibodies abo blood group consequently transplants individuals differing abo blood types generally avoided though may

alongside antibodymediated cytotoxicity neutrophils type white blood cell separate lymphocytes predominantly infiltrating barring genetically identical twins acute rejection expected rates clinically significant acute rejection could endanger transplant decreased significantly development immunosuppressive regimens using kidney transplants example rates acute rejection declined singular episodes acute rejection promptly treated compromise transplant however repeated episodes may lead chronic chronic rejection insidious form rejection leads graft destruction course months often years tissue mechanism chronic rejection yet fully understood known prior acute rejection episodes main clinical predictor development chronic particular incidence increases following severe persistent acute rejection whereas acute rejection episodes return function back baseline major effects graft chronic rejection generally thought related either vascular damage parenchymal damage subsequent unknown
