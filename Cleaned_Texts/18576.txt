developmental noise stochastic noise concept within developmental biology observable characteristics traits phenotype varies individuals even though individuals share genetic code genotypes environmental factors completely factors influence effect include stochastic randomized gene expression cellular although organisms within species share similar genes similar environments similar developmental history individual organism develop differences due noise signaling signal interpretation developmental noise may help individuals gain ability adapt environment contribute unique patterns human fingerprints provide wellknown example fingerprints differ even genetically identical human developmental noise may help individuals gain ability adapt environment biological systems display variation natural variation within population large part genetically determined variation due noise may contribute rapid response individual changes environment variation evolutionary tuning effect contributes optimal fitness population support idea shown bacteria switch stochastically persistent state slow growth coupled ability survive antibiotic another study shown noisy proteins associated stress response proteins expressed small quantities expression noisy proteins influenced noises come environmental context types noises include extrinsic noise variation celltocell expression level protein intrinsic noise variation inherent stochastic nature protein moreover noisy genes associated distinct promoter architecture including prevalence tata boxes consistent theoretical predictions noise greatly influenced logic transcriptional process particular transition closed open developmental noise contribute unique patterns development individual well development complex organ variability gene expression may required contribute differentiation multiple cell types cells equivalent potential example patterning adult fly eye relies multiple alternative choices differentiation pathways within apparently homogeneous field cells facets ommatidia fly eyes occur two types designated pale yellow defined particular types rhodopsin photopigments expressed two inner photoreceptor flies carrying mutations gene spineless ommatidia show pale fate expression spineless induces yellow fate final pattern ommatidia determined stochastic variation expression single transcription factor comprehensive review article summarized effects noise cellular decisions bacteria mammalian majority study developmental noise focused animals also examples plants one early study roy made thousands observations petal numbers well leaf tooth numbers observed high degree variability traits analyzing data could conclude variability caused environmental effect another example noise plants lateral root behavior people found growth lateral roots unpredictable genetically identical plants grow environment one example seed germination may illustrate benefit developmental noise plants stochasticity timing germination ensures least fraction progeny survive though stochastic variations cell behaviors may beneficial biological systems need maintain reliable output without unpredictable variations ability buffer variations generated molecular noise genetic polymorphism environmental fluctuations termed robustness example development repeating blocks somites mesoderm vertebrate animals even though biological system may subject noisy environment segmentation clock maintains periodic gene expression coupled oscillators synchronous oscillation neighbors maintained mutual coupling mechanism enables embryos maintain constant segregation somites despite noise imposed high level mitosis required continued sources consequences control noise major questions study developmental noise recent studies suggest noise multiple sources including stochastic inherently random nature biochemical reactions gene expression detailed mechanisms still unclear contributions factors micrornas whose existence first discovered remain unclear example one recent study showed micrornas serve different roles using noise throw developmental switch buffering consequences noise order confer robustness environmental thus much work remains done understanding significance control mechanisms developmental noise httpsenwikipediaorgwikidevelopmentalnoise
