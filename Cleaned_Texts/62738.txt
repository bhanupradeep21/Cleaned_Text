peptides involves disintegration damaging puncturing cell membranes organisms toward peptide antimicrobial effects observed fungal bacterial viral pathogenscitation needed cathelicidins rapidly destroy lipoprotein membranes microbes enveloped phagosomes fusion lysosomes macrophages therefore inhibit formation bacterial plays role activation cell proliferation migration contributing wound closure mechanisms together play essential role tissue homeostasis regenerative processes moreover agonistic effect various pleiotropic receptors example formyl peptide receptor purinergic receptor epidermal growth factor receptor insulinlike growth receptor receptors play important immunomodulatory role among things antitumor immune responsecitation needed furthermore induces regulates
