alcoholic liver disease ald also called alcoholrelated liver disease arld term encompasses liver manifestations alcohol overconsumption including fatty liver alcoholic hepatitis chronic hepatitis liver fibrosis major cause liver disease western countries although steatosis fatty liver disease develop individual consumes large quantity alcoholic beverages long period time process transient heavy drinkers develop fatty liver whilst develop severe alcoholic hepatitis liver risk factors known mechanism ald completely understood alcohol passes liver detoxified chronic consumption alcohol results secretion proinflammatory cytokines tnfalpha interleukin interleukin oxidative stress lipid peroxidation acetaldehyde toxicity factors cause inflammation apoptosis eventually fibrosis liver cells occurs individuals still unclear additionally liver tremendous capacity regenerate even hepatocytes dead continues function fatty change steatosis accumulation fatty acids liver cells seen fatty globules microscope alcoholism causes development large fatty globules macrovesicular steatosis throughout liver begin occur days heavy alcohol metabolized alcohol dehydrogenase adh acetaldehyde metabolized aldehyde dehydrogenase aldh acetic acid finally oxidized carbon dioxide water process generates nadh increases nadhnad ratio higher nadh concentration induces fatty acid synthesis decreased nad level results decreased fatty acid oxidation subsequently higher levels fatty acids signal liver cells compound glycerol form triglycerides triglycerides accumulate resulting fatty livercitation needed alcoholic hepatitis characterized inflammation hepatocytes heavy drinkers develop alcoholic hepatitis niaaa development hepatitis directly related dose alcohol people seem prone reaction others called alcoholic steatonecrosis inflammation appears predispose liver fibrosis inflammatory cytokines tnfalpha thought essential initiation perpetuation liver injury cytotoxic hepatomegaly inducing apoptosis severe hepatotoxicity one possible mechanism increased activity tnfα increased intestinal permeability due liver disease facilitates absorption gutproduced endotoxin portal circulation kupffer cells liver phagocytose endotoxin stimulating release tnfα tnfα triggers apoptotic pathways activation caspases resulting cell cirrhosis late stage serious liver disease

damage cell symptoms include jaundice yellowing liver enlargement pain tenderness structural changes damaged liver architecture without total abstinence alcohol use cirrhosis eventually lead liver failure late complications cirrhosis liver failure include portal hypertension high blood pressure portal vein due increased flow resistance damaged liver coagulation disorders due impaired production coagulation factors ascites heavy abdominal swelling due buildup fluids tissues complications including hepatic encephalopathy hepatorenal syndrome cirrhosis also result causes hazardous alcohol use viral hepatitis heavy exposure toxins alcohol late stages cirrhosis may look similar medically regardless cause phenomenon termed final common pathway disease fatty change alcoholic hepatitis abstinence reversible later stages fibrosis cirrhosis tend irreversible usually contained abstinence long periods timecitation needed early stages patients ald exhibit subtle often abnormal physical findings usually development advanced liver disease stigmata chronic liver disease become apparent early ald usually discovered routine health examinations liver enzyme levels found elevated usually reflect alcoholic hepatic steatosis microvesicular macrovesicular steatosis inflammation seen liver biopsy specimens histologic features ald indistinguishable nonalcoholic fatty liver disease steatosis usually resolves discontinuation alcohol use continuation alcohol use result higher risk progression liver disease cirrhosis patients acute alcoholic hepatitis clinical manifestations include fever jaundice hepatomegaly possible hepatic decompensation hepatic encephalopathy variceal bleeding ascites accumulation tender hepatomegaly may present abdominal pain unusual occasionally patient may people alcoholic hepatitis serum aspartate aminotransferase ast alanine aminotransferase alt ratio greater ast alt levels almost always less elevated ast alt ratio due deficiency pyridoxal phosphate required alt enzyme synthetic pathway furthermore alcohol injury hepatic mitochondria results ast isoenzyme release laboratory findings include red blood cell macrocytosis mean corpuscular volume elevations serum gammaglutamyl transferase ggt alkaline phosphatase bilirubin levels folate level reduced alcoholic patients due decreased intestinal absorption increased bone marrow requirement folate presence alcohol increased urinary loss magnitude leukocytosis white blood cell depletion reflects severity liver injury histologic features include mallory bodies giant mitochondria hepatocyte necrosis neutrophil infiltration area around veins mallory bodies also present liver diseases condensations cytokeratin components hepatocyte cytoplasm contribute liver injury
