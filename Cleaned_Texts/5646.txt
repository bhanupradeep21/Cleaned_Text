lewis c cantley born february american cell biologist biochemist made significant advances understanding cancer metabolism among notable contributions discovery study enzyme known important understanding cancer diabetes currently meyer director professor cancer biology sandra edward meyer cancer center weill cornell medicine new york city formerly professor departments systems biology

remaining wesleyan college graduated summa cum laude chemistry cantley obtained phd cornell university ithaca new york worked gordon hammes enzyme kinetics using fret study enzyme conformational changes moved harvard university postdoctoral fellowship guido guidotti discovered impurity commercial preparations atp vanadate acts transition state analog phosphate hydrolysis cantley became assistant professor biochemistry molecular biology harvard promoted associate professor became full professor physiology tufts university school medicine cantley colleagues malcolm whitman david kaplan tom roberts brian schaffhausen made seminal discovery existence cantley moved harvard medical school professor cell biology director division signal transduction former beth israel hospital beth israel deaconess medical center cantley became founding member newly formed department systems biology harvard medical school cantley also became director cancer research beth israel deaconess medical center joined faculty weill cornell medicine hospital dr cantley elected chairman board hope funds cancer research cantley married vicki sato prominent figure pharmaceutical industry professor harvard university business medical schools series studies spanning several years cantley colleagues demonstrated kinase activity associated middle oncoprotein phosphoinositide novel type phosphoinositide kinase phosphorylates position inositol activated growth factors produce novel phosphoinositides particularly previously identified physiologically stimulated human subsequent years cantley colleagues identified critical aspects regulation growth factor receptors specifically discovered catalytic subunit dimerizes regulatory subunit domain specifically recognized growth factor receptors adaptor proteins via pyxxm cantley lab also made seminal contributions understanding signaling downstream discovered pleckstrin homology domain akt binds binding critical activation akt catalytic demonstrated critical substrate together laboratory john blenis discovered akt phosphorylation required activation mtor kinase via regulation small gtpase cantley lab also one labs nearly simultaneously identified regulator ampk also serves regulate discovery role cancer metabolism cantley one eleven recipients inaugural breakthrough prize life sciences worlds richest academic prize medicine biology prize carries million cash award recognizes excellence research aimed curing intractable diseases human fundamental farreaching nature discovery together cantleys role mapping upstream regulation downstream signaling pathways led speculation cantley likely candidate nobel prize medicine growing evidence primary role critical role insulin served strengthen significance fundamentally important discovery first drug targeting pathway treatment cancer idelalisib delta inhibitor approved fda treatment leukemia two types lymphoma july drugs currently clinical development cantley lab published novel strategy determine sequence specificity phosphopeptide binding domains initially subsequently oriented peptide library approach extended identify substrate specificity protein kinases toward synthetic approach extended characterize specificity serthr kinases phosphoserthr binding approach used characterize substrate specificity large number protein kinases kinase specificity matrices generated experiments served basis creating website scansite allowing de novo identification candidate phosphorylation sites arbitrary later research oriented peptide library approach also used characterize protease cleavage modification original oriented peptide approach allowed large scale kinomewide determination protein kinase cantley lab discovered enzymes referred type ii pipkinases instead using substrate fact required substrate produce research demonstrated naturally occurring eukaryotes remarkable seven naturally occurring phosphoinositides existence four discovered cantley role anabolic signaling insulin growth factors makes straightforward link metabolism cancer especially light discovery gene encoding recent years cantley colleagues made additional links metabolic regulation oncogenic transformation discovery isoform pyruvate kinase associated discovery provides molecular basis understanding warburg effect cantley major player resurgence importance warburg effect process cantley part stand cancer dream team brought together investigate ways target way treat womens cancers leads national effort targeting triplenegative breast cancer ovarian cancer novel drug recent research found high levels vitamin c halted growth aggressive forms colorectal lab also elucidated role serine production nonsmall cell lung cancer potential
