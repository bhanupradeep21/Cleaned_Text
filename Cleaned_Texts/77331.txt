reproductive success individuals production offspring per breeding event limited number offspring produced one individual also reproductive success offspring reproductive success different fitness individual success necessarily determinant adaptive strength genotype since effects chance environment influence specific reproductive success turns part fitness offspring actually recruited breeding population offspring quantity correlated quality holds reproductive success must adjusted traits predict juvenile survival order measured quality quantity finding right balance reproduction

measuring number cubs born using different foods fall including corn herbaceous red oak beech cherry nutritional facts protein carbohydrate fat noted varied percent compositions seventypercent bears high fat high carbohydrate diets produced cubs conversely females low carbohydrate diets reproduce cubs deeming carbohydrates critical factor reproductive success fat adequate nutrition premating time periods showed effect various reproductive processes mammals increased nutrition general time beneficial oocyte embryo development result offspring number viability also improved thus proper nutrition timing premating time key development longterm benefit two different diets fed florida scrubjays breeding performance noted different effects one diet consisted high protein high fat consisting high fat significant result birds high protein high fat diet laid heavier eggs birds richinfat diet difference amount water inside eggs accounted different weights hypothesized added water resulting adequate proteinrich fatrich diet may contribute development survival chick therefore aiding reproductive dietary intake also improves egg production also considered help create viable offspring postmating changes seen organisms response necessary conditions development depicted twospotted cricket feeding tested females found mated females exhibited overall consumption unmated observations female crickets showed laying eggs protein intake increased towards end second day female crickets therefore require larger consumption protein nourish development subsequent eggs even mating

maternal antibody transmission thus immune response affected since still source protein although low means bird able compensate lack protein diet protein reserves higher concentrations protein diet also positively correlated gamete production across various animals formation oothecae brownbanded cockroaches based protein intake tested protein intake deemed low delayed mating extreme protein

ensuring genes passed next research suggested historically women far higher reproductive success rate men dr baumeister suggested modern human twice many female ancestors male ancestors males females considered separately reproduction success different limitations producing maximum amount offspring females limitations gestation time typically months followed lactation suppresses ovulation chances

yet need focusing energy growth maintenance yet place energy towards reproducing however female ready begin putting forth energy reproduction less energy put towards overall growth maintenance females constraint amount energy need put forth reproduction since females go gestation set obligation energy output reproduction males however constraint therefore could potentially put forth offspring
