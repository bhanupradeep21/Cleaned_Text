asian elephants megatherium species members abundant pleistocene megafauna large mammals lived pleistocene epochcitation needed megatherium robust skeleton large pelvic girdle broad muscular tail large size enabled feed heights unreachable contemporary herbivores rising powerful hind legs using tail form tripod megatherium could support massive body weight using curved claws long forelegs pull branches choicest leaves sloth like modern anteater walked sides feet claws prevented putting flat ground although primarily quadruped trackways show capable bipedal locomotion biomechanical analysis also suggests adaptations one study proposed megatherium mostly hairless like modern elephants large size small surfaceareatovolume ratio would made susceptible megatherium narrow coneshaped mouth prehensile lips probably used select particular plants megatherium also possessed narrowest muzzle ground sloths pleistocene possibly meaning selective eater able carefully pick choose leaves twigs evidence suggests animal could use tongue differentiate select foliage lips probably important role megatherium stylohyal epihyal bones parts hyoid bone supports tongue located throat fused together apparatus lies farther upwards throat together elongated steeply inclined mandibular symphysis indicates relatively shorter geniohyoid muscle thus limited capacity tongue analysis wear biomechanics chewing muscles suggests chewed vertically megatheres displayed deeper jaws like sloths megatherium lacked enamel deciduous dentition dental cusp patterns mammals instead enamel tooth displays layer cementum orthodentine modified orthodentine creating soft easily abraded teeth americanum exhibit extreme hypsodonty indicative gritty fibrous diet teeth side view show interlocking vshaped biting surfaces although nearly square crosssection exhibit bilophodonty teeth spaced equidistantly series located back mouth leaves space predentary diastema although length tooth row predentary spout vary speciesclarification megatherium inhabited woodland grassland environments lightly wooded areas south america late pleistocene range centred around endemic species recently years ago megatherium adapted temperate arid semiarid open habitats example recent finds cueva del milodón patagonian closely related genus eremotherium classified occasionally part lived tropical environments north invaded temperate north america part great american interchange giant ground sloth lived mostly groups may lived singly caves probably mainly browsing diet open habitats also probably fed moderate soft tough food millions years sloth many enemies bother probably diurnal animalcitation needed giant ground sloth herbivore feeding leaves yuccas agaves grassescitation needed fed chiefly terrestrial plants could also stand hind legs using tail balancing tripod reach upper growth vegetation would pull upright sit haunches stand tugged plants feet digging five sharp claws foot sloth used simple teeth grind food swallowing highly developed cheek muscles helped process sloths stomach able digest coarse fibrous foodcitation needed likely spent lot time resting aid digestion recent morphofunctional indicates americanum adapted strong vertical biting teeth hypsodont bilophodont sagittal section loph triangular sharp edge suggests teeth used cutting rather grinding hard fibrous food primary dietary component suggested giant sloth may partly carnivorous controversial claim richard fariña ernesto blanco universidad de la república montevideo analysed fossil skeleton americanum discovered part elbow triceps muscle short adaptation found carnivores optimises speed rather strength researchers say would enabled americanum use claws like daggers suggest add nutrients diet megatherium may taken kills smilodon based estimated strength mechanical advantage biceps proposed megatherium could overturned adult glyptodonts large armored xenarthrans related armadillos means scavenging hunting however noting sloths lack carnassials typical predators traces bone absent many preserved deposits sloth dung paul martin described proposal fancifula carbon isotope analysis found megatherium isotope values similar megafaunal herbivores mammoths glyptodonts macrauchenia significantly unlike omnivorous carnivorous mammals suggesting megatherium obligate youngest unambiguous dates megatherium end late pleistocene supposed early holocene dates obtained megatherium pampas megafauna questioned suggestions likely due humic acid contamination collagen used radiocarbon date megatherium disappeared simultaneously along vast majoriy large megafaunal south american mammals part quaternary extinction use bioclimatic envelope modeling indicates area suitable habitat megatherium shrunk become fragmented midholocene alone would likely caused extinction cited possible contributing towards end late pleistocene humans first arrived americas earliest evidence humans
