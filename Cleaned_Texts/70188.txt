contemporary niche theory impact niche defined combination effects given consumer resources uses b consumers ecosystem therefore impact niche equivalent eltonian niche since concepts defined impact given species range environmental conditions species successfully survive reproduce ie hutchinsonian definition realized niche also encompassed contemporary niche theory termed requirement niche requirement niche bounded availability resources well effects coexisting consumers eg competitors contemporary niche theory provides three requirements must met order two species consumers requirements interesting controversial require two species share certain environment overlapping requirement niches fundamentally differ ways use impact environment requirements repeatedly violated nonnative ie introduced invasive species often coexist new species nonnative ranges appear constricted requirements words contemporary niche theory predicts species unable invade new environments outside requirement ie realized niche yet many examples additionally contemporary niche theory predicts species unable establish environments species already consume resources ways incoming species however examples also ecology niche differentiation also known niche segregation niche separation niche partitioning refers process competing species use environment differently way helps competitive exclusion principle states two species identical niches ecological roles compete one inevitably drive rule also states two species occupy exact niche habitat coexist together least stable two species differentiate niches tend compete less strongly thus likely coexist species differentiate niches many ways consuming different foods using different areas example niche partitioning several anole lizards caribbean islands share common insects avoid competition occupying different physical locations although lizards might occupy different locations species found inhabiting range certain example live ground others arboreal species live different areas compete less food resources minimizes competition species however species live similar areas typically compete equation states two competing

niche differentiation necessary ecologists able detect measure quantify niches different coexisting competing species often done combination detailed ecological studies controlled experiments

addition several mathematical models exist quantify niche breadth competition coexistence bastolla et al however regardless methods used niches competition distinctly difficult measure quantitatively makes detection demonstration niche differentiation difficult complex time two competing species either coexist niche differentiation means compete one species becomes locally extinct several theories

resource partitioning phenomenon two species divides resources like food space resting sites etc coexist example lizard species appear coexist consume insects differing alternatively species coexist resources species limited different resources differently able capture resources different types phytoplankton coexist different species differently limited nitrogen phosphorus silicon galapagos islands finches small beaks able consume small seeds finches large beaks able consume large seeds species density declines food depends become abundant since individuals consume result remaining individuals experience less competition food although resource generally refers food species partition nonconsumable objects parts habitat example warblers thought coexist nest different parts species also partition habitat way gives access different types resources stated introduction anole lizards appear coexist uses different parts forests perch likely gives access different species insects

competition could different genotypes organisms play soil increase symbiotic efficiency predator partitioning occurs species attacked differently different predators natural enemies generally example trees could differentiate niche consumed different species specialist herbivores herbivorous insects species density declines density natural enemies giving advantage thus species constrained different natural enemies able early work focused specialist however recent studies shown predators need pure specialists simply need affect prey species hypothesis represents form predator conditional differentiation sometimes called temporal niche partitioning occurs species differ competitive abilities based varying environmental conditions example sonoran desert annual plants successful wet years others successful dry result species advantage years others environmental conditions favorable individuals tend compete strongly member species example dry year dryadapted plants tend limited dryadapted help coexist storage effect species differentiate niche via competitionpredation tradeoff one species better competitor predators absent better predators present defenses predators toxic compounds hard shells often metabolically costly result species produce defenses often poor competitors predators absent species coexist competitionpredation tradeoff predators abundant less defended species common less abundant welldefended species effect criticized weak theoretical models suggest two species within community coexist two ecological paradigms deal problem first paradigm predominates may called classical ecology assumes niche space largely saturated individuals species leading strong competition niches restricted neighbouring species ie species similar ecological characteristics similar habitats food preferences prevent expansion niches even narrow niches continual struggle existence important assumption natural selection introduced darwin explanation evolution paradigm assumes niche space large degree vacant ie many vacant niches based many empirical studies theoretical investigations especially kauffman causes vacant niches may evolutionary contingencies brief longlasting environmental disturbances paradigms agree species never universal sense occupy possible niches always specialized although degree specialization varies example universal parasite infects host species microhabitats within however degree host specificity varies strongly thus toxoplasma protista infects numerous vertebrates including humans enterobius vermicularis infects humans following mechanisms niche restriction segregation proposed niche restriction niche segregation paradigms acknowledge role mechanisms except possibly random selection niches first paradigm emphasis various mechanisms varies first paradigm stresses paramount importance interspecific competition whereas second paradigm tries explain many cases thought due competition first paradigm reinforcement reproductive barriers andor random selection niches many authors believe overriding importance interspecific competition intuitively one would expect interspecific competition particular importance cases sympatric species ie species occurring together area large population densities use resources largely exhaust however andrewartha birch others pointed natural populations usually even approach exhaustion resources much emphasis interspecific competition therefore wrong concerning possibility competition led segregation evolutionary past wiens concluded assumptions proven connell found interspecific competition mechanism niche segregation proven pest insects barker review competition drosophila related genera among best known animal groups concluded idea niche segregation interspecific competition attractive study yet able show mechanism responsible segregation without specific evidence possibility random segregation never excluded assumption randomness indeed serve nullmodel many physiological morphological differences species prevent hybridization evidence niche segregation result reinforcement reproductive barriers especially convincing cases differences found allopatric sympatric locations example kawano shown giant rhinoceros beetles southeast asia two closely related species occur allopatric ie different areas sympatric ie area locations former body length length genitalia practically identical latter significantly different much genitalia body convincing evidence reinforcement important factor possibly one responsible niche segregation detailed studies communities monogenea parasitic gills marine freshwater fishes several authors shown species use strictly defined microhabitats complex copulatory organs fact fish replicas available almost unlimited numbers makes ideal ecological models many congeners species belonging genus noncongeners found single host species maximum number congeners nine species limiting factor space attachment since food blood mucus fast regenerating epithelial cells unlimited supply long fish alive various authors using variety statistical methods consistently found species different copulatory organs may cooccur microhabitat whereas congeners identical similar copulatory organs spatially segregated convincing evidence reinforcement competition responsible niche detailed discussion especially competition reinforcement reproductive barriers competing species shown coexist resource observable evidence niche differentiation violation competitive exclusion principle one instance group hispine beetle beetle species eat food occupy habitat coexist without evidence segregation exclusion beetles show aggression either intra interspecifically coexistence may possible combination nonlimiting food habitat resources high rates predation parasitism though demonstrated example illustrates evidence niche differentiation means universal niche differentiation also means
