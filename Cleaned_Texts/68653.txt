united states indeed incur greatly elevated risk child maltreatment various sorts especially lethal powerful evidence support cinderella effect comes finding abusive parents step genetic children generally spare genetic children families stepchildren exclusively targeted times one study addition displaying higher rates negative behaviors eg abuse toward stepchildren stepparents display fewer positive behaviors toward stepchildren genetic parents example average stepparents invest less education play stepchildren less take stepchildren doctor less discrimination stepchildren unusual compared abuse statistics involving overall population given following additional facts child abuse detected often found children home victimized stepchildren almost always eldest children home whereas general tendency families uniform parentage youngest frequent evolutionary psychologists martin daly margo wilson propose cinderella effect direct consequence modern evolutionary theory inclusive fitness especially parental investment theory argue human child rearing prolonged costly parental psychology shaped natural selection unlikely according research concerning animal social behaviour provide rationale expecting parents discriminative care affection specifically discriminate favour inclusive fitness theory proposes selective criterion evolution social traits social behavior costly individual organism nevertheless emerge statistical likelihood significant benefits social behavior accrue survival reproduction organisms also carry social trait straightforwardly accrue close genetic relatives conditions net overall increase reproduction social trait future generations result initial presentation inclusive fitness theory mid focused making mathematical case possibility social evolution also speculated possible mechanisms whereby social trait could effectively achieve necessary statistical correlation likely bearers two possibilities considered one social trait might reliably operate straightforwardly via social context species genetic relatives usually concentrated local home area born viscous populations genetic detection mechanisms supergenes might emerge go beyond statistical correlations reliably detect actual genetic relatedness social actors using direct kin recognition relative place two broad types social mechanisms debated see kin selection kin recognition many biologists consider kin recognition important possible mechanism martin daly margo wilson follow second mechanism expect parents discriminate favour young ie actual genetic relatives abundant data stepchild mistreatment collected interpreted psychologists martin daly margo wilson study emphasis neuroscience behavior mcmaster university first measure validity cinderella effect based data american humane association aha archive child abuse reports united states holding twenty thousand records led wilson daly conclude child three years age lived one genetic parent one stepparent united states seven times likely become validated childabuse case records one dwelt two genetic overall findings demonstrate children residing stepparents higher risk abuse even factors organisms face tradeoffs invest time energy risk resources investment one domain eg parental investment generally takes away ability invest domains eg mating effort growth investment investment nongenetic children therefore reduces individuals ability invest genetic children without directly bringing reproductive benefits thus evolutionary biology perspective one would expect organisms regularly deliberately care unrelated offspring daly wilson point infanticide extreme form biasing parental investment widely practiced animal example immigrant male lion enters pride uncommon kill cubs fathered since pride provide support limited number cubs survive adulthood killing cubs competition new males potential offspring increases chances progeny surviving addition act infanticide speeds return sexual receptivity females allowing male father offspring timelier observations indicate animal world males employ certain measures order ensure parental investment geared specifically toward unlike lion however humans stepparenting situation face complicated tradeoff since completely disown partners offspring previous relationship would risk losing sexual access partner chance producing potential offspring thus according daly wilson stepparental investment viewed mating effort ensure possibility future reproduction parent mating effort hypothesis suggests humans tend invest genetic offspring invest enough stepchildren theoretical framework daly wilson argue instances child abuse towards nonbiological offspring frequent towards biological one would therefore expect greater parental responsiveness towards ones offspring towards unrelated children result positive outcomes fewer negative outcomes towards ones children towards children one expected invest ie stepchildren child abuse behavioral response influenced natural selection likely occur reduced inclusive fitness payoffs owing uncertain low owing adaptations natural selection child abuse likely committed stepparents genetic expected invest heavily children genetic parents greater childspecific parental love promotes positive caretaking inhibits maltreatment daly wilson report parental love explain genetic offspring immune lashing assert childspecific parental love emotional mechanism permits people rejoice long years expensive unreciprocated parental point study comparing natural father stepfather families support notion stepparents view stepchildren biological children likewise children view stepparents biological study based series questionnaires subjected statistical analyses reports children less likely go stepfathers guidance stepfathers rate stepchildren less positively natural daly wilsons reports overrepresentation stepparents child homicide abuse statistics support evolutionary principle maximizing ones inclusive fitness formalized hamiltons rule helps explain humans preferentially invest close adoption statistics also substantiate principle nonkin adoptions represent minority worldwide research high adoption rates oceania shows childlessness common reason adopting eleven populations data available large majority adoptions involved relative coefficient relatedness greater equal eg genetic also observed parents biological adopted children bias partitioning estates favor biological children demonstrating parental behavior corresponds principles kin canadian sample daly wilson classify frequencies different living arrangements two natural parents one natural parent one natural parent one stepparent according child age accomplished administering randomized telephone records child abuse childrens aid organizations well police reports runaways juvenile offenders used determine whether children stepparental living situations overrepresented abuse victims compared demographic data gathered telephone survey data results indicate living situation significant correlation increased child abuse one natural parent one stepparent household rates running away crime comparable children living stepparents children singleparents abuse rates children living stepparents much daly wilson examined several potentially confounding variables research including socioeconomic status family size maternal age childbirth however minor differences naturalparent stepparent families respect factors found indicating none major contributing factors observed cinderella evolutionary psychologists also suggested one causes stepchild abuse may lack parental attachment bond mother would normally form attachment bond general

parental supervision fundamentally correlated incidentsspelling unintentional childhood injury shown wadsworth et al peterson stern tooley et al posit selective pressures would favor inclination towards parental vigilance threats offspring tooley et al argue parental vigilance highly engaged stepparents genetic parents therefore placing stepchildren greater risk unintentional based data gathered australia national coroners information system stepchildren five years age two fifteen times likely experience unintentional fatal injury especially drowning genetic additionally study finds risks unintentional fatal injury significantly higher genetic children single parent homes versus twoparent difference suggests removing one biological parent home significantly increase risk children adding nonbiological parent home results drastic increase risk unintentional fatal despite fact adding stepparent home increases available resources terms supervision comparison singleparent home risk unintentional fatal injury still significantly higher risk injury stepchildren attributed fact stepparents occupy supervisory role genetic parent yet lower intrinsic commitment protecting child

ep mistakenly attempts discover human psychological adaptations rather evolutionary causes psychological traits buller also argues daly wilsons canadian sample included cases sexual abuse well cases unintentional omission buckling childs seatbelt car buller asserts unintentional omission fall realm dangerous acts rather designated maltreatment argues since sexual abuse often accompanied physical abuse unreasonable assume motivated kind psychological mechanism child buller also points conclusion nonbiological parents likely abuse children contradicted fact even rate abuse among stepparents disproportionate lowest rate child abuse found among adoptive daly wilson respond bullers criticism stating buller confuses empirical statistical findings define cinderella effect proposed theoretical framework offers evolutionary explanation buller also argues daly wilsons findings inherently biased since use data official documents officials collecting data trained take special notice stepparents versus biological furthermore buller states since daly wilson rely official reports death certificates data data inherently biased cites colorado study found maltreatment fatalities likely correctly reported death certificates unrelated individual perpetrator rather parent perpetrator suggesting data empirically skewed support cinderella according study crume et al perpetrator murder parent maltreatment correctly noted death certificate percent time furthermore found perpetrator unrelated including boyfriend individual maltreatment reported death certificate percent time significantly higher although statistics seem provide evidence bias stepparents review data undermines conclusion crume et al daly wilson note maltreatment likely reported death certificates percent time case relatives including stepparents represents marginal increase amount parental therefore daly wilson respond bullers critique seem significant source error studying cinderella effect provide evidence inherent bias findings daly wilson called question one study child homicides sweden found children living households nongenetic parent increased risk homicide compared children living genetic parents study published conducted temrin colleagues argued daly wilson classified homicides according family situation account genetic relatedness parent actually committed crime swedish sample two seven homicides genetic nongenetic parent offender actually genetic parent thus homicides support daly wilsons definition cinderella daly wilson attribute contrasting findings swedish study analytical oversight temrin colleagues neglect consider fact proportion children living situations stepparent constant child age groups rather increases age correcting age differences swedish data set produces

crosscultural variation cinderella noted multiple researchers child abuse intricate issue affected daly wilson state however even evolutionary psychology account every instance stepparental abuse invalidate empirical burgess drais propose child maltreatment complex explained fully genetic relatedness alone cite reasons child maltreatment social factors ecological factors child traits

battles mental health gilessims david finkelhor categorized evaluated five possible hypotheses could explain cinderella effect socialevolutionary theory normative theory stress theory selection factors resource theory socialevolutionary theory based proposal nongenetically related parents invest less costly parental duties due fact genes passed individual normative theory proposes due genetic repercussions incest among genetically related individuals widespread taboo would thus less common among biological relatives propose incest among stepfamilies would less taboo since risk genetic degradation stress theory proposes increased stressors inherently common among stepfamilies cause increased risk abuse selection factors theory proposes individuals likely stepparents divorcees likely inherently violent due emotional disturbances aggressive impulses selfesteem issues due stepparents group would higher proportion individuals violentprone characteristics would suggest abuse happening due personality factors rather stepparental relationship directly finally according resource theory individuals contribute resources granted authority individuals lack
