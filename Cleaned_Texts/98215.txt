cincinnati water maze cwm type water maze water mazes experimental equipment used laboratories mazes partially filled water rodents put observed timed make way maze generally two sets rodents put maze one treated another results compared experimenter uses type maze learn subjects cognitive emotional cincinnati water maze water maze nine interconnected tintersections rats forced find way one end maze navigating openings side walls rather end passage walls wide enough rat prop wall walls made plexiglas prevent subjects carrying unwanted behavior climbing wall finding seams walls grab onto mazes filled water rats typically natural swimmers rats prefer water provides motivation subjects want complete test also run dark researcher wants greater focus subjects egocentric navigational abilities rat reference visual cues distance use type reference based navigation allocentric navigation two parts egocentric navigation evaluated routebased navigation clearly defined path environment part path integrated navigation ability take different direct path starting location outbound path egocentric navigation evaluated observing subjects recording many times subject crosses predetermined line tintersection head forepaws indicating going wrong direction words predecessor cincinnati water maze cwm biel water maze bwm invented w c biel test rats egocentric navigational capabilities bwm enclosed within container prevent external stimuli light assisting subject completing task ensures rats memory previous trials primary source information moreover original design bwm walls measuring fifth meter height leaving approximately cm clearance top maze ceiling container design bwm made intersection formed nevertheless several concerns bwm including abundance tintersections prompted innovation would result creation cwm contrast bwm cwm possesses wider channels prevent larger rats propping added benefit asymmetry extra intersections furthermore strategy predominantly seen bwm rats would swim straight line forced turn undone inherent asymmetry cwm instead rats began pointa arrive pointb would turn halfway corridor prior reaching dead end conversely beginning pointb towards pointa allows standard method previously cincinnati water maze developed dr charles v vorhees many improvements developed collaboration dr michael williams cwm often used measure escape latency time required subject escape maze researchers may also measure number errors subject makes counted subject moves stem arms deadend culdesac animal typically put maze trials per day days tested light days tested dark goal assess rats procedural learning subject must learn route one way rats given time limit find escape prevent fatigue studying escape latency errors animal researchers standardized test rate learning cwms especially useful direct test egocentric without external visual cues rat forced remember sequence turns previous trials escape useful determining effect drugs shortterm memory egocentric learning test also useful mapping areas brain spatial learning occurs recording areas brain activity test one variation adding light visual cues researchers may measure allocentric learningmemory procedure test becomes similar morris water maze spatial learning tested furthermore variation rat able use allocentric egocentric cues escape particularly useful studying spatial memory rats able use types navigational cwm useful mice mice cognitive ability find escape complex maze cwm must preceded day training must learn swim simple straight waterfilled channel one end trials allows one measure swim speed see groups equal entering maze teach rats submerged platform end escape without prior training high failure rates rats put cwm even training run infrared light dark takes control rats days begin learn escape days show mastery since water mazes used mostly rats mice extrapolation research data experiments organisms humans limited cincinnati water maze cwm poses limitations experimenters rodent tests one must extrapolate human egocentricprocedural learning memory different tests used example element water escape different using food restriction together food sweetened liquid used appetitive mazes advantage water mazes require less training appetitive mazes rats preexisting activity differences hyperactive hypoactive openfield differences affect swimming therefore influence maze performance cwm measures routebased egocentric navigation run dark measure component egocentric navigation path integration rat learn direct shortcut path start goal animals unstructured mazes another advantage water mazes insensitive body weight differences therefore experimental treatment reduces growth body weight one group compared controls little effect water
