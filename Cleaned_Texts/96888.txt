hyperinsulinism refers normal level insulin blood person animal normal insulin secretion blood levels closely related level glucose blood given level insulin normal one blood glucose level low high another hyperinsulinism associated several types medical problems roughly divided two broad largely nonoverlapping categories tending toward reduced sensitivity insulin high blood glucose levels hyperglycemia tending toward excessive insulin secretion low glucose levels hypoglycemiacitation needed hyperinsulinism due reduced insulin sensitivity usually contrast hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia produce entire range hypoglycemic symptoms shakiness weakness seizures although many factors influence insulin secretion important control amount glucose moving blood beta cells pancreas healthy people even small rises blood glucose result increased insulin secretion long pancreatic beta cells able sense glucose level produce insulin amount insulin secreted usually amount required maintain fasting blood glucose mgdl mmoll nonfasting glucose level mgdl mmollcitation needed liver cells cells remove glucose blood become less sensitive resistant insulin pancreas increases secretion level insulin blood rises increased secretion compensate reduced sensitivity many years maintenance normal glucose levels however insulin resistance worsens insulin secretion ability declines glucose levels begin rise persistent elevation glucose levels termed diabetes mellituscitation needed typical fasting insulin levels found type hyperinsulinism μuml resistance severe levels exceed μumlcitation needed addition risk factor type diabetes hyperinsulinism due insulin resistance may increase blood pressure contribute hypertension direct action vascular endothelial cells cells lining blood vessels hyperinsulinism also implicated contributing factor excessive production androgens polycystic ovary syndromecitation needed principal treatments hyperinsulinism due insulin resistance measures improve insulin sensitivity weight loss physical exercise drugs thiazolidinediones metformincitation needed hyperinsulinism may also refer forms hypoglycemia caused excessive insulin secretion normal children adults insulin secretion minimal blood glucose levels fall mgdl mm many forms hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia caused various types insulin excess occur infants young children termed congenital hyperinsulinism adults severe hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia often due insulinoma insulinsecreting tumor pancreascitation needed insulin levels μuml inappropriate glucose level mgdl mm may indicate hyperinsulinism cause hypoglycemia treatment form hyperinsulinism depends cause severity hyperinsulinism may include surgical removal source insulin drug diazoxide octreotide reduces insulin secretioncitation needed spontaneous hyperinsulinism might cause symptomatic hypoglycemia first proposed seale harris md journal american medical dr seale harris first diagnosed hyperinsulinism also credited recognition spontaneous httpsenwikipediaorgwikihyperinsulinism
