doctorate broca became professor agrégé appointed surgeon hospital elected chair external pathology faculty medicine one year later professor clinical surgery elected member académie de medicine appointed chair clinical surgery served capacity death also worked hôpital st antoine pitié hôtel des clinques hôpital researcher broca joined society anatomique de paris first six years society broca productive two months joining societys journal editorial committee became secretary vice president soon creation broca joined société de also joined became president societe de chirurgie parallel medical career broca founded society freethinkers sympathetic charles darwins theories remarked would rather transformed ape degenerate son brought conflict church regarded subversive materialist corrupter youth churchs animosity toward continued throughout lifetime resulting numerous confrontations broca ecclesiastical feeling pressured others especially mother broca married adele augustine lugol came protestant family daughter prominent physician jean guillaume auguste lugol brocas three children daughter jeanne francoise pauline son benjamin auguste son élie andré one year later brocas

like father auguste andre went study medicine auguste broca became professor pediatric surgery known contribution brocaperthesblankart operation andré became professor medical optics known developing pellinbroca since majority medical advancements emerged interaction independent sometimes secret society anatomique de paris met every friday chaired anatomist jean cruveilhier interned father french neurology jeanmartin charcot instrumental later discovery multiple meetings members would make presentations regarding scientific findings would published regular bulletin societys like cruveilhier charcot broca made regular society anatomique presentations musculoskeletal demonstrated rickets disorder results weak soft bones children caused interference ossification due disruption work osteoarthritis form arthritis broca amédée broca showed like nails teeth cartilage tissue requires absorption nutrients nearby blood vessels described detail process lead degeneration cartilage broca also made regular presentations clubfoot disorder birth defect infants feet rotated inwards birth time broca saw degeneration muscle tissue explanation root cause still undetermined brocas theory muscle degeneration would lead understanding pathology muscular anatomist broca considered making separate contributions medical surgeon broca wrote detailed review recently discovered use chloroform anesthesia well experiences using novel pain managing methods surgery hypnosis carbon dioxide local broca used hypnosis surgical removal abscess received mixed results patient felt pain beginning went away could remember anything afterwards inconsistent results reported doctors broca repeat using hypnosis anestheticn patients memory loss saw potential using psychological broca published aneurysms

achievements work broca known french broca contributed charlesédouard brownséquards work nervous system conducting vivisection experiments specific spinal nerves cut demonstrate spinal pathways sensory motor systems result work brownséquard became known demonstrating principle decussation vertebrates neural fibers cross one lateral side another resulting phenomenon right side animals brain controlling left side scientist broca also developed theories made hypotheses would eventually disproven based reported findings example published work support viewing syphilis western medicine discovered qualities muscle relaxant curare used south american indian hunters poison broca thought strong support incorrect idea aside applied topically curare could also diluted ingested counter tetanus caused muscle broca also spent many earlier years researching cancer wife known family history carcinoma possible piqued interest exploring possible hereditary causes cancer investigations accumulated evidence supporting hereditary nature cancers also discovering cancer cells run many scientists skeptical brocas hereditary hypothesis believing merely coincidental stated two hypotheses cause cancer diathesis infection believed cause may lie somewhere two hypothesized diathesis produces first cancer cancer produces infection infection produces secondary multiple tumors cachexia broca spent much time anthropological institute studying skulls bones argued attempting use measurements obtained studies main criteria ranking racial groups order superiority sense broca pioneer study physical anthropology part called scientific racism advanced science cranial anthropometry developing many new types measuring instruments craniometers numerical published around papers general anthropology physical anthropology ethnology branches field founded société danthropologie de paris revue danthropologie broca first became acquainted anthropology works isidore geoffroy sainthilaire antoine étienne reynaud augustin serres jean louis armand de quatrefages de bréau late became lifetime interest broca defined anthropology study human group considered like scientists rejected relying religious texts looked scientific explanation human origins broca presented hybrid leporid result cross species reproduction rabbit hare crossbreeding done commercial rather scientific reasons resulting hybrids became popular pets specific circumstances set order differently behaving species reproduce hybrid descendants able reproduce broca fact different animals able intermix create fertile offspring prove broca presented findings leporids société de biologie believed key element work implication physical differences human races could explained different species different origins rather single moment creation charles darwins origin species come following year topic human origin already widely discussed science still capable producing negative response government worry pierre rayer president société along members broca good relations asked broca stop discussion topic broca agreed adamant discussion continue formed société proponent polygenism broca rejected monogenistic approach humans common ancestor instead viewed human racial groups coming different origins like proponents either side viewed racial group place barbarism civilization progression saw european colonization territories justified attempt civilize barbaric populationsn work phenomenon hybridity genus homo argued reasonable view humanity composed independent racial groups australian caucasian mongolian malayan ethiopian american saw racial group species connected geographic location together different species part single genus per standard time broca would also refer caucasian racial group white ethiopian racial group negro writings brocas use word race narrower used today broca considered celts gauls greeks persians arabs distinct races part caucasian racial races within group specific physical characteristics distinguished racial groups like work anatomy broca emphasized conclusions rested empirical evidence rather priori thought distinct geographic location racial group one main problems monogenists argument common ancestry even necessity insist upon difficulty greater geographical impossibility dispersion many races proceeding common origin remark remote almost recent migrations europeans natural group human races occupied upon planet region characterized special fauna american animal found either australia ancient continent men new type discovered found animals belonging species general sometimes zoological orders without analogues regions broca also felt enough evidence theory appearance different races could changed qualities environments lived broca saw physical characteristic jews portrayed egyptian paintings bc even though ad population spread different locations vastly different environments pointed opponents unable provide similar longterm broca influenced previous work samuel george morton used concept hybridity primary argument monogenism flawed see humanity single different racial groups ability reproduce sufficient prove brocas view hybridity result reproduction two different races could fall four categories resulting offspring infertile resulting offspring infertile reproduce sometimes successful reproduce parent groups known paragenesic offsprings descendants able reproduce within parents success reproduction lowers every generation ends known eugenesic successful reproduction continue indefinitely intermix descendants parent looking historical population figures broca concluded population france example eugenesic mixed race resulting intermixing cimbri celtic germanic northern races within caucasian hand thought observations population data different regions africa southeast asia north south america showed significant decrease physical intellectual abilities mixed groups compared different races originated concluding intermixed descendants different racial groups could paragenesic far advancing suppositions demonstrated truths studied analysed documents within reach responsible facts ascertained much opposition generally received opinions admitted without strict investigation obtain particulars reason upon known facts must admitted numerous authentic constitute rigorous definitive demonstration least strong presumption doctrines phenomenon hybridity published year darwins presentation theory evolution origin species time broca thought racial group independently created nature slavery disturbed extinction native populations caused broca thought monogenism often used justify actions argued races single origin lower status noncaucasians caused race acted following creation wrote difference origin means implicates subordination races contrary implicates idea race men originated determined region crown fauna region permitted guess intention nature might led suppose assigned distinct inheritance race despite said cosmopolitism man inviolability domain certain races determined broca known making contributions towards scientific approach measurements human physical features developed numerous instruments data points basis current methods medical archeological craniometry specifically cranial points like glabella inion instruments like craniograph unlike morton believed subjects brain size main indicator intelligence broca thought factors important included prognathic facial angles closer right angles indicating higher intelligence cephalic index relationship brains length width directly proportional intelligence intelligent european group long headed least intelligent negro group short thought important aspect relative size frontal rear areas brain caucasians larger frontal area broca eventually came conclusion larger skulls associated higher intelligence still believed brain size important aspects social progress material security compared cranial capacity different types parisian skulls found average oldest parisian skull smaller modern wealthier parisian skull bigger average skull poor parisians graven aside approaches craniometry broca made contributions anthropometry developing field work scales measuring techniques classifying eye skin hair color designed resist water sunlight broca published phenomenon hybridity two years darwins

reason limiting single spot single moment spontaneous evolution matter seems likely centers organization appeared different places different periods polygenic transformism would inclined accept objection darwinism would invalid conceded organized beings undetermined considerable number distinct origins structural analogies longer considered sufficient proof common even narrower level broca saw evolution insufficient explanation presence traits apply darwins thinking genus orang satyrus alone primates nail big toe darwinists answer one day certain pithecus born without big toe nail descendants perpetuated variety let us call ape prosatyrus behooves founder dynasty according law immediate heredity offspring like ancestors nail every toe one deprived first nail like father thanks natural selection character finally became constant see negative characteristic might give advantage struggle ultimately broca believed process ran parallel evolution fully explain origins divergences different broca celebrated theory speech production center brain located left side brain pinpointing location ventroposterior region frontal lobes known brocas area arrived discovery studying brains aphasic patients persons speech language disorders resulting brain area study began broca dispute proponents cerebral localization whose views derived phrenology franz joseph gall opponents led pierre flourens phrenologists believed human mind set various mental faculties one represented different area brain specific areas representing personality characteristics like ones aggressiveness spirituality also memory linguistic abilities opponents claimed careful ablation specific way removing material various brain regions flourens disproved galls hypotheses however galls former student jeanbaptiste bouillaud kept localization function hypothesis alive especially regards language center although rejected much remaining phrenological thinking bouillaud relied work braindamaged patients challenge professionals disprove finding case frontal lobe damage unaccompanied disorder soninlaw ernest aubertin began seeking cases either support disprove theory found several support brocas society anthropology paris language regularly discussed context race nationality also became platform addressing physiological aspects localization function controversy became topic regular debate several experts head brain anatomy including aubertin joined society experts still supported flourens argument aubertin persistent presenting new patients counter views however broca aubertin finally put localization issue rest broca visited patient bicêtre hospital named louis victor leborgne progressive loss speech paralysis loss comprehension mental function nicknamed tan due inability clearly speak words tan pronounced french word temps leborgne died several days later due uncontrolled infection resultant gangrene broca performed autopsy hoping find physical explanation leborgnes

determined lie within third convolution left frontal lobe next lateral one day tans death broca presented findings anthropological second case leborgne solidified brocas beliefs human speech function localized lazare lelong grounds worker treated bicêtre dementia also lost ability speak five simple meaningful words included name yes always well number death brain also autopsied broca found lesion encompassed much area affected leborgnes brain finding concluded specific area controlled ones ability produce meaningful sounds affected one lose capability next two years broca went find autopsy evidence twelve cases support localization articulated broca published findings autopsies twelve patients paper localization speech third left frontal cultivation work inspired others perform careful autopsies aim linking brain regions sensory motor functions although history credits discovery broca another french neurologist marc dax made similar observations generation earlier based work approximately forty patients subjects papers dax presented findings conference southern france physicians dax died soon presentation reported published broca made initial accordingly daxs brocas conclusions left frontal lobe essential producing language considered however brains leborgne lelong preserved whole broca never sliced reveal damaged structures beneath years later nina dronkers american cognitive neuroscientist obtained permission reexamine brains using modern mri technology imaging resulted virtual slices historic brains revealed patients sustained much damage brain broca
