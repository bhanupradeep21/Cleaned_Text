affective neuroscience study brain processes emotions field combines neuroscience psychological study personality emotion basis emotions emotions remains issue debate within field affective term affective neuroscience coined neuroscientist jaak panksepp time cognitive neuroscience focused parts psychology include emotion attention emotions thought related activity brain areas direct attention motivate behavior help us make decisions environment early stages research emotions brain conducted paul james paul work suggests emotion related group structures center brain called limbic system limbic system made following brain structures research shown limbic system directly related emotion brain areas structures important producing processing many theories role right hemisphere emotion resulted several models emotional functioningafter observing decreased emotional processing right hemisphere injuries ck mills hypothesized emotions directly related right researchers found emotional expression understanding may controlled smaller brain structures right findings basis right hemisphere hypothesis valence hypothesis believed right hemisphere specialized processing emotions left right hemisphere associated nonverbal synthetic integrative holistic gestaltic mental demonstrated patients increased spatial neglect damage affects right brain rather left brain right hemisphere connected subcortical systems autonomic arousal right hemisphere disorders associated abnormal patterns autonomic nervous system findings suggest right hemisphere subcortical brain areas closely related according valence hypothesis although right hemisphere involved emotion primarily involved processing negative emotions left hemisphere involved processing positive emotions one explanation negative emotions processed right brain positive emotions processed alternative explanation right hemisphere dominant comes feeling positive negative recent studies indicate frontal lobes hemispheres play active role emotions parietal temporal lobes process depression associated decreased right parietal lobe activity anxiety associated increased right parietal lobe based original valence model increasingly complex models developed result increasing understanding different emotions integral thought processes cognition investigated without emotion late focusing instead nonemotional processes memory attention perception problem solving mental cognitive neuroscience affective neuroscience emerged separate fields studying neural basis nonemotional emotional processes despite fact fields classified according brain processes cognition emotion neural mental mechanisms behind emotional nonemotional processes often emotion gonogo tasks used study behavioral inhibition especially influenced go cue tells participant respond rapidly nogo cue tells withhold response go cue occurs frequently used measure well subject suppresses response different emotional task often used combination neuroimaging healthy individuals patients affective disorders identify relevant brain functions associated emotional several studies including gonogo studies suggest sections prefrontal cortex involved controlling emotional responses stimuli adapted stroop emotional stroop test measures much attention pay emotional task participants instructed name ink color words ignoring generally people trouble detaching attention words affective meaning compared neutral demonstrated several studies naming color neutral words results quicker selective attention negative threatening stimuli often related psychological disorders commonly tested different mental disorders associated specific attentional participants spider phobia example tend inclined use spiderrelated words negatively charged similar findings found threat words related anxiety even studies questioned conclusions words matched emotionality anxious participants studies show stroop interference effect negative positive words specificity effects words various disorders may primarily due conceptual relation disorders concerns rather ekman faces task used measure emotion recognition six basic black white

involve bursts noise abrupt flashes light transmitted individual attends set startle reflexes shown modulated emotion example healthy participants tend show enhanced startle responses viewing negatively valenced images attenuated startle viewing positively valenced images compared neutral startle response particular stimulus greater conditions common example given indicate phenomenon ones startle response flash light greater walking dangerous neighborhood night would safer conditions laboratory studies threat receiving shock enough potentiate startle even without actual fear potentiated startle paradigms often used study fear learning extinction individuals posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd anxiety fear conditioning studies initially neutral stimulus repeatedly paired aversive one borrowing classical fps studies demonstrated ptsd patients enhanced startle responses danger cues neutralsafety cues compared healthy affect plays many roles learning deep emotional attachment subject area allows deeper understanding material therefore learning occurs emotions evoked reading comparison emotions portrayed content affects comprehension someone feeling sad understands sad passage better someone feeling therefore students emotion plays important role learning process emotion embodied perceived words read page facial expression neuroimaging studies using fmri demonstrated area brain activated feeling disgust activated observing anothers traditional learning environment teachers facial expression play critical role language acquisition showing fearful facial expression reading passages contain fearful tones facilitates students learning meaning certain vocabulary words comprehension neurobiological basis emotion still existence basic emotions defining attributes represents long lasting yet unsettled issue available research suggests neurobiological existence basic emotions still tenable heuristically seminal pending approaches hypothesize emotion categories including happiness sadness fear anger disgust biologically view emotions inherited biologically based modules separated basic psychological models following approach hypothesize mental states belonging single emotional category consistently specifically localized either single brain region defined network brain basic emotion category also shares universal characteristics distinct facial behavior physiology subjective experience accompanying thoughts approach emotion hypothesizes emotions like happiness sadness fear anger disgust many others constructed mental states occur brain systems work view networks brain regions underlie psychological operations eg language attention etc interact produce emotion perception one psychological operation critical emotion network brain regions underlie valence feeling pleasantunpleasant arousal feeling activated emotions emerge neural systems underlying different psychological operations interact involved valence arousal producing distributed patterns activation across brain emotions emerge basic components heterogeneity affects emotion category example person experience many different kinds fear feel differently correspond different neural patterns aging aspect affective neuroscience relatively important discuss people consider concept aging people typically associate decline functioning mental processing abilities however case emotion regulation matter fact older adults typically stronger drive maintain improve emotional well thus providing utilize emotion regulation skills provide higher satisfaction life ventromedial prefrontal cortex vmpfc significant influence emotion regulation especially regarding high emotional arousing compared areas prefrontal cortex pfc vmpfc loses volume much lower rate due older persons emotion regulation abilities heavily impacted brain changes associated aging additionally anterior cingulate cortex acc important area brain used emotion regulation acc proven key player emotion regulation young adults also older older adults acc important create connections vmpfc order regulate emotions connection salient negative emotions reappraised demonstrates older adults use vmpfc regulate emotions positive manner despite areas brain decreasing functionality humans age connection vmpfc acc remains strong reappraise negative emotions positive emotions different younger adults rely areas pfc people age cognitive functions decline case comes emotion regulation study conducted carstensen colleagues found people increase age ability regulate important note older adults better emotion regulation skills mean live stable daily lives fact tend unstable negative emotions especially comparison stability positive major difference observed older adults younger adults regulate emotions negative emotional stimuli present explained numerous theories older adults handle emotionally salient events stimuli often vastly different younger adults even middle aged adults appear many differences ways younger middle older adults handle social situations however social situation becomes emotionally charged differences intense emotions social situation evoked older adults tended situation passive manner comparison middle aged adults also tend rely previous problem solving skills younger older adults people age tends shift preferences maintain positive emotional affect fact seems decrease negative emotions felt older adults reach age decrease important note frequency negative emotion decreases age intensity emotions experienced change additionally emotional satisfaction lower experience less frequent negative emotions carstensen hypothesized reason older adults tended better emotion regulation skills younger adults due socioemotional selectivity theory highlights role social interactions ability regulate emotions social interactions often positive sometimes lead negative emotional arousal since older adults alive longer dense social networks creates drastic increase social interaction cause positive emotional arousal chance experience negative emotional reaction social event likely able pair something positively emotionally salient causes negative emotion less potent therefore increase hedonic perspective life metaanalysis statistical approach synthesizing results across multiple studies included studies investigated healthy unmedicated adults used subtraction analysis examine brain areas active emotional processing neutral control condition first neuroimaging metaanalysis emotion phan et al analyzed results peer reviewed studies january december determine emotions fear sadness disgust anger happiness consistently associated activity specific brain regions studies used fmri pet techniques investigate higherorder mental processing emotion studies loworder sensory motor processes excluded authors tabulated number studies reported activation specific brain regions brain region statistical chisquared analysis conducted two regions showed statistically significant association amygdala studies inducing fear reported activity region compared studies inducing happiness studies inducing sadness reported activations anger disgust subcallosal cingulate studies inducing sadness reported activity region compared inducing happiness inducing anger pattern clear discriminability emotion categories fact rare patterns occurring limbic regions paralimbic regions uniheteromodal regions brain regions implicated across discrete emotion included basal ganglia studies inducing happiness studies inducing disgust reported activity region medial prefrontal cortex happiness anger sadness disgust fear murphy et al analyzed peer reviewed studies published january december examine evidence regional specialization discrete emotions fear disgust anger happiness sadness across larger set studies studies included metaanalysis measured activity whole brain regions interest activity individual regions particular interest study kolmogorovsmirnov statistics used compare rough spatial distributions activation patterns determine statistically significant activations specific particular brain regions emotional categories pattern consistently activated regionally specific activations identified four brain regions amygdala fear studies insula disgust globus pallidus disgust lateral orbitofrontal cortex anger regions showed different patterns activation across categories example dorsal medial prefrontal cortex rostral anterior cingulate cortex showed consistent activity across emotions happiness sadness anger fear disgust barrett et al examined studies published authors compared consistency specificity prior metaanalytic findings specific notional basic emotion consistent neural patterns defined brain regions showing increased activity specific emotion relative neutral control condition regardless method induction used example visual vs auditory cue specific neural patterns defined separate circuits one emotion vs emotions example fear circuit must discriminable anger circuit although may include common brain regions general results supported phan et al murphy et al specificity consistency determined comparison chisquared analyses revealed whether proportion studies reporting activation one emotion significantly higher proportion studies reporting activation emotions specificity determined comparison emotioncategory brainlocalizations contrasting activations key regions specific particular emotions increased amygdala activation fear consistently reported across induction methods specific metaanalyses associated anterior cingulate cortex sadness although finding less consistent across induction methods specific metaanalyses found disgust associated basal ganglia findings neither consistent specific neither consistent specific activity observed across metaanalyses anger happiness metaanalysis introduced concept basic irreducible elements emotional life dimensions approach kober reviewed neuroimaging studies published order determine specific brain regions activated experiencing emotion directly indirectly experience someone according study six different functional groups showed similar activation patterns psychological functions group discussed basic terms regions may also play role processing visual information paying attention emotional vytal et al examined neuroimaging studies published examine whether neuroimaging evidence supports biologically discrete basic emotions ie fear anger disgust happiness sadness consistency analyses identified brain regions associated individual emotions discriminability analyses identified brain regions differentially active contrasting pairs emotions metaanalysis examined pet fmri studies reported whole brain analyses identifying significant activations least one five emotions relative neutral control condition authors used activation likelihood estimation ale perform spatially sensitive voxelwise sensitive spatial properties voxels statistical comparisons across studies technique allows direct statistical comparison activation maps associated discrete emotion thus discriminability five discrete emotion categories assessed precise spatial scale prior metaanalyses consistency first assessed comparing crossstudy ale map emotion ale maps generated random permutations discriminability assessed pairwise contrasts emotion maps consistent discriminable activation patterns observed five categories lindquist et al reviewed pet fmri studies published january december induction methods used elicit fear sadness disgust anger happiness goal compare basic emotions approaches psychological constructionist found many brain regions activated consistently selectively one emotion category experienced perceived predicted constructionist models region demonstrated functional specificity fear disgust happiness sadness anger authors suggest certain brain areas traditionally assigned certain emotions incorrect instead correspond different emotion categories evidence amygdala anterior insula orbitofrontal cortex contribute core affect feelings pleasure discomfort anterior cingulate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex play key role attention closely related core affect using sensory information anterior cingulate directs attention motor responses according psychological constructionist theory emotions conceptualizations connecting world body dorsolateral prefrontal cortex facilitates executive attention well playing active role conceptualizing prefrontal cortex hippocampus also simulate previous experiences several studies ventrolateral prefrontal cortex supports language consistently active emotion perception
