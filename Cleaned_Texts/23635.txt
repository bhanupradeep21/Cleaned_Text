estrous cycle latin oestrus frenzy originally ancient greek οἶστρος oîstros gadfly set recurring physiological changes induced reproductive hormones females mammalian subclass estrous cycles start sexual maturity females interrupted anestrous phases otherwise known rest phases pregnancies typically estrous cycles repeat death cycles widely variable duration frequency depending animals may display bloody vaginal discharge often mistaken many mammals used commercial agriculture cattle sheep may estrous cycles artificially controlled hormonal medications optimum male equivalent seen primarily ruminants called mammals share reproductive system including regulatory hypothalamic system produces gonadotropinreleasing hormone pulses pituitary gland secretes folliclestimulating hormone luteinizing hormone ovary releases sex hormones including estrogens progesterone however species vary significantly detailed functioning one difference animals estrous cycles resorb endometrium

phase cycle also referred heat contrast females species menstrual cycles sexually active time cycle even ovulate humans menstrual cycles rather estrous cycles unlike species concealed ovulation lack obvious external signs signal estral receptivity ovulation ie ability become pregnant animals estrous cycles often unmistakable outward displays receptivity ranging engorged colorful genitals

anestrum anoestrum completion abortion pregnancy species postpartum estrus ovulation corpus luteum production occurs immediately following birth example mouse fertile postpartum estrus occurs hours following parturition estrous cycle variability differs among species cycles typically frequent smaller animals even within species significant variability observed thus cats may undergo estrous cycle
