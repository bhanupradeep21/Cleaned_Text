pain syndrome surgery commonly performed outpatient surgery various surgical strategies may considered planning inguinal hernia repair include consideration mesh use eg synthetic biologic open repair use laparoscopy type anesthesia general local appropriateness bilateral repair etc mesh non mesh repairs benefits different areas mesh repairs may reduce rate hernia reappearance visceral neurovascular injuries length hospital stay time return activities daily laparoscopy commonly used nonemergency cases however minimally invasive open repair may lower incidence postoperative nausea mesh associated pain surgery conducted local anaesthesia patient asked cough strain procedure help demonstrating repair without tension constipation hernia repair results strain evacuate bowel causing pain fear sutures may rupture opioid analgesia makes constipation worse promoting easy bowel motion important postoperatively surgical correction always recommended inguinal hernias emergency surgery incarceration strangulation carry much higher risk planned elective procedures however risk incarceration low evaluated per hand surgery risk inguinodynia males minimal symptoms advised watchful
