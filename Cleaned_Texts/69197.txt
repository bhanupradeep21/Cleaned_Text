allergic contact dermatitis acd form contact dermatitis manifestation allergic response caused contact substance type irritant contact dermatitis icd although less common icd acd accepted prevalent form immunotoxicity found allergic nature form contact dermatitis hypersensitive reaction atypical within population mechanisms reactions occur complex many levels fine control immunology centres

papules blisters vesicles even simple red area main difference rash caused allergic contact dermatitis one caused irritant contact dermatitis latter tends confined area trigger touched skin whereas allergic contact dermatitis rash likely widespread verification another characteristic allergic contact dermatitis rash usually appears day two exposure allergen unlike irritant contact dermatitis appears immediately contact trigger symptoms may include itching skin redness inflammation localized swelling area may become tender warmer left untreated skin may darken become leathery pain also present dermatitis occur anywhere skin common hands people scattered across body face rash symptoms typically occur hours exposure cases rash may persist individual developed skin reaction certain

based physical exam medical history cases doctors establish accurate diagnosis based symptoms patient experiences rashs appearance case single episode allergic contact dermatitis necessary chronic andor intermittent rashes readily explained history physical exam often benefit testing patch test contact delayed hypersensitivity allergy commonly used examination determine exact cause allergic contact dermatitis according american academy allergy asthma immunology patch testing gold standard contact allergen patch test consists applying small quantities potential allergens small patches placed two days removed skin reaction occurred one substances applied raised bump noticeable underneath patch tests read hours application patch testing used patients chronic recurring contact tests may used diagnose contact dermatitis rule potential causes symptoms include skin biopsy culture skin lesion clinical expression dermatitis mitigated avoidance allergen compliance avoidance measures immune system become less stimulated key avoidance proper evaluation detection inciting allergen however immune system registers allergen recognition permanent first step treating condition appropriate recognition clinical problem followed identification culprit chemical source chemical corticosteroid creams used carefully according prescribed directions overused longer periods time cause thinning skin also instances poison ivy dermatitis calamine lotion cool oatmeal baths may relieve usually severe cases treated systemic corticosteroids may tapered gradually various dosing schedules ranging total days prevent recurrence rash chemical allergen still skin weeks well topical tacrolimus ointment pimecrolimus cream also used additionally corticosteroid creams instead oral antihistamines diphenhydramine hydroxyzine may also used severe cases relieve intense itching via topical antihistamines advised might second skin reaction treatment associated contact dermatitis lotion symptoms caused allergic contact dermatitis may eased cool compresses stop itching vital treatment success trigger identified avoided discomfort caused symptoms may relieved wearing smoothtextured cotton clothing avoid frictional skin irritation avoiding soaps perfumes dyes commonly symptoms may resolve without treatment weeks specific medication may hasten healing long trigger avoided also condition might become chronic allergen detected avoided identification allergen aided site dermatitis allergic dermatitis hands often due contact preservatives fragrances metals rubber
