epilepsy neurological condition recurrent episodes unprovoked epileptic seizures seizure abnormal neuronal brain activity cause intellectual emotional social consequences epilepsy affects children adults ages races one common neurological disorders nervous well condition common among children adults affecting us children age years epileptic seizures different types depending part brain affected seizures classified main types partial seizure genralized child first seizure suspect seizure referred specialized paediatrician epilepsy seizures assess seizure conclude diagnosis specialist doctor take detailed history child perform physical examinations clinical laboratory tests blood genetic test neuroimaging child suspected epileptic seizures additional investigations performed electroencephalogram eeg give information brain electrical activity seizure children treated proper effective therapy prevent irreversible neural treatment options epilepsy include medications diet diet surgery considered children medication resistant epilepsy classified according seizure types epilepsy types epilepsy syndromes seizure types include focal onset generalized onset unknown epilepsy types include focal generalized combination focal generalized unknown accurate classification epilepsy help providing appropriate treatment management assessment epilepsy conducted diagnosed neurologist international league epilepsy ilae proposed treating epilepsy properly classified diagnosed epilepsy confirmed least one following conditions present first condition time seizures occurring greater hours apart necessary diagnosis parameters specific time frame utilized reset clock example person first unprovoked seizure age another seizure years later would diagnosis epilepsy seizures temporary shortlived spontaneously occurring result acute brain trauma fever alcohol withdrawal low high blood sugar would diagnosed epilepsy seizures occur due known cause considered terms second condition high recurrence risk patient already developed one unprovoked seizure labeled greater equal risk another seizure within next years two criteria must met predict greater equal risk second seizure next years first one brain imaging indicate potential brain generate spontaneous recurrent second criteria eeg test must show abnormal electrical brain patterns indicate high risk recurrence another neuroimaging eeg tests show abnormal findings epileptiform potential meaning certain brain waves activity imply associated epilepsy patient experienced one unprovoked seizure patient would diagnosed epilepsy consensus set percentage greater equal represents minimum level confidence someone already experienced two unprovoked seizures likely third third condition diagnosed epilepsy syndrome epilepsy syndromes notably different epilepsy types identified combination specific findings come clinical features eeg neuroimaging genetic testing age dependent evidence findings suggesting specific epilepsy syndrome patient assumed multiple types tests may conducted order accurate diagnosis well create personalized treatment regimen brain imaging tests record brain wave patterns detect abnormalities common brain imaging test electroencephalogram eeg electrodes attached scalp pastelike substance cap record electrical activity brain highdensity eeg may used electrodes

seizures include imbalance neurotransmitters nervesignaling brain chemicals brain tumors stroke brain damage illness injury even combination several causes however majority seizures cause unable factors may contribute seizure episode include head injuries recent fever infection concurrent health conditions medication many different symptoms look epilepsy children vary based seizure type common signs seizure child may appear confused sleep following seizure episode symptoms seizure may like health conditions make sure child sees healthcare provider symptoms also vary depending type seizures one focal seizures seizures start one side brain spread across brain could potentially cause numbness tingling feeling something crawling skin generalized seizures seizures occur abnormal electrical activity causing seizure begins halves brain time could lead loss consciousness shaking stiffening children develop epilepsy treated conventionally anticonvulsants cases childhood epilepsy medication completely control limited evidence supporting medications used treat infantile epilepsy included levetiracetam topiramate vigabatrin phenytoin lamotrigine rufinamide stiripentol carbamazepine valproate majority infants epilepsy prescribed levetiracetam pharmacological monotherapy treatment latter representing children onset anticonvulsant medications risk side effects range mild discomfort major cognitive impairment usually adverse cognitive effects ablated following dose reduction cessation severe adverse effects uncommon infants prescribed levetiracetam topiramate lamotrigine extent cannabinoids cbd also used treat epilepsy children cbd shown reduce seizures children drugresistant epilepsies dre specifically dravet syndromes lead seizure freedom medicating child always easy many pills made swallowed difficult child medications chewable versions goal treatment control stop reduce often seizures occur treatment often done medicine many types medicines used treat seizures epilepsy childs healthcare provider need identify type seizure medicines selected based type seizure age child side effects cost ease use medicines used home usually taken mouth
