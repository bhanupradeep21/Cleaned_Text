vulnerable plaque kind atheromatous plaque collection white blood cells primarily macrophages lipids including cholesterol wall artery particularly unstable prone produce sudden major problems heart attack stroke defining characteristics vulnerable plaque include limited thin fibrous cap large lipidrich necrotic core increased plaque inflammation positive vascular remodeling increased vasavasorum neovascularization intraplaque characteristics together usual hemodynamic pulsating expansion systole elastic recoil contraction diastole contribute high mechanical stress zone fibrous cap atheroma making prone rupture increased hemodynamic stress eg increased blood pressure especially pulse pressure systolic blood pressure vs diastolic blood pressure difference correlates increased rates major cardiovascular events associated exercise especially exercise beyond levels individual routinely generally atheroma becomes vulnerable grows rapidly thin cover separating bloodstream inside arterial lumen tearing cover called plaque rupture however repeated atheroma rupture healing one mechanisms perhaps dominant one creates artery stenosis researchers found accumulation white blood cells especially macrophages termed inflammation walls arteries leads development soft vulnerable plaque released aggressively promotes blood clotting researchers think vulnerable plaque see atherosclerosis formed following inflammation combined stresses high blood pressure increased mechanical stretching contraction arteries heart beat cause thin covering plaque split spilling contents vulnerable plaque bloodstream recent studies shown cholesterol crystals within plaque play key role splitting plaque also inducing sticky cytokines artery wall capture blood cells mainly platelets accumulate site injury cells clump together form thrombus sometimes large enough block artery frequent cause cardiac event following rupture vulnerable plaque blood clotting top site ruptured plaque blocks lumen artery thereby stopping blood flow tissues artery supplies upon rupture atheroma tissue debris may spill blood stream debris cholesterol material often large micrometers pass capillaries downstream usual situation debris obstruct smaller downstream branches artery resulting temporary permanent end arterycapillary closure loss blood supply death previously supplied tissues severe case seen angioplasty slow clearance injected contrast artery lumen situation often termed nonreflow addition atheroma rupture may allow bleeding lumen inner tissue atheroma making atheroma size suddenly increase protrude lumen artery producing lumen narrowing even total obstruction single ruptured plaque identified autopsy cause coronary event currently way identify culprit lesion artery walls typically enlarge response enlarging plaques plaques usually produce much stenosis artery lumen therefore detected cardiac stress tests angiography tests commonly performed clinically goal predicting susceptibility future heart attack contrast conventional angiography cardiac ct angiography enable visualization vessel wall well plaque composition ct derived plaque characteristics help predict acute coronary addition lesions produce significant stenoses typically considered critical andor interventionable interventional cardiologists even though research indicates important lesions producing heart attacks tests commonly performed clinically goal testing susceptibility future heart attack include several medical research efforts starting early using intravascular ultrasound ivus thermography nearinfrared spectroscopy careful clinical followup methods predict lesions individuals prone future heart attacks efforts remain largely research useful clinical methods date furthermore usefulness detecting individual vulnerable plaques invasive methods questioned many vulnerable plaques rupture without associated symptoms remains unclear risk invasive detection methods outweighed clinical another approach detecting understanding plaque behavior used research clinicians use ultrasound noninvasively measure wall thickness usually abbreviated imt portions larger arteries closest skin carotid femoral arteries stability vs vulnerability readily distinguished way quantitative baseline measurements thickest portions arterial wall locations plaque accumulation documenting imt location measurement plaque size basis tracking partially verifying effects medical treatments progression stability potential regression plaque within given individual time may achieved factors
