tooth wear refers loss tooth substance means dental tooth wear common condition occurs approximately normal physiological process occurring throughout life increasing lifespan individuals increasing retention teeth life incidence noncarious tooth surface loss also shown tooth wear varies substantially people groups extreme attrition enamel fractures common archaeological samples erosion common tooth wear predominantly result combination three processes attrition abrasion forms tooth wear lead condition known tooth tissue fractured due stress lesions caused extrinsic forces enamel tooth wear complex multifactorial problem often difficulty identifying single causative however tooth wear often combination processes many clinicians therefore make diagnoses tooth wear major element attrition tooth wear major element erosion reflect makes diagnosis management therefore important distinguish various types tooth wear provide insight diagnosis risk factors causative factors order implement appropriate tooth wear evaluation system twes may help determine likely aetiology tooth heavy tooth wear commonly found occlusal chewing surface noncarious cervical lesions tooth wear also common multiple indices developed order assess record degree tooth wear earliest paul smith knight developed tooth wear index twi four visible surfaces buccal cervical lingual occlusalincisal teeth present scored wear regardless recent index basic erosive wear examination bewe bartlett et al also attrition loss tooth substance caused physical toothtotooth word attrition derived latin verb attritium refers action rubbing attrition mostly causes wear incisal occlusal surfaces teeth attrition associated masticatory force parafunctional bruxism degree attrition normal especially elderly abrasion loss tooth substance caused physical means term derived latin verb abrasum means scrape tends present rounded ditching around cervical margins teeth commonly described shallow concave wedge shaped causative factors linked condition include vigorous horizontal tooth brushing using toothpaste relatively high rda value pipe smoking nail biting also shown improper use dental floss toothpicks lead wear interproximal inbetween surfaces erosion chemical dissolution tooth substance caused acids unrelated acid produced bacteria dental erosion may occur excessive consumption acidic foods drinks medical conditions involving repeated regurgitation reflux gastric derived latin word erosum describes action corrode usually palatal inside surfaces upper front teeth occluding top surfaces molar teeth dental erosion rarely seen archaeological record certain cases described suggested acidic fruits andor plants regularly abfraction loss tooth substance cervical margins purportedly caused minute flexure teeth occlusal term derived latin words ab functio meaning away breaking abfraction presents triangular lesions along cervical margins buccal surfaces teeth enamel thinner therefore presence occluding forces prone whether abfraction exists debated tooth wear indices useful tools carrying epidemiological studies general use dental basic erosive wear examination first described bartlett et

successful active management carried achieved decision needs made whether necessary carry restorative treatment simply managed noninvasive restorative treatment necessary must decided whether conform existing occlusion typically moderate wear teeth affected reorganise occlusion severe wear unstable occlusion occlusion reorganised first tested using reversible method ie hard occlusal splint

wax proposed restorative active restorative management depends upon location wear localised generalised severity wear patients occlusal vertical dimension ovd may changed result tooth wear three potential scenarios tooth scenario relatively common whereas scenario quite rare tends occur wear rapidly occurring scenario occurs due phenomenon called dentoalveolar compensation whereby dentoalveolar tissues compensate wear teeth increasing bony support order maintain constant ovd makes things difficult room build teeth back original height without increasing options restoring loss
