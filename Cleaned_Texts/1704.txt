sydney joined royal society new south wales became assistant astronomical observer sydney observatory held position five years retired moderate competency gave rest life research work hargrave interested experiments kinds early age particularly aircraft father died hargrave came inheritance resigned observatory concentrate fulltime research time gave particular attention flight birds chose live experiment flying machines stanwell park place offers excellent wind hang conditions nowadays famous hang gliding paragliding venue australia career hargrave invented many devices never applied patent needed money passionate believer scientific communication key furthering progress wrote workers must root idea keeping results labours fortune assured patent fees much wasted money flying machine future born fully fledged capable flight miles like everything else must evolved gradually first difficulty get thing fly made full description published aid others excellence design workmanship always defy among many three hargraves inventions particularly significant made endless experiments numerous models communicated conclusions series papers royal society new south wales two papers found volume journal proceedings show early road success important papers found volumes reported experiments flyingmachine motors cellular kites great significance pioneers working toward powered flight hargrave successfully lifted ground train four box kites stanwell park beach november aided james swain caretaker property kite line moored via spring balance two sandbags see image hargrave carried anemometer clinometer aloft measure wind speed angle kite line rose feet wind speed mph experiment widely reported established box kite stable aerial hargrave claimed particular steps gained demonstration extremely simple apparatus made carried flown one man safe means making ascent flying machine trying without risk accident descending service experimenter wishes use seen abbott lawrence rotch meteorological observatory harvard university constructed kite particulars engineering modification adopted weather bureau united states use boxkites meteorological observations became widespread principle applied gliders october alberto santosdumont used boxkite principle aeroplane make first flight boxkite aeroplane usual type europe hargrave confined problem constructing heavierthanair machine would fly given much time means propulsion invented rotary engine appears attracted little notice principle discovered seguin brothers form engine much used early aviation superseded later inventions development rotary engine frustrated weight materials quality machining available time unable get sufficient power engines build independent flying machine hargraves work inspired alexander graham bell begin experiments series tetrahedral kite designs however hargraves work like many pioneers sufficiently appreciated lifetime models offered premier new south wales gift state generally incorrectly stated offer accepted clear really happened appears delays accepting models meantime given visiting german professors handed deutsches museum hargrave also conducted experiments hydroplane application gyroscopic principle onewheeled car wave propelled vessels hargraves son geoffrey killed battle gallipoli may world war hargrave operated appendicitis suffered peritonitis afterwards died july interred waverley cemetery cliffs overlooking open ocean hargrave excellent experimenter models well crafted optimism essential inventor perseverance allow damped failures modest unassuming unselfish always refused patent inventions anxious might succeed adding sum human knowledge many men smiled efforts faith anything would come honourable exception professor richard threlfall presidential address royal society new south wales may spoke strong conviction importance work mr hargrave done towards solving problem artificial flight threlfall called hargrave
