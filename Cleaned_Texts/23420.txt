analgesics would affect clinical exam children recommended given surgeon able examine surgical procedure removal appendix called appendectomy appendectomy performed open laparoscopic surgery laparoscopic appendectomy several advantages open appendectomy intervention acute century laparotomy open appendectomy standard treatment acute procedure consists removal infected appendix single large incision lower right area incision laparotomy usually inches mm long open appendectomy person suspected appendicitis placed general anesthesia keep muscles completely relaxed keep person unconscious incision two three inches mm long made right lower abdomen several inches hip bone incision opens abdomen cavity appendix identified surgeon removes infected tissue cuts appendix surrounding tissue careful close inspection infected area ensuring signs surrounding tissues damaged infected case complicated appendicitis managed emergency open appendectomy abdominal drainage temporary tube abdomen outside avoid abscess formation may inserted may increase hospital update surgeon start closing incision means sewing muscles using surgical staples stitches close skin prevent infections incision covered sterile bandage surgical adhesive laparoscopic appendectomy introduced become increasingly prevalent intervention acute surgical procedure consists making three four incisions abdomen inches mm long type appendectomy made inserting special surgical tool called laparoscope one incisions laparoscope connected monitor outside persons body designed help surgeon inspect infected area abdomen two incisions made specific removal appendix using surgical instruments laparoscopic surgery requires general anesthesia last two hours laparoscopic appendectomy several advantages open appendectomy including shorter postoperative recovery less postoperative pain lower superficial surgical site infection rate however occurrence intraabdominal abscess almost three times prevalent laparoscopic appendectomy open pediatric patients high mobility cecum allows externalization appendix umbilicus entire procedure performed single incision laparoscopicassisted transumbilical appendectomy relatively recent technique long published series good surgical aesthetic treatment begins keeping person surgery eating drinking given period usually overnight intravenous drip used hydrate person surgery antibiotics given intravenously cefuroxime metronidazole may administered early help kill bacteria thus reduce spread infection abdomen postoperative complications abdomen wound equivocal cases may become difficult assess antibiotic treatment benefit serial examinations stomach empty food past six hours general anaesthesia usually used otherwise spinal anaesthesia may used decision perform appendectomy made preparation procedure takes approximately one two hours meanwhile surgeon explain surgery procedure present risks must considered performing appendectomy surgeries risks must evaluated performing procedures risks different depending state appendix appendix ruptured complication rate appendix ruptured complication rate rises almost usual complications occur pneumonia hernia incision thrombophlebitis bleeding adhesions evidence indicates delay obtaining surgery admission results measurable difference outcomes person surgeon explain long recovery process take abdomen hair usually removed avoid complications may appear regarding incision cases patients going surgery experience nausea vomiting require medication surgery antibiotics along pain medication may administered appendectomies hospital lengths stay typically range hours days weeks complications occur recovery process may vary depending severity condition appendix ruptured surgery appendix surgery recovery generally much faster appendix important people undergoing surgery respect doctors advice limit physical activity tissues heal recovery appendectomy may require diet changes lifestyle change length hospital stays appendicitis varies severity condition study united states found average appendicitis hospital stay days stays persons appendix ruptured

patients completely awake moved hospital room recover individuals offered clear liquids day surgery progress regular diet intestines start function correctly patients recommended sit upon edge bed walk short distances several times day moving mandatory pain medication may given necessary full recovery appendectomies takes four six weeks prolonged eight weeks appendix ruptured people appendicitis recover quickly surgical treatment complications occur treatment delayed peritonitis occurs recovery time depends age condition complications circumstances including amount alcohol consumption usually days young children around ten years old recovery takes three weeks possibility peritonitis reason acute appendicitis warrants rapid evaluation treatment people suspected appendicitis may undergo medical evacuation appendectomies occasionally performed emergency conditions ie proper hospital timely medical evacuation impossible typical acute appendicitis responds
