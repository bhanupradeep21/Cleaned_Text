aprosodia neurological condition characterized inability person properly convey interpret emotional prosody prosody language refers ranges rhythm pitch stress intonation etc neurological deficits result damage form nondominant hemisphere areas language production prevalence aprosodias individuals currently unknown testing aprosodia secondary brain injury recent occurrence receptive aprosodia result impairment one sensory andor cognitive levels ranging hearing signal acquisition auditory processing signal isolation emotional comprehension signal interpretation example first two difficulties impair individuals ability observe discern changes stress intonation whereas third impairs individuals ability assess significance stress intonation changes correctly observes discerns impairment third type correlates significantly expressive mixed aprosodia characterized exhibition one specific subtypes aprosodia degree impairment exhibited given person often differing subtype subtypecitation needed loss ability express understand emotions debilitating experiencing aprosodia large impact lives affects daytoday interactions others often overlooked affective prosody integral communication ability form understand correct words patients exhibiting extreme cases aprosodia speak monotone fashion barely able unable distinguish changes stress intonationcitation needed one cause aprosodia trauma one several specific areas brain resulting inability properly process convey emotional cues brain damage occur form ischemic damage removal surgery brain lesions trauma localized bullet wound worth noting however localization occurs range areas vary person person research required define areas diagnostic confirmation aprosodia using brain scanning techniques relatively recent occurrence least respect quantitative brain imaging techniques refined allow greater temporal spatial resolution hoped able learned aprosodias functional anatomical levelcitation needed inability process exhibit emotions proper manner shown exist people consume excessive amounts alcohol exposed alcohol fetuses faexp initially people alcohol use disorder detoxified faexp individuals tested impairment cognitive function limited testing nonaffective aspects language easily recognized physician trained analyzing affective prosody tested using aprosodia battery found alcohol use disorder detoxified faexp individuals demonstrated significant impairment ability detect affective prosody used others major factors influence affective prosody impacted alcohol use greatest least impact alcohol use mother age onset chronic abuse alcohol age initial abuse chronic abuse age person first becomes aprosodia also shown appear secondary several diseases multiple sclerosis post traumatic stress likely time passes diseases shown exhibit aprosodia symptom aprosodia condition often tested presence neurological deficits however becomes known aprosodia battery likely administered frequently example first study testing aprosodia ms occur surprising given changes emotional affect would expected noticed patients exhibiting changes speech patterns especially given patients tested studies scored poorer controls statistically significant amountcitation needed emotional batteries consist asking patients read various sentences specific emotional indicators performance subjectively analyzed expert determine aprosodic analysis often performed two experts independently one judges present interview case patient still able use facial another method implemented test aprosodia involves questionnaires filled close patient doctors nurses taking care patient also requested fill questionnaire aprosodia suspected diagnosis method occurs indicator aprosodia battery administered rather used singular diagnosis tool implementation questionnaire expected become widespread aprosodia revealed sideeffect brain imaging studies related speech functions yielded insights subtle difference aprosodia dysprosody major differences result functions characterized belonging mainly left right hemisphere several functions described dominant lateralized functions corresponding hemispheres found arise communication two ability express receptive affective prosody similar dysprosody aprosodia significant difference characterization dominant vs nondominant hemispherical damagecitation needed due rarity reported aprosodia cases labs currently researching treatment methods aprosodia largest study treatments aprosodia consisted fourteen individuals resulting sample sizes small report statistical significance comparing one treatment another however data gained study still yielded results used next iteration aprosodia researchcitation needed two main forms treatment cognition based imitation based cognitive treatments attempt rebuild emotional toolbox aprosodia basis treatment belief exists defined set emotional responses chosen given scenario choosing proper emotional response much likened choosing proper word describing object deficiency likened brocas aphasia emotions imitative treatments attempt help kickstart motor systems involved production vocal facial emotive gestures basis treatment belief pathways responsible motor elements expressive prosody damaged hypothesized motor damage occurs level planning well level methods treatment evaluated changed several iterations reach beneficial treatment aprosodia although biggest limitation progress aprosodia treatment sample size significant data found influence subsequent phase study rosenbek lab university florida currently new phase treatment study based combinations cognitivelinguistic imitative therapies delivered randomized fashion effort gain insight prominently affects aprosodia research perisylvan region right hemisphere shown similarly mapped analogues speech center left hemisphere especially evident areas resembling brocas area wernickes similarity regions led scientists view aprosodias similar manner aphasias viewed presence aphasia often pronounced individual aprosodia might aphasias traditionally heavily studied aphasias rooted deficiencies language modalities rather affective aspects language easier characterize underlying impairment caused brain damage eg inability choose right word inability speak due motor control combining aphasic research rightleft analogue mapping allowed researchers produce hypotheses underlying process behind various aprosodiascitation needed additionally studying brain regions associated aprosodia brain imaging tests performed determine aprosodia lateralized dominant function right hemisphere areas language production aprosodia considered dominant function right hemisphere strong correlation found deficits affective prosody distribution lesions cortices right brain damage correlation found distribution cortical lesions patients left brain damage types aphasic deficits pronounced patients aprosodia considered lateralized function right hemisphere differences ability patient respond affective prosodic information left brain damage compared right brain damage patients affectiveprosodic deficits left hemisphere dysprosodic patients showed improvement understanding repeating prosodic information conveyed linguistic information simplified ie requiring patient mainly determine prosodic information contained interaction improvement processing affective prosodic information reduced linguistic processing demands occur patients right brain httpsenwikipediaorgwikiaprosodia
