sexual selection mammals process study started charles darwins observations concerning sexual selection including sexual selection humans consisting competition mate choice mold development future phenotypes population given good example intrasexual selection males fight dominance harem females elephant seal large oceangoing mammals genus mirounga two species northern angustirostris southern elephant seal leonina largest carnivoran living today species show extreme sexual dimorphism possibly largest mammal southern males typically five six times heavier females average kilograms lb metres ft long bulls average kilograms lb metres ft recordsized bull shot possession bay south georgia february measured metres ft long estimated weigh kilograms maximum weight female kilograms lb length metres ft males arrive colonies females fight control large body size confers advantages fighting agonistic behaviour bulls gives rise dominance hierarchy access harems breeding activity determined dominant bulls harem masters establish harems several dozen females least successful males harems may try copulate harem males females dominant male looking dominant male must stay territory defend mean months without eating living store blubber males stayed ashore three months without food two fighting males use weight canine teeth outcome rarely fatal defeated bull flee however bulls suffer severe tears cuts males commonly vocalize coughing roar serves individual recognition size assessment conflicts highranking males often resolved posturing vocalizing physical case intrasexual selection adorned males may gain reproductive advantage without intervention female preference advantage conferred weapons used process resolving disputes territorial rights use sexual ornamentation signaling device create dominance hierarchy among males also known pecking order allows struggle proceed without excessive injury fatality predominantly two opposing males closely matched would found males established dominance hierarchy asymmetries found confrontation escalates point asymmetries must proved aggressive use ornamentation often males physically engage manner best understood applying game theory developed biology notably john maynard evolutionary origins giraffes giraffa camelopardalis long neck controversial longaccepted competing browsers hypothesis originally put forth charles darwin put question originally scientists believed elongation giraffes neck result natural selection acting relation foraging behaviour supposed longer necks enabled favoured individuals gather food inaccessible even though giraffes overall height meters still typically feeds meters moreover giraffes kudu impala steenbok competitors feed meters prefer feeding shoulder level well rather maximum height could alternative explanation origin long necks giraffe sexual selection male giraffe often neck males exhibit six criteria need satisfied exaggerated neck classified result sexual selection characteristic exaggerated one sexes must used indicate dominance direct survival benefits cost organism terms survival factors eg positive allometry evolutionary history shows increased neck length correlated increases parts body would expected foraging selection sexual selection may satisfactory studies failed resolve causes involved perhaps neck result precopulatory mechanisms determine father offspring prior sex competition biggest precopulatory mechanism mammals sexual dimorphism result competition easily seen species competition copulate opposite sex often seen mammals african elephants strongly promote competition elephants continuously grow throughout lifetime males grow older also experience increasing lapses musth violent sexual excitement reproductive success happens males musth helps win fight male musth one result death latter species intense competition known exhibit size example female american black bears ursus americanus smaller male mammals compete harems well elephant seals competing fiercely harems mammals reach sexual maturity secondary sexual characteristic elephant seals proboscis adult male used project loud noises frequently heard mating elephant seals bigger proboscis emit lower sounds males smaller proboscis bigger males colony mateguarding important factor competition ensure fertilization offspring successful helps overlook court especially prevents sperm competition occurring ensures reproductive success process engaged postcoital signal sent male keep guard mating plugs form mateguarding proved show precopulatory female copulatory plugs commonly acellular thought made proteins seminal dna taken copulatory plugs show females deter mating close relatives breeding season mammals call opposite sex male koalas bigger let different sound smaller koalas bigger males routinely sought called sires females choose sires indirect benefits offspring could inherit like larger nonsires females vary body mass reject male screaming hitting competition rarely exhibited acoustic signaling type call used significant distance encoding organisms location condition sacwinged bats display acoustic signaling often interpreted songs females hear songs named whistle call onto males breed screech action termed calling red deer spotted hyenas along mammals also perform acoustic testosterone driving factor towards achieving fertilizing success bighorn sheep display curved horns rams species big compared small horns displayed females species bigger horns testosterone found male important social rank positive correlation length social rank leads tending group females copulate testosterone also appears polygynous species monogamous polyandrous females two mating partners heat females likely find new mate current male high number paternities year current male old presumed effect offspring giving genetic sex role reversal change behavior specific species ordinary pattern sexrole reversal supports sexual dimorphism competition common abnormality within animals accepted sex roles females invest choosing best possible mate part bringing offspring males gestation lactation gestation lactation energyconsuming means competition resources competitions observed gain access better mates meerkat females acquire dominant status resources female reproduction dominant females species heavier win competitions females copulating opposite sex ensure fertilization egg postcopulatory mechanisms include sperm cryptic female sperm competition involves male gametes trying fertilize eggs first result sperm competition males given species develop bigger testes seminal larger midpiece areas sperm contain mitochondria also larger testes bigger midpieces sperm seen males mate multiple partners female multiple partners likely give birth offspring fathered male produced faster found primates rodents longer flagellum fathered length baculum also influenced sperm competition mammal cryptic female choice postcopulatory mechanism observed takes place inside females enables female control fathers child even species females may choose mate one male prevent infanticide harassment infanticide prevented confusing males given colony female mates multiple males males know sure fathered offspring infanticide also prevented choosing male protect sexual harassment may avoided females give males copulate
