cardiogenic shock medical emergency resulting inadequate blood flow bodys organs due dysfunction heart signs inadequate blood flow include low urine production mlhour cool arms legs decreased level consciousness people may also severely low blood pressure heart rate causes cardiogenic shock include cardiomyopathic arrhythmic mechanical cardiogenic shock commonly precipitated heart treatment cardiogenic shock depends cause initial goals improve blood flow body cardiogenic shock due heart attack attempts open hearts arteries may help certain medications dobutamine milrinone improve hearts ability contract also used measures fail advanced options mechanical support devices heart transplantation pursued cardiogenic shock condition difficult fully reverse even early however early initiation treatment may improve outcomes care also directed organs affected lack blood flow eg dialysis kidneys mechanical ventilation lung dysfunction mortality rates cardiogenic shock high decreasing united states likely due rapid identification treatment recent decades studies suggested possibly related new treatment advances nonetheless mortality rates remain high multiorgan failure addition cardiogenic shock associated higher rates presentation followingcitation needed cardiogenic shock caused failure heart pump effectively due damage heart muscle often heart attack myocardial causes include abnormal heart rhythms cardiomyopathy heart valve problems ventricular outflow obstruction ie systolic anterior motion hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ventriculoseptal defects also caused sudden decompressurization eg aircraft air bubbles released bloodstream henrys law causing heart electrocardiogram helps establish exact diagnosis guides treatment may reveal echocardiography may show poor ventricular function signs pedclarification needed rupture interventricular septum obstructed outflow tract cardiomyopathycitation needed ultrasound showing cardiogenic shock due ultrasound showing cardiogenic shock due catheter pulmonary artery catheter may assist diagnosis providing information hemodynamicscitation needed cardiomyopathy suspected cause cardiogenic shock biopsy heart muscle may needed make definite diagnosiscitation needed cardiac index falls acutely person may cardiogenic shockcitation needed initial management cardiogenic shock involves medications augment hearts function certain medications dobutamine milrinone enhance hearts pumping function often used firstline improve low blood pressure delivery blood rest patients cardiogenic shock unresponsive medication therapy may candidates advanced options mechanical circulatory support device several types mechanical circulatory support devices common intraaortic balloon pumps left ventricular assist devices venousarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation important note however none devices permanent solutions rather bridge definitive therapy heart transplantion intraaortic balloon pump device placed cardiac surgeon descending aorta consists small balloon filled helium helps heart pump blood inflating diastole resting phase cardiac cycle deflating systole contracting phase cardiac intraaortic balloon pumps directly increase cardiac output importantly decrease amount pressure heart pump thereby allowing blood flow oxygen delivered heart intraaortic balloon pumps around several decades commonly used firstline mechanical circulatory support however without potential complications potential complications include injury upon insertion device arteries supplying spinal cord well risks procedure bleeding contraindications intraaortic balloon pumps include aortic dissection abdominal aortic aneurysm irregularly fast heart several types left ventricular assist devices impella devices common device placed cardiac surgeon left ventricle heart essentially acts pump drawing blood left ventricle pushing aorta could delivered rest unlike intraaortic balloon pumps impella acts independently cardiac adjusted pump faster rates take blood left ventricle aorta quickly thereby decreasing amount work left ventricle impella commonly used settings cardiogenic shock evidence suggests placing impella device acute cardiogenic shock setting heart fails pump suddenly may necessarily guarantee increased potential complications specific impella device include hemolysis shearing blood cells well formation lesions heart valve namely mitral aortic contraindications impella device insertion include aortic dissection presence mechanical aortic valve presence blood clot left venousarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit support system meant replace function heart heals awaits definitive consists circuit essentially drains blood patients venous system runs blood circulator adds oxygen removes carbon dioxide ultimately returns blood back patients arterial system newly oxygenated blood delivered persons organs evidence suggests combination impella device venousarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may decrease hearts pulmonary capillary wedge pressure thereby decreasing amount stress cardiac venousarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation invasive procedure usually firstline chosen device patients cardiogenic shock often reserved patients cardiogenic shock also respiratory failure andor concomitant cardiac complications venousarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation include air embolism pulmonary edema blood clotting circuit httpsenwikipediaorgwikicardiogenicshock
