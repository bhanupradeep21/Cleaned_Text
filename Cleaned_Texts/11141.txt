epidural administration ancient greek ἐπί upon dura method medication administration medicine injected epidural space around spinal cord epidural route used physicians nurse anesthetists administer local anesthetic agents analgesics diagnostic medicines radiocontrast agents medicines glucocorticoids epidural administration involves placement catheter epidural space may remain place duration treatment technique intentional epidural administration medication first described spanish military surgeon fidel pagés epidural anaesthesia causes loss sensation including pain blocking transmission signals nerve fibres near spinal cord reason epidurals commonly used pain control childbirth surgery technique considered safe effective providing pain relief childbirth surgery considered effective safer giving pain medication mouth intravenous line epidural injection may also used administer steroids treatment inflammatory conditions spinal cord recommended people severe bleeding disorders low platelets infections near intended injection site severe complications epidural administration rare include problems resulting improper administration well adverse effects medicine common complications epidural injections include bleeding problems headaches inadequate pain control epidural analgesia childbirth may also impact mothers ability move labor large doses anesthetics analgesics may result respiratory depression epidural injection may administered point spine commonly lumbar spine end spinal cord specific administration site determines specific nerves affected thus area body pain blocked insertion epidural catheter consists threading needle bones ligaments reach epidural space without going far puncture dura mater saline air may used confirm placement epidural space alternatively direct imaging injection area may performed portable ultrasound fluoroscopy confirm correct placement placed medication may administered one single doses may continually infused period time placed properly epidural catheter may remain inserted several days usually removed possible use less invasive administration methods oral medication epidural injections commonly used provide pain relief analgesia usually involves epidural injection local anesthetic opioids commonly called epidural effective oral intravenous iv opioids common modalities analgesia epidural administered woman may feel pain may still feel epidural clonidine rarely used extensively studied management analgesia epidural analgesia considered safer effective method relieving pain labor compared intravenous oral analgesia cochrane review studies compared epidural analgesia oral opioids advantages epidural analgesia versus opioids included fewer instances naloxone use newborns decreased risk maternal disadvantages epidural analgesia versus opioids included longer labor durations increased need oxytocin stimulate uterine contractions increased risk fever low blood pressure muscle however review found difference overall caesarean delivery rates epidural analgesia versus analgesia additionally difference found immediate neonatal health child epidural analgesia versus analgesia furthermore occurrence longterm backache unchanged epidural complications epidural analgesia rare may include headaches dizziness difficulty breathing seizures mother child may experience slow heartbeat decreased ability regulate temperature potential exposure drugs administered overall difference outcomes based time epidural administered specifically change rate caesarean section birth must assisted instruments duration labor also change apgar score newborn early late epidural epidurals lowdose ambulatory epidurals also impact ability mother move labor movement walking changing positions may help improve labor comfort decrease risk epidural analgesia demonstrated several benefits surgeries including decreasing need use oral systemic reducing risk postoperative respiratory problems chest blood transfusion myocardial use epidural analgesia surgery place systemic analgesia less likely decrease intestinal motility would occur systemic opioid therapy blockade sympathetic nervous surgeries spinal analgesia may used include lower abdominal surgery lower limb surgery cardiac surgery perineal injection steroids epidural space sometimes used treat nerve root pain radicular pain inflammation caused conditions spinal disc herniation degenerative disc disease spinal risk complications steroid administration low complications usually minor specific drug dose frequency administration impacts risk severity complications complications epidural steroid administration similar side effects steroids administered manners include higher normal blood sugar especially patients type epidural blood patch consists small amount persons blood injected epidural space done method sealing hole leak injected blood clots site puncture closes leak modulates csf may used treat postduralpuncture headache leakage cerebrospinal fluid due dural puncture occurs approximately epidural analgesia use epidural analgesia anesthetic considered safe effective situations epidural analgesia contraindicated people complications cellulitis near injection site severe cases may contraindicated people low platelets increased intracranial pressure decreased cardiac due risk disease progression also potentially contraindicated people preexisting progressive neurologic heart conditions stenosis aortic mitral valves also contraindication use epidural administration low blood pressure epidural generally used people administered anticoagulation therapy increases risk complications addition blocking nerves carry pain signals local anesthetics may block nerves carry signals though sensory nerve fibers sensitive effects local anesthetics motor nerve fibers reason adequate pain control usually attained without blocking motor neurons would cause loss muscle control occurred depending drug dose administered effects may last minutes several epidural provide pain control without much effect muscle strength example woman labor administered continuous analgesia via epidural may impairment ability move larger doses medication likely result side large doses medications cause paralysis intercostal muscles thoracic diaphragm responsible breathing may lead respiratory depression arrest may also result loss sympathetic nerve input heart may cause significant decrease heart rate blood obese people given birth prior history opiate use cervical dilation cm higher risk inadequate pain dura accidentally punctured administration may cause cerebrospinal fluid leak epidural space causing postduralpuncture occurs approximately epidural procedures headache may severe last several days rarely weeks months caused reduction csf pressure mild postduralpuncture headaches may treated caffeine severe headaches may treated epidural blood patch though cases resolve spontaneously time less common severe complications include subdural hematoma cerebral venous thrombosis epidural catheter may also rarely inadvertently placed subarachnoid space occurs less procedures occurs cerebrospinal fluid freely aspirated catheter used detect misplacement occurs catheter withdrawn replaced elsewhere though occasionally fluid may aspirated despite dural dural puncture recognized large doses anesthetic may delivered directly cerebrospinal fluid may result high block rarely total spinal anesthetic delivered directly brainstem causing unconsciousness sometimes epidural administrations also cause bleeding issues including bloody tap occurs approximately occurs epidural veins inadvertently punctured needle insertion common occurrence usually considered problem people normal blood clotting permanent neurological problems bloody tap extremely rare estimated less however people coagulopathy may risk epidural hematoma thrombocytopenia might bleed expected cochrane review found evidence regarding effect platelet transfusions prior lumbar puncture epidural anesthesia participants unclear whether major surgeryrelated bleeding within hours surgeryrelated complications days procedure affected epidural rare complications epidural administration include formation epidural abscess epidural hematoma neurological injury lasting longer year paraplegia rarely epidural may cause death circumstances contraindications exist numerous fascial plane blocks may provided instead bupivacaine medication commonly administered via epidural inadvertently administered vein cause excitation nervousness tingling around mouth tinnitus tremor dizziness blurred vision seizures well central nervous system depression loss consciousness respiratory depression apnea bupivacaine intended epidural administration implicated cardiac arrests resulting death accidentally administered vein instead epidural administration large doses opioids epidural space may cause itching respiratory sensation needing urinate often significantly diminished completely absent administration epidural local anesthetics urinary catheter often placed duration epidural many women given epidural analgesia labor oxytocin also used augment uterine contractions one study examined rate breastfeeding two days following epidural anesthesia childbirth epidural analgesia used combination oxytocin resulted lower maternal oxytocin prolactin levels response breastfeeding second day following birth results decrease amount milk epidural injected epidural space inside bony spinal canal outside dura contact inner surface dura another membrane called arachnoid mater contains cerebrospinal fluid adults spinal cord terminates around level disc neonates extends reach low spinal cord bundle nerves known cauda equina horses tail hence lumbar epidural injections carry low risk injuring spinal cord insertion epidural needle involves threading needle bones ligaments epidural space without puncturing layer immediately containing csf epidural administration procedure requires person performing insertion technically proficient order avoid complications proficiency may trained using bananas fruits person receiving epidural may seated lying side level spine catheter placed depends mainly site intended operation based location pain iliac crest commonly used anatomical landmark lumbar epidural injections level roughly corresponds fourth lumbar vertebra usually well termination spinal tuohy needle designed curved tip side hole redirect inserted catheter vertically along axis spine may inserted midline spinous processes using paramedian approach tip needle passes along shelf vertebral bone called lamina reaching ligamentum flavum epidural along sudden loss resistance pressure plunger syringe slight clicking sensation may felt operator tip needle breaches ligamentum flavum enters epidural space saline air may used identify placement epidural space systematic review showed difference terms safety efficacy use saline air addition loss resistance technique direct imaging placement may used may conducted portable ultrasound scanner fluoroscopy moving xray placement tip needle catheter small tube threaded needle epidural space needle withdrawn catheter catheter generally inserted cm epidural space typically secured skin adhesive tape similar intravenous short duration action desired single dose medication called bolus may administered thereafter bolus may repeated necessary provided catheter remains undisturbed prolonged effect continuous infusion medication may used evidence automated intermittent bolus technique may provide better pain control continuous infusion technique even total doses administered typically effects epidural block noted specific level portion body determined site injection higher injection may result sparing nerve function lower spinal nerves example thoracic epidural performed upper abdominal surgery may effect area surrounding genitals pelvic procedures rapid onset spinal anesthetic postoperative analgesic effects epidural desired techniques may used combination called combined spinal epidural anesthesia cse spinal anesthetic may administered one location epidural adjacent location alternatively locating epidural space tuohy needle spinal needle may inserted tuohy needle subarachnoid spinal dose given spinal needle withdrawn epidural catheter inserted normal method known needlethroughneedle technique may associated slightly higher risk placing catheter subarachnoid epidural analgesia generally well tolerated recovery time quick administration complete epidural removed epidural catheter usually removed possible safely switch oral administration medications though catheters safely remain place several days little risk bacterial particularly skin prepared chlorhexidine subcutaneously tunneled epidural catheters may safely left place longer periods low risk infection regardless length use effects medicine administered epidurally including numbness used analgesia usually wear within hours epidural stopped full recovery normal function within use epidural analgesia birth effect whether caesarean section must performed future births epidural analgesia childbirth also generally negative effects longterm health mother use epidural analgesia versus oral analgesia analgesia effect normal length hospital stay childbirth difference care must performed around epidural insertion site prevent following epidural analgesia used gastrointestinal surgery time
