following synonymizations proposed coombs thought exist far longer member distinct faunas contemporaries fossils date million years ago campanianmaastrichtian ages late cretaceous period came dinosaur

holotype euoplocephalus uncertain specimens reliably referred e tutus came lower upper dinosaur park formation known ankylosaurids top formation thus euoplocephalus specimens date less million years ago late campanian according coombs euoplocephalus may cursorial abilities par modern rhinoceros based form humerusshoulder articulation arrangement protracting muscles upper arm appears upper arm sloped away coombs maryanska observed euoplocephalus specimens usually discovered isolated elements partial skeletons suggested animal engaged solitary habits usually either solitary participated small group armor euoplocephalus may keratinous covering may floated skin seen modern crocodiles addition protection heavily vascularized armor may role palpebral bones eyes may provided additional protection eyes bones euoplocephalus discovered upper part eye socket instead front upper socket rim common position coombs explained assuming bones located eyelid musculature probably mobile enough moved tail club ankylosaurids often interpreted defensive weapon euoplocephalus presence ossified tendons distal half tail may support distal half tail stiffened tendons anterior half could still move freely side side ossified tendons would transmitted force swing club reinforced supporting club likely held ground sufficient musculature raise tail study concluded large ankylosaurian clubs could generate sufficient force break bone impacts average small ones could also concluded tail swinging behavior feasible ankylosaurids remains unknown whether tail used interspecific defense intraspecific combat tail club could swung low toward fragile metatarsals shin bones attacking theropods euoplocephalus relatively small eyes necessarily mean restricted vision complex respiratory passages observed skull suggest euoplocephalus good sense smell although examination casts endocranium show enlarged olfactory region teresa maryanska worked extensively mongolian ankylosaurids suggested respiratory passages primarily used perform mammallike treatmentclarification needed inhaled air based presence arrangement specialized present study found nasal passages euoplocephalus looped complex possibly adaptation heat water balance vocal resonance researchers discovered enlarged vascularised chamber back nasal tract considered authors adaptation improve sense smell researchers also managed reconstruct dinosaurs inner ear concluded capable hearing low frequencies suggested may adaption hearing lowtoned resonant sounds produced nasal euoplocephalus like ankylosaurians thought broad muzzle could indicate nonselective feeder perhaps similar hippopotamus would provide niche separation contemporaneous nodosaurids narrower ankylosaurians historically thought feeding using simple upanddown movements jaws georg haas examined evidence jaw muscles two skulls amnh concluded despite large size skulls associated musculature relatively weak also thought jaw movement largely orthogonal vertical plane haas extrapolated dinosaurs like euoplocephalus likely ate relatively soft nonabrasive however later research indicated forward sideways jaw movement possible skull able withstand considerable euoplocephalus appears able make complex movements tooth wear jaw articulations within lower jaw lower jawquadrate joint suggest lower jaws pulled back feeding also slightly pivoted inward action
