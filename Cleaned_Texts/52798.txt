different murine model found play role improving course inflammatory bowel disease epithelial restoration loss protective mucin barrier large however humans inflammatory bowel disease effect pathology important cytokine maintaining intestinal homeostasis action helps enhance defense surface intestinal mucosa weakening mucin layer ability produce antimicrobial agents βdefensins powerful mechanism helps maintain intestinal increase levels together increased βdefensin expression reported inflammatory skin diseases psoriasis well could thus involved development skin diseases since humans without problems expression effects complement stimulate increased amount antimicrobial peptides site like ilc express mhc ii appropriating function antigen presenting however ilcs lack costimulatory receptors necessary proper activation initiation immune response ilcs contrary may set helper lymphocytes state anergy case ilc ability express mhc ii apparently serves maintain tolerance commensal
