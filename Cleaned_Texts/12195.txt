medical device hijack also called medjack type cyber attack weakness target medical devices hospital covered extensively press medical device hijacking received additional attention function increase identified attacks globally research released early attacks endanger patients allowing hackers alter functionality critical devices implants exposing patients medical history potentially granting access prescription infrastructure many institutions illicit seems additional sophistication designed reveal searches older vulnerable operating systems found embedded within medical devices ability hide sandboxes defense tools safe nonvm environment considerable discussion debate topic rsa event special session debate ensued various medical device suppliers hospital executives audience vendors ownership financial responsibility remediate massive installed base vulnerable medical device notwithstanding discussion fda guidance well intended may go far enough remediate problem mandatory legislation part new national cyber security policy may required address threat medical device hijacking sophisticated attacker tools used hospitals new variants ransomware seem targeted hospitals cyberattack attacker places malware within networks variety methods malwareladen website targeted email infected usb stick socially engineered access etc malware propagates within network time existing cyber defenses clear attacker tools standard serves workstations endpoints cyber defense software access embedded processors within medical devices embedded operating systems within medical devices running microsoft windows windows xp security operating systems longer supported relatively easy targets establish attacker tools inside medical devices cyber attacker finds safe harbor establish backdoor command control since medical devices fda certified hospital cybersecurity team personnel access internal software without perhaps incurring legal liability impacting operation
