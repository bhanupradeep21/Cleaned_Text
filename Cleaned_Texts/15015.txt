glossopharyngeal nerves slurred speech dysarthria disordered vocal quality dysphonia also common damage cerebellum inferior cerebellar peduncle cause ataxia damage hypothalamospinal fibers disrupts sympathetic nervous system relay gives symptoms similar symptoms caused horners syndrome miosis anhidrosis partial ptosiscitation needed palatal myoclonus twitching muscles mouth may observed due

medullary syndrome also cause bradycardia slow heart rate increases decreases patients average blood clinical manifestation resulting occlusion posterior inferior cerebellar artery pica one branches vertebral artery lateral part medulla oblongata infarcts resulting typical pattern commonly affected artery pica specifically lateral medullary segment since lateral medullary syndrome often caused stroke diagnosis time dependent diagnosis usually done assessing vestibularrelated symptoms order determine medulla infarction occurred head impulsive nystagmus test skew hints examination oculomotor function often performed along computed tomography ct magnetic resonance imaging mri assist stroke detection standard stroke assessment must done rule concussion head treatment lateral medullary syndrome dependent quickly treatment lateral medullary syndrome involves focusing relief symptoms active rehabilitation help patients return daily activities many patients undergo speech therapy depressed mood withdrawal society seen patients following initial onslaught symptomscitation needed severe cases feeding tube may need inserted mouth gastrostomy may necessary swallowing impaired cases medication may used reduce eliminate residual pain studies reported success mitigating chronic neuropathic pain associated syndrome antiepileptics gabapentin longterm treatment generally involves use antiplatelets like aspirin clopidogrel statin regimen rest lives order minimize risk another warfarin used atrial fibrillation present medications may necessary order suppress high blood pressure risk factors associated strokes blood thinner may prescribed patient order break infarction reestablish blood flow try prevent future one unusual difficult treat symptoms occur due wallenberg syndrome interminable violent hiccups hiccups severe patients often struggle eat sleep carry conversations depending severity blockage caused stroke hiccups last weeks unfortunately successful medications available mediate inconvenience constant hiccupscitation needed dysphagia symptoms repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation shown assist rehabilitation overall traditional stroke assessment outcomes used treat patients since lateral medullary syndrome often caused stroke lateral outlook someone lateral medullary syndrome depends upon size location area brain stem damaged individuals may see decrease symptoms within weeks months others may left significant neurological disabilities years initial symptoms however patients seen minimal symptoms present six months time original stroke able independently accomplish average daily within lateral medullary syndrome common form posterior ischemic stroke syndrome estimated around new cases syndrome united states overall highest risk lateral medullary syndrome men average age history hypertension diabetes smoking increase risk large artery large artery atherosclerosis thought greatest risk factor lateral medullary
