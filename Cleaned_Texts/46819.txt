prediabetes include overweight obese physical inactivity unhealthy diet family history diabetes genetic predisposition prediabetes diabetes older age women history gestational diabetes high birth

pathology although lesser risk impaired glucose tolerance igt ifg sometimes progresses type diabetes mellitus fasting blood glucose levels continuum within given population higher fasting glucose levels corresponding higher risk complications caused high glucose levels patients impaired fasting glucose also may diagnosed impaired glucose tolerance many normal responses glucose tolerance test fasting glucose helpful identifying prediabetes positive risk false world health organization criteria impaired fasting glucose differs american diabetes association ada criteria normal range glucose
