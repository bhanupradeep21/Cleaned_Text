bay hair coat color horses characterized reddishbrown brown body color black point coloration mane tail ear edges lower legs bay one common coat colors many horse breeds black areas bay horses hair coat called black points without horse bay horse black points may sometimes covered white markings however markings alter horses classification bay bay horses dark skin except white markings skin pink genetically bay occurs horse carries agouti gene black base coat basic genetics create bay coloring fairly simple genes mechanisms cause shade variations within bay family quite complex times disputed genetics dark shades bay still study genetic mechanism produces seal brown yet isolated sooty genetics also appear darken horses bay coats genetic mechanism yet fully understood addition dilution genes various spotting pattern genes create many additional coat colors although underlying bay coat color genetics usually manifest warmtoned red tan brownish body color appearance black points bay horses range color light copper red rich red blood bay bestknown variety bay horse dark red brown called dark bay mahogany bay blackbay brown seal brown dark brown shades bay referred languages words

chestnut brown mane tail legs black points bay horses black skin dark eyes except skin markings pink skin color help observer distinguish bay horse white markings horse resembles bay pigment bay horses coat regardless shade rich fully saturated makes bays particularly lustrous sun properly cared bay horses exhibit dappling caused textured concentric rings within coat dapples bay horse suggest good condition care though many wellcared horses never dapple tendency dapple may also extent genetic red areas bay coat usually twotoned hair shaft shaved closely bodyclipping horse show may cause horse appear several shades lighter somewhat dull orangegold almost like dun however hair grows darken proper shade phenomenon linked genetics produce red coloration horses usually seen bodyclipped darker shades bay less red hair shaft many terms used describe particular shades qualities bay coat shade variations related nutrition grooming appear caused inherited factors yet fully understood shades least amount point coloration called wild bays wild bays true bays fully pigmented reddish coat color black manes tails black points extend pastern fetlock wild bay sometimes found conjunction trait called pangare produces pale color underbelly soft areas near stifle around breed registries use term brown describe darker bays though modern genetics resulted terminology revisions use bay brown however liver chestnuts horses red brown mane tail well dark brownish body coat sometimes called brown colloquial contexts therefore brown ambiguous term describing horse coat color clearer refer darkcolored horses dark bays liver chestnuts complicate matters apparently exists one genetic mechanism darkens coat colors one theorized sooty gene produces dark shading coat color specific allele agouti linked certain type dark bay called seal brown seal brown horse dark brown body lighter areas around eyes muzzle flanks dna test said detect seal brown allele developed test never subjected peer review due unreliable results subsequently pulled foals born bay carry dominant gene graying thus turn gray mature eventually hair coat completely white foals going become gray must one parent gray foals may born white hairs already visible around eyes muzzle finehaired thinskinned areas others may show signs graying several months old bay color created two colors melanin pigment black eumelanin gives black color mane tail lower legs red pheomelanin gives body redbrown color unlike point coloration siamese cats himalayan rabbits points horses produced albinism gene instead two genes called extension agouti interact create pattern agouti dominant ancestral allele limits location black pigment points seen bay color recessive allele allows black pigment cover whole body resulting fully black extension horses dominant ancestral e allele able produce either red black pigment depending agouti genotype horses e bay black recessive e alleles replaces black pigment coat red creating solid red chestnut coat regardless agouti genotype bay horse must least one e extension least one extent bay passes color varies two bay horses heterozygous e ee x ee statistical probability produce chestnut similarly bay horses heterozygous aa x aa may produce black foal chestnuts e extension recessive bays e two chestnut horses never bay foal likewise blacks agouti recessive

genetics behind different shades bay still investigation genome wide association study identified region equine chromosome appears correlate extent black pigment bay horses region includes end agouti

sometimes zebralike black stripes along dorsal stripe seen dun horses called primitive markings years ago mutation called nondun appeared allowed horses bay nondun replaces tan dun color darker brown
