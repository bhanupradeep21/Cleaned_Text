angelman syndrome angelmans genetic disorder mainly affects nervous symptoms include small head specific facial appearance severe intellectual disability developmental disability limited functional speech balance movement problems seizures sleep children usually happy personality particular interest symptoms generally become noticeable one year angelman syndrome due lack function part chromosome typically due new mutation rather one often due deletion mutation gene occasionally due inheritance two copies chromosome father none mother paternal uniparental fathers versions inactivated process known genomic imprinting functional version gene diagnosis based symptoms possibly genetic cure treatment generally supportive antiseizure medications used physical therapy bracing may help affected nearly normal life affects males females affected equal named british pediatrician harry angelman first described syndrome older term happy puppet syndrome generally considered syndrome separate condition caused similar loss fathers chromosome signs symptoms angelman syndrome relative frequency affected individuals angelman syndrome caused lack expression gene known gene located within region chromosome known part ubiquitin pathway fact codes selective ubiquitin ligase Î²catenin identified ubiquitination typically fetus inherits maternal copy paternal copy certain areas developing brain paternal copy inactivated process known imprinting fetus relies functioning maternal copy order develop normally individual however maternal gene absent functioning normally due genetic errors deletion mutation segment chromosome uniparental disomy translocation angelman syndrome caused single mutation gene common genetic defect leading angelman syndrome megabase maternal deletion chromosomal region specifically paternal copy known imprinted within hippocampus cortex thalamus olfactory bulb therefore areas brain functioning maternal copy essential proper developmentcitation

syndrome based oncitation needed diagnostic criteria disorder initially established collaboration angelman syndrome foundation criteria underwent revision seizures consequence excessive major hindrance early diagnosis conditions appear similar currently cure available epilepsy controlled use one types anticonvulsant medications however difficulties ascertaining levels types anticonvulsant medications needed establish control people often multiple types many families use promote sleep condition often affects sleep patterns many individuals angelman syndrome sleep maximum five hours one timecitation needed mild laxatives also used frequently encourage regular bowel movements additionally among cohort individuals ranitidine shown frequently prescribed medication treating gastroesophageal reflux disease early intervention physiotherapy sometimes used encourage joint mobility prevent stiffening joints speech language therapy commonly employed assist individuals angelman syndrome communication issuescitation needed occupational therapists contribute development augmentation nonverbal communication skills addressing foundational skills finger isolation motor planning handeye coordination spatial awareness refining important individuals angelman syndrome already possess form nonverbal communication much harder time adapting changes new existing aac device communicate needs much faster occupational therapists assist individuals angelman syndrome many skills many individuals angelman syndrome also difficulty processing sensory information responding appropriately sensory occupational therapists work together individuals improve visual perceptual skills increase sensory syndrome generally happy contented people like human contact playcitation needed people exhibit profound desire personal interaction others communication difficult first child develops definite character ability make understood people tend develop strong nonverbal skills compensate limited use speech widely accepted understanding communication directed much larger ability return conversation affected people develop words severity symptoms associated angelman syndrome varies significantly across population affected speech greater degree selfcare possible among least profoundly affected walking use simple sign language may beyond reach profoundly affected early continued participation physical occupational related development finemotor control skills communication speech therapies believed significantly improve prognosis areas cognition communication individuals affected specific genetic mechanism underlying condition thought correlate general prognosis affected person one end spectrum mutation gene thought correlate least affected whereas larger deletions chromosome thought correspond affectedcitation needed clinical features angelman syndrome alter age adulthood approaches hyperactivity poor sleep patterns improve seizures decrease frequency often cease altogether eeg abnormalities less obvious medication typically advisable seizure disorders often overlooked contribution poor sleep patterns frequency andor severity seizures medication may worthwhile help deal issue improve prognosis respect seizures sleep also noteworthy reports frequency severity seizures temporarily escalate pubescent angelman syndrome girls seem affect longterm
