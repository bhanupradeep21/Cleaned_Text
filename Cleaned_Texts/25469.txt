transposition great vessels tgv group congenital heart defects involving abnormal spatial arrangement great vessels superior andor inferior venae cavae pulmonary artery pulmonary veins aorta congenital heart diseases involving primary arteries pulmonary artery aorta belong subgroup called transposition great arteries tga considered common congenital heart lesion presents transposed vessels present atriovenous ventriculoarterial andor arteriovenous discordance effects may range slight change blood pressure interruption circulation depending nature degree misplacement specific vessels involvedcitation needed although transposed literally means swapped many types tgv involve vessels abnormal positions actually swapped terms tgv tga commonly used reference dextrotga two main arteries swapped positions however terms also commonly used though slightly lesser extent reference levotga arteries ventricles swapped defects category almost never referred either termscitation needed dextrotransposition great arteries also known dextrotga cyanotic heart defect aorta arises right ventricle pulmonary artery arises left ventricle switch causes deoxygenated blood right heart pumped immediately aorta circulated throughout body heart bypassing lungs altogether condition left heart continuously pumps oxygenated blood back lungs pulmonary artery instead bodys circulation normally would effect two separate parallel circulatory systems created called cyanotic congenital heart defect chd newborn infant turns blue cyanotic lack oxygencitation needed levotransposition great arteries also known levotga congenitally corrected tga double discordance ventricular inversion rare acyanotic heart defect primary arteries transposed aorta anterior left pulmonary artery morphological left right ventricles corresponding atrioventricular valves also words right ventricle left side heart left ventricle right side heart systemic pulmonary circulation connected condition complications arise pressure change due fact right ventricle adapted pumping blood lowpressure pulmonary circulation tasked pumping blood much higher pressure high resistance systemic circulation since position left ventricle typically locatedcitation needed many cases tgv accompanied heart defects common type intracardiac shunts atrial septal defect including patent foramen ovale ventricular septal defect patent ductus arteriosus stenosis defects valves andor vessels may also presentcitation needed heart defects present called simple tgv defects present called complex tgv symptoms may appear birth birth severity symptoms depends type tgv type size heart defects may present ventricular septal defect atrial septal defect patent ductus arteriosus babies tga blue skin color cyanosis

represents egg side narrowed atrophic thymus superior mediastinum represents echocardiogram ultrasound heart accurately assesses heart structure function show specific features tga present imaging modality allows definitive diagnosis tga catheterization catheterization done diagnostic tests provide enough information make diagnosis neonate unstable procedure catheter inserted artery vein groin makes way heart dye used visualize heart structures xray also measure pressures heart infants tga need surgery correct defect life expectancy months corrective surgery performedcitation needed surgery newborns transposition prostaglandins given keep ductus arteriosus open allows mixing otherwise isolated pulmonary systemic circuits thus oxygenated blood recirculates back lungs mix blood circulates throughout body keep body oxygenated surgery atrial septostomy also performed usually cardiac catheter instead surgery enlarge natural connection hearts upper chambers atria allow oxygenrich oxygenpoor blood mix resulting improved oxygen delivery babys surgery arterial switch operation surgery pulmonary artery aorta moved normal positions common surgery done correct dextrotga considered definitive treatment atrial switch operation alternative surgical option arterial switch feasible due particular coronary artery anatomy operation creates tunnel baffle hearts two upper chambers surgery lifelong followup care cardiologist needed infants undergo surgery symptoms relieved able live normal life potential complications occur include coronary artery problems heart valves problems
