digit ratio ratio taken lengths different digits fingers hand modern sciences ratio become commonly studied digit ratio calculated dividing length index finger given hand length ring finger hand average males lower ratio females although studies claimed show correlation digit ratio various physical behavioral traits studies drawn criticism irreproducible contradictory exaggerated claims lack high quality research digit length typically measured palmar ventral front palmside hand midpoint bottom crease tip measurement digits dorsal backside hand tip finger proximal phalangebone protrusion occurs digits bent degrees palm recently also gained study shown compared palmar digit ratio dorsal digit ratio better indicator bone digit moreover differential placing flexion creases factor palmar digit digit ratios also similarly calculated hand suggested academics accepted variety techniques equipment calipers radiography photocopy researchers deliberately record multiple measurements report significant form reporting bias ratio two digits particular palmar index finger ring finger supposedly affected fetal exposure hormones particular testosterone androgens ratio could therefore considered crude measure prenatal androgen exposure lower ratios pointing higher prenatal androgen also studies suggest palmar ratio influenced prenatal estrogen exposure thus correlates negatively prenatal testosterone alone rather prenatal testosteronetoestrogen ratio however various studies challenged aforementioned findings meta analysis studies participants found correlation digit ratio adult testoserone levels studies testoserone change studies prenatal testoserone studies researchers conclude due link unsupported concerningly common papers use proxy another paper also found relationship ratios testosterone estradiol levels even testosteronetoestradiol largest study failed find evidence marker prenatal androgen one frequently cited paper failed study measuring deceased fetuses found ratio sexually dimorphic lower men women however comparing extent sexual dimorphism adults children researchers found extent similar children lower adults led authors suggest digit ratio also affected postnatal development palmar digit ratios strong sexual dimorphism occurs digit dorsal digit ratios contrast strong sexual dimorphism occurs digit women shorter fifth digits overall report sexual dimorphism much stronger dorsal digit palmar digit ratios especially compared classic palmar moreover compared palmar digit ratio dorsal digit ratio better indicator bone digit thus earlier research focused palmar ratio study digit ratios also promising experimental studies monkeys shown prenatal testosterone injection produces maletypical changes palmar digit length bone digit moreover effect occurs digit digit monkeys additionally human epidermal tissues androgen receptors estrogen thus likely dermatoglyphic tissues fingers may sensitive prenatal testosterone effect whereas reported bone digit ratios may sensitive testosteronetoestrogen ratio hence palmar ratio reflects combination two different hormonal sensitivities support study shown differential placing flexion creases contributes sex differences palmar greater proportion men shorter index fingers ring fingers women noted scientific literature several times late statistically significant sex

manning criticized researchers controlling sex difference present birth ratio testosterone estradiol measured amniocentesis samples correlated childs subsequent conclusion research supported association low high levels testosterone compared estrogen high low testosterone relative estrogen however study criticised lack scrutiny despite frequently cited failed level estrogen amniotic fluid correlated higher researchers found difference estrogen levels males researchers highlighted research measuring amniotic fluid umbilical cord blood make conclusions regarding early androgen exposure tenuous although research points towards negative correlation results statistically several studies present evidence digit ratios nonclinical sample women digit ratio correlated anogenital distance expected direction words women greater anogenital distance indicating greater prenatal androgen exposure smaller digit women congenital adrenal hyperplasia cah results elevated androgen levels birth lower masculinized possible physiological effects include enlarged clitoris shallow males cah smaller masculine digit ratios control suggesting prenatal androgens affect digit ratios amniocentesis samples show prenatal levels testosterone highnormal range males cah levels weaker androgen androstenedione several fold higher control measures indicate males cah exposed greater prenatal concentrations total androgens control males greater digit ratio occurs men klinefelters syndrome reduced testosterone secretion throughout life compared control males fathers control digit ratio men may correlate genetic variation androgen receptor men genes produce androgen receptors less sensitive testosterone cag repeats greater ie feminine digit ratios reports failure replicate however men carrying androgen receptor cag repeats compensate less sensitive receptor secreting probably result reduced negative feedback gonadotropins thus clear would expected correlate cag repeats even accurately reflects prenatal androgen xy individuals androgen insensitivity syndrome ais due dysfunctional gene androgen receptor present women feminine digit ratios average would predicted androgenic hormones affect digit ratios finding also demonstrates sex difference digit ratios unrelated chromosome per clear digit ratio might influenced prenatal hormones studies supporting notion relationhip digit ratios prenatal evidence similar traits eg otoacoustic emissions armtotrunk length ratio show similar effects hox genes responsible digit penis implicated affecting multiple traits pleiotropy direct effects sex hormones bone growth might responsible either regulation hox genes digit development independently genes likewise unclear digit ratio right hand responsive left hand indicated greater sex difference right however difference found sexual dimorphism bone digit ratios dorsal digit differential placing flexion creases contributes sex differences palmar digit differences placing flexion creases may determining difference palmar ratio manning colleagues shown ratios vary greatly different ethnic groups study han berber uygur jamaican children subjects manning et al found han children highest mean values followed berbers uygurs jamaican children lowest mean variation far larger differences sexes mannings words theres difference pole finn man standard deviations associated given mean considerable example ratio han children allows ratio low ratio jamaican children allows ratio high thus ethnic groups confidence intervals overlapcitation needed study lu et al found mean

studies explored question whether geographical differences ratios caused gene pool differences whether environmental variable associated latitude might involved eg exposure sunlight different daylength patterns conclusions geographical differences ratio caused genetic pool differences geographical consanguinous parentage inbreeding found lower ratio may account geographical ethnic variation ratios consanguinity rates depend among others religion culture evidence ratio may also indicative human development growth ronalds et al showed men average placental weight shorter neonatal crownheel length higher ratios adult kumar et reported similar effect hand preference digit lengths digit ratios occurs oppositely among children adults moreover studies correlations face shape suggest testosterone exposure early life may set constraints subsequent development prenatal sex steroid ratios terms actual chromosomal sex dimorphism found operate differently human faces affect male female face shape similar fink et al found men low indicating high testosterone women high indicating high estrogen ratios express greater levels facial digit ratio received attention within
