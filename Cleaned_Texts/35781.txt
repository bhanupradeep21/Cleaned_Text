analysis genomics metagenomics metabolomics omics studies modeling simulation systems biology translational research drug development kegg database project initiated minoru kanehisa professor institute chemical research kyoto university ongoing japanese human genome foreseeing need computerized resource used biological interpretation genome sequence data started developing kegg pathway database collection manually drawn kegg pathway maps representing experimental knowledge metabolism various functions cell organism pathway map contains network molecular interactions reactions designed link genes genome gene products mostly proteins pathway enabled analysis called kegg pathway mapping whereby gene content genome compared kegg pathway database examine pathways associated functions likely encoded genome according developers kegg computer representation biological integrates building blocks wiring diagrams specifically genetic building blocks genes proteins chemical building blocks small molecules reactions wiring diagrams molecular interaction reaction networks concept realized following databases kegg categorized systems genomic chemical health kegg pathway database wiring diagram database core kegg resource collection pathway maps integrating many entities including genes proteins rnas chemical compounds glycans chemical reactions well disease genes drug targets stored individual entries databases kegg pathway maps classified following sections metabolism section contains aesthetically drawn global maps showing overall picture metabolism addition regular metabolic pathway maps lowresolution global maps used example compare metabolic capacities different organisms genomics studies different environmental samples metagenomics studies contrast kegg modules kegg module database higherresolution localized wiring diagrams representing tighter functional units within pathway map subpathways conserved among specific organism groups molecular complexes kegg modules defined characteristic gene sets linked specific metabolic capacities phenotypic features used automatic interpretation genome metagenome data another database supplements kegg pathway kegg brite database ontology database containing hierarchical classifications various entities including genes proteins organisms diseases drugs chemical compounds kegg pathway limited molecular interactions reactions entities kegg brite incorporates many different types relationships several months kegg project initiated first report completely sequenced bacterial genome since published complete genomes accumulated kegg eukaryotes prokaryotes kegg genes database contains geneproteinlevel information kegg genome database contains organismlevel information genomes kegg genes database consists gene sets complete genomes genes set given annotations form establishing correspondences wiring diagrams kegg pathway maps kegg modules brite hierarchies correspondences made using concept orthologs kegg pathway maps drawn based experimental evidence specific organisms designed applicable organisms well different organisms human mouse often share identical pathways consisting functionally identical genes called orthologous genes orthologs genes kegg genes database grouped orthologs kegg orthology ko database nodes gene products kegg pathway maps well kegg modules brite hierarchies given ko identifiers correspondences established genes genome annotated ko identifiers genome annotation procedure kegg metabolic pathway maps drawn represent dual aspects metabolic network genomic network genomeencoded enzymes connected catalyze consecutive reactions chemical network chemical structures substrates products transformed set enzyme genes genome identify enzyme relation networks superimposed kegg pathway maps turn characterize chemical structure transformation networks allowing interpretation biosynthetic biodegradation potentials organism alternatively set metabolites identified metabolome lead understanding enzymatic pathways enzyme genes involved databases chemical information category collectively called kegg ligand organized capturing knowledge chemical network beginning kegg project kegg ligand consisted three databases kegg compound chemical compounds kegg reaction chemical reactions kegg enzyme reactions enzyme currently additional databases kegg glycan two auxiliary reaction databases called rpair reactant pair alignments rclass reaction kegg compound also expanded contain various compounds xenobiotics addition metabolites kegg diseases viewed perturbed states biological system caused perturbants genetic factors environmental factors drugs viewed different types kegg pathway database includes normal states also perturbed states biological systems however disease pathway maps drawn diseases molecular mechanisms well understood alternative approach taken kegg disease database simply catalogs known genetic factors environmental factors diseases catalogs may eventually lead complete wiring diagrams diseases kegg drug database contains active ingredients approved drugs japan us europe distinguished chemical
