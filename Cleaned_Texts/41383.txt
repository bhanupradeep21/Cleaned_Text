nucleolus basidium increases size primary nuclei fuse nucleus migrates towards end basidia time nucleus develops vacuoles filled nuclear sap living cell chromosomes produced nucleolar threads align transversely near apex basidium connected spindles chromosomes move poles forming daughter nuclei occupy different positions basidium daughters structure similar parent nuclei two nuclei divide form four nuclei similar fungi fourspored basidia four nuclei crowd together distance end basidium form irregular mass shortly thereafter sterigmata slender projections basidia attach spores begin form
