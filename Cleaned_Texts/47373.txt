parvocellular magnocellular layer lgn even quantity neurons approximately equal number magnocellular cells koniocellular layers much thinner due size comparison parvocellular magnocellular system fewer studies conducted investigate koniocellular system koniocellular cells heterogeneous population differing many aspects response properties k cells neurochemically anatomically distinct p cells three proteins k cells clearly distinguished k cells differ size p cells much smaller unlike p cells k cells structurally similar thalamocortical neurons suggests k cells act like thalamocortical cells since k cells heterogeneous group cells likely contain subclasses fulfill different functions cells respond colour achromatic gratings still others unresponsive types gratings experimental
