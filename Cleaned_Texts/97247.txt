one enzyme hypothesis idea genes act production enzymes gene responsible producing single enzyme turn affects single step metabolic pathway concept proposed george beadle edward tatum influential genetic mutations mold neurospora crassa subsequently dubbed one enzyme hypothesis collaborator norman horowitz reminisced experiments founded science beadle tatum called biochemical genetics actuality proved opening gun became molecular genetics developments followed development one enzyme hypothesis often considered first significant result came called molecular although extremely influential hypothesis recognized soon proposal oversimplification even subsequent reformulation one polypeptide hypothesis considered simple describe relationship genes although instances errors metabolism following mendelian inheritance patterns known earlier beginning identification archibald garrod alkaptonuria mendelian recessive trait part genetics could applied metabolism late another exceptions work boris ephrussi george beadle two geneticists working eye color pigments drosophila melanogaster fruit flies caltech laboratory thomas hunt morgan found genes affecting eye color appeared serially dependent normal red eyes drosophila result pigments went series transformations different eye color gene mutations disrupted transformations different points series thus beadle reasoned gene responsible enzyme acting metabolic pathway pigment synthesis however relatively superficial pathway rather one shared widely diverse organisms little known biochemical details fruit fly eye pigment metabolism studying pathway detail required isolating pigments eyes flies extremely tedious moving stanford university beadle began working biochemist edward tatum isolate fly eye pigments success identified one intermediate pigments shortly another researcher adolf butenandt beat tatum switched focus organism made genetic studies biochemical traits much easier bread mold neurospora crassa recently subjected genetic research one thomas hunt morgans researchers carl c lingegren neurospora several advantages required simple growth medium grew quickly production ascospores reproduction easy isolate genetic mutants analysis produced mutations exposing fungus xrays identified strains metabolic defects varying growth medium work beadle tatum led almost important generalization mutants unable grow minimal medium able grow complete medium require addition one particular supplement growth minimal medium synthesis particular nutrient amino acid vitamin disrupted mutation mutant strain could grown adding necessary nutrient medium finding suggested mutations affected single metabolic pathway evidence obtained soon initial findings tended show generally single step pathway blocked following first report three auxotroph mutants beadle tatum used method create series related mutants determined order amino acids metabolites synthesized several metabolic obvious inference experiments gene mutation affects activity single enzyme led directly one enzyme hypothesis certain qualifications refinements remained essentially valid present day recalled horowitz et work beadle tatum also demonstrated genes essential role biosyntheses time experiments nongeneticists still generally believed genes governed trivial biological traits eye color bristle arrangement fruit flies basic biochemistry determined cytoplasm unknown processes also many respected geneticists thought gene action far complicated resolved simple experiment thus beadle tatum brought fundamental revolution understanding genetics awarded nobel prize physiology medicine nutritional mutants neurospora also proved practical applications one early indirect examples military funding science biological sciences beadle garnered additional research funding rockefeller foundation association manufacturers military rations develop strains could used assay nutrient content foodstuffs ensure adequate nutrition troops world war first neurospora paper published november edition proceedings national academy sciences beadle tatum noted entirely tenable suppose genes part system control regulate specific reactions system either acting directly enzymes determining specificities enzymes idea suggested though limited experimental support early offered new evidence support view outlined research program would enable explored beadle tatum others working neurospora model organisms e coli produced considerable experimental evidence step metabolic pathway controlled single gene review beadle suggested gene visualized directing final configuration protein molecule thus determining specificity also argued reasons economy evolutionary process one might expect exceptions final specificity particular enzyme would imposed one gene time genes widely thought consist proteins nucleoproteins although experiment related work beginning cast doubt idea however proposed connection single gene single protein enzyme outlived protein theory gene structure paper norman horowitz named concept one enzyme although influential one enzyme hypothesis unchallenged among others max delbr√ºck skeptical single enzyme actually involved step along metabolic pathways many accept results strengthened link genes enzymes biochemists thought genes enzymes consistent work studies reproduction tobacco mosaic virus known heritable variations followed pattern autocatalysis many enzymatic reactions crystallization virus apparently pure protein start neurospora findings widely admired prevailing view conclusion beadle drawn vast beadle wrote reading cold spring harbor symposium genes mutations impression supporters one enzyme hypothesis could counted fingers one hand couple fingers left early biochemists geneticists considered dna likely candidate physical basis gene one enzyme hypothesis reinterpreted attributing instructional role genes beadle tatum implicitly accorded genes informational capability insight provided foundation concept genetic code however experiments performed showing dna genetic material proteins consist defined linear sequence amino acids dna structure contained linear sequence base pairs clear basis solving genetic code early advances biochemical part original one enzyme hypothesis seem unlikely least original form beginning vernon ingram others showed electrophoresis chromatography genetic variations proteins sickle cell hemoglobin could limited differences single polypeptide chain multimeric protein leading one polypeptide hypothesis according geneticist rowland h davis indeed even one gene one enzyme longer hypothesis resolutely defended simply name research presently one polypeptide perspective account various spliced versions many eukaryote organisms use spliceosome individually prepare rna transcript depending various inter intracellular environmental signals splicing discovered phillip sharp richard j historian jan sapp studied controversy regard german geneticist franz moewus leading geneticists argued generated similar results beadle tatums celebrated working algae chlamydomonas moewus published results showed different genes responsible different enzymatic reactions production hormones controlled organisms reproduction however sapp skillfully details results challenged others found data good true statistically results could replicated
