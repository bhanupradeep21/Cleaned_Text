technology emergence mechanical encouraged mechanical imagery unlikely come fore previous backdrop deists suggested watchmaker analogy watches set motion watchmakers operate according preestablished mechanisms also world begun god creator parts operated according preestablished natural laws laws perfectly place events unfolded according prescribed sir isaac newton regular motion planets made reasonable believe continued existence newton also upheld idea like watchmaker god forced intervene universe tinker mechanism time time ensure continued operating good working order similarly newton rené descartes speculated cosmos great time machine operating according fixed laws watch created wound great needed watches timepieces used examples complicated technology philosophical discussions example cicero voltaire rené descartes used timepieces arguments regarding purpose watchmaker analogy described used bernard le bovier de fontenelle famously formulated paley paley used watchmaker analogy book natural theology evidences existence attributes deity collected appearances nature published paley wrote pocket watch found heath reasonable assume someone dropped made least one watchmaker natural forces crossing heath suppose pitched foot stone asked stone came might possibly answer anything knew contrary lain forever would perhaps easy show absurdity answer suppose found watch upon ground inquired watch happened place hardly think answer given anything knew watch might always must existed time place artificer artificers formed watch purpose find actually answer comprehended construction designed use every indication contrivance every manifestation design existed watch exists works nature difference side nature greater degree exceeds computation paley went argue complex structures living things remarkable adaptations plants animals required intelligent designer believed natural world creation god showed nature creator according paley god carefully designed even humble insignificant organisms minute features wings antennae earwigs believed therefore god must care even humanity paley recognised great suffering nature nature appears indifferent pain way reconciling belief benevolent god assume life pleasure pain side note charge wholesale plagiarism book brought paley athenaeum famous illustration watch peculiar nieuwentyt used many others either paley nieuwentyt charge plagiarism based similarities example nieuwentyt wrote middle sandy desart sic solitary place people used pass one find watch william paley taught works joseph butler appears built butlers design arguments inferring designer evidence design butler noted manifold appearances design final causes constitution world prove work intelligent mind appearances design final causes constitution nature really prove acting agent intelligent designer ten thousand instances design prove rousseau also mentioned watchmaker theory wrote following book emile like man sees works watch first time never weary admiring mechanism though know use instrument never seen face know says see part fitted rest admire workman details work quite certain wheels work together fashion common end perceive let us compare special ends means ordered relations every kind let us listen inner voice feeling healthy mind reject evidence unless eyes blinded prejudices fail see visible order universe proclaims supreme intelligence sophisms must brought together fail understand harmony existence wonderful cooperation every part maintenance paley published book david hume already put forward number philosophical criticisms watch analogy extent anticipated concept natural selection criticisms separated three major distinctions first objection experience worldmaking hume highlighted fact everything claim know cause derived inductions previous experiences similar objects created seen object created example watch know created watchmaker observe made compare making similar watches objects deduce alike causes creation however argues experience universes creation universes creations compare universe never therefore would illogical infer universe created intelligent designer way watch hascitation needed second criticism hume offers form argument analogy analogical argument claims object x watch like object universe one respect therefore probably alike another hidden respect cause created intelligent designer points argument analogy successful two things compared adequate number similarities relevant respect analogised example kitten lion may similar many respects lion makes roar would correct infer kitten also roars similarities two objects enough degree relevance sound make relevant enough hume argues universe watch also enough relevant close similarities infer created way example universe made organic natural material watch made artificial mechanic materials claims respect universe could argued analogous something organic vegetable observe need designer watchmaker created although admits analogy universe vegetable seem ridiculous says ridiculous analogize universe third criticism hume offers even argument give evidence designer still gives evidence traditional omnipotent benevolent allpowerful allloving god traditional christian theism one main assumptions paleys argument like effects like causes machines like watch universe similar features design also cause existence must intelligent designer however hume points paley comprehend extent like causes extend similar creation universe creation watch instead paley moves straight conclusion designer universe god believes traditional christianity hume however takes idea like causes points potential absurdities far likeness causes could extend argument taken explain one example uses machine watch usually designed whole team people rather one person surely analogizing two way would point group gods created universe single another example uses complex machines usually result many years trial error every new machine improved version last also analogy two would hint universe could also one many gods trials much better universes however taken true surely creator would loving powerful carry process trial error creating hume also points still possibility universe could created random chance still show evidence design universe eternal would infinite amount time able form universe complex ordered called epicurean hypothesis argued universe first created universe random chaotic universe eternal unlimited period time natural forces could naturally evolved random particles coming together time incredibly ordered system observe today without need intelligent designer explanationcitation needed last objection makes draws widely discussed problem evil argues daily unnecessary suffering goes everywhere within world yet another factor pulls away idea god omnipotent benevolent beingcitation needed darwin completed studies theology christs college cambridge

published theory theologians liberal christianity already supporting ideas late century modernist approach predominant theology science evolution theory incorporating darwins natural selection became completely accepted blind watchmaker richard dawkins argues watch analogy conflates complexity arises living organisms able reproduce may become complex time complexity inanimate objects unable pass reproductive changes multitude parts manufactured watch comparison breaks important bbc horizon episode also entitled blind watchmaker dawkins described paleys argument mistaken elegant contexts saw paley made incorrect proposal certain problems solution dawkins disrespect essay big bang steven pinker discusses dawkinss coverage paleys argument adding biologists today disagree paleys laying problem disagree solution book god delusion dawkins argues life result complex biological processes makes argument comparison lucky construction watch fallacious proponents evolution consider evolution lucky rather luck evolution human life result billions years natural selection concludes evolution fair contestant replace god role watchmaker addition argues watchmakers creation watch implies watchmaker must complex watch design topdown someone something complex designs something less complex follow line upwards demands watch designed necessarily complex watchmaker watchmaker must created complex question becomes designed designer dawkins argues line continues ad infinitum b explain anything evolution hand takes bottomup approach explains complexity arise gradually building combining lesser complexity biologist peter richerson anthropologist robert boyd offer oblique criticism arguing watches hopeful monsters created single inventors created watchmakers building skills cumulative fashion time contributing watchmaking tradition individual watchmaker draws early century modernist theology higher criticism contested united states biblical literalists campaigned
