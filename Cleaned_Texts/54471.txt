tooth characteristics consistent mere individual variation writing stated comparing two animals skulls characters specific analysis mitochondrial genomes eurasian crocuta specimens shows clear separation african lineages however analysis full nuclear genomes suggests african eurasian crocuta populations largely separate estimated diverged around million years ago closely corresponding age earliest crocuta specimens eurasia around million years old china nuclear genome results also suggested european asian populations latter often assigned separate subspecies c crocuta ultima distinct closely related overall african crocuta analysis nuclear genome suggests interbreeding populations time split likely explains discordance nuclear mitochondrial genome results mitochondrial genomes
