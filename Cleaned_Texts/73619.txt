transfer factors essentially small immune messenger molecules produced higher transfer factors originally described immune molecules derived blood spleen cells cause antigenspecific cellmediated immunity primarily delayed hypersensitivity production lymphokines well binding antigens molecular weight approximately daltons composed entirely amino transfer factors discovered henry sherwood lawrence second use term transfer factor applies likely different entity derived cow colostrum chicken egg yolk marketed oral dietary supplement name citing claims benefit immune merrill chase discovered cells taken peritoneum guinea pigs immunized antigen could transfer immunity injected guinea pigs never exposed antigen phenomenon discovery cellmediated immunity subsequent research attempted uncover cells imparted effects henry sherwood lawrence discovered partial immunity could transferred even immune cells undergone lysis indicating cells need fully intact order produce immune lawrence went discover factors less daltons required transfer immunity termed transfer history cellular derived transfer factor treatment effectively ended early research world initially excited discovery dr lawrence possibility small molecule could affect immune system concept small molecules profound biologic effect despite several successes using transfer factor treat human disease uncover immune effects one thenprominent researcher exposed falsifying data related work transfer factor guinea pigs effectively casting transfer factor science negative scandal followed shortly thereafter discovery alpha molecule thus attention shifted towards research interleukins discovered blood products could harbor viruses hepatitis indicating transfer factor treatments derived human cow blood cells potential transmit diseases eventual discovery hivaids additional bloodborne disease researchers viewed product derived blood unsafe treatment since screening hepatitis b hivaids would developed studies using transfer factor conducted discovery hivaids almost outside united states recently transfer factor harvested sources blood administered orally opposed intravenously use transfer factors sources blood accompanied concerns associated bloodborne diseases since blood involved transfer factor based nutritional supplements become extremely popular throughout world however way transfer factor works still clear communicate cells immune system employs hormonelike signal substances transfer factors one class immune system communication substances transfer factors include inducerhelper functions inducer factors regulator functions regulator called suppressor inducer factors translate apparently mature immune response donor recipient regulator factors help control overreactions limit allergies autoimmune conditions transfer factors shown induce immune response less transfer factors speciesspecific thus transfer factors produced cows immune system effective humans cow henry sherwood lawrence discovered blood cells could transfer antigenspecific cellmediated immunity even cells undergone lymphocyte product sometimes referred dialyzable leukocyte extract scientific literature due extract white blood cells undergoing dialysis remove molecules larger studies cellular transfer factor involved mostly animal models small human clinical trials studies demonstrated

concern raised possibility catching bovine spongiform encephalopathy mad cow disease diseases animal bloodderived products transfer factors contraindicated women pregnant human bovinederived transfer

immune modulating molecules including high antibody based studies noting overlap observed vitro effects molecule contained colostrum called colostrinin dialyzable leukocyte extract mentioned hypothesis formed two recent research investigations comparing two entities thus verifiable evidence either colostrum egg whites contain cellular product shares name transfer factor orally available transfer factor obtained humans blood products mammal animal thus carry presumed risks contracting bloodborne animal tissue derived diseases retailers dietary supplement transfer factors advice use
