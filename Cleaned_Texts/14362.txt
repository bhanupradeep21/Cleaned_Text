ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ohss medical condition occur women take fertility medication stimulate egg growth women rare cases cases mild rarely condition severe lead serious illness symptoms set categories mild moderate severe mild symptoms include abdominal bloating feeling fullness nausea diarrhea slight weight gain moderate symptoms include excessive weight gain weight gain greater pounds per day increased abdominal girth vomiting diarrhea darker urine decreased urine output excessive thirst skin andor hair feeling dry addition mild symptoms severe symptoms fullnessbloating waist shortness breath pleural effusion urination significantly darker ceased calf chest pains marked abdominal bloating distention lower abdominal pains addition mild moderate symptomscitation needed ohss may complicated ovarian torsion ovarian rupture venous thromboembolism acute respiratory distress syndrome electrolytes imbalance thrombophlebitis chronic kidney disease symptoms generally resolve weeks severe persist longer pregnancy occurs due human chorionic gonadotropin hcg pregnancy acting corpus luteum ovaries sustaining pregnancy placenta fully developed typically even severe ohss developing pregnancy duration exceed first trimestercitation needed sporadic ohss rare may genetic component clomifene citrate therapy occasionally lead ohss vast majority cases develop use gonadotropin therapy administration fsh pergonal administration hcg induce final oocyte maturation andor trigger oocyte release often conjunction ivf frequency varies depends womans risk factors management methods surveillance treated women may encounter moderate severe ohss risk factors include polycystic ovary syndrome young age low bmi high antral follicle count development many ovarian follicles stimulation extreme elevated serum estradiol concentrations use hcg final oocyte maturation andor release continued use hcg luteal support occurrence pregnancy resulting hcg production mortality low several fatal cases reportedcitation needed ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome particularly associated injection hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin hcg used inducing final oocyte maturation andor triggering oocyte release risk increased multiple doses hcg ovulation procedure results using gnrh agonist instead hcg inducing final oocyte maturation andor release results elimination risk ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome slight decrease delivery rate approximately ohss characterized presence multiple luteinized cysts within ovaries leading ovarian enlargement secondary complications definition includes almost women undergoing ovarian stimulation central feature clinically significant ohss development vascular hyperpermeability resulting shift fluids third spacecitation needed hcg causes ovary undergo extensive luteinization large amounts estrogens progesterone local cytokines released almost certain vascular endothelial growth factor vegf key substance induces vascular hyperpermeability making local capillaries leaky leading shift fluids intravascular system abdominal pleural cavity supraphysiologic production vegf many follicles prolonged effect hcg appears specific key process underlying ohss thus woman accumulates fluid third space primarily form ascites actually becomes hypovolemic risk respiratory circulatory arterial thromboembolism since blood thicker renal problems women pregnant sustain ovarian luteinization process production hcgcitation needed avoiding ohss typically requires interrupting pathological sequence avoiding use hcg one alternative use gnrh agonist instead hcg repeatedly shown virtually eliminate ohss risk controversy regarding effect pregnancy rates fresh nondonor embryo transfer attempted almost certainly due luteal phase defect dispute gnrh agonist trigger effective oocyte donors embryo banking cryopreservation cyclescitation needed ohss divided categories mild moderate severe mild forms ohss ovaries enlarged may additional accumulation ascites mild abdominal distension abdominal severe forms ohss may hemoconcentration thrombosis distension oliguria decreased urine production pleural effusion respiratory distress early ohss develops pregnancy testing late ohss seen early pregnancycitation needed criteria severe ohss include enlarged ovary ascites hematocrit wbc oliguria creatinine mgdl

medication cabergoline confers significant reduction risk ohss high risk women according cochrane review randomized studies included trials report live birth rates multiple pregnancy cabergoline well dopamine agonists might reduce severity ohss interfering vegf systematic review metaanalysis concluded prophylactic treatment cabergoline reduces incidence severity ohss without compromising pregnancy risk ohss smaller using gnrh antagonist protocol instead gnrh agonist protocol suppression ovulation ovarian underlying mechanism gnrh antagonist protocol initial follicular recruitment selection undertaken endogenous endocrine factors prior starting exogenous hyperstimulation resulting smaller number growing follicles compared standard long gnrh agonist cochrane review found administration hydroxyethyl starch decreases incidence severe insufficient evidence support routine cryopreservation insufficient evidence relative merits intravenous albumin versus also coasting ovarian hyperstimulation without induction final maturation significantly decrease risk volume expanders albumin hydroxyethyl starch solutions act providing volume circulatory system treatment ohss depends
