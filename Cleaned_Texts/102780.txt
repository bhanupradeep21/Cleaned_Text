reproductive health obstetric transition concept around secular trend countries gradually shifting pattern high maternal mortality low maternal mortality direct obstetric causes maternal mortality indirect causes aging maternal population moving natural history pregnancy childbirth institutionalization maternity care medicalization concept originally proposed latin american association reproductive health researchers alirh analogy epidemiological demographic nutritional transitions last two decades world seen substantial reduction maternal considering maternal mortality vastly determined social societal contextual factors reduction important number lives spared period estimated denotes world making progress towards development gender however progress still insufficient unequal slow recent estimates suggest women died causes related pregnancy childbirth maternal mortality remains global tragedy observed progress inspires international community believe strive elimination maternal mortality decades vast majority maternal deaths avoidable takes place developing countries developed countries maternal mortality ratio low maternal deaths per live births among least developed countries high maternal deaths per live disparity also observed within countries population disaggregated quintiles income thus countries regions within countries different population groups within country experience specific momentum dynamic process reduction maternal mortality may benefit specific approaches thompson described phenomenon demographic transition characterized gradual shift pattern high mortality high fertility pattern low mortality low omram described epidemiologic transition shift pattern high prevalence communicable diseases pattern high prevalence noncommunicable finally poppkin proposed nutritional transition model helps understand transformations human diets global epidemic transitions socioeconomic cultural changes eg globalization urbanization led us develop concept obstetric transition result millennium development goals project improved data related maternal mortality severe maternal morbidity became available period altogether data reflect secular trend countries gradually shifting pattern high maternal mortality low maternal mortality direct obstetric causes maternal mortality indirect causes moving natural history pregnancy childbirth institutionalization maternity care medicalization medicalization aging maternal population obstetric transition phenomenon implications strategies aimed reducing maternal mortality figure presents trends maternal mortality world region period derived recent estimates considering countries world regions transitioning pathway towards elimination maternal deaths five stages devised countries experiencing transition different paces started process different moments history eg developed countries started transitions century ago developing countries started transition much recently stage mmr women experiencing situation close natural history pregnancy childbirth little done anything reduce risk maternal mortality population level considering data chad somalia countries could illustrate stage hopefully time passes progress occurs country remain stage stage characterized high maternal mortality high fertility predominance direct causes maternal deaths together substantial proportion deaths attributable communicable diseases malaria stage ii mmr mortality fertility remain high similar pattern causes compared stage however greater proportion women population able somewhat detach natural history pregnancy childbirth several countries subsaharan africa could illustrate stage ii stages ii main issue access care general countries substantial lack basic infrastructure roads transportation health facilities low education levels particularly female literacy weak health systems severe shortages skilled birth attendants low capacity deliver essential lifesaving interventions context poor quality care functions deterrent generating demand health services countries stages focus directed creating basic infrastructure implement maternalmortality primary prevention measures eg family planning iron supplementation insecticide treated nets intersectorial measures remove barriers access health system minimal infrastructure created health services strive deliver quality care order become sensible alternative pregnant women demand generation obstetric transition tipping point occurs stage iii stage mortality still high mmr maternal deaths live births fertility variable direct causes mortality still predominates complex stage access remain issue great deal population large proportion pregnant women indeed reaching health facilities quality care becomes major determinant health outcomes primary prevention important also secondary tertiary prevention critical improving maternal health outcomes stage words quality care skilled birth attendance appropriate management complications disabilities essential reduce maternal mortality india guatemala south africa countries could illustrate stage stage iv mmr maternal deaths live births maternal mortality moderate low low fertility indirect causes maternal mortality particularly noncommunicable diseases acquire greater importance order advance reduction maternal mortality main issue becomes quality care elimination delays within health systems another aspect emerges stage growing role medicalization threat quality improved health outcomes various asian countries latin american countries joined developed countries stage stage v avoidable maternal deaths indeed avoided maternal mortality rate low fertility low low noncommunicable diseases main causes maternal mortality aspirational largely theoretical stage moment maternal mortality levels remain uncertain could lower maternal deaths per live births main issue stage would sustainability excellence quality care worth noting main purpose framework illustrate different phases dynamic process offer rationale different focus solutions reducing mortality according stage obstetric transition ranges maternal mortality ratio uses define proposed stages obstetric transition frequently country stratification boundaries stages somewhat imprecise one stage tends fade another progression always linear largely due equity issues different stages often coexist country httpsenwikipediaorgwikiobstetrictransition
