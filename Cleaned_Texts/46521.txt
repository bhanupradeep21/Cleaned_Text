melanocytes melaninproducing neural cells located bottom layer stratum basale skins epidermis middle layer eye inner vaginal melanin dark pigment primarily responsible skin color synthesized melanin contained special organelles called melanosomes transported nearby keratinocytes induce pigmentation thus darker skin tones melanosomes present lighter skin tones functionally melanin serves protection uv radiation melanocytes also role immune system process called melanogenesis melanocytes produce melanin pigment found skin eyes hair nasal cavity inner ear melanogenesis leads longlasting
