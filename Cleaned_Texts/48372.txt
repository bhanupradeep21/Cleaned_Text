venkatasuchus extinct genus aetosaur late triassic dharmaram formation india described basis series associated osteoderms formed paramedian lateral armour based osteoderms carapace venkatasuchus discshaped wide curved hornlike elements along sides phylogenetic analysis indicates venkatasuchus belonged subfamily typothoracinae specifically clade paratypothoracini recovered sister taxon kocurypelta venkatasuchus among aetosaurs recovered region would later become gondwana lends credence idea late triassic india represented connective hub laurasian gondwanan fauna genus monotypic meaning includes single species venkatasuchus armatum venkatasuchus known series osteoderms recovered late triassic lower dharmaram formation india specifically locality near village rampur within indias adilabad district holotype consists eight associated pieces bone paramedian armour armour placed along midline animals back well associated lateral osteoderms attach sides former addition holotype set bones isolated osteoderm also recovered referred genus based shared anatomy however differences isolated element type material seeing differences may related age sex simple intraspecific variation currently believed belonged different genus named honor n venkata raja reddy enthusiast helped discovery fossils pranhitagodavari basin second part name utilizes greek suffix suchus derived egyptian deity sobek translates crocodile species name armatum simply means although little material venkatasuchus known readily distinguished aetosaurs combination features present osteoderms though traits observed venkatasuchus deemed unique taxon specific combination features sets apart relatives anterior bar osteoderms frontmost section thick weakly raised taking around length element raised anterior bar trait almost universal among aetosaurs yet absent desmatosuchus anterior bar also features straight anteriomedial margin considered autapomorphy derived trait seen members group broadly margin entire medial section anterior bar straight also shared paratypothorax contrast anterior bar posterior back end osteoderm far distinctive form slopes forms bevel seen tecovasuchus kocurypelta inconsistently among individuals paratypothorax andressorum underside osteoderm generally smooth preserves pronounced ventral strut keel runs along width viewed paramedian osteoderm rectangular shape straight edge lateral osteoderms connect similar straight sigmoid lateral edge present two typothoracines tecovasuchus kocurypelta observing osteoderms front back meanwhile shows arched made two main regions connect oblique angle dorsal eminence raised region forms center ossification dorsal eminence forms highest point osteoderms connected rounded ridge spans entire width osteoderm similar kocurypelta running parallel posterior edge osteoderm eminence surrounded distinct pattern medium largesized pits ridges collectively referred ornamentation also distinct location relative edges osteoderm example similar desmatosuchus spurensis lucasuchus among others eminence contact back edge osteoderm noted offset much towards midline aetosaurs another prominent ridge located posteromedial corner typical members clade typothoracinae paramedian osteoderms extremely wide four times wider long since dorsal eminence offset towards midline thus also shifting flexion paramedian osteoderm medial portion paramedian osteoderm much shorter lateral section making total width addition phylogenetic value great width osteoderms recovered venkatasuchus indicate trunk osteoderms rather neck osteoderms haldar ray bandyopadhyay interpreting formed early middle trunk armour taking placement account applying proportions similar typothoracines would suggest complete armour would disclike overall lateral osteoderms located side main paramedian row described reduced hornlike convex anterior margin making appear curve backwards generally divided dorsal upper ventral lower flange highly asymmetric much larger ventral flange like paratypothorax rioarribasuchus tecovasuchus dorsal flange short triangular ventral flange long rectangular connection point two strongly flexed meaning meet acute angle tho specific degree flexion varies within row least two groups lateral osteoderms identified group ratio width length less flanges meet angle group ii ratio width length greater angle sits group encompasses first four preserved lateral osteoderms remaining fall group multiple features osteoderms venkatasuchus indicate member aetosaurinae one major clades within aetosauria sister stagonolepidoidea specifically venkatasuchus falls within typothoracinae deeply nested paratypothoracini traits responsible results include extreme width length ratio narrow weakly raised anterior bar

suggesting middle norian age least based stratigraphy chinle formation dockum venkatasuchus also major implications geography aetosaurs generally aetosaurs best represented laurasian formations europe north america whereas gondwanan record comparably poor exception south america westernmost region makes venkatasuchus one known aetosaurs eastern central gondwana one hypothesis goes aetosaur diversification highly dependent carnial pluvial event much like spread metoposaurids phytosaurs typothoracines likely appeared little later early norian diversifying middle norian rhaetian geographically aetosaurs found three major clusters high latitudes south featuring early diverging forms high latitudes north featuring late diverging forms taxa clustering low latitudes north america morocco india feature mix early late diverging taxa clusterings aetosaur diversity overlap metoposaurids phytosaurs exception southern latitudes though collection bias could factor india particular
