theory recapitulation also called biogenetic law embryological expressed using ernst haeckels phrase ontogeny recapitulates historical hypothesis development embryo animal fertilization gestation hatching ontogeny goes stages resembling representing successive adult stages evolution animals remote ancestors phylogeny formulated étienne serres based work johann friedrich meckel also known law since embryos also evolve different ways shortcomings theory recognized early century relegated biological analogies recapitulation theory formulated fields including cognitive music idea recapitulation first formulated biology onwards german natural philosophers johann friedrich meckel carl friedrich kielmeyer étienne marcel danesi states soon gained status supposed biogenetic embryological theory formalised serres based meckels work became known meckelserres law attempted link comparative embryology pattern unification organic world supported étienne geoffroy sainthilaire became prominent part ideas suggested past transformations life could environmental causes working embryo rather adult lamarckism naturalistic ideas led disagreements georges cuvier theory widely supported edinburgh london schools higher anatomy around notably robert edmond grant opposed karl ernst von baers ideas divergence attacked richard owen ernst haeckel attempted synthesize ideas lamarckism goethes naturphilosophie charles darwins concepts often seen rejecting darwins theory branching evolution linear lamarckian view progressive evolution accurate haeckel used lamarckian picture describe ontogenetic phylogenetic history individual species agreed darwin branching species one original since early twentieth century haeckels biogenetic law refuted many haeckel formulated theory ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny notion later became simply known recapitulation theory ontogeny growth size change development structure change individual organism phylogeny evolutionary history species haeckel claimed development advanced species passes stages represented adult organisms primitive otherwise put successive stage development individual represents one adult forms appeared evolutionary history example haeckel proposed pharyngeal grooves pharyngeal arches neck human embryo roughly resembled gill slits fish directly represented adult fishlike developmental stage signifying fishlike ancestor embryonic pharyngeal slits form many animals thin branchial plates separating pharyngeal pouches pharyngeal grooves perforate open pharynx outside pharyngeal arches appear tetrapod embryos mammals first pharyngeal arch develops lower jaw meckels cartilage malleus stapes haeckel produced several embryo drawings often overemphasized similarities embryos related species modern biology rejects literal universal form haeckels theory possible application behavioural ontogeny ie psychomotor development young animals human haeckels theory drawings criticised contemporary anatomist wilhelm sr developed rival causalmechanical theory human embryonic hiss work specifically criticised haeckels methodology arguing shapes embryos caused immediately mechanical pressures resulting local differences growth differences turn caused heredity compared shapes embryonic structures rubber tubes could slit bent illustrating comparisons accurate drawings stephen jay gould noted book ontogeny phylogeny hiss attack haeckels recapitulation theory far fundamental empirical critic effectively stated haeckels biogenetic law darwin proposed embryos resembled since shared common ancestor presumably similar embryo development necessarily recapitulate phylogeny saw reason suppose embryo stage resembled adult ancestor darwin supposed embryos subject less intense selection pressure adults therefore changed modern evolutionary developmental biology evodevo follows von baer rather darwin pointing active evolution embryonic development significant means changing morphology adult bodies two key principles evodevo namely changes timing heterochrony positioning heterotopy within body aspects embryonic development would change shape descendants body compared ancestors first formulated haeckel elements thinking development thus survived whereas theory recapitulation haeckelian form recapitulation theory considered embryos undergo period phylotypic stage morphology strongly shaped phylogenetic rather selective pressures means resemble embryos stage ancestral adults haeckel modern view summarised university california museum paleontology embryos reflect course evolution course far intricate quirky haeckel claimed different parts embryo even evolve different directions result biogenetic law abandoned fall freed scientists appreciate full range embryonic changes evolution appreciation yielded spectacular results recent years scientists discovered specific genes control idea ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny applied areas english philosopher herbert spencer one energetic proponents evolutionary ideas explain many phenomena five years haeckel first published subject spencer proposed possible basis cultural recapitulation theory education following order human race mastered various kinds knowledge arise every child aptitude acquire kinds knowledge order education repetition civilization g stanley hall used haeckels theories basis theories child development influential work adolescence psychology relations physiology anthropology sociology sex crime religion education suggested individuals life course recapitulated humanitys evolution savagery civilization though influenced later childhood development theories halls conception generally considered developmental psychologist jean piaget favored weaker version formula according ontogeny parallels phylogeny two subject similar external austrian pioneer psychoanalysis sigmund freud also favored haeckels doctrine trained biologist influence recapitulation theory heyday retained lamarckian outlook justification recapitulation freud also distinguished physical mental recapitulation differences would become essential argument theory late century studies symbolism learning field cultural anthropology suggested biological evolution stages childs cognitive development follow much progression evolutionary stages suggested archaeological musicologist richard taruskin applied phrase ontogeny becomes phylogeny process creating recasting music history often assert perspective argument example peculiar development works modernist composer arnold schoenberg ontogeny generalized many histories phylogeny historical development evolution western music toward atonal styles schoenberg representative historiographies collapse traditional tonality faulted music historians asserting rhetorical rather historical point tonalitys taruskin also developed variation motto pun ontogeny recapitulates ontology refute concept absolute music advancing socioartistic theories musicologist carl dahlhaus ontology investigation exactly something taruskin asserts art object becomes society succeeding generations made example johann sebastian bachs st john passion composed appropriated nazi regime propaganda taruskin claims historical development st john passion ontogeny work antisemitic message fact inform works identity ontology even though unlikely concern
