interleukin also known human cytokine synthesis inhibitory factor csif antiinflammatory cytokine humans interleukin encoded signals receptor complex consisting two two consequently functional receptor consists four receptor molecules binding induces signalling via phosphorylation cytoplasmic tails receptor receptor protein homodimer subunits classified cytokine set cytokines including interferons typei ifnalpha beta epsilon kappa omega typeii ifngamma typeiii including humans encoded gene located chromosome comprises primarily produced monocytes lesser extent lymphocytes namely typeii helper cells mast cells regulatory cells certain subset activated cells b cells produced monocytes upon triggering upregulation also mediated gpcrs type receptors expression minimal unstimulated tissues
