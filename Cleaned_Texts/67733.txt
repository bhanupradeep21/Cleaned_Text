common coding theory cognitive psychology theory describing perceptual representations eg things see hear motor representations eg hand actions linked theory claims shared representation common code perception action important seeing event activates action associated event performing action activates associated perceptual idea direct perceptionaction links originates work american psychologist william james recently american neurophysiologist nobel prize winner roger sperry sperry argued cycle fundamental logic nervous perception action processes functionally intertwined perception means action action means perception indeed vertebrate brain evolved governing motor activity basic function transform sensory patterns patterns motor coordination classical approach cognition sandwich model assumes three stages information processing perception cognition action model perception action interact directly instead cognitive processing needed convert perceptual representations action example might require creating arbitrary linkages mapping sensory motor contrast common coding account claims perception action directly linked common computational theory put forward wolfgang prinz colleagues max planck institute human cognitive brain sciences claims parity perception action core assumption actions coded terms perceivable effects ie distal perceptual events theory also states perception action activate action representations degree perceived represented action claim suggests represent observed executed imagined actions commensurate manner makes specific predictions regarding nature action perceptual representations first representations observed executed actions rely shared neural substrate second common cognitive system predicts facilitation action based directly prior perception vice versa third system predicts interference effects action perception attempt access shared representations simultaneously year onwards growing number results interpreted favor common coding theory instance one functional mri study demonstrated brains response power law motion ie dictates strong coupling movement curvature velocity much stronger widespread types motion compliance law reflected activation large network brain areas subserving motor production visual motion processing action observation functions results support common coding notion similar neural coding motion perception one direct evidence common coding brain stems fact pattern classifiers differentiate based brain activity whether someone performed action b also classify chance whether person heard sound action b thereby demonstrating action execution perception represented using common early century common coding theory received increased interest researchers developmental cognitive social common coding posits top separate coding domains representation afferent efferent information share format dimensionality representation common coding refers late afferent representations referring events environment early efferent representations referring intended events representations commensurate since exhibit distal permit creating linkages perception action rely arbitrary mappings common coding conceives action planning terms operations determine intended future events given current events matching event codes action codes particular perception action may modulate virtue similarity unlike rulebased mapping incommensurate codes requires preceding acquisition mapping rules similaritybased matching commensurate codes requires preceding rule acquisition line ideomotor theory william james hermann lotze common coding theory posits actions represented terms perceptual consequences actions represented like events sole distinctive feature generated bodily movements perceivable action consequences may vary two major dimensions resident vs remote effects cool versus hot outcomes ie reward values associated action individuals perform actions learn movements lead ideomotor learning ideomotor theory claims associations also used reverse order cf william james ii p individuals perceive events know previous learning may result certain movements perception events may evoke movements leading ideomotor control distinction learning control equivalent distinction forward inverse computation motor learning ideomotor learning supports prediction anticipation action outcomes given current action ideomotor control supports selection control action given intended outcomes traditional approaches tend stress relative independence perception action theories argued closer links motor theories speech action perception made case motor contributions close nonrepresentational connections perception action also claimed ecological today common coding theory closely related research theory two intersecting fields study mirror neurons systems embodied cognition concerns mirror systems common coding seems reflect functional logic mirror neurons mechanisms concerns embodied cognition common coding compatible claim meaning embodied ie grounded perception common coding theory sparked refined theoretical frameworks build notion shared
