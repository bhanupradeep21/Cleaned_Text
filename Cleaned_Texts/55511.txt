chindesaurus ˌtʃɪndɪˈsɔːrəs chindissorəs extinct genus basal saurischian dinosaur late triassic million years ago southwestern united states known single species c bryansmalli based partial skeleton recovered petrified forest national park arizona original specimen nicknamed gertie generated much publicity park upon discovery airlift park fragmentary referred specimens found late triassic sediments throughout arizona new mexico texas may belong chindesaurus bipedal carnivore approximately large chindesauruss classification debated various papers different conclusions affinities fossils originally believed belong prosauropods basal sauropodomorphs original description numerous subsequent papers argued redescription holotype considered chindesaurus theropod closely related tawa slightly smaller dinosaur known hayden quarry ghost ranch new although many specimens referred chindesaurus one specimen enough material remain within genus specimen holotype pefo partial skeleton found within petrified forest national park apache county arizona pefo discovered bryan small recovered skeleton blue mudstone layer chinle formations upper petrified forest based upb dating overlying underlying units mudstone layer deposited million years ago norian stage pefo mainly consists vertebrae limb bones hip fragments vertebrae include several partial cervical neck dorsal back caudal tail vertebrae along two sacral hip vertebrae chevron rib fragments three bones making hip ilium pubis ischium represented isolated fragments leg bones include complete right femur upper part left femur incomplete right tibia right astragalus bone single serrated tooth also considered part may holotype specimen discovered nicknamed gertie gertie dinosaur received much publicity gertie subsequently airlifted helicopter june brought university california museum paleontology ucmp berkley ca prepared next several anniversary airlift media interest generated petrified forest national park celebrated park every year gertie described given proper binomial name ra long pa murry also initially known chinde point dinosaur reference geological landmark close site recovered reference carried generic name derived navajo word chindi meaning ghost evil spirit greek word sauros σαυρος meaning lizard name could therefore translated ghost lizard lizard chinde point specific name bryansmalli honors

horizontal ridge inner edge large roughlytextured tubercle outer surface characteristics also known caseosaurus distinct brevis fossa also like caseosaurus herrerasaurids pubic ischiadic peduncles ilium expand lengthwise towards lower edges unlike herrerasaurids supraacetabular crest ilium extend far forwards contact pubis pubis thin straight slightly curved back widening slightly towards ilium hand ischium seems widen slightly away femur large sigmoid smooth rectangular femoral head like tawa unlike coelophysoids anterior trochanter appearance bulbous ridge separated shaft cleft however chindesaurus lacks groove top femoral head possesses trochanteric shelf dorsolateral trochanter low rounded traits contrast tawa fourth trochanter low located distally herrerasaurus lower end femur

tawa distinct ascending process upper outer part astragalus surrounded system pits ridges depressions connect chindesaurus difficult classify recovered several different positions base saurischian family tree first discovered fossil specimen would eventually named chindesaurus thought prosauropod basal finally described named decade later long murry regarded herrerasaurid interpretation followed many paleontologists since often supported phylogenetic nesbitt et al irmis et al argued chindesaurus probable basal saurischian dinosaur noted shares wide range characteristics several lineages basal saurischians making classification rauhut noted medially expanded brevis shelf chindesaurus resembles crurotarsans pseudosuchians unlike dinosaurs usually laterally partial ilium originally assigned chindesaurus tecovas formation texas later placed genus species caseosaurus crosbyensis hunt et al langer argued separation probably error two forms represent nesbitt et al corroborated stating differences caseosaurus chindesaurus cited hunt et al probably result sizerelated variation however nesbitt et al refrained formally synonymizing two taxa due fragmentary nature chindesauruss baron williams redescribed caseosaurus considered valid herrerasaurian taxon closely related within family herrerasauridae larger clade analysis novas et al also placed chindesaurus
