including orca common breachers fact capable lifting completely water easily although little distinction porpoising noncetacean marine creatures also exhibit breaching behavior several shark species rays genera manta two techniques used cetaceans order breach first method common sperm humpback whales conducted swimming vertically upwards depth heading straight common method travel close surface parallel jerk upwards full speed tail strokes perform breaches cetacean clears water majority body acute angle average horizontal recorded sperm whale turns land back side less frequently may turn belly flop instead order achieve clearance humpback needs leave water speed eight metres per second kilometres per hour mph metric tons short tons animal results momentum thousand newton seconds despite energetic cost breaching often carried series longest recorded sustained series humpback near west indies totaling leaps less repeated breaches tire animal less body clears water ultimately reasons breaching unknown however evidence support range hypotheses whales likely breach groups suggesting nonverbal signal group members social behaviour scientists called theory honest signalling immense cloud bubbles underwater disturbance following breach faked neighbours know breach taken place single breach costs whale total daily energy intake long series breaches may add significant energy breach therefore sign animal physically fit enough afford energy acrobatic display hence could used ascertaining dominance courting warning also possible loud smack upon reentering useful stunning scaring prey similar lobtailing breaching often seen rough seas possible breach allows whale breathe air close surface full spray use breaching communicate noise ocean would mask acoustic another widely accepted possible reason dislodge parasites behaviour may also simply form hourglass dolphins drake passage southern right whale dolphins porpoising porpoising also known high speed surface behaviour small cetaceans long jumps alternated swimming close surface despite name porpoising behaviour seen dolphins porpoises well marine species marine mammals travelling speed forced stay close surface order maintain respiration energetic exercise leisurely cruising speeds ms dolphins swim waters surface briefly expose blowholes along one third body one results little splashing streamlined porpoising occurs mainly dolphins porpoises swimming speeds greater jump length roughly equal distance traveled cetaceans exposes blowhole longer needed get enough oxygen maintain metabolism therefore high speeds long periods time studies also shown leaping energetically efficient swimming certain threshold due reduction friction travelling air compared water saves energy needed produce benefits also outweigh energy wasted due large amount splashing often seen groups porpoising therefore result high speed swimming cetaceans use important pursuit escape activities example dolphins may seen porpoising away main predator direction incoming boats avoid although porpoising useful product rapid swimming much variation seen behaviour explained cause alone likely evolved provide functions example rotation porpoising spinner dolphin leads much splashing common slower attributed energy saving mechanism therefore likely form play communication within another reason might remove barnacles remoras attached increase drag spinner dolphins impact water combination centrifugal vertical force upon ectoparasites times weight efficiently remove theories suggest
