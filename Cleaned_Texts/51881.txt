ostensive definition traditionally c medius considered type species cetiosaurus richard lydekker formally assigned c oxoniensis type species modern rules iczn one species named original author case

would nomen dubium interpreted implying c brevis type species conclusion correct would cause considerable taxonomic instability genus pelorosaurus since based fossils recognized totally different kind
