cognitive psychology cognitive load refers amount working memory resources used however essential distinguish actual construct cognitive load cl mental workload mwl studied widely many disciplines according work conducted field instructional design pedagogy broadly three types cognitive load intrinsic cognitive load effort associated specific topic extraneous cognitive load refers way information tasks presented learner germane cognitive load refers work put creating permanent store knowledge schema however years additivity types cognitive load investigated questioned believed circularly influence cognitive load theory developed late study problem solving john sweller argued instructional design used reduce cognitive load learners much later researchers developed way measure perceived mental effort indicative cognitive taskinvoked pupillary response reliable sensitive measurement cognitive load directly related working information may stored long term memory first attended processed working memorycitation needed working memory however extremely limited capacity durationcitation needed limitations conditions impede learningcitation needed heavy cognitive load negative effects task completion important note experience cognitive load everyonecitation needed elderly students children experience different often higher amounts cognitive loadcitation needed fundamental tenet cognitive load theory quality instructional design raised greater consideration given role limitations working memory increased distractions particularly cell phone use students prone experiencing high cognitive load reduce academic late john sweller developed cognitive load theory study problem order provide guidelines intended assist presentation information manner encourages learner activities optimize intellectual swellers theory employs aspects information processing theory emphasize inherent limitations concurrent working memory load learning instructioncitation needed makes use schema primary unit analysis design instructional materialscitation needed history cognitive load theory traced beginning cognitive science work ga miller classic miller perhaps first suggest working memory capacity inherent limits experimental results suggested humans generally able hold seven plus minus two units information shortterm memorycitation needed simon chase first use term chunk describe people might organize information shortterm chunking memory components also described schema constructioncitation needed late john sweller developed cognitive load theory clt studying problem studying learners solved problems associates found learners often use problem solving strategy called meansends analysis suggests problem solving meansends analysis requires relatively large amount cognitive processing capacity may devoted schema construction sweller suggested instructional designers prevent unnecessary cognitive load designing instructional materials involve problem solving examples alternative instructional materials include known workedexamples goalfree problemscitation needed cognitive load theory applied several contexts empirical results studies led demonstration several learning effects completionproblem modality splitattention workedexample expertise reversal cognitive load theory provides general framework broad implications instructional design allowing instructional designers control conditions learning within environment generally within instructional materials specifically provides empiricallybased guidelines help instructional designers decrease extraneous cognitive load learning thus refocus learners attention toward germane materials thereby increasing germane schema related cognitive load theory differentiates three types cognitive load intrinsic cognitive load germane cognitive load extraneous cognitive intrinsic cognitive load inherent level difficulty associated specific instructional topic term first used early chandler according instructions inherent difficulty associated eg calculation versus solving differential equation inherent difficulty may altered instructor however many schemas may broken individual subschemas taught isolation later brought back together described combined extraneous cognitive load generated manner information presented learners control instructional load attributed design instructional materials single limited cognitive resource using resources process extraneous load number resources available process intrinsic load germane load ie learning reduced thus especially intrinsic andor germane load high ie problem difficult materials designed reduce extraneous example extraneous cognitive load occurs two possible ways describe square square figure described using figural medium certainly instructor describe square verbal medium takes second far less effort see instructor talking learner shown square rather one described verbally instance efficiency visual medium preferred unduly load learner unnecessary information unnecessary cognitive load described extraneouscitation needed chandler sweller introduced concept extraneous cognitive load article written report results six experiments conducted investigate working memory load many experiments involved materials demonstrating split attention effect found format instructional materials either promoted limited learning proposed differences performance due higher levels cognitive load imposed format instruction extraneous cognitive load term unnecessary artificially induced cognitive loadcitation needed extraneous cognitive load may different components clarity texts interactive demands educational germane cognitive load processing construction automation schemas first described sweller van merriënboer paas intrinsic cognitive load generally thought immutable although techniques applied manage complexity segmenting sequencing complex material instructional designers manipulate extraneous germane load suggested limit extraneous load promote germane article sweller van merriënboer paas cognitive load theory primarily concentrated reduction extraneous cognitive load article cognitive load researchers began seek ways redesigning instruction redirect would extraneous load focused toward schema construction germane load thus important instructional designers reduce extraneous cognitive load redirect learners attention cognitive processes directly relevant construction paas van developed construct known relative condition efficiency helps researchers measure perceived mental effort index cognitive load construct provides relatively simple means comparing instructional conditions taking account mental effort ratings performance scores relative condition efficiency calculated subtracting standardized mental effort standardized performance dividing square root paas van merriënboer used relative condition efficiency compare three instructional conditions worked examples completion problems discovery practice found learners studied worked examples efficient followed used problem completion strategy since early study many researchers used constructs measure cognitive load relates learning ergonomic approach seeks quantitative neurophysiological expression cognitive load measured using common instruments example using heart rateblood pressure product rpp measure cognitive physical occupational believe may possible use rpp measures set limits workloads establishing work allowance taskinvoked pupillary response form measurement directly reflects cognitive load working memory greater pupil dilation found associated high cognitive pupil constriction occurs low cognitive taskinvoked pupillary response shows direct correlation working memory making effective measurement cognitive load explicitly unrelated learning researchers compared different measures cognitive example deleeuw mayer compared three commonly used measures cognitive load found responded different ways extraneous intrinsic germane study showed may various demand components together form extraneous cognitive load may need measured using different established eye movement pupillary response indicators cognitive load heavy cognitive load typically creates error kind interference task heavy cognitive load also increase heavy cognitive load pushes excess information subconscious processing involves use schemas patterns thought behavior help us organize information categories identify relationships stereotypical associations may automatically activated use pattern recognition schemas producing implicit stereotype effect stereotyping extension fundamental attribution error also increases frequency heavier cognitive notions cognitive load arousal contribute overload hypothesis explanation social facilitation presence audience subjects tend perform worse subjectively complex tasks whereas tend excel subjectively easy tasks evidence found individuals systematically differed processing established example individual differences processing capacities novices experts experts knowledge experience regard specific task reduces cognitive load associated task novices experience knowledge thus heavier cognitive danger heavy cognitive load seen elderly population aging cause declines efficiency working memory contribute higher cognitive heavy cognitive load disturb balance elderly people relationship heavy cognitive load control center mass heavily correlated elderly population cognitive load increases sway center mass elderly individuals study examined relationship body sway cognitive function relationship multitasking found disturbances balance led decrease performance cognitive conversely increasing demand balance increase cognitive loadcitation needed increasing cognitive load students using laptop school become concern use facebook social forms communication adding multiple tasks jeopardizes students performance classroom many cognitive resources available probability switching one task another high lead optimal switching study students heavy facebook users students sat nearby heavy facebook users performed poorly resulted lower british psychologists alan baddeley graham hitch proposed components working memory place years found clear difference adult child knowledge differences due developmental increases processing children lack general knowledge creates increased cognitive load children children impoverished families often experience even higher cognitive load learning environments middleclass children hear talk learn schooling concepts parents often formal educationcitation needed comes learning lack experience numbers words concepts increases cognitive load children grow older develop superior basic processes also develop metacognition helps understand cognitive lastly gain greater content knowledge elements help reduce cognitive load children developcitation needed gesturing technique children use reduce cognitive load gesturing free working memory pointing allows child use object pointing best representation means hold
