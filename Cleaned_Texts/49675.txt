pointed fossilized peeblesorum eggs black color high prominent ridges outer eggs incubated heat resulting rotting vegetation placed nest parents rather parent sitting nest upon hatching fossils baby maiasaura show legs fully developed thus incapable walking fossils also show teeth partly worn means adults brought food hatchlings grew size centimetres long span first year point perhaps another
