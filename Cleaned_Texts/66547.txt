mitral valve replacement procedure whereby diseased mitral valve patients heart replaced either mechanical tissue bioprosthetic valve mitral valve may need replaced becausecitation needed causes mitral valve disease include infection calcification inherited collagen disease current mitral valve replacement approaches include open heart surgery minimally invasive cardiac surgery mics mitral valve bileaflet valve sited left atrium left ventricle responsible preventing blood flowing ventricle atrium heart contracts elliptical area varies valve leaflets separated two commissures leaflet valve anterior leaflet large one posterior leaflet small one three sections histologically leaflet composed solid fibrosa spongiosa atrial surface another fibroelastic layer covering two papillary muscles originating base left ventricle hold mitral leaflets place chordae tendinae insert edge leaflets preventing leaking left ventricle normal mitral valve function fluid jets left atrium mitral valve left ventricle vortex created jetting travels towards apex left ventricle asymmetric shape mitral valve leaflets vortex rotates clockwise isovolumetric contraction left ventricle opens aortic valve redirects fluid flow apex left ventricle systemic circulation rest bodycitation needed important emphasize asymmetry mitral valve important diastolic flow patterns transmitral flow additionally entire systems mitral annulus papillary muscles chordae tendinea play vital role forming sophisticated vortex optimizes fluid flow left heart simulations performed showing aspects mitral valve contribute normal vortex formation left common cause mitral stenosis rheumatic fever seen mostly developing world causes mitral degenerative disease severe calcification elderly congenital deformities malignant carcinoid syndrome neoplasm left atrial appendage thrombus endocarditic vegetations certain inherited metabolic diseases complications previous procedures aortic mitral stenosis causes left atrial pressure increase left untreated lead ventricular dilation hypertrophy atrial fibrillation thrombus creation symptoms include shortness breath dyspnea exertion lying flat orthopnea night paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea mitral leaflets dont coapt close effectively blood flows backwards regurgitation left ventricle towards left atrium systole common causes myxomatous degeneration barlow

used system classify mitral valve regurgitation carpentiers classification separates mitral regurgitation three types depending leaflet motion relation mitral annular planecitation needed two main types artificial mitral valve mechanical valves tissue bioprosthetic come various sizes commonly starting external diameter mm increasing mm per mechanical valves made metal andor pyrolitic last risk blood clots forming higher mechanical valves bioprosthetic valves result patients mechanical valves must take bloodthinning medication anticoagulants rest lives making prone three types mechanical valves bileaflet valves common type mechanical valve offering desirable two leaflets bileaflet disc valve open diastole close systolecitation needed bioprosthetic valves made animal tissues people bioprosthetic valves need take anticoagulants long term however bioprosthetic valves may last tend deteriorate quickly younger valve failure prevalence years increasing new tissue preservation technologies studied try increase durability bioprosthetic choice valve depends upon patients age medical condition preferences typically patients younger years old receive mechanical valve unless unable take longterm anticoagulation patients older years receive bioprosthetic common approach surgeons reach heart median sternotomy vertically cutting breastbone incisions employed left right heart exposed patient put cardiopulmonary bypass machine also known machine machine breathes patient pumps blood around body bypassing heart surgeon replaces heart valve next aortic clamp placed aorta heart stopped depending pathology mitral valve surgeons preference various approaches used access mitral valve interatrial groove approach involves incising left atrium posterior interatrial groove transatrial oblique approach utilized left atrium small approach right atrium opened another incision made interatrial valve excised mm annulus leaving intact attached chordae unless calcified otherwise diseased valve replaced mechanical bioprosthetic valve replacement valve sewn annulus interrupted horizontal mattress sutures pledgets atrial atrial walls closed taking care trap air within chambers heart restarted patient taken machinecitation needed following surgery patients typically taken intensive care unit monitoring may need respirator help breathe first hours days surgery patient able sit bed within hours two days patient may moved intensive care unit patients usually discharged days mitral valve replacement successful patients expect symptoms improve scarring occurs surgery median sternotomy patient vertical scar chest breastbone heart accessed left breast smaller scar patients bioprosthetic mitral valve prescribed anticoagulants warfarin weeks months operation patients mechanical valves prescribed anticoagulants rest lives anticoagulants taken prevent blood clots move parts body cause serious medical problems heart attack anticoagulants dissolve blood clot prevent clots forming prevent clots becoming wounds healed patients restrictions daily activities people advised walk undertake physical activities gradually regain strength patients physically demanding jobs wait little longer patients also restricted driving car six weeks surgerycitation needed cardiac procedures mitral valve replacement associated risks bleeding infection thromboembolism

requirements pressure shifts lateral septal wall left heartcitation needed since surgeons working less invasive approaches mitral valve surgery known minimally invasive cardiac surgery mics minimally invasive mitral valve replacement involves small incision cm right breast benefits mics conventional surgery include reduced hospital stay blood transfusion requirements smaller rather removing existing valve transcatheter mitral valve involves wedging new valve site existing valve replacement valve delivered site existing valve tube called catheter catheter may inserted femoral artery thigh small incision replacement valve place expanded pushing old valve leaflets sections open close many mitral valves repaired instead replaced fact mitral valve repair recommended international guidelines wherever advantages mitral valve repair replacement include lower surgical mortality repair vs lower rates stroke endocarditis infection heart inner lining equivalent better improved longterm patients valve repaired similar life expectancy general addition patients may need take anticoagulants long term following mitral valve individuals symptoms contraindications surgery options
