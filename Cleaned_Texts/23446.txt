sore throat pharyngitis sydenhams chorea common females males cases affect children years age adult onset sydenhams chorea comparatively rare majority adult cases recurrences following childhood sydenhams chorea historically one conditions called st vitus sydenhams chorea characterized abrupt onset sometimes within hours neurological symptoms classically chorea nonrhythmic writhing explosive involuntary movements usually four limbs affected cases reported one side body affected hemichorea typical chorea includes repeated wrist hyperextension grimacing lip pouting fingers move playing piano may tongue fasciculations bag worms motor impersistence example milkmaid sign grip strength fluctuates hand milking cow inability sustain tongue protrusion called jackinthebox serpentine tongue slides mouth eye closure usually loss fine motor control particularly obvious handwriting child school age speech often affected dysarthria walking legs suddenly give way flick one side giving irregular gait appearance skipping dancing underlying abnormal movements often low tone hypotonia may become obvious treatment started suppress chorea severe cases loss tone weakness predominate chorea paralyticum severity condition vary instability walking difficulty handwriting extreme wholly unable walk talk eat movements cease sleep neuropsychiatric disorder besides motor problems classically emotional lability mood swings inappropriate mood anxiety attention deficit precede motor nonneurologic manifestations acute rheumatic fever may present namely carditis cases often

association case isolated chorea arguable whether cardiac risk justifies prophylaxis however likely reduce recurrence several historical case series reporting successful treatment sydenhams chorea
