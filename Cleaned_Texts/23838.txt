fine motor skill dexterity coordination small muscles movement eyes hands fingers complex levels manual dexterity humans exhibit related nervous system fine motor skills aid growth intelligence develop continuously throughout stages human development motor skills movements actions bone typically categorised two groups gross motor skills fine motor skills gross motor skills involved movement coordination arms legs large body parts involve actions running crawling swimming fine motor skills involved smaller movements occur wrists hands fingers feet toes specifically single joint movements fine motor movements require fine motor skills involve smaller actions picking objects thumb finger writing carefully blinking developmental stage motor skills gradually develop first seen infancy toddlerhood preschool school age basic fine motor skills gradually develop typically mastered ages children fine motor skills develop age practice deemed necessary occupational therapy help improve overall fine motor early fine motor skills involuntary notable involuntary reflex darwinian reflex primitive reflex displayed various newborn primates species involuntary muscle movements temporary often disappear first two months eight weeks infant begin voluntarily use fingers touch however infants learned grab stage coordination begins develop two five months infants begin reach grasp objects age piaget found even infants able reach successfully grasp objects see demonstrate competent handmouth coordination study done philippe rochat emory university test relation progress control posture developmental transition twohanded onehanded engagement reaching found object reached needed controlled precision reach potentially maximized placed centrally also found posture needed controlled infants able sit used bimanual reaches postural positions except sitting upright would reach onehanded result grasping phases maximized decrease body control hand infant body control would hard get hold object reach limited nonsitting infants reached bimanually seated upright often ended falling forward regardless whether selfsit infants adjust two handed engagement relation arrangement objects reached analysis handtohand distance reaching indicates prone supine posture nonsitting infants moved hands simultaneously towards midline bodies reached observed stable sitting infants position nonsitter infants although showing strong tendencies toward bimanual reaching tend reach one hand sat sitter infants show majority differentiated reaches posture conditions study conducted esther thelen postural control infancy used dynamic systems approach observe motor development findings suggest early reaching constrained head shoulder instability relationship posture reaching tight thus head control body stability necessary emergence graspingcitation needed next developmental milestone seven twelve months series fine motor skills begins develop include increase grip enhancement vision pointing index finger smoothly transferring objects one hand well using pincer grip thumb index fingers pick tiny objects precision lot factors change grasping infant becomes seven months infant better chance grasping sit therefore infant fall infant grasping also changes infant starts hold objects properly age time child one year old fine motor skills developed hold look objects children manipulate objects purpose gain experience identifying objects based shape size weight develops childs fine motor skills understanding toddler show hand dominance children typically attend preschool ages time child capable grasping objects using static tripod grasp combined use index thumb middle finger preschool childs motor skills moderate allowing child cut shapes paper draw trace vertical lines crayons button clothes pick objects preferred hand dominates majority activities also develop sensory awareness interpret environment using senses moving static tripod grasp next form dynamic tripod grasp shown series schneck hendersons grip form chart based accuracy form hold child ranked either well able complete dynamic tripod grasp properly writing conjunction accuracy precision child able properly position writing utensil terms implement diameter well form grip strength proper handwriting drawing fall deeper category graphomotor national centre teaching learning illustrates abilities preschool children improved fine motor skills several domains children use motor skills sorting manipulating geometric shapes making patterns using measurement tools build math skills using writing tools reading books build language literacy arts crafts activities like cutting gluing paper finger painting dressing develops creativity parents support development intervening child perform fine motor activity correctly making use several senses learning activity offer activities child successful developmental disabilitiesexample needed may stop child things involve motor skills drawing building fine motor skills acquired stage aids later advancement understanding subjects science study american journal occupational therapy included twentysix preschool children received occupational therapy weekly basis showed overall advancements fine motor skill area results showed link inhand manipulation coordination grasping strength childs motor skills selfcare social function children shown better mobility ages five seven fine motor skills developed child interacts objects movements elbows shoulders less apparent movements wrist fingers ages years old girls advance fine motor skills boys girls develop physically earlier age boys allows advance motor skills faster rate prepubescent ages boys advance gross motor skills later around age five girls advanced balance motor dexteritycitation needed children able make precise cuts scissors example cutting squares holding common mature manner childs movements become fluid arms hands become sync child also able write precisely lines print letters numbers greater clarity fine motor skills become impaired due injury illness stroke congenital deformities cerebral palsy developmental disabilities problems brain spinal cord peripheral nerves muscles joints also effect fine motor skills decrease control infant child age five developing fine motor skills show signs difficulty controlling hands fingers face young children delays learning sitting walking early sign issues fine motor skills may also show signs difficulty tasks cutting scissors drawing lines folding clothes child difficulty might poor coordination could need therapy improve skillscitation needed fine motor skills assessed standardized nonstandardized tests children adults finemotor assessments include force matching tasks humans exhibit high degree accuracy force matching tasks individual instructed match reference force applied finger different humans show high accuracy grip force matching aspects manual dexterity apparent ability humans effectively use tools perform hard manipulation tasks handling unstable another assessment called peabody developmental scales pdms test children examines childs ability grasp variety objects development coordination childs overall finger similar pdms integration assessment vmir assessment examines visual motor integration system demonstrates points possible learning disabilities
