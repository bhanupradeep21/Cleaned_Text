sclera harmless condition called scleral melanocytosis human eyes somewhat distinctive animal kingdom sclera plainly visible whenever eye open due white color human sclera many species share also fact human iris relatively small comprises significantly smaller portion exposed eye surface compared animals theorized adaptation evolved social nature eye became useful communication tool addition
