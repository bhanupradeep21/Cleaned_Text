epigenetic theories homosexuality concern studies changes gene expression cellular phenotype caused mechanisms changes underlying dna sequence role development epigenetics examines set chemical reactions switch parts genome strategic times locations organisms life cycle however epigenetic theories tangle multiplicity initiating causes resulting final effects never lead single cause single result hence interpretation theories may focus one isolated reason multiplicity causes instead affecting organisms dna sequence nongenetic factors may cause organisms genes express differently dna human body wrapped around histones proteins package order dna structural units dna histone covered chemical tags known epigenome shapes physical structure tightly wraps inactive genes dna sequence making genes unreadable loosely wrapping active genes making expressive tightly wrapped gene less expressed organism epigenetic tags react stimuli presented outside world adjusts specific genes genome respond humans rapidly changing environments idea epigenetics gene expression theory applied origins homosexuality humans one team researchers examined effects epimarks buffering xx fetuses xy fetuses certain androgen exposure used published data fetal androgen signaling gene regulation nongenetic changes dna packaging develop new model researchers found stronger average epimarks epigenomes wrapped tightly around dna sequence convert sexual preference individuals without altering genitalia sexual however later study found male homosexuality linked low androgen sensitivity sexreversed epigenetic marks epimarks temporary switches control genes expressed gestation birth moreover epimarks modifications histone epigenetic marks modifications methyl acetyl groups bind dna histones thereby changing proteins function result alter gene epimarks change histones function result influence way genes epigenetic marks promote normal sexual development fetal development however passed offspring process meiosis transferred one parent offspring opposite sex contribute altered sexual development thus leading masculinization female offspring feminization male however epimarks hold consistency individuals regard strength variabilitycitation needed identical twins nearly identical dna leads perceived conclusion identical twins either heterosexual homosexual however evident case consequently leaving gap explanation homosexuality gay gene produce homosexuality rather epigenetic modifications act temporary switches regulate genes pairs identical twins one twin homosexual twin despite genome chance homosexual leads hypothesis homosexuality created something else rather genes epigenetic transformation allows switching certain genes subsequently shaping cells respond androgen signaling critical sexual another example epigenetic consequences evident multiple sclerosis monozygotic identical twins pairs twins discordant multiple sclerosis show trait gene testing suggested dna identical epigenetic differences contributed gene difference identical fetal stages hormonal influences androgen specifically testosterone cause feminine qualities regard sexual development females masculine qualities males typical sexual development females exposed minimal amounts testosterone thus feminizing sexual development males typically exposed high levels testosterone masculinize development epimarks play critical role development acting buffer fetus androgen exposure moreover predominantly protect xy fetuses androgen underexposure protecting xx fetuses androgen however androgen overexposure happens xx fetuses research suggests show masculinized behavior comparison females undergo normal levels androgen exposure research also suggests excess androgen exposure females led reduced heterosexual interest adulthood females normal levels new epimarks usually produced generation marks sometimes carry generations sexspecific epimarks produced early fetal development protect sex natural disparity testosterone occurs later stages fetal development different epimarks protect different sexspecific traits masculinized affect genitals others affect sexual identity yet others affect sexual preference however epimarks transmitted across generations fathers daughters mothers sons may cause reversed effects feminization traits sons similarly partial masculinization daughters furthermore reversed effects feminization masculinization lead reversed sexual preference example sexspecific epimarks normally prevent female fetuses masculinized exposure atypically high testosterone vice versa male fetuses sexspecific epimarks normally erased passed generations however sometimes escape erasure transferred fathers genes daughter mothers genes son happens may lead altered sexual epimarks normally protect parents variation sex hormone levels fetal development carry across generations subsequently lead homosexuality oppositesex offspring demonstrates gene coding epimarks spread population benefit development fitness parent rarely escape erasure leading samesex sexual preference offspringcitation needed epigenetic explanations sexual orientation still purely
