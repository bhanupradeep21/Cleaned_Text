immune dysregulation proposed confirmed breakdown maladaptive change molecular control immune system processes example dysregulation component pathogenesis autoimmune diseases cancers immune system dysfunction seen ipex syndrome leads immune dysfunction polyendocrinopathy enteropathy xlinked ipex ipex typically presents first months life diabetes mellitus intractable diarrhea failure thrive eczema hemolytic anemia unrestrained unregulated immune ipex immune dysregulation polyendocrinopathy enteropathy xlinked syndrome syndrome caused genetic mutation encodes major transcription factor regulatory cells tregs mutation leads dysfunctional tregs result autoimmune diseases classic clinical manifestations enteropathy type diabetes mellitus eczema various autoimmune diseases hypersensitivity common individuals ipex addition autoimmune diseases individuals experience higher immune reactivity eg chronic dermatitis susceptibility infections individuals also develop autoimmune diseases young autoimmune polyendocrinopathycandidiasisendodermal dystrophy apeced syndrome caused mutation aire autoimmune regulator typical manifestations apeced mucocutaneous candidiasis multiple endocrine autoimmune diseases apeced causes loss central immune omenn syndrome manifests gvhd graft versus host diseaselike autoimmune disease immune dysregulation caused increased ige production syndrome caused mutations rmrp genes number immune cells usually normal syndrome functionality wiskottaldrich syndrome caused mutation gene manifests higher susceptibility infections eczema frequent development autoimmune hemolytic anemia neutropenia partial cell immunodeficiency characterized incomplete reduction cell number activity contrast severe cell immunodeficiency tcell ability respond infections maintained tcell immunodeficiencies tend associated autoimmune diseases hyperreactivity increased ige production mutations tend genes cytokines tcrs proteins important somatic recombination antigen additional cellassociated immune dysregulation may due mutation essential negative regulation immune response loss leads dysregulation autoimmune diseases disease characterized hypogammaglobulinemia frequent infections occurrence autoimmune diseases individuals disease may manifest differently cases partial reduction number tregs others ability bind ligand reduced resulting disruption homeostasis effector b cells inheritance syndrome autosomal dominant incomplete chronic stress various stages life lead chronic inflammation immune dysregulation individuals high stress childhood abuse neglect etc higher risk cardiovascular disease type ii diabetes osteoporosis rheumatoid arthritis problems associated immune dysregulation overall individuals higher childhood stress increases risk chronic inflammation adulthood higher levels tnfα noted stressed individuals chronic stress childhood also promotes development proinflammatory types monocytes macrophages also develop resistance antiinflammatory agent eg cortisol traumatized individuals also higher antibody titers viruses herpes simplex virus virus cytomegalovirus individuals without chronic dysregulation immune system also associated immunosenescence arises due aging immunosenescence manifested decrease reactivity vaccination infection impaired ability b lymphocytes activate proliferate lower ability antigen presentation dendritic cells immunosenescence memory effector cells accumulate expense naïve cells lack naïve lymphocytes cause low plasticity immune system aging immune system also decrease central tolerance increase number autoreactive b cells also decreased repertoire naïve cells increase memory b also reduced production antibodies antigens immunosenescence change individual subtypes immunoglobulins igm igd levels decrease levels increase iga higher form monomers serum lower dimer mucosal overall accumulation effector b cells due presence chronic inflammation due longterm exposure antigens immunosenescence also reduced ability apoptosis promotes survival memory old age innate immunity cells also affected activated cells lower ability return quiescent state effector functions elderly people show poor nk cell reactivity impaired ability antigen presentation dendritic macrophages ability phagocytosis reduced phenotype macrophages alternatively activated immunosenescence also results increased production immune mediators proinflammatory may also higher production antiinflammatory old age ability heal wounds also decreases leading susceptibility infections site aging immune system also supported chronic infections oxidative stress production accumulation reactive oxygen species ros increase proportion memory cells also affected cytomegalovirus chronic proinflammatory condition aging organism also referred inflammaging longterm lowgrade systemic inflammation present without presence immune dysregulation also caused toxins example environmental workers increased exposure pesticides ddt organophosphate amides phthalamides etc disrupts immune system responses resulting damage depends individuals age dose time toxin exposure young age adolescents significant negative effects even lower dose toxins however ability break toxic substances resulting impact organism also related metabolism genetic equipment individual toxins act directly cellular component immunity metabolites promote reactive oxygen species ros body depletion antioxidants oxidative stress common clinical manifestations immunosuppression hypersensitivity autoimmune diseases also support response development allergies support chronic conventional toxins irritants environment saliva enzymes bloodfeeding parasites insect poisons irritants plants also cause allergic reactions substances disrupt cell membranes activate cell receptors aggregate degrade certain proteins disrupt mucosal surface layer immune system often responds substances reactions lead removal irritant substance body itching coughing sneezing combining action several toxins time increase negative effects cases effects toxins cancel allergic reactions misdirected reactions immune system substances commonly found environment allergens elicit immune response including involvement ige mast cells innate lymphoid cells eosinophils basophils allergy symptoms often related bodys efforts expel allergen body protect exposure allergic reactions increase production mucus goblet cells mucosa production mucus promoted cells higher mucus production creates stronger barrier protection supports runny nose coughing sneezing removal allergen body sneezing coughing vomiting diarrhea enabled activation peristalsis contractions smooth muscles digestive respiratory systems activation smooth muscles occurs action histamine released mast cells manifestations allergies generally aim eliminate bodys allergen also related hearing flushing antigens eyes attempts achieve mechanical removal surface allergies caused genetic environmental factors theories support view allergies enter protection environmental substances disrupt body insect venom another possibility activating allergic reaction similarity allergens molecular patterns parasites immune system also uses type immune hygiene hypothesis relates changes lifetime exposure pathogens developed countries case insufficient exposure pathogens insufficient stimulation response individuals development balance type responses may predominate proallergic theory supported frequent occurrence allergies developed countries compared developing countries also higher incidence allergies cities compared villages individuals meet pathogens farm animals children small families also likely allergies children families children frequent contact pathogens another environmental factor may promote predisposition allergies reduction diversity microbiome affects diet individuals also diet mother pregnancy method delivery breastfeeding antibiotics presence domestic farm animals normal life httpsenwikipediaorgwikiimmunedysregulation
