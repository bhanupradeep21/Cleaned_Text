external fertilization mode reproduction male organisms sperm fertilizes female organisms egg outside females contrasted internal fertilization sperm introduced via insemination combine egg inside body female external fertilization typically occurs water moist area facilitate movement sperm release eggs sperm water known motile species spawning females often travel suitable location release eggs however sessile species less able move spawning locations must release gametes among vertebrates external fertilization common amphibians invertebrates utilizing external fertilization mostly benthic sessile including animals coral sea anemones tubedwelling benthic marine plants also use external fertilization environmental factors timing key challenges success external fertilization water male female must release gametes similar times order fertilize gametes spawned water may also washed away eaten damaged external factors sexual selection may seem occur external fertilization ways actually two types external fertilizers nest builders broadcast spawners female nest builders main choice location lay eggs female choose nest close male wants fertilize eggs guarantee preferred male fertilize eggs broadcast spawners weak selection due randomness releasing look effect female choice external fertilization vitro sperm competition experiment performed results concluded decreased importance sperm number increased importance sperm velocity thus changing outcome sperm competition ovarian fluid also increased paternity preferred male release fewer faster success male fertilizing egg relies ability males sperm outcompete sperm looking fertilize egg sperm chemotaxis use chemical signals give sperm ability navigate egg huge contributor reproductive benthic sessile animals make majority invertebrates using external fertilization rely ambient water motion bring sperm eggs together invertebrates externally fertilize organisms like sea urchin confined shallow burrows exposed shores turbulent flows surf zone also create transport hydrodynamic conditions gamete properties control efficiency fertilization influence rate water dilemma turbulence possibility dilution sperm egg mixing rapid mixing cause lower probability sessile adult staged animals commonly produce gametes times also known synchronized release gametes external fertilization water column helpful lack mobility organisms also rely turbulent mixing sperm mobility enhance chances presence food resources favorable environmental conditions lack predators thought thinking survival next female producing eggs perform predator satiation multiple females release gametes mass reproductive great barrier reef known mass spawn occurs week full moon mass reproductive event given reef forming corals perform synchronized release gametes one evening dusk midnight species release gametes cases fertilization take place spawning animals surface animals turbulent although fertilization usually thought shortterm process possibility gametes retained surface animal extended period order release egg sperm time clumps formed float water allows variation locations time differences fertilization taking place earliest amphibians internal fertilizers wasnt million years ago anura early internal fertilizer caudata early external fertilizer orders begun anurans externally anurans amphibians lacking tail frogs anurans commonly used model organism amphibians large easy manipulate eggs fast developmental rate high fecundity rate parental involvement external fertilization males congregate near lake pond establish calling stations females approach area listen different male calls continue move towards mate chooses anurans sexual selection concluded females prefer male attractive call also larger copulation occurs male anuran hops onto back female move spot near water simultaneously release sperm eggs males area also release sperm onto eggs also attempt fertilize eggs female want reproduce male jumps onto back wait male leaves move new sperm released water must close proximity get egg first enter gel layer egg best chance fertilizing anurans close eggs sometimes release sperm oocyte containing foam nests terrestrial breeders go right gel coat oocyte release course breeding season males copulate numerous times releasing sperm anywhere finds unfertilized eggs encounters female iswants spawn females however release eggs per breeding releasing sperm directly water increases sperm competition agonistic behavior spawning groups tested good evidence associated larger sperm number testes smaller testes size slower sperm velocity seen anurans released sperm foam nests instead open increase sperm competition larger thickness anuran oocyte gel specifically green tree frog anuran sperm also high longevity osmotic tolerance compared fresh water caudata order contains salamanders newts amphibians within subgroups externally fertilize cryptobranchidae giant salamanders sirenidae females release egg sacs onto stones branches male later hovers eggs release sperm males seen protective eggs may continue hover eggs sperm release decrease sperm competition cases males may even latch onto females lay eggs ensure fertilize first times may numerous males surrounding single sac eggs creating scramble cryptobranchid sperm seen higher longevity times greater freshwater fish even close high salmon cod trout char examples fish externally fertilize females release roe egg mass males release milt seminal fluid containing sperm water diffuse together top sperm locating oocyte penetrating gel layer must also infiltrate turbulent water even open calm water closer fish releases sperm higher chance fertilizing eggs sperm released early become dilute die ever reaches eggs sperm released late higher chance different fishs sperm already reached eggs also faster numerous sperm instances males create habitats attempt monopolize females increase chance fertilizing fishes iteroparous spawn spawn death known semelparous within iteroparous fish usually give parental care external sperm present male fish immotile testes seminal fluid fertilization environment determines sperm become motile salmon decrease potassium fresh water initiate motility sperm decrease osmolality spawning fresh water makes cyprinid fishs sperm httpsenwikipediaorgwikiexternalfertilization
