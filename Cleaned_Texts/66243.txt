diuresis ˌdaɪjʊˈriːsɪs excretion urine especially excessive polyuria term collectively denotes physiologic processes underpinning increased urine production kidneys maintenance fluid healthy people drinking extra water produces mild diuresis maintain body water balance many people health issues heart failure kidney failure need diuretic medications help kidneys deal fluid overload edema drugs promote water loss via urine production concentrations electrolytes blood closely linked fluid balance action problem involving fluid intake output polydipsia polyuria diarrhea heat exhaustion starting changing doses diuretics others require management electrolytes whether selfcare mild cases help health professionals moderate severe casescitation needed osmotic diuresis increase urination rate caused presence certain substances small tubes excretion occurs substances glucose enter kidney tubules reabsorbed due pathological state normal nature substance substances cause increase osmotic pressure within tubule causing retention water within lumen thus reduces reabsorption water increasing urine output ie diuresis effect seen therapeutics mannitol used increase urine output decrease extracellular fluid volumecitation needed substances circulation also increase amount circulating fluid increasing osmolarity blood effect pulling water interstitial space making water available blood causing kidney compensate removing urine hypotension often colloids used intravenously increase circulating volume exert certain amount osmotic pressure water therefore also moved increasing circulating volume blood pressure increases kidney removes excess fluid urine sodium chloride potassium excreted osmotic diuresis originating diabetes mellitus dm osmotic diuresis results dehydration polyuria classic polydipsia excessive thirst associated dmcitation needed forced diuresis increased urine formation diuretics fluid may enhance excretion certain drugs urine used treat drug overdose poisoning drugs hemorrhagic diuretic drugs either weak acids weak bases urine made alkaline elimination acidic drugs urine increased converse applies alkaline drugs method therapeutic significance drug excreted active form urine ph urine adjusted levels pk value active form drug acidic drugs urine ph pk value drug converse basic drugs ionization acidic drug increased alkaline urine ionized drugs easily cross plasma membrane reenter blood kidney tubules method ineffective drugs strongly protein bound eg tricyclic antidepressants large apparent volume distribution eg paracetamol tricyclic forced alkaline diuresis sodium bicarbonate added infusion fluid make blood turn urine alkaline potassium replacement becomes utmost importance setting potassium usually lost urine blood levels potassium depleted normal levels hypokalemia occurs promotes bicarbonate ion retention prevents bicarbonate excretion thus interfering alkalinization urine forced alkaline diuresis used increase excretion acidic drugs like salicylates phenobarbitone recommended rhabdomyolysismedical citation needed forced acid diuresis ascorbic acid vitamin c sometimes used ammonium chloride also used forced acid diuresis toxic compoundmedical citation needed usually however technique produces slight increase renal clearance drug forced acid diuresis rarely done used enhance elimination cocaine amphetamine quinine quinidine atropine strychnine poisoning drugs occurred rebound diuresis refers sudden resurgence urine flow occurs convalescence acute kidney acute kidney injury particularly acute tubular necrosis tubules become blocked cellular matter particularly necrotic sloughing dead cells debris obstructs flow filtrate results reduced output urine arterial supply nephron linked filtration apparatus glomerulus reduced perfusion leads reduced blood flow usually result prerenal kidneys resorptive mechanisms particularly energetic using nearly supplied thus kidney particularly sensitive reduction blood supply phenomenon occurs renal flow restored prior normal resorption function renal tubule shown graph urine flow recovers rapidly subsequently overshoots typical daily output ml people since kidneys resorption capacity takes longer reestablish minor lag function follows recovery flow good reference range plasma creatinine immersion diuresis caused immersion body water equivalent liquid mainly caused lower temperature temperature component caused water drawing heat away body causing vasoconstriction cutaneous blood vessels within body conserve body detects increase blood pressure inhibits release vasopressin also known antidiuretic hormone adh causing increase production urine pressure component caused hydrostatic pressure water directly increasing blood pressure significance indicated fact temperature water substantially affect rate partial immersion limbs cause increased urination thus hand warm water trick immersing hand sleeping person water make urinate support mechanism immersion diuresis hand sitting neck pool hours clearly increases excretion water salts coldinduced diuresis cold diuresis phenomenon occurs humans exposure hypothermic environment usually mild moderate currently thought caused redirection blood extremities core due peripheral vasoconstriction increases fluid volume core overall acute exposure cold thought induce diuretic response due increase mean arterial arterial cells kidneys sense increase blood pressure signal kidneys excrete superfluous fluid attempt stabilize pressure kidneys increase urine production
