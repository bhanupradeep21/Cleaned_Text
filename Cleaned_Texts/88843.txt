cepaea genus large airbreathing land snails terrestrial pulmonate gastropod molluscs family helicidae shells often brightly coloured patterned brown stripes two species genus c nemoralis c hortensis widespread common western central europe introduced north america influential model species ongoing studies genetics natural selection like many helicidae snails use love darts long time four species classified genus cepaea however molecular phylogenetic studies suggested two placed genera macularia caucasotachea immediate relatives either cepaea range c hortensis extends north c nemoralis scotland scandinavia one two species likewise swiss alps c hortensis found high c nemoralis conversely southern edge range lies north c hortensis unlike c nemoralis occur italy spain restricted distribution northeast ranges overlap c hortensis prefers cooler sites longer damper vegetation two species often cooccur site situation densities affect others growth fecundity mortality however differ somewhat behaviour c hortensis active lower temperatures aestivates higher vegetation diurnal although appears independent whether species present given choice partner laboratory two cepaea

around shell numbered larger numbers shell apex conventional scoring annotation write bands present separated replace number band absent usual position enclose numbers parentheses bands fused neighbours thus would mean top two bands absent lower two dominant allele one locus causes absence bands dominant allele another locus causes loss bands except band dominant allele third locus causes
