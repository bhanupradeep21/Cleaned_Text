fecal sludge management fsm faecal sludge management british english storage collection transport treatment safe end use disposal fecal together collection transport treatment end use fecal sludge constitute value chain service chain fecal sludge management fecal sludge defined broadly accumulates onsite sanitation systems eg pit latrines septic tanks containerbased solutions specifically transported sewer composed human excreta also anything else may go onsite containment technology flushwater cleansing materials eg toilet paper anal cleansing materials menstrual hygiene products grey water ie bathing kitchen water including fats oils grease solid waste fecal sludge removed septic tanks called septage estimated onethird worlds population served onsite sanitation lowincome countries less urban areas served lowincome countries majority fecal sludge discharged untreated urban environment placing huge burden public environmental health hence fsm plays critical role safely managed
