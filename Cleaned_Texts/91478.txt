major vector accord mechanism infection triatomine likes nests vertebrate animals shelter bites sucks blood food individual triatomines infected protozoa contact animals transmit trypanosomes triatomine deposits faeces hosts skin surface bites penetration infected faeces facilitated scratching bite area human animal host specific name cruzi honor brazilian scientist oswaldo cruz taught discoverer carlos trypanosoma cruzi life cycle starts animal reservoir usually mammals wild domestic including humans triatomine bug serves vector taking blood meal ingests cruzi triatomine bug triatoma infestans parasite goes epimastigote stage making possible reproduce reproducing binary fission epimastigotes move onto rectal cell wall become infectious infectious cruzi called metacyclic trypomastigotes triatomine bug subsequently takes blood meal host waste containing cruzi propagation stages parasites transmission route result trumper gorla find transmission success centers around triatomines defecation trypomastigotes feces capable swimming hosts cells using flagella characteristic swimming tail dominant euglenoid class trypomastigotes enter host bite wound crossing mucous membranes host cells contain macromolecules laminin thrombospondin heparin sulphate fibronectin cover macromolecules essential adhesion parasite host process host invasion parasite trypomastigotes must cross network proteins line exterior host cells order make contact invade host cells molecules proteins cytoskeleton cell also bind surface parasite initiate host trypanosomiasis humans progresses development trypanosome trypomastigote blood amastigote tissues infection progresses number infected cells increases well number amastigotes per infected cell apc average apc one close one infection begun higher apc means amastigotes started acute form trypanosomiasis usually unnoticed although may manifest localized swelling site entry form appears elevated parasitism myocarditis changes myocardial gene expression chronic form may develop years infection affect internal organs eg heart oesophagus colon peripheral nervous system affected people may die heart failure severe heart acute cases treated nifurtimox benznidazole effective therapy chronic cases currently knowncitation needed researchers chagas disease demonstrated several processes occur cardiomyopathies first event inflammatory response following inflammation cellular damage occurs finally bodys attempt recover cellular damage fibrosis begins cardiac another cardiomyopathy found nearly cases chronic chagas disease thromboembolic syndrome thromboembolism describes thrombosis formation clot main complication embolism carrying clot distal section vessel causing blockage occurrence contributes death patient four means arrhythmias stasis secondary cardiac dilation mural endocarditis cardiac fibrosis thrombi also affect organs brain spleen subcellular findings murine studies induced cruzi infection revealed chronic state associated persistent elevation phosphorylated activated extracellularsignalregulated kinase erk nfκb also mitotic regulator progression cyclin found activated although increase isoform erk increased concentration phosphorylated erk mice infected cruzi found within seven days concentration significantly higher mice compared control elevated levels nfκb also found myocardial tissue highest concentrations found vasculature indicated western blot cyclin upregulated day day postinfection also indicated immunohistochemical analysis areas produced cyclin vasculature interstitial regions conduction abnormalities also associated cruzi base conduction abnormalities depopulation parasympathetic neuronal endings heart without proper parasympathetic innervations one could expect find chronotropic also inotropic abnormalities true inflammatory noninflammatory heart disease may display forms parasympathetic denervation denervation presents descriptive fashion chagas disease also indicated loss parasympathetic innervations lead sudden death due severe cardiac failure occurs acute stage another conduction abnormality presented chronic chagas disease change ventricular repolarization represented electrocardiogram twave change repolarization inhibits heart relaxing properly entering diastole changes ventricular repolarization chagas disease likely due myocardial ischemia ischemia also lead fibrillation sign usually observed chronic chagas disease considered minor villous plaque characterized exophytic epicardial thickening meaning growth occurs border epicardium center mass unlike milk spots chagasic rosary inflammatory cells vasculature present villous plaque since villous plaque contains inflammatory cells reasonable suspect lesions recently formed milk spots chagasic mammalian cells present trypomastigotes move sub diffusive fashion short periods time control conditions motion diffusive parasites increase mean speed explore smaller areas short time scales show preference located nearby cells periphery extent changes depends cell type therefore cruzi trypomastigotes sense mammalian cells modify motility patterns prepare epimastigotes culture forms cruzi swim direction flagellum due tiptobase symmetrical flagellar beats interrupted basetotip highly asymmetric beats switching beating modes facilitates parasite reorientation allowing many movements trajectories epimastigote motility characterized alternation quasirectilinear restricted complex invasion efficiency positively correlated average parasite mean speed negatively correlated mean square displacement msd therefore motility modifications undergone parasites presence mammalian cells may functionally related cell invasion process moreover different parasite strains infect different tissues variable invasion efficiency due high genetic phenotypic variability found among cruzi strains cruzi trypomastigotes capable sensing mammalian cells different degree depending cell type modify motility patterns increase invasion cruzi produce prostaglandins instead pingefilho et al finds parasite induces mice overproduce prostaglandins immunosuppressive aid immune imipramines doyle weinbach find imipramine various derivatives trypanocidal find effective among cruzi transmission documented southwestern us warming trends may allow vector species move north

transplantation consumption uncooked food contaminated feces infected bugs accidental laboratory exposurecitation needed species transmit six taxonomic subunits incubation period five fourteen days host comes contact feces chagas disease undergoes two phases acute chronic phase acute phase last two weeks two months go unnoticed symptoms minor shortlived symptoms acute phase include swelling fever fatigue diarrhea chronic phase causes digestive problems constipation heart failure pain abdomencitation needed diagnostic methods include microscopic examination serology isolation parasite inoculating blood guinea pig mouse ratcitation needed vaccines available used method epidemiological management disease prevention resides within vector mainly use insecticides taking preventative measures applying bug repellent skin wearing protective clothing staying higher quality hotels traveling investing quality housing would ideal decrease risk contracting genetic exchange identified among field populations process appears involve genetic recombination well meiotic mechanism despite capability sexual reproduction natural populations cruzi exhibit clonal population structures appears frequent sexual reproduction events occur primarily close relatives resulting apparent clonal population httpsenwikipediaorgwikitrypanosomacruzi
