alien hand syndrome ahs dr strangelove category conditions person experiences limbs acting seemingly without conscious control variety clinical conditions fall category commonly affects left many similar terms various forms condition often used affected person may sometimes reach objects manipulate without wanting even point use controllable hand restrain alien normal circumstances however given intent action assumed deeply mutually entangled occurrence alien hand syndrome usefully conceptualized phenomenon reflecting functional disentanglement thought action alien hand syndrome best documented cases person two hemispheres brain surgically procedure sometimes used relieve symptoms extreme cases epilepsy epileptic psychosis eg temporal lobe epilepsy also occurs cases brain surgery stroke infection tumor aneurysm migraine specific degenerative brain conditions alzheimers disease corticobasal areas brain associated alien hand syndrome frontal occipital parietal medical alien behavior distinguished reflexive behavior former flexibly purposive latter obligatory sometimes affected person aware alien hand brought attention hand something draws attention behavior clear distinction behaviors two hands affected hand viewed wayward sometimes disobedient generally realm voluntary control unaffected hand normal volitional control times particularly patients sustained damage corpus callosum connects two cerebral hemispheres see also splitbrain hands appear acting opposition related syndrome described french neurologist fran√ßois lhermitte involves release disinhibition tendency compulsively utilize objects present surrounding environment around behavior patient sense obligatorily linked affordances using terminology introduced american ecological psychologist james j gibson presented objects located within immediate peripersonal environmentcitation needed condition known utilization behavior often associated extensive bilateral frontal lobe damage might actually thought bilateral alien hand syndrome patient compulsively directed external environmental contingencies presence hairbrush table front elicits act brushing hair capacity hold

ability act selfdirected manner becomes totally dependent upon surrounding environmental indicators guide behavior general social context condition referred environmental dependency order deal alien hand patients engage personification affected usually names negative nature mild cheeky malicious monster example rachelle doody jankovic described patient named alien hand baby joseph hand engaged playful troublesome activities pinching nipples akin biting nursing would experience amusement would instruct baby joseph stop furthermore bogen suggested certain personality characteristics flamboyant personality contribute frequent personification affected neuroimaging pathological research shows frontal lobe frontal variant corpus callosum callosal variant common anatomical lesions

intrahemispheric agency system potential capability acting autonomously control contralateral limb although unitary integrative control two hands maintained interhemispheric communication systems via projections traversing corpus callosum cortical level interhemispheric commissures linking two hemispheres subcortical levelcitation needed one major difference two hemispheres direct connection

frontal posterior components agency systems within particular hemisphere relevant specific form alien behavior developing limb contralateral damaged hemispherecitation needed damage corpus callosum give rise purposeful actions persons nondominant hand individual lefthemispheredominant experience left hand becoming alien right hand turn alien person righthemisphere dominancecitation needed callosal variant patients hand counteracts voluntary actions performed good hand two phenomena often found patients callosal alien hand agonistic dyspraxia diagonistic dyspraxiacitation needed agonistic dyspraxia involves compulsive automatic execution motor commands one hand patient asked perform movements hand example patient callosal damage instructed pull chair forward affected hand would decisively impulsively push chair agonistic dyspraxia thus viewed involuntary competitive interaction two hands directed toward completion desired act affected hand competes unaffected hand complete purposive act originally intended performed unaffected handcitation needed diagonistic dyspraxia hand involves conflict desired act unaffected hand engaged interfering action affected hand works oppose purpose desired act intended performed unaffected hand instance akelaitiss patients underwent surgery corpus callosum reduce epileptic seizures one patients left alien hand would frequently interfere right hand instance trying turn next page right hand left hand would try close another case callosal alien hand patient intermanual conflict hands rather symptom characterized involuntary mirror movements affected patient asked perform movements one hand hand would involuntarily perform mirror image movement continued even involuntary movement brought attention patient patient asked restrain mirrored movement patient ruptured aneurysm near anterior cerebral artery resulted right hand mirrored left hand patient described left hand frequently interfering taking anything patient tried right hand instance trying grasp glass water right hand right side approach left hand would involuntary reach grasp hold glass left side approachcitation needed recently geschwind et al described case woman severe coronary heart one week undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting noticed left hand started live life would unbutton gown try choke asleep would automatically fight right hand answer phone physically restrain affected hand right hand prevent injury behavior termed selfrestriction left hand also showed signs severe ideomotor apraxia able mimic actions help mirror movements executed right hand enabling synkinesis using magnetic resonance imaging mri geschwind et al found damage posterior half callosal body sparing anterior half splenium extending slightly white matter underlying right cingulate park et al also described two cases infarction origin alien hand symptoms individuals infarction anterior cerebral artery aca one individual male difficulty controlling hands often moved involuntarily despite trying stabilize furthermore often could let go objects grasping palms individual female aca different location artery complained left hand would move could control movements left hand could also sense right hand holding object would involuntarily forcibly take object right unilateral injury medial aspect brains frontal lobe trigger reaching grasping purposeful movements contralateral hand anteromedial frontal lobe injuries movements often exploratory reaching movements external objects frequently grasped utilized functionally without simultaneous perception part patient control object acquired maintained grasp frontal variant form alien hand patient often difficulty voluntarily releasing object grasp sometimes seen peeling fingers hand back grasped object using opposite controlled hand enable release grasped object also referred tonic grasping instinctive grasp example neurologist derek dennybrown referred behavior magnetic goldberg bloom described woman large cerebral infarction medial surface left frontal lobe territory left anterior cerebral artery left frontal variant alien hand involving right signs callosal disconnection evidence callosal damage patient displayed frequent grasp reflexes right hand would reach grab objects without releasing regards tonic grasping patient tried let go object grip object tightened focused effort patient able let go object distracted behaviour would recommence patient could also forcibly release grasped object peeling fingers away contact object using intact left hand additionally hand would scratch patients leg extent orthotic device required prevent another patient reported tonic grasping towards objects nearby alien hand would take hold patients penis engage public distinct posterior variant form alien hand syndrome associated damage posterolateral parietal lobe andor occipital lobe brain movements situation tend likely withdraw palmar surface hand away sustained environmental contact rather reaching grasp onto objects produce palmar tactile stimulation often seen frontal form condition frontal variant tactile contact ventral surface palm fingers facilitates finger flexion grasp object positive feedback loop ie stimulus generates movement reinforces strengthens sustains triggering stimulationcitation needed contrast posterior variant tactile contact ventral surface palm fingers actively avoided facilitation extension fingers withdrawal palm negative feedback loop ie stimulus even anticipation stimulation palmar surface hand generates movement palm fingers reduces effectively counteracts eliminates triggering stimulation case anticipated palmar contact decreases likelihood contact alien movements posterior variant syndrome also tend less coordinated show coarse ataxic motion active movement generally observed frontal form condition generally thought due optic form ataxia since facilitated visual presence object visual attention directed toward object apparent instability could due unstable interaction tactile avoidance tendency biasing toward withdrawal object visually based acquisition bias tendency pushing toward approach objectcitation needed alien limb posterior variant syndrome may seen levitate upward air withdrawing away contact surfaces activation antigravity musculature alien hand movement posterior variant may show typical posture sometimes referred parietal hand instinctive avoidance reaction term introduced neurologist derek dennybrown inverse form magnetic apraxia seen frontal variant noted digits move highly extended position active extension interphalangeal joints digits hyperextension metacarpophalangeal joints palmar surface hand actively pulled back away approaching objects away supporting surfaces alien movements however remain purposeful goaldirected point clearly differentiates movements disorganized nonpurposeful forms involuntary limb movement eg athetosis chorea myoclonuscitation needed frontal posterior variants alien hand syndrome patients reactions limbs apparent capability perform goaldirected actions independent conscious volition similar variants alien hand syndrome alien hand emerges hand contralateral damaged hemispherecitation needed cure alien hand however symptoms reduced managed degree keeping alien hand occupied involved task example giving object hold grasp specific learned tasks restore voluntary control hand significant degree one patient frontal form alien hand would reach grasp onto different objects eg door handles walking given cane hold alien hand walking even though really need cane usual purpose cane firmly grasp alien hand would generally release grasp drop cane order reach grasp onto different object techniques proven effective include wedging hand legs slapping warm water application visual tactile additionally wu et found irritating alarm activated biofeedback reduced time alien hand held object presence unilateral damage single cerebral hemisphere generally gradual reduction frequency alien behaviors observed time gradual restoration voluntary control affected hand actually ahs originates focal injury acute onset recovery usually occurs within one theory neuroplasticity bihemispheric subcortical brain systems involved voluntary movement production serve reestablish connection executive production process internal selfgeneration registration process exactly may occur well understood process gradual recovery alien hand syndrome damage confined single cerebral hemisphere instances patients may resort constraining wayward undesirable sometimes embarrassing actions impaired hand voluntarily grasping onto forearm impaired hand using intact hand observed behavior termed selfrestriction another approach patient trained perform specific task moving alien hand contact specific object highly salient environmental target movement patient learn generate voluntarily focused training order effectively override alien behavior possible training produces reorganization premotor systems within damaged hemisphere alternatively ipsilateral control limb intact hemisphere may expandedcitation needed another method involves simultaneously muffling action alien hand limiting sensory feedback coming back hand environmental contact placing restrictive cloak specialized soft foam hand orthosis alternatively everyday oven mitt patients reported using orthotic device restrict perseverative restraining alien hand securing bed course limit degree hand participate addressing functional goals patient may considered unjustifiable restraintcitation needed theoretically approach could slow process voluntary control hand restored neuroplasticity underlies recovery involves recurrent exercise voluntary control actions hand functional context associated experiential reinforcement successful willful suppression alien behaviorcitation needed first known case described medical literature appeared detailed case report published german preeminent german neuropsychiatrist kurt paper goldstein described righthanded woman stroke affecting left side partially recovered time seen however left arm seemed though belonged another person performed actions appeared occur independent patient complained feeling strangeness relationship goaldirected movements left hand insisted someone else moving left hand moving left hand grasped object could voluntarily release senses touch proprioception left side impaired left hand would make spontaneous movements wiping face rubbing eyes relatively infrequent significant effort able move left arm response spoken command conscious movements slower less precise similar involuntary goldstein developed
