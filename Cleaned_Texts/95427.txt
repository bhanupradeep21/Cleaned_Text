convallatoxin glycoside extracted convallaria majalis convallatoxin natural cardiac glycoside found among others plant lily valley convallaria majalis legend says apollo gave plant asclepios greek god lily valley indeed used medicinally treat going back medieval times convallatoxin similar therapeutic target effect digitalis used medieval herbalists substitute foxglove mostly administered strengthens heartbeat also slowing regulating heart lily valley used us television show breaking bad made plant compound convallatoxin quite well known general public systematic name organic compound convallatoxin follows shorter semisystematic iupac name structure convallatoxin consists strophanthidin group attached position convallatoxin donate hydrogen bond five places accept hydrogen bond ten melting point lies degrees celsius compound soluble alcohol acetone slightly chloroform ethyl acetate since convallatoxin structurally similar digoxin research done determine convallatoxin serum detected loci digoxin showed compound significant crossreactivity used antibody causes bidirectional interference digoxin assay convallatoxin indeed detected loci digoxin assay may also possible convallatoxin crossreacts antidigoxin antibody used commercially available digoxin assays investigated furthermore antigen digibind also bind convallatoxin vitro could possibly used treatment convallatoxin even though convallatoxin found nature also synthesized manufacturers done via koenigsknorr strophanthidin glycosylated two compounds precursors convallatoxin alkaline hydrolysis extraction strophanthidin residues crystallization isopropanol reaction product liberated reaction product convallatoxin using grams strophanthidin grams convallatoxin convallatoxin digitalis like compound dlc mainly used cardiac glycoside since inhibit nakatpase congestive heart failure causes inotropic many digitalis like compounds nakatpase creates ion gradient intra extracellular domains cell transporting three sodium ions two potassium ions nakatpase inhibited sodium accumulate cell preventing sodiumcalcium exchanger work diastole calcium accumulates cardiac myocytes uptake calcium sarcoplasmic reticulum sr increased thus stimulation cardiac muscle occurs sr releases higher levels calcium increases contractility increased release calcium also increases refractory period atrioventricular av node regulating heart beat cycle patients arrythmia lung colon breast cancer cells convallatoxin shows great effects nano shown inhibit cell proliferation invasion migration cancer cells underlying mechanisms fully known however demonstrated convallatoxin induces apoptosis autophagy dose nm per also shown inhibit angiogenesis autophagy apoptosis concentrations autophagy induced human cervical carcinoma cells hela cells convallatoxin blocking mtor signalling pathway signalling pathway usually inhibits autophagy cells convallatoxin induces apoptosis increasing parp cleavage proteins induce programmed cell death activated entirely clear induction apoptosis autophagy related inhibitory effects convallatoxin na katpase pump however dose nm convallatoxin reduce non small cell lung cancer cells inhibiting numbers differ per experiment colon cancer nm derived breast cancer cells dose nm long time exposure h show even longer time exposure h many potential therapeutic uses convallatoxin example cystic fibrosis neurodegenerative also demonstrated inhibit viral infection example convallatoxin used treatment human cytomegalovirus inhibit nakatpase pump decreases sodium concentration outside cell thus limiting cotransport methionine sodium cell disabling protein dose μm already great efficacy cytomegalovirus dose nm less great potency also shown last convallatoxin thus quite efficient drug showing effects small doses treatment multiple diseases excreted pglycoprotein affinity mm vmax mmol mgproteinmin determined excretion convallatoxin mainly kidneys clogp convallatoxin mainly metabolised liver conversion convallatoxin aldehyde cho group attached reduced alcohol group cytochrome reductase phase metabolism reaction however modification phase ii reaction convallatoxin reduction convallatoxin increases polarity thus enabling compound excreted readily form convallatoxin metabolism found rats however present guinea pigs traces convallatoxol found convallatoxin small therapeutic index nm ie margin narrow therapeutic dose overdose giving rise symptoms poisoning even cytotoxicity convallatoxin mainly timedependent increased plasma level dlcs including convallatoxin toxicity symptoms include dizziness fatigue nausea loss appetite vision disturbance vomiting hypertension arrythmia cardiac arrest coma abdominal pain convulsions heart failure certain animals convallatoxin quite interesting effects lifespan c elegans nematode expanded μm convallatoxin shows toxicity expand lifespan worm due certain mechanisms including improvement pharyngeal pumping locomotion reduced lipofuscin accumulation convallatoxin quite positive effects nematodes extra poisonous causes nephrotoxicity acute renal failure dose
