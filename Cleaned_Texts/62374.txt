scalp reconstruction surgical procedure people scalp defects scalp defects may partial full thickness congenital acquired layers scalp elastic scalp convex shape use primary closure limited sometimes easiest way closing wound may ideal best way choice reconstruction depends multiple factors defect patient characteristics surgeon preference skull brain surgery known prehistoric era evidence scalp reconstructions dating back egyptians bc roman empire word plastic surgery likely comes greek πλαστικός plastikós lit formable mouldable attempts made reconstruct damaged skulls despite minimal knowledge neurology anatomy brain skulls showing manipulation interpreted primitive form surgery found various eras around world medieval times people convinced trepanation remedy various diseasescitation needed main reasons scalp reconstruction divided two groups congenital acquired congenital defects may include aplasia cutis congenita congenital nevus congenital vascular malformations congenital tumors acquired defects caused burns blunt penetrating avulsion injuries tumor invasion infection oncologic resection radiation woundhealing alopecia aesthetic motivation hairbearing scalp incidence basalcell carcinoma squamouscell carcinoma rising located head neck area number scalp reconstructions likely increase future depending size nature defect appropriate reconstructive method used using mohs surgery defect kept minimal nevertheless infiltrative basalcell carcinoma may need remove large part scalpcitation needed flowchart simplified algorithm scalp reconstruction depicted options range simple solutions small skin defects complicated reconstructions requiring multitissue reconstructions active severe infection must controlled first surgical debridement antibiotic treatment reconstruction performed infection cause bacteraemia negative effect wound healing five layers scalp superficial deep memorized using mnemonic scalp skin scalp scientifically examined posterior scalp skin thickness temporal scalp anterior scalp thickness scalp contains approximately hairscitation needed hair lines make scalp reconstruction difficult hair lines must respected attain satisfying aesthetic subcutis layer fat enclosed compartments formed rigid fibrous septa inelasticity prevents bleeding vessels collapsing retracting skin achieve haemostasis large blood vessels nerves scalp located next layer galea aponeurotica separates underlying bone overlying layers large blood vessels nerves scalp pierce loose connective tissue periosteum aponeurosis makes two rigid structures easily slide contribute skin movement thus vascular nervous anatomy respected skin subcutaneous tissue galea aponeurotica lifted skull minimal bleeding nerve damage chance necrosis method first described orticochea updated minimize fifth layer periosteum skull also referred pericranium separated skull except near sutures skull consists inner outer table spongy bone known sides scalp five large arteries perfuse scalp local flaps used scalp reconstruction must contain least one major arteries maintain reliable blood supply scalp divided four different vascular territories veins anastomose frequently enter diploic veins skull bones dural sinuses extra difficulty vein pattern differs scalp veins accompany arteries similar names frontal part scalp drained parotid submandibular deep cervical lymph nodes posterior part drained posterior auricular occipital lymph nodes malignancies scalp metastasize lymph nodes brain tumors however tend metastasize haematogenously blood scalp innervated motor nerves sensory nerves trigeminal nerve cnv one important cranial sensory nerves innervates scalp anterior posterior front back nerves dural lesions closed avoid csf leakage also defect acts like port entry microorganisms cause meningitis fibrin glue primary closure possible patches used made cadaveric dura mater xenografts tachosil duragen durepair synthetic grafts materials ptfe neuropatch however vascularised autografts fascia lata muscle omentum majus preferred irradiated severely infected skull defects closed order protect brain occipital temporal regions bear pressure sleeping therefore need reconstructed frontal bone defects cause contour defect therefore aesthetic considerations often taken account reconstruct area midsagittal defects lower importance allow penetrating trauma reconstruction performed immediately wearing helmet advised skull deformities result high intracranial pressure cause complaints ranging headaches epilepsylike seizures small defects filled morcellized bone consolidate weeks anatomy skull external table split internal table moved defect rib grafts whether accompanied latissimus dorsi muscle suitable larger defects bear pressure cover whole defect implants used well preferred patients irradiated recently infection necrosis increased risk infection implants factorymade metal titanium synthetic materials pmma peek synthetic bodyown material hydroxylapatite pictures reconstruction using titanium plate shown skull contour restored periosteum underlying muscles frontalis occipitalis temporalis intact secondary closure granulation possible surgical intervention option available used treat robert mcgee needed considering modern aesthetic standards better option use splitthickness fullthickness skin grafts also quicker bulk needed better contour free flap used shown pictures regional skin defect exceed cm diameter closed primarily possible without tension surrounding loose connective tissue undermined attain different kinds transpositions close defect adjacent skin possible vy z pinwheel flaps advancement flaps orticochea flaps rotation flaps transpositions generate tension skin may distort hair lines combination orticochea rotation flaps illustrated pictures forehead defect another option secondary healing aesthetically inferior primary closure hair bearing areas resulting alopecia scalp closed primarily local reconstruction hair bearing skin needed hair lines tissue expansion hair bearing skin may possible expansion process uncomfortable short term longterm results good local reconstruction possible due lack local tissue regional reconstruction next rung reconstructive ladder includes pedicled flaps trapezius supraclavicular flap tissue expansion nearby regions alternatively crane principle described millard used healthy part used resurface defect flap takes skin returned original site leaving subcutaneous tissue defect needs split skin skin missing underlying galea muscle connective tissue intact skin graft used skin graft needs healthy vascularised tissue beneath take otherwise become necrotic free flaps usually best solution reconstruction large defects closed locally unfavourable wound conditions severe infection exposed sinuses dura brain tissue csf leakage radiation damage method complex reconstructive ladder scalp reconstruction free flaps great benefit completely detached original location donor site transferral scalp makes inset easier pedicled flaps another advantage free flaps provide robust vascular supply wound compared pedicled flaps controlling infection radiation induced damage addition muscle myocutaneous free flaps provide additional bulk obliterates empty spaces eg exposed sinuses covers dura mater defects options reducing postoperative wound infections csf leakages disadvantages complexity operation leading prolonged operation times need specialised personnel chance total flap necrosis due microvascular complications another challenge use free flaps achieve aesthetically pleasing result good color contour match especially defect incidence basal cell carcinoma squamouscell carcinoma rises need reconstructions radical excision skin malignancies reconstructive options depend location size time problem solved one operation small adjustments necessary good aesthetic results postoperative treatment modalities radiation therapy chemotherapy may impact final resultcitation needed temporal forehead defects offer difficult aesthetic challenge best covered thin flap aesthetic unit appears equal although forehead highly important aesthetic unit color mismatch bulkiness draw attention quickly free flap reconstruction forehead bulky color match variable depends ethnic genetic background people satisfied outcome may experience psychological problems low selfconfidence even depression sometimes second operation needed improve skin color overgrafting skin skin grafts scalp improve color matchcitation needed postoperative complications divided donorsite recipientsite problems donorsite complications include wound infection hematoma seroma recipientsite complications include total partial flap necrosis wound infection dehiscence hematoma skin graft failure avoid major bleeding sensibility disorders anatomy scalp must respected making incisions parallel rather across blood vessels due rich perfusion scalp injuries lead serious bleeding may difficult stem cut blood vessels retract httpsenwikipediaorgwikiscalpreconstruction
