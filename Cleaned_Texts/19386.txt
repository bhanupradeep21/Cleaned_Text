paraphysornis extinct genus giant flightless terror birds inhabited brazil late oligocene early miocene although tallest phorusrhacid paraphysornis notably robust bird short robust tarsal bones suited pursuit hunting holotype known fossil discovered mining company taubaté basin são paulo state layer bentonite clay two three meters layer pyrobitumen sediments belong late oligocene early miocene tremembé formation excavation bones took several months yielding nearly complete skeleton lacking cranium pelvis sternum bones initially studied herculano alvarenga first described species following closer examination various phorusrhacid remains held institutions across europe north america argentina alvarenga came conclusion taxon displays enough unique features warrant new genus distinct physornis naming paraphysornis publication name combination genus name physornis greek suffix para combination meaning close species name brasiliensis coined initial description reflects animals country origin mandible well preserved slightly distorted convex lower margin concave cutting surface preserving signs longitudinal crest seen phorusrhacos mandible also wider higher phorusrhacos better developed retroarticular process elongated foramina mandible cm long mm high base mandibular symphysis elements cranium preserved including quadrates articulation mandible well front premaxilla shows strongly hooked tip known vertebral column well preserved shows presence thirteen cervical vertebrae displaying strong curvature kyphosis cervicals one five less developed curvature lordosis cervicals eight twelve sections articulating almost straight gives animals neck traditional avian scurve atlas axis resemble mesembriornis general shape atlas taller narrower psilopterus following cervical series five thoracic dorsal vertebrae followed integrated poorly preserved pelvic region may represent sacral vertebra least first dorsal vertebrae possess neural spines high psilopterus andalgalornis pelvis poorly preserved give idea morphology however anterior superior portions present preserve iliac crest appears similar psilopterus mesembriornis ribs preserved appear robust preserved bone shoulder girdle left coracoid well preserved quite robust triangular crosssection lower half cylindrical crosssection despite absence preserved sternum clues anatomy gathered bones would articulate specifically sternal rib coracoid show large articular surfaces indicating sternum well developed almost entire left wing preserved elements also present right side skeleton like flightless birds wings heavily reduced evenmore phorusrhacids humerus heavily curved shaft almost elliptical shape possesses rugose ridge towards central third serves anchor point tensor muscle patagium humeral head swollen almost triangular shape differing significantly round head extant seriemas ulna preserved excellent condition notably atrophied mesembriornis radius partly preserved shows elliptical shaft turned towards ulna unlike phorusrhacids paraphysornis preserves indication quill knobs attachment points strong pennacious feathers evidence absence pennaceous feathers indicates strongly anchored members femur preserves proximal distal ends missing shaft making impossible determine exact length bone however estimates based proportions brontornis might indicate length cm tibiotarsus long straight robust tarsometatarsus notably short half length resembles condition seen brontornis paraphysornis would stood around ft tall weight kilograms lb calculated animal comparing girth leg bones large male ostrich kilograms another estimate molinapérez larramendi puts paraphysornis weight kilograms paraphysornis shares several characteristics brontornis including shortend tarsometatarsus half length tibiotarsus morphology vertebrae however two genera also differ significantly size phalanges paraphysornis less flattened claws toes sharper condyles tibiotarsus run parallel axis shaft medial condyle brontornis angled similar due shared features paraphysornis traditionally considered member brontornithinae alongside brontornis however nature clade come question researchers arguing brontornis fact represent phorusrhacid may instead gastornithiform although matter debated agnolin proposed name physornithinae clade containing physornis following phylogenetic tree shows internal relationships phorusrhacidae exclusion brontornis published degrange colleagues recovers paraphysornis basal clade contains physornis phorusrhacos andalgalornis among cariamidae mesembriornis incertus mesembriornis milneedwardsi llallawavis scagliai procariama simplex psilopterus affinis psilopterus bachmanni psilopterus colzecus psilopterus lemoinei kelenken guillermoi devincenzia pozzi titanis walleri paraphysornis brasiliensis andrewsornis abbotti andalgalornis steulleti patagornis marshi phorusrhacos longissimus physornis fortis birds ability run proportional ratio tarsometatarsus tibiotarsus length paraphysornis tarsometatarsus half length tibiotarsus used infer relatively slow speed matching animals increased bodymass method storer works similar manner determining locomotion style according lengths two bones addition femur length method highly dependent preservation applying method likewise gives results suggesting heavyset graviportal animal calculated values similar moas elephant however according recent calculations rubén molinapérez asier larramendi paraphysornis may still capable reaching speeds kilometres per hour anatomy mandible shape claws clearly suggest bird carnivore like alvarenga suggested paraphysornis heavy stature might mean paraphysornis however line studies regarding scavenging adaptations suggest scavengers exist adaptations energyefficient travel long distances impossible heavy flightless bird thus reasonable assume paraphysornis active predator like relatives leaning towards ambushing prey
