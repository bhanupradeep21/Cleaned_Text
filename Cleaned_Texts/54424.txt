prozostrodon extinct genus probainognathian cynodonts closely related ancestors mammals remains found brazil dated carnian age late triassic holotype estimated skull length centimetres indicating whole animal may size cat teeth typical advanced cynodonts animal probably carnivore hunting reptiles small prozostrodon brasiliensis originally described species thrinaxodon paper mário c barberena josé f bonaparte sá holotype includes wellpreserved skull preserving front half cranium mostly complete lower jaw teeth missing braincase sagittal crest zygomatic arches also preserves multiple

redescription bonaparte barberena indicated brasiliensis indeed closely related mammals thrinaxodon species result reclassified new genus prozostrodon generic name references welldeveloped cingulum lower postcanines derived greek word zoster meaning girdle band latin prefix pro meaning histological analysis found holotype represents subadult bones still growing second specimen cappaufsm described marchezan locality municipality são joão polêsine consists right dentary bone preserving three postcanine teeth small size lack diastema behind canine specimen thought third specimen described faixa nova locality consisting front part cranium fragments right dentary specimen notably preserves natural endocast nasal nearly complete skull cappaufsm described marchezan locality unlike known specimens preserves back portion skull including holotype estimated skull length centimetres prozostrodon considerably larger prozostrodontians alemoatherium therioherpeton snout tip premaxilla bore narial process connected nasal bone back premaxilla thin posterodorsal process wedged septomaxilla maxilla eye socket orbit prozostrodon retained small prefrontal postorbital bones unlike prozostrodontians bones completely absent postorbital bar divided eye socket temporal fenestra earlier cynodonts missing prozostrodon prozostrodontians within eye socket broad contact frontal palatine orbitosphenoid bones small hole called sphenopalatine foramen present within eye socket prozostrodontians prozostrodon foramen completely enclosed palatine bone unlike later prozostrodontians like brasilodon morganucodon foramen bordered orbitosphenoid secondary hard palate extended slightly behind last postcanine tooth lingual inner side upper postcanines deep groove lower teeth would fit mouth lower jaw consisted primarily dentary bone dentary fairly robust upturned tip symphysis joint two halves dentary unfused basal probainognathians generally fused symphysis unfused symphysis one main synapomorphies shared derived features prozostrodontia rear end dentary behind tooth row somewhat tall broad coronoid process extended upwards behind coronoid process backwardspointing projection called articular process modern mammals articular process bears dentary condyle articulates squamosal bone cranium condyle absent prozostrodon lingual side dentary meckelian groove stretched near symphysis rear part like cynodonts prozostrodon heterodont dentition divided incisors canines postcanines cheek teeth four pairs incisors upper lower lower incisors somewhat procumbent forwardspointing recurved tips decreased size back mouth conversely upper incisors backwardspointing increased size back canines large lower one fine serrations back cynodonts postcanines bore multiple cusps prozostrodon placed straight line consisted large central cusp cusp upper teeth cusp lower ones smaller front cusp cusp b b front central cusp small rear cusp cusp c c behind central cusp cusp cc often followed even smaller cusp dd postcanines also bore shelflike feature called cingulum parallel main cusps roots postcanines incipiently divided groove ran lengthwise prozostrodon appears ten lower postcanines lower postcanines divided two main shapes located front back respectively first shape simple type large cusp significantly smaller cusps b c sometimes small cusp behind cusp c teeth type cingulum poorly developed absent second postcanine shape complex type relatively smaller cusp larger cusps b c teeth also welldeveloped cingulum lingual side could bear nine distinct cusps holotype first five postcanines simple type last four inferred complex type third transitional type similar cusp proportions first type cingulum like second found sixth postcanine holotype juvenile specimen cappaufsm preserves fourth fifth sixth postcanines fourth tooth first simple type unlike holotype fifth sixth postcanines second complex type closely resembling seventh eighth postcanines holotype indicates juveniles complex anterior postcanines adults replaced simpler teeth growth simultaneously eruption additional complex postcanines back ever since genus named
