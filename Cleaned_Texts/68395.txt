jeffrey connor hall born may american geneticist chronobiologist hall professor emeritus biology brandeis currently resides cambridge maine hall spent career examining neurological component fly courtship behavioral rhythms research neurology behavior drosophila melanogaster hall uncovered essential mechanisms circadian clocks shed light foundations sexual differentiation nervous system elected national academy sciences revolutionary work field chronobiology nominated washington along michael w young michael rosbash awarded nobel prize physiology medicine discoveries molecular mechanisms controlling circadian jeffrey hall born brooklyn new york raised suburbs washington dc father worked reporter associated press covering us senate halls father joseph w greatly influenced especially encouraging hall stay updated recent events daily newspaper hall attended walter johnson high school bethesda maryland graduating good high school student hall planned pursue career medicine hall began pursuing bachelors degree amherst college however time undergraduate student hall found passion senior project gain experience formal research hall began working philip ives hall reported ives one influential people encountered formative hall became fascinated study drosophila working ives lab passion permeated research supervision ives hall studied recombination translocation induction drosophila success halls research pursuits prompted department faculty recommend hall pursue graduate school university washington seattle entire department devoted hall began working lawrence sandlers laboratory graduate school hall worked sandler analyzing agedependent enzyme changes drosophila concentration genetic control chromosome behavior meiosis hershel roman encouraged hall pursue postdoctoral work seymour benzer pioneer forward genetics california institute interview hall regarded roman influential figure early career roman fostered camaraderie laboratory guided nascent upon completing doctoral work hall joined benzers laboratory benzers lab hall worked doug kankel taught hall drosophila neuroanatomy neurochemistry although hall kankel made great progress two projects hall left benzers laboratory publishing results halls third year postdoctoral researcher roman contacted hall regarding faculty positions roman advocated hall hall joined brandeis university assistant professor biology known eccentric lecturing styleaccording time working field chronobiology hall faced many challenges attempting establish findings specifically genetic approach biological clocks see period gene section easily accepted traditional chronobiologists conducting research particular topic hall faced skepticism trying establish importance sequence amino acids isolated working project researcher working similar project michael hall faced hurdles attempting establish work also found politics research funding frustrating fact challenges one primary reasons left field felt hierarchy entry expectations biology preventing researchers pursuing research desire hall believed focus individuals research funding limiting factor scientist instead give flexibility pursue new interests hypotheses hall expressed loves research flies yet feels bureaucracy involved process prevented excelling making new strides halls work drosophila courtship behavior began collaborative work kankel correlate courtship behaviors genetic sex various regions nervous systems using fruit fly sex mosaics last months postdoctoral years benzers laboratory work triggered interest neurogenetics drosophila courtship led subsequent career path investigation drosophila late collaborative work florian von schilcher hall successfully identified nervous system regions drosophila contributed regulation males courtship hall realized study courtship singing behavior one elegantly quantifiable features courtship decided study topic subsequent research postdoctoral fellow lab bambos kyriacou hall discovered drosophila courtship song produced rhythmically normal period one suspecting period mutation abnormal sleepwake ron konopka late also alter courtship song cycles hall kyriacou tested effect mutations period courtship found period mutations affected courtship song way changed circadian rhythms pers allele produced shorter approximately second oscillation perl allele produced longer approximately second oscillation pero produced song regular research hall mainly focused flies fruitless gene began studying postdoctoral years fruitless fru mutant behaviorally sterile furthermore indiscriminately courted females males try mate either behavior identified neglected halls group began investigate topic collaborative work bruce baker stanford university barbara taylor stanford university hall successfully cloned fruitless subsequent research cloned fruitless hall confirmed previously suspected role fruitless master regulator gene courtship examining several fru mutations hall discovered males performed little courtship toward females failed produce pulse song component courtship song never attempted copulation exhibited increased intermale courtship absence frum hall worked primarily drosophila study mechanism circadian rhythms rather using traditional method measuring eclosion hall measured locomotor activity drosophila observe circadian collaboration michael rosbash paul hardin hall discovered period protein per played role suppressing transcription exact role per unknown hall rosbash hardin able develop negative transcriptiontranslation feedback loop model ttfl serves central mechanism circadian clock drosophila original model per expression led increase per certain concentration per expression per decreased causing per levels decrease allowing per hall part group susan renn jae park michael rosbash paul taghert discovered genes part ttfl expressed cells throughout body despite genes identified necessary genes circadian clock variety levels expressions various parts body variation observed cellular level hall succeeded entraining separate tissues different lightdark cycles time hall didnt discover element synchronizes cells found pigment dispersing factor protein pdf helps control circadian rhythms turn locomotor activity genes cells localized small ventral lateral neurons slnvs drosophila brain data hall concluded slnvs serve primary oscillator drosophila pdf allows synchrony cells awarded nobel prize medicine hall contributed two discoveries drosophila refined ttfl model first discovery involved role cryptochrome cry plays entrainment hall found cry key photoreceptor entrainment regulation locomotor hypothesized cry may input circadian system also role pacemaker year hall discovered drosophila per timeless tim circadian genes regulated hall discovered clock cycle cyc proteins form heterodimer via pas domain upon dimerizing two proteins bind e box promoter element two genes via bhlh domain induce expression per tim
