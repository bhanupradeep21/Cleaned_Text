peripheral mononeuropathy nerve related disease single nerve used transport messages brain peripheral body diseased peripheral neuropathy general term indicates disorder peripheral nervous name disorder broken order understand better peripheral regard peripheral neuropathy refers outside brain spinal cord neuro means nerve related pathy means peripheral mononeuropathy disorder links peripheral neuropathy effects single peripheral nerve rather several damaged diseased nerves throughout healthy peripheral nerves able carry messages brain spinal cord muscles organs body tissues peripheral neuropathy mononeuropathy common neurological disorders diverse range variables causes conclude neuropathy three subclassifications mononeuropathy result entrapped traumatised nerve nerve area mononeuropathy multiplex linked chronic diseases like leprosy polyneuropathy outcome systemic metabolic toxic signs symptoms peripheral mononeuropathy neuropathy vary result types individual andor nerve areas affected three types nerve damage including motor nerve damage sensory nerve damage autonomic nerve sensory motor autonomic fibres make peripheral nerves specific functions means involvement neuropathic disorders lead diverse symptoms signs electrodiagnostic edx features focus symptoms valuable understanding diagnosing varied cases peripheral neuropathy usually correlated muscle weakness symptoms include painful cramps fasciculations uncontrolled muscle twitching visible skin muscle shrinking motor symptoms usually aided mechanical aids hand foot braces orthopaedic shoes splints severe cases procedures tendon transfers bone fusions take aids procedures reduce physical disability pain pressured compressed nerves broader category sensory nerves broader function range therefore deviations symptoms order assist improve sensory nerve damage difficult maintain without medication patients adopt behavioural strategies order manage chronic pain along emotional discrepancies may follow nerve injury national institute neurological disorders affects axons smallfibre neuropathies excess sweating heat intolerance unstable blood pressure gastrointestinal abnormalities symptoms linked autonomic nerve peripheral neuropathic mononeuropathic disorders stem autonomic nerve damage include diabetes guillainbarre syndrome carpal tunnel syndrome meralgia parestheticaand complex regional pain improve autonomic nerve damage symptoms patients use complementary methods well medical management methods include therapies acupuncture massages herbal medications much mononeuropathy refers single peripheral nerve involvement usually occurs due trauma compression entrapment isolated situations like pregnancy thyroid disease ones occupation desk work intense physical labour lead mononeuropathy result entrapped nerve peripheral neuropathy mononeuropathy result variety factors result one three methods clinical presentation chronic nerve entrapment multiplex diabetes mellitus multifocal motor neuropathy vasculitis syndromes chronic acquired immunodeficiency syndrome leprosy sarcoidosis autonomic features amyloidosis chemotherapyrelated neuropathy diabetes heavy metal toxicity paraneoplastic syndrome porphyria primary dysautonomia vitamin deficiency neuropathy amyloidosis chemotherapy heavy metal toxicity diabetes idiopathic polyneuropathy porphyria due fact symptoms peripheral mononeuropathy neuropathy diverse means diagnosis neuropathies often difficult therefore require medical testing ensure appropriate diagnosing neuropathic disorders often includes peripheral mononeuropathy complex sense diagnoses treated numerous ways diversity symptoms therefore treating peripheral mononeuropathy depends nerve area damaged patient symptoms general maintainable advice treating peripheral neuropathy mononeuropathy would lead balanced healthy lifestyle without good nutrition exercise avoiding mass exposure toxins balanced intake absorption vitamins minerals reducing one alcoholic smoking although peripheral mononeuropathy scientifically reached point symptoms effects reversed patients use medications therapies clinical trials alternative medicines lifestyle changes home remedies order stop slow prevent occurrence peripheral mononeuropathy examples might include testing medications therapies alternative medicine lifestyle home remedies due broad range variation researchers experimenting different treatments peripheral mononeuropathy treating lab rats preventative post medications treatments researcher claudia sommer et al provided study experiments antitnfneutralizing antibodies order reduce painrelated behaviour two different mouse models painful mononeuropathy tnf tumour necrosis factor mediator inflammatory neuropathic pain testing different variants set test rats sommer et al concludes degree endoneurial damage effect tnfab behavioural tests identical two models antihyperalgesic action tnf nerve injury thus independent epineurial inflammation consistent observations others us increase tnf nerve injury mostly due increased synthesis schwann cells inhibition tnf abs effective thermal hyperalgesia already present peak tnf release h nerve mechanical thresholds however influenced prophylactic administration ab may reflect different fibre populations involved greater impact central sensitization mechanical allodynia interestingly mice deficient tnf receptor develop mechanical allodynia cci chronic constrictive injury thermal hyperalgesia indicating greater influence endogenous tnf thermal mechanical thresholds another study jianren mao et al examined intrathecal treatment dextrorphan ketamine potently reduces painrelated behaviours rat model peripheral mononeuropathy mao understands experimental neuropathic pain syndrome seen cci rats similar many respects neuropathic pain syndrome seen man mao et al concludes mechanisms dextrorphan ketamine induced attenuation nociceptive behaviours cci rats likely related effects nmda nmethyldaspartate receptormediated central nervous system excitability may occur following peripheral nerve injury dextrorphan ketamine noncompetitive nmda receptor antagonists shown reduce excitatory amino acidmediated neurotoxicity since cci produces central nervous system hyperexcitability mediated spinal cord nmda nonnmda receptor activation subsequent intracellular processes therapeutic effects dextrorphan ketamine neuropathic pain behaviours may related ability reduce spinal cord nmda receptor activation following either multiple single treatment compounds since peripheral anaesthesia injured sciatic nerve development painrelated behaviours also found attenuate thermal hyperalgesia cci rats dextrorphan ketamine treatment alone combination local nerve anaesthesia may prove useful therapeutic means clinical management neuropathic pain syndromes third research experiment presented article patrick dougherty et al commentary differential influence local anaesthetic upon two models experimentally induced peripheral mononeuropathy rat dougherty exposes two types peripheral mononeuropathies discovered amongst
