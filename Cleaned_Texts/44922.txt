bone healing fracture healing proliferative physiological process body facilitates repair bone fracture generally bone fracture treatment consists doctor reducing pushing displaced bones back place via relocation without anaesthetic stabilizing position aid union waiting bones natural healing process occur adequate nutrient intake found significantly affect integrity fracture age bone type drug
