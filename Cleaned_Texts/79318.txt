integrin protein humans encoded subunit integrin integrins αβ heterodimeric glycoproteins span cell membrane integrating outside inside cell integrins bind specific extracellular proteins extracellular matrix cells subsequently transduce signals intracellularly affect cell behaviour one α one β subunit associate noncovalently form unique integrins found β integrin subunits partner multiple α subunits associates exclusively αv subunit thus function entirely associated integrin subunit sequence discovered professor dean sheppard colleagues university california san francisco early guinea pig investigation research groups university madrid university auckland found located chromosome position past decade significant research performed toward identifying location regions within gene promote suppress expression note binding regions transcription factors cebpα found basic normal cell expression thought regulated primarily transcription factors also shown increase binding able decrease also known expression regulated epigenetically via histone also known expression regulated posttranscriptionally mrna characteristically weak meaning less likely translated strong mrna protein binds weak mrna upregulate translation disruption expression results significantly reduced expression first mouse model developed mice grew normally difference wound healing ability however significant amount inflammation skin lungs observation eventually leading discovery activates mice similar phenotype deficient mice mice also developed temporary baldness possibly due role plays hair follicle regeneration tgfβ mice many similar characteristics deficient mice suffer poorer health symptoms observed mice still activated proteins doublenull mice higher incidence

metallopeptidase enzyme strongly associated development emphysema expressed higher compared normal mice alveolar macrophages mice also abnormally large alveoli worsened mice aged another consistent observation mice expressed junctional epithelium gums involved adhesion gingiva teeth incomplete adhesion gums teeth cause pockets form prone infection resulting chronic periodontal mice also develop

fibroblasts called cancer associated immune epithelialtomesenchymal transition emt process epithelial cells adopt mesenchymal phenotype breaking away neighbouring epithelial cells becoming migratory
