supersaurus meaning super lizard genus diplodocid sauropod dinosaur lived north america late jurassic period type species vivianae first discovered vivian jones delta colorado middle morrison formation colorado fossil remains came brushy basin member formation dating million years large sauropod wdc byu specimens reaching metres ft length approximately metric tons short tons body mass potential second species lourinhanensis dinheirosaurus known portugal dated similar supersaurus present stratigraphic zone morrison dating original fossil remains supersaurus discovered dry mesa quarry find yielded bones mainly shoulder girdle ischium tail vertebrae paleontologist james jensen described supersaurus designated scapulocoracoid byu originally labeled byu type specimen shoulder girdle stood meters ft tall placed end specimen given name supersaurus informally early officially described named decade later sauropod researcher jack mcintosh one time thought byu supersaurus material might represent large species barosaurus later felt evidence supersaurus valid much complete specimen wdc found converse county wyoming brandon flyr bart lesco hiking reported people owned land time discovery later named jimbo family purchased land described assigned supersaurus specimen represented approximately skeleton bones held wyoming dinosaur center comparison wdc specimens previously assigned supersaurus done order help decide material dry mesa quarry belonged genus indicated series tail vertebrae ulna may belonged jensen described original supersaurus specimen simultaneously reported discovery another gigantic sauropod would later named ultrasaurus later renamed ultrasauros macintoshi type specimen specimen used define new species ultrasauros backbone dorsal vertebra labeled byu later found come supersaurus fact probably belonged original supersaurus specimen discovered quarry therefore ultrasauros became junior synonym supersaurus named first thus retains priority name ultrasauros bones found location originally thought belong ultrasauros like shoulder girdle scapulocoracoid byu actually belonged brachiosaurus possibly large specimen brachiosaurus brachiosaurus bones indicate large recordbreaking individual little larger brachiosaurus brancai giraffatitan brancai mount berlins natural history originally supersaurus brachiosaurus bones believed represent single dinosaur estimated reach meters ft long meters ft high shoulder meters ft total height weighing maybe metric tons short tons time mass estimates ranged placed category blue whale equally problematic bruhathkayosaurus naming chimeric ultrasauros similarly complicated history ultrasaurus final u original choice widely used media discovery however name new species must published description become jim jensen published discovery another paleontologist kim haang mook used name ultrasaurus publication describe believed giant dinosaur south korea different much smaller dinosaur jensens find kim thought represented similarly gigantic animal confused humerus ulna logic naming incorrect ultrasaurus kims find fulfilled requirements naming became regarded legitimate dubious thus jensen publish ultrasaurus find kims use retained official priority name jensen forced choose new name technical terms original choice preoccupied kims sauropod suggestion george olshevsky changed one letter renamed jensens sauropod ultrasauros final later discovered new name referred bones two separate already known species name ultrasauros considered invalid became junior synonym supersaurus since bones brachiosaurus used secondary reference new species ultrasauros junior synonym brachiosaurus name supersaurus kept instead ultrasaurus animal diplodocid ultrasaurus always referred another diplodocid dinosaur found near original supersaurus quarry known backbone dorsal vertebra type specimen byu named dystylosaurus edwini also considered specimen supersaurus vivianae hence dystylosaurus also become junior synonym supersaurus among largest dinosaurs known good remains wdc byu specimens reaching meters ft length approximately metric tons short tons body larger specimen indicating body length metres ft described first described specimens supersaurus individual bones suggested large diplodocid large cervical vertebra byu quarry later assigned vertebra measures ft length longest cervical enormous vertebra reclassified barosaurus vertebra mike taylor matt however brian curtice reassigned supersaurus basis additional assignment complete specimen wdc supersaurus suggests respects similar anatomy apatosaurus less robustly built especially elongated cervical vertebrae resulting one longest known sauropod studies diplodocid relationships found contain two primary subgroups diplodocinae containing diplodocids closely related diplodocus apatosaurus apatosaurinae diplodocids closely related apatosaurus diplodocus originally thought supersaurus related longnecked diplodocid barosaurus therefore member subfamily diplodocinae however assignment complete wdc later studies found supersaurus close relative familiar apatosaurus group however later studies cast doubt paradigm one comprehensive study diplodocoid relationships published whitlock found apatosaurus lie base diplodocid family tree apatosaurines including supersaurus progressively closely related diplodocus making specimen level phylogenetic study diplodocids found dinheirosaurus lourinhanensis grouped supersaurus study considered new species supersaurus new combination
