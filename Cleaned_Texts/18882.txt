herbivorous thulborn proposed tusks dinosaur played important role feeding rather would used combat conspecifics display visual threat active defence similar functions seen enlarged tusks modern

much controversy surrounded question whether degree heterodontosaurus showed continuous tooth replacement typical dinosaurs reptiles thulborn found skulls known time lacked indications continuous tooth replacement cheek teeth known skulls worn uniformly indicating formed simultaneously newly erupted teeth absent evidence derived wear facets teeth formed toothtotooth contact lower upper

dinosaurs fabrosaurus back forth movements possible teeth worn uniformly strengthening case lack continuous tooth replacement simultaneously thulborn stressed regular tooth replacement essential animals supposed diet consisting tough plant material would led quick abrasion teeth observations led thulborn conclude heterodontosaurus must replaced entire set teeth regular basis complete
