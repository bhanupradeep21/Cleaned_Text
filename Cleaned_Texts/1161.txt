prismatic adaptation pa alongside rehabilitation findings dyschiria complexly align cases studying syndromes spatial neglect related disorders published medical literature early dr ernest jones proposed three stages dyschiria mental syndrome jones studied initial case achiria alongside phenomena allochiria perceived french psychologist pierre janet austrian neurologist heinrich obersteiner independent cases defined dyschiric syndrome redefined allochiria century onwards dyschiria replaced unilateral neglect hemispatial neglect related neurological disorders unilateral neglect replaced dyschiria following austrian neurologist marcel kinsbournes publication model mechanisms unilateral spatial neglect study greater theoretical influence previous experiments neglect disorders become

intensity stimulation possible patient exclusion side stimulus sensations tactile carried patients motor deficits unless limb specified without left right descriptions involuntary habitual movements limb reflex mechanisms performed regular despite functioning limb becomes imprecise conscious directed effort required patients experiencing achiria lost memory feeling affected body part regardless ability recognize existence experience closely associated attitude depersonalization felt patients severe forms hysterical senses categorized two types memoryfocused memoryfocused senses obtained previous experiences eg knowing difference left right aesthesic senses obtained ongoing experiences eg smell touch senses damaged functional disorders however time taken recovery reacquisition senses differ among two groups recovery functional disorders aesthesic senses usually recover quicker memoryfocused senses dr ernest jones described variation paradoxical cleavage theorized cause achiria earlier recovery tactile sensations relative recognition left right sides underscores achiric able recognize precise location stimulus corresponding position contralateral side body referred allochiria location stimulus pointed corresponding opposite half body done exact patients asked carry motor responses affected limb instantly direct movement opposite limb full conviction confusions occur bilateral allochiria however affected limb directed using opposite direction ie using right hand requires term left used loses physiological function unilateral allochiria allochiric patients full ability feel affected limb unilateral senses affected limb felt opposite side rarely correct half body directed movement patients may feel dead limb active limb unaffected side body affected half seldom felt often patients feel one limb pair unaffected side bilateral allochiric patients mental capacity feel limbs sides body asymmetrically commanded tactile allochiria present individuals damage central nervous study found patients cerebral hemorrhage unable correctly localize tactile stimulation pinched arms incorrectly localized corresponding area opposite arm result obtained participants exposed forms tactile stimulation eg exposure arm coldhot objects vibration brain lesions forms brain damage often caused strokes lead neglect ones contralesional space information left right egocentric spaces principally understood neurons right parietal cortex right region also weakly managed neurons left parietal damage right parietal cortex thus severe solely maintains attention towards left makes neglect left space prevalent mitigating component neglect caused lesion undermine detection tactile sensations however hinders tactile localization stimulated touch contralesional arm touch detected however location contact transposed patient ipsilesional arm contralesional space recognition stimulus corresponding sides body two concurrent sensations applied one affected part known synchiria terms motor response patient carries movement sides body simultaneously even asked conduct motion affected side movement felt affected side patients introspectively patient impression moving affected limb unable differentiate two halves body according dr ernest jones patients could feel affected side displaced shifting two halves median plane body presence synchiria attributed brain lesions study patient brain lesion left hemisphere showed detection touch possible lacking accurate identification point contact specifically claimed experienced tactile sensation left ipsilesional right contralesional hands left hand stimulated suggested two pathways somatosensory activity first contralateral pathway hemisphere receives sensory information transmits motor information opposite egocentric spaces ie left side body right second ipsilateral pathway allows transmission information along side body ie left side body left healthy individual hand stimulated touch increased brain activity contralateral hemisphere decreased activity ipsilateral suggests presence mechanisms inhibit hemispheres processing ipsilateral sensations inhibition necessary discriminate points contact absence damage inhibition theorized result exhibition synchiria despite one tactile stimulation sensory information processed hemispheres hinders ones ability localize touch one hand instead results feeling sensation treatment established entirely effective patients dyschiria related neglect disorders functioning mechanisms syndromes varied therapeutic options
