juvenile c bohemicus pineal opening closed adult unknown c florensis pineal opening based fossil evidence related temnospondyl taxa believed cochleosaurus species likely covered small densely packed scales larger scales ventral plates however confirmed fossil evidence cochleosaurus soft tissues like temnospondyls cochleosaurus species narrow rounded snout eyes positioned top single meckelian fenestra adult specimens c adult skulls c bohemicus c florensis similar ratios index skull lengths width skull table width orbital bones c florensis however much larger orbital width relationship skull length shorter snout compared length entire c bohemicus larger post parietal lapets indicates allometric growth pattern skeletal jaws species consist ten bones upper lower jaw large number marginal teeth well pair palatal fangs situatied vomer palatine ectopterygoid teeth covered thin level enamel thicker layer infolded dentine dental pulp center palate densely covered dentacles

pangea provided refugian temnospondyls especially later carboniferous period global temperatures cochleosaurus fossils found late carboniferous fossil assemblages characteristic seasonal wetlands analysis sediment sydney coal field c florensis specimen first discovered found habitat little fresh water level inundation highly majority c bohemicus specimens found kladno formation czech republic moscovian period region submerged freshwater lake covering located equatorial region eastern pangea fossil assemblage klando formation shows diverse freshwater habitat supported large number fish species aquatic plants like salt marshes inhabited c florensis sediment deposits region show lake subject dramatic changes water level partly influenced seasonal cycles characteristic pangea muscovian although cochleosaurus species like temnospondyii amphibious comparison patterns interosseous blood vessels found cochleosaurus fossils early tetrapods led researchers conclude c bohemicus c florensis adapted terrestrial habitats c florensis discovered fossil assemblage also includes terrestrial reptiles giving support idea species able move terrestrial habitats however due internal gills cochleosaurus would require habitat access water order keep gills moist gas httpsenwikipediaorgwikicochleosaurus
