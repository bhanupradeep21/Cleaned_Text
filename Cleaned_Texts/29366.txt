gustatory cranial nerves innervate taste buds connected nucleus include chorda tympani lingual branch glossopharyngeal tastants chemical molecules provide stimulus taste perception concentration taste stimulus dictates intensity taste sensation furthermore threshold concentration required degree sensation varies depending specific tastant however general threshold concentrations tastants high relative sensory stimuli numerous studies investigated connection gustatory nucleus obesity increase visceral fat negatively correlated taste function humans rats taste sensitivity changes body weight especially sweet fat taste qualities signal high energy availability nucleus tractus solitarii nts includes gustatory nucleus neurons express many different receptors inform organisms internal state

taste receptor cell expression well reduced activation taste receptor one study effect obesity responses taste stimuli nts investigated recording taste responses single cells sensory region rats diet induced obesity due high energy diet lean rats fed normal diet results study showed rats diet induced obesity produce prevalent response taste gustatory nucleus nts well weakened association taste responses ingestive behavior compared lean rats addition also discovered responses taste stimuli rats obesity smaller shorter occur longer latencies compared lean rats electrophysiological recordings create connection gustatory nucleus obesity exposure high energy diet alter taste encoded nervous system humans rats obesity taste responses shorter weaker large impact brainstem represents taste
