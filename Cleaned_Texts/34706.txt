shoulder problems including pain one common reasons physician visits musculoskeletal symptoms shoulder movable joint body however unstable joint range motion allowed instability increases likelihood joint injury often leading degenerative process tissues break longer function well shoulder pain may localized may referred areas around shoulder arm regions within body gallbladder liver heart disease disease cervical spine neck also may generate pain brain may interpret arising shoulder joint composed three bones clavicle collarbone scapula shoulder blade humerus upper arm bone see diagram two joints facilitate shoulder movement acromioclavicular ac joint located acromion part scapula forms highest point shoulder clavicle glenohumeral joint term shoulder joint commonly refers ballandsocket joint allows arm rotate circular fashion hinge away body ball top rounded portion upper arm bone humerus socket glenoid dishshaped part outer edge scapula ball fits arm movement facilitated ability scapula slide along rib cage capsule soft tissue envelope encircles glenohumeral joint lined thin smooth synovial membranecitation needed bones shoulder held place muscles tendons ligaments tendons tough cords tissue attach shoulder muscles bone assist muscles moving shoulder ligaments attach shoulder bones providing stability example front joint capsule anchored three glenohumeral ligamentscitation needed rotator cuff structure composed tendons associated muscles holds ball top humerus glenoid socket provides mobility strength shoulder four filmy saclike structures called bursa permit smooth gliding bone muscle tendon cushion protect rotator cuff bony arch acromioncitation needed following ways doctors diagnose shoulder problems shoulder joint frequently dislocated major joint body typical case dislocated shoulder strong force pulls shoulder outward abduction extreme rotation joint pops ball humerus shoulder socket dislocation commonly occurs backward pull arm either catches muscles unprepared resist overwhelms muscles shoulder dislocates frequently condition referred shoulder instability partial dislocation upper arm bone partially partially socket called subluxation medical community dislocation commonly referred luxationcitation needed almost shoulder dislocations downwards inferior percent forward direction clinically referred anterior dislocation glenohumeral joint arm appear position shoulder dislocates dislocation also produces pain muscle spasms may increase intensity pain swelling bruising normally develop cases may numbness muscle weakness problems seen dislocated shoulder tearing ligaments tendons reinforcing joint capsule less commonly nerve damage doctors usually diagnose dislocation physical examination xrays taken confirm diagnosis rule related fracture complications xrays also taken relocation ensure correct placecitation needed doctors treat dislocation putting head humerus back joint socket glenoid fossa procedure called manipulation reduction usually followed xray make sure reduction fracture surrounding bones arm immobilized sling device called shoulder immobilizer several days usually doctor recommends resting shoulder applying ice three four times day pain swelling controlled patient enters rehabilitation program includes exercises restore range motion shoulder strengthen muscles prevent future dislocations exercises may progress simple motion use weightscitation needed treatment recovery previously dislocated shoulder may remain susceptible reinjury especially young active individuals ligaments stretched may tear due dislocation torn ligaments problems resulting dislocation increase chance repeated dislocation shoulder dislocates severely often injuring surrounding tissues nerves usually requires surgery repair damaged parts shouldercitation needed sometimes doctor performs surgery tiny incision small scope arthroscope inserted observe inside joint procedure called arthroscopic surgery shoulder generally restrained sling three six weeks full recovery including physical therapy takes several months arthroscopic techniques involving shoulder relatively new many surgeons prefer repair recurrent dislocating shoulder timetested open surgery direct vision usually fewer repeat dislocations improved movement following open surgery may take little longer regain motioncitation needed shoulder separation occurs collarbone clavicle meets shoulder blade scapula ligaments hold ac acromioclavicular joint together partially completely torn outer end clavicle may slip place preventing properly meeting scapula often injury caused blow shoulder falling outstretched hand injury hard degrees rotationcitation needed shoulder pain tenderness occasionally bump middle top shoulder ac joint signs separation may occurred sometimes severity separation detected taking xrays patient holds light weight pulls muscles making separation pronouncedcitation needed shoulder separation usually treated conservatively rest wearing sling soon injury ice bag may applied relieve pain swelling period rest therapist helps patient perform exercises put shoulder range motion shoulder separations heal within two three months without intervention however ligaments severely torn surgical repair may required hold clavicle place doctor may wait see conservative treatment works deciding whether surgery requiredcitation needed directly shoulder problem may affect shoulder functionality due problems sternoclavicular rotation sternoclavicular separation occurs sternum separates clavicle sternoclavicular joint sternoclavicular separations dislocation subluxation generally caused accident clavicle separated posteriorly ie clavicle separates goes behind sternum situation dangerous clavicle cause damage interior arteries veins organscitation needed xray ct scan may necessary accurately diagnose sternoclavicular separationcitation needed treatment consists standard use plenty rest icing nsaids sling joint may need reduced ie put back place especially posterior separations severe cases surgery may advisedcitation needed rotator cuff group four tendons blend together attach upper end arm bone humerus tendons transmit force muscles originating shoulder blade scapula arm providing rotational motion centering stability jointcitation needed rotator cuff tendons degenerate group respected scientists wrote review existing evidence theory degeneration related pinching impingement head humerus acromion considered rotator cuff pathology similar nondominant compared dominant symptomatic compared asymptomatic twothirds humans develop rotator cuff tendinopathy live years pathology mucoid degeneration process involve intraarticular part long head biceps addition supraspinatus infraspinatus subscapularis tendinitis inflammation redness soreness swelling tendon tendinitis shoulder rotator cuff andor biceps tendon become inflamed usually result pinched surrounding structures injury may vary mild inflammation involvement rotator cuff rotator cuff tendon becomes inflamed thickened may get trapped acromion squeezing rotator cuff called impingement syndromecitation needed inflamed bursa called bursitis tendinitis impingement syndrome often accompanied inflammation bursa sacs protect shoulder inflammation caused disease rheumatoid arthritis may cause rotator cuff tendinitis bursitis sports involving overuse shoulder occupations requiring frequent overhead reaching potential causes irritation rotator cuff bursa may lead inflammation impingementcitation needed commonly affected tendon supraspinatus muscle defects rotator cuff come injury cuff tear degeneration cuff wear degree tendon reparable depends quantity quality degenerated tendons often frail retracted may amenable repair individuals elderly smokers cortisone injections often weaker tendon tissue fails without significant injury contrast whose tendon torn substantial fall often good quality tendon repaired surgery performed promptly injury symptoms rotator cuff disease include difficulty lifting arm repair rotator cuff requires tendon securely anchored bone surgery repair protected several months healingcitation needed signs conditions include slow onset discomfort pain upper shoulder upper third arm andor difficulty sleeping shoulder similar condition sharp pain discomfort upper shoulder positioned certain angles tendinitis bursitis also cause pain arm lifted away body overhead tendinitis involves biceps tendon tendon located front shoulder helps bend elbow turn forearm pain occur front side shoulder may travel elbow forearm pain may also occur arm forcefully pushed upward overheadcitation needed diagnosis tendinitis bursitis begins medical history physical examination xrays show tendons bursae may helpful ruling bony abnormalities arthritis doctor may remove test fluid inflamed area rule infection ultrasound scans frequently used confirm suspected tendinitis bursitis well rule tear rotator cuff muscles impingement syndrome may confirmed injection small amount anesthetic lidocaine hydrochloride space acromion relieves paincitation needed antiinflammatory medicines aspirin naproxen ibuprofen among others taken help pain cases physical therapist use ultrasound electrical stimulation well manipulation gentle stretching strengthening exercises added gradually improvement doctor may inject corticosteroid medicine space acromion however recent level one evidence showed limited efficacy corticosteroid injections pain steroid injections common treatment must used caution may lead tendon rupture still improvement six months doctor may perform either arthroscopic open surgery repair damage relieve pressure tendons bursaecitation needed calcific tendinitis shoulder high energy extracorporeal shockwave therapy useful types rotator cuff tear tentative evidence suggests exercise may reduce pain combination exercise joint mobilization result long term evidence demonstrates use corticosteroids injections slap superior labrum anterior posterior tear occurs cartilage shoulder labrum delaminates glenoid causes instability shoulder typically overhead movementscitation needed symptoms include dull ache deep shoulder joint trouble sleeping due instability discomfort extreme weakness overhead activitiescitation needed best diagnosis slap tear clinical exam followed mri combined contrast agentcitation needed cases recover complete mobility without surgical intervention patients able strengthen shoulders limit day day dull ache limited mobility function surgery reattaches labrum glenoid use surgical anchorscitation needed recovery often lengthy process first four weeks patient required wear sling following month physical therapy regain range motion two months limited strength training occurs six months patient typically released full active use although many patients find full recovery takes longer thiscitation needed name implies movement shoulder severely restricted people frozen shoulder condition doctors call adhesive capsulitis frequently caused injury leads lack use due pain rheumatic disease progression recent shoulder surgery also cause frozen shoulder intermittent periods use may cause inflammation adhesions abnormal bands tissue grow joint surfaces restricting motion also lack synovial fluid normally lubricates gap arm bone socket help shoulder joint move restricted space capsule ball humerus distinguishes adhesive capsulitis less complicated painful stiff shoulder people diabetes stroke lung disease rheumatoid arthritis heart disease accident higher risk frozen shoulder condition rarely appears people age needed bone fracture shoulder involves partial total crack one three bones shoulder clavicle scapula humerus break bone usually occurs result impact injury fall blow shoulder fractures usually involve clavicle neck area ball humerus fractures scapula sometimes occur coracoid processcitation needed shoulder fracture occurs major injury usually accompanied severe pain within short time may redness bruising around area sometimes fracture obvious bones appear position however occur noninvolved dislocations separations diagnosis severity confirmed xrayscitation needed fracture occurs doctor tries bring bones position promote healing restore arm movement clavicle fractured patient must first wear strap sling around chest keep clavicle place removing strap sling doctor prescribe exercises strengthen shoulder restore movement surgery occasionally needed certain clavicle fractures especially disunionscitation needed fracture neck humerus usually treated sling shoulder immobilizer bones position surgery may necessary reset exercises also part restoring shoulder strength motioncitation needed arthritis shoulder cartilage ball socket glenohumeral joint lost bone rubs bone may caused wear tear degenerative joint disease injury traumatic arthritis surgery secondary degenerative joint disease inflammation rheumatoid arthritis infection septic arthritiscitation needed arthritis shoulder causes pain loss
