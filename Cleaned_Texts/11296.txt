cognitive hierarchy theory cht behavioral model originating behavioral economics game theory attempts describe human thought processes strategic games cht aims improve upon accuracy predictions made standard analytic methods including backwards induction iterated elimination dominated strategies deviate considerably actual experimental outcomes levelk theory competing theory cognitive hierarchy similar cognitive hierarchy theory sense player types drawn hierarchy levels iterated rationalizability hierarchy begins naive type completely nonstrategic levelzero player choose actions without regard actions players player said zeroorder beliefs one level higher sophisticated type believe population consists naive types slightly sophisticated level one player believes players act nonstrategically action best response consistent firstorder beliefs next level believes population consists first level sophisticated level two player acts belief players level one pattern continues higherlevel players player finite depth reasoning meaning individual players limit depth reason strategically mixture model typically used identify subpopulations levelk theory assumes players strategic games base decisions predictions likely actions players according levelk players strategic games categorized depth strategic thus heavily focused bounded rationality basic form levelk theory implies player believes sophisticated person game players level k neglect fact players could also levelk even higher attributed many factors maintenance costs simply noted players necessarily fall archetypes instead player act assumption percentage population fits archetype act accordingly find best response example keynesian beauty contest described player might believe half players levelzero half levelone player would select number halfway guesses archetypal levelone leveltwo players also argued players able believe others level reasoning leading inclusive cognitive hierarchy framework could helpful capturing behavior games eg expansive games keynesian beauty contest participants asked choose number close possible fraction average participants guesses suppose many players attempting guess average range level zero player select number nonstrategically number might selected random may special significance player case indistinguishable random number players level one player choose number consistent belief players level zero players game level zero average guesses would therefore level one player choose level two player choose number consistent belief players level one since level one player choose level two player choose process repeats higherlevel players centipede game two players take turns choosing either expand slowly increasing pot end game keep larger fraction pot example players alice bob alice chooses first also highest reward bob chooses expand pot final round alice nonstrategic level zero compare payoffs possible endpoint game note highest reward results bob expanding pot final round alice thus choose expand pot every turn alice level one correctly identify optimal outcome however also note outcome feasible bobs optimal outcome results ending game last turn rather expanding pot result choose end game last round rather expanding pot alice level two predict bob expects end game last round try end game result alice choose end game second last round theories behavior often assume players think strategically meaning players base actions probable decisions players way serve objectives however many games real contrived result equilibrium predicted standard analytic methods standard solution keynesian beauty contest determined iterated elimination dominated strategies using example fully rational player observe number could player also predict players know well behave accordingly maximum feasible number becomes players know process repeats indefinitely concludes players selecting nash equilibrium game solution inconsistent experimental evidence finds players choose numbers around either guesses consistent first secondorder depth reasoning supporting cht small proportion players exhibit depths reasoning greater second order standard solution centipede game determined backward induction according method bob reaches final decision prefer keep larger share smaller pot smaller share larger pot end game instead expanding pot alice knows bob end game last move decides end game one step however bob knows alice end early decides end process repeats alice confronted decision first round knowing bob end game first opportunity alice ends game first round walk home smallest possible total payoff thus standard analytic methods predict players defect soon opportunity despite higher payoffs would accrue cooperative play actual experimental settings however cooperative behavior observed limited number rounds benefits cooperation persist fact grow games end prematurely defection player previously cooperative many alternative models proposed explain discrepancies standard theory experimental results example temporary cooperation centipede game ascribed altruism either error anticipation errors players case altruism player opposed altruist cooperate temporarily increase size payoff intention defecting later case error player appreciate vulnerabilities created cooperative play player anticipates opponent prone making errors players interest cooperate opponent recognizes error alternative explanations descriptive plausible also nonpredictive nonfalsifiable limits usefulness behavioral models also speculative given observation deviates prediction economists unable distinguish errors social preferences intentional strategies causes cognitive hierarchy theory explains observed pattern opportunistic cooperation found many games without susceptible speculation players traits intelligence motivations centipede game eventual defection players signifies players strategic nonaltruistic suggests players cooperate temporary basis seeking selfinterest cooperate long expect serve suggesting cht describes human behavior better alternatives furthermore researchers able preserve common assumption players selfinterested cht incorporated existing models rather replacing outright cht offer reasonably accurate predictions human behavior acknowledging stronger forms bounded rationality opportunism standard theory unlike methods backwards induction assume players possess unrealistically developed ability process information especially conditions uncertainty dependence players time constraints furthermore incorporating stronger assumptions opportunism able explain player cooperate defect instead consistent cooperation defection
