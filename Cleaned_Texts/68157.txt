speech application programming interface sapi api developed microsoft allow use speech recognition speech synthesis within windows applications date number versions api released shipped either part speech sdk part windows os applications use sapi include microsoft office microsoft agent microsoft speech server general versions api designed software developer write application perform speech recognition synthesis using standard set interfaces accessible variety programming languages addition possible company produce speech recognition texttospeech engines adapt existing engines work sapi principle long engines conform defined interfaces used instead microsoftsupplied engines general speech api freely redistributable component shipped windows application wishes use speech technology many versions although speech recognition synthesis engines also freely redistributable two main families microsoft speech api sapi versions similar extra features newer version sapi however completely new interface released since several subversions api released speech api viewed interface piece middleware sits applications speech engines recognition synthesis sapi versions applications could directly communicate engines api included abstract interface definition applications engines conformed applications could also use simplified higherlevel objects rather directly call methods engines sapi however applications engines directly communicate instead talks runtime component sapidll api implemented component applications use another set interfaces engines typically sapi applications issue calls api example load recognition grammar start recognition provide text synthesized sapidll runtime component interprets commands processes necessary calling engine engine interfaces example loading grammar file done runtime grammar data passed recognition engine actually use recognition recognition synthesis engines also generate events processing example indicate utterance recognized indicate word boundaries synthesized speech pass reverse direction engines runtime dll event sink application addition actual api definition runtime dll components shipped versions sapi make complete speech software development kit following components among included versions speech sdk xuedong huang key person led microsofts early sapi efforts first version sapi released supported windows windows nt version included lowlevel direct speech recognition direct text speech apis applications could use directly control engines well simplified higherlevel voice command voice talk apis sapi released added limited support dictation speech recognition discrete speech continuous additional sample applications audio sources sapi released version sapi included core com api together c wrapper classes make programming c easier activex controls allow draganddrop visual basic development shipped part sdk included recognition synthesis engines also shipped synthesis engines windows main components sapi api available c com activex flavors speech sdk version incorporating sapi runtime released complete redesign previous versions neither engines applications used older versions sapi could use new version without considerable modification design new api included concept strictly separating application engine calls routed runtime sapidll change intended make api engineindependent preventing applications inadvertently depending features specific engine addition change aimed making much easier incorporate speech technology application moving management initialization code runtime new api initially pure com api could used easily cc support vb scripting languages added later operating systems windows nt upwards supported major features api include version shipped late part speech sdk version together version recognition synthesis engines recognition engines supported continuous dictation command control released us english japanese simplified chinese versions us english system special acoustic models available childrens speech telephony speech synthesis engine available english chinese version api recognition engines also

engines shipped windows xp windows xp tablet pc edition office also include version substantially improved version recognition engine traditional chinese special version api use microsoft speech server shipped added support srgs ssml markup languages well additional server features performance improvements speech server also shipped version desktop recognition engine version server recognition engine version api ships windows vista together new recognition synthesis engines windows speech recognition integrated operating system speech sdk apis part windows sdk sapi includes following new features updated version api ships windows microsoft sam speech articulation module commonly shipped sapi voice addition microsoft office xp office installed lh michael michelle voices sapi sdk installs voices mike mary windows vista includes microsoft anna replaces microsoft sam sounds natural intelligible also installed windows xp microsoft streets trips later versions chinese

new api available windows xp windows server windows vista windows server existing sapi api also used managed code limited extent creating com interop code helper code designed assist accessing com interfaces classes works well scenarios however new api provide seamless experience equivalent using managed code library however major obstacle towards transitioning com interop fact managed implementation subtle memory leaks lead memory fragmentation exclude use library nontrivial applications workaround microsoft suggested using different api fewer windows vista includes number new
