colorectal polyp polyp fleshy growth occurring lining colon untreated colorectal polyps develop colorectal colorectal polyps often classified behaviour ie benign vs malignant cause eg consequence inflammatory bowel disease may benign eg hyperplastic polyp premalignant eg tubular adenoma malignant eg colorectal adenocarcinoma colorectal polyps usually associated occur symptoms include bloody stools changes frequency consistency stools week constipation fatigue arising blood anemia arising iron deficiency also present due chronic blood loss even absence bloody another symptom may increased mucus production especially involving villous copious production mucus causes loss potassium occasionally result symptomatic occasionally polyp big enough cause bowel obstruction may nausea vomiting severe polyps either pedunculated attached intestinal wall stalk sessile grow directly addition gross appearance categorization divided histologic appearance tubular adenoma tubular glands villous adenoma long finger like projections surface tubulovillous adenoma features hereditary syndromes causing increased colorectal polyp formation include several genes associated polyposis familial adenomatous polyposis fap form hereditary cancer syndrome involving apc gene located chromosome syndrome first described virchow boy multiple polyps syndrome involves development multiple polyps early age left untreated eventually develop gene expressed mutation autosomal patients negative family history acquire syndrome spontaneous germline average age newly diagnosed patient average age newly discovered colorectal cancer recommended affected undergo colorectal cancer screening younger age treatment prevention surgical removal affected hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer hnpcc also known lynch syndrome hereditary colorectal cancer common hereditary form colorectal cancer united states accounts cases first recognized alder warthin university later studied henry lynch recognized autosomal dominant transmission pattern affected relatively early onset cancer mean age years greater occurrence proximal lesions mostly mucinous poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma greater number synchronous metachronous cancer cells good outcome surgical amsterdam criteria initially used define lynch syndrome underlying genetic mechanism worked criteria required patient three family members

involving breast ovary cervix fallopian tubes thyroid lung gallbladder bile ducts pancreas polyps often bleeds may cause obstruction would require polyps larger cm needs removal patients monitored

distal colon malignant means likely normal tissue eventually become cancer neoplasm tissue whose cells lost normal differentiation either benign growths malignant growths malignant growths either

adenoma tumor glandular tissue yet gained properties cancercitation needed common adenomas colon colorectal adenoma tubular tubulovillous villous sessile serrated large majority benign tubular type tubulovillous villous rare evident name sessile serrated traditional serrated adenomas tsas serrated appearance difficult distinguish microscopically hyperplastic making distinction important however since ssas tsas potential become hyperplastic polyps villous subdivision associated highest malignant potential generally largest surface area villi projections lumen hence bigger surface area however villous adenomas likely tubular tubulovillous adenomas become cancerous sizes hamartomatous polyps tumours like growths found organs result faulty development normally made mixture tissues contain
