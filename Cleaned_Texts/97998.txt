ptosis sagging female breast natural consequence aging rate womans breasts drop degree ptosis depends many factors key factors influencing breast ptosis womans lifetime cigarette smoking number pregnancies higher body mass index larger bra cup size significant weight postmenopausal women people collagen deficiencies may experience increased ptosis due loss skin elasticity many women medical professionals mistakenly believe breastfeeding increases sagging also commonly believed breast offers insufficient support wearing bra prevents sagging found plastic surgeons categorize degree ptosis evaluating position nipple relative inframammary fold point underside breasts attach chest wall advanced stage nipples fold point toward ground womans breasts change size volume position chest throughout life young women large breasts sagging may occur early life due effect gravity may primarily caused volume weight breasts disproportionate body pregnancy ovaries placenta produce estrogen progesterone hormones stimulate lobes milksecreting glands breasts develop women experience multiple pregnancies repeatedly stretch skin envelope engorgement lactating womans breasts change size repeated pregnancies size breasts change mammary glands engorged milk gains loses weight addition milk production stops usually child weaned voluminous mammary glands diminish volume still add bulk firmness breast review found weight gain pregnancy breastfeeding significant risk factors middleaged women breast ptosis caused combination factors woman pregnant postpartum hormonal changes cause depleted milk glands atrophy breast tissue suspensory ligaments may also stretched woman overweight loses gains weight factors play breast prolapses falls forward woman sagging breasts stands underside inferior skin breast folds inframammary fold lies chest wall nippleareola complex tends move lower breast relative inframammary crease nipple breast may also tend point downward postmenopausal women breast atrophy aggravated inelasticity overstretched aged due part reduction estrogen affects body tissues including breast tissue loss estrogen reduces breast size fullness estrogen also essential maintaining fibrous protein called collagen makes much breasts connective tissuecitation needed plastic surgeons describe degree breast sagging using ptosis scale like modified regnault ptosis scale university kentucky plastic surgeon brian rinker encountered many women practice attributed sagging breasts breastfeeding also usual belief among medical decided find true researchers interviewed women seeking breast augmentation breast lifts studied womens medical history body mass index bmi number pregnancies breast cup size pregnancy smoking status study results presented conference american society plastic according rinkers research several key factors history cigarette smoking breaks protein skin called elastin gives youthful skin elastic appearance supports breast number pregnancies strongly correlated ptosis effects increasing women age breasts naturally yield gravity tend sag fold inframammary crease lower attachment point chest wall true largerbreasted women fourth reason significant weight gain loss greater pounds significant factors higher body mass index larger bra cup rinkers study respondents reported adverse change breast shape pregnancy many women mistakenly attribute changes sagging breasts result reluctant nurse infants research shows breastfeeding factor many thought rinker concluded expectant mothers reassured breastfeeding appear adverse effect upon breast also discounted causes affecting ptosis weight gain pregnancy lack participation regular upper body running breasts may move threedimensionally vertically horizontally laterally overall motion unrestrained movement large breasts may contribute sagging motion studies revealed woman runs breasts total movement vertical sidetoside study found encapsulationtype sports bras cup separately molded effective compressiontype bras press breasts close body reducing total breast motion exercise encapsulation bras reduce motion two three planes compression bras reduce motion one previously commonly believed woman small mediumsize breasts benefited compressiontype sports bra women larger breasts need encapsulationtype sports anatomically females breasts contain muscle composed soft glandular tissue breasts composed mammary glands milk ducts adipose tissue fat tissue coopers ligaments mammary glands remain relatively constant throughout life fat tissue surrounds mammary glands volume normally vary throughout life although exact mechanisms determine breast shape size largely amount distribution fat tissue lesser extent mammary tissue cause variations breast size shape volume expertswho believe coopers ligaments connective tissue breast provide support within agreement whether provide support simply divide breast tissue since breasts external organ contain muscle exercise improve shape protected external forces subject gravity many women mistakenly believe breasts anatomically support wearing brassiere prevent breasts sagging later researchers bra manufacturers health professionals find evidence support idea wearing bra amount time slows breast bra manufacturers careful claim bras affect shape breasts evidence bra use reduces development coopers ligaments connective tissue supports breast shape atrophy brawearing may therefore lead breast sag long run much connective tissue limb weakens cast must restrengthened studies actually documented initial period adjustment women experienced significant increase comfort breast firmness going without women ptosis choose undergo plastic surgery make breasts less ptotic plastic surgeons offer several procedures lifting sagging breasts surgery correct size contour elevation sagging breasts called women also choose breast implants may undergo procedures breastlift procedure surgically elevates parenchymal tissue breast mass cuts resizes skin envelope transposes nippleareola complex higher upon breast hemisphere sagging present woman opts undergo mastopexy implants typically placed muscle fill breast skin tissue submuscular placement result deformity cases implant appears high chest natural breast tissue hangs implant
