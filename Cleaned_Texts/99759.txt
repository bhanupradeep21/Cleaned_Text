cicutoxin naturallyoccurring poisonous chemical compound produced several plants family apiaceae including water hemlock cicuta species water dropwort oenanthe compound contains polyene polyyne alcohol functional groups structural isomer oenanthotoxin also found water dropwort belong chemical causes death respiratory paralysis resulting disruption central nervous potent noncompetitive antagonist gammaaminobutyric acid gaba receptor humans cicutoxin rapidly produces symptoms nausea emesis abdominal pain typically within minutes ingestion lead tremors seizures ip johann jakob wepfers

cicutoxin gives overall yield cicutoxin known interact gabaa receptor also shown block potassium channel lymphocytes similar effect potassium channels neurons blocked could account toxic effect nervous interactions explained mechanism action exact mechanism action known cicutoxin even though well known violent toxin mechanism known chemical instability studies delivered evidence mechanism action cicutoxin noncompetitive gammaaminobutyric acid gaba antagonist central nervous system cns gaba normally binds beta domain gabaa receptor activates receptor causes flow chloride across membrane cicutoxin binds place gaba receptor activated gaba pore receptor wont open chloride cant flow across membrane binding cicutoxin beta domain also blocks chloride channel effects cicutoxin gabaareceptor cause constant depolarization causes hyperactivity cells leads also studies suggest cicutoxin increases duration neuronal repolarization dosedependent manner toxin could increase duration repolarization sixfold µmol prolonged action potentials may cause higher excitatory demonstrated cicutoxin also blocks potassium channels toxin inhibits proliferation lymphocytes made substance

occur untreated kidneys also fail causing adverse effects cicutoxin poisoning gastrointestinal cardiac nature antidote known symptomatic treatments available though supportive treatments substantially improve survival treatments used include administration activated charcoal within minutes ingestion reduce uptake poison maintaining open airways prevent suffocation rehydration address dehydration
