pelorosaurus pəˌlɒroʊˈsɔːrəs pəlorrohsorəs meaning monstrous lizard genus titanosauriform sauropod dinosaur remains referred pelorosaurus date early cretaceous period million years ago found england portugalcitation needed thomas holtz estimated length meters name pelorosaurus one first given sauropod many species assigned genus historically currently considered belong genera problematically first named species pelorosaurus pconybeari junior synonym cetiosaurus brevis pelorosaurus one first sauropods identified dinosaur although first discovered richard owen discovered cetiosaurus incorrectly identified gigantic seagoing crocodilelike mantell identified pelorosaurus dinosaur living land taxonomic history pelorosaurus cetiosaurus noted reviewers including michael p taylor darren naish highly confusing richard owen named several species cetiosaurus among cetiosaurus brevis based several specimens early cretaceous period four caudal vertebrae bmnh three chevrons bmnh found around john kingdon near cuckfield tunbridge wells sand formation hastings beds belonged sauropods others however including bmnh found near sandown bay isle wight bmnh found near hastings actually belonged iguanodont noticing owens mistake assigning iguanodont bones cetiosaurus comparative anatomist alexander melville renamed sauropod bones cetiosaurus conybeari gideon mantell decided c conybeari different cetiosaurus needed new genus reclassified new name pelorosaurus conybeari mantell originally november intended use name colossosaurus upon discovering kolossos greek statue giant changed mind generic name derived greek pelor monster also emended specific name honouring william conybeare conybearei present rules iczn original conybeari today written without capital priority mantell used sauropod material c brevis type pelorosaurus conybeari also large humerus found miller peter fuller site bmnh assumed individual discovered metres away vertebrae mantell acquired bone humerus clearly shaped vertically support weight body presumed possess medullary cavity showed pelorosaurus land animal main motive naming separate genus shortly afterwards however studying sacral vertebrae cetiosaurus mantell established lived owen highly piqued melvilles mantells attempts suppress cetiosaurus brevis publication tried set matters straight saw avoiding openly admit original mistake first suggested melvilles main motivation name change presumed inaccuracy epithet brevis short total length animal could deduced limited remains owen pointed anyone acquainted taxonomy would understood short referred vertebrae animal whole subsequent page apparently separate issue owen covert terms implied publication descriptive enough thus merely resulted nomen nudum assigned sauropod material making cetiosaurus brevis valid name still left problem named new genus mantell owen resolved simply presenting humerus sole holotype pelorosaurus verification remarkably repeated mistake referring iguanodontid vertebrae specimens bmnh c last proposed belong pelorosaurus together number iguanodontid vertebrae mantell labelled collection owen suggested mere mistake name pelorosaurus connected c brevis material instead owens interpretation commonly accepted well twentieth century however john ostrom rodney steel understood owens claim c brevis still nomen nudum rejected transparent attempt change type specimen inadmissible present standardsfailed verification standards though melvilles name change also incorrect name cetiosaurus brevis still available simply made sauropod bones lectotype removing iguanodontid remains syntype series sauropod bones iguanodont bones would retained name c brevis therefore cetiosaurus conybeari junior objective synonym c brevis c brevis older name one based exactly fossils younger invalid specimens continued assigned pelorosaurus cetiosaurus studied reported extensively scientific slowly tendency developed subsume fragmentary sauropod material jurassic england designation cetiosaurus assigning incomplete european cretaceous sauropod finds pelorosaurus pelorosaurus thus came typical wastebasket taxon european sauropod

considered different dinosaurs one notable species p becklesii known humerus radius ulna well skin impressions specimen since made new genus haestasaurus mantell first suggest relationship pelorosaurus dinosaurs friedrich august quenstedt formally listed predictably owen first rejected classification still considering member crocodilia henriémile sauvage first stated belonged sauropoda group still incompletely known however proved difficult determine precise affinities atlantosauridae cardiodontidae cetiosauridae morosauridae suggested von huene understood possible link brachiosaurus placing pelorosaurus brachiosauridae placement followed subsequent authors early century humerus centimeters long elongated strongly suggests typical brachiosaurid trait present
