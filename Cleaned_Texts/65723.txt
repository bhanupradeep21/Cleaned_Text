genetically modified tomato transgenic tomato tomato genes modified using genetic engineering first trial genetically modified food tomato engineered longer shelf life flavr savr market briefly beginning may first direct consumption tomato approved japan primary work focused developing tomatoes new traits like increased resistance pests environmental projects aim enrich tomatoes substances may offer health benefits nutritious well aiming produce novel crops scientists produce genetically modified tomatoes understand function genes naturally present tomatoes agrobacteriummediated genetic engineering techniques developed late could successfully transfer genetic material nuclear genome genetic material also inserted tomato cells chloroplast chromoplast plastomes using biolistics tomatoes first food crop edible fruit tomatoes used model organism study fruit ripening climacteric fruit understand mechanisms involved process ripening scientists genetically engineered flavr savr
