methiocarb carbamate pesticide acetylecholinesterase inhibitor used bird since methiocarb contact stomach action mites neurotoxic effects molluscs seeds treated methiocarb also affect birds names methiocarb mercaptodimethur due toxicity methiocarb approval plant protection product withdrawn eu effective carbamate functional group methiocarb cleaved cholinesterase result carbamate binds cholinesterase aromatic alcohol methiocarb synthesised bayer methyl isocyanate xylenol act nucleophile reaction attacking partially positively charged carbon isocyanate methiocarb acts acetylcholinesterase product cleavage carbamate group methiocarb methylcarbamic acid bound cholinesterase reaction normal function choline esterase cleave acetylcholine bond results binding acetic acid choline sterase fast reversible reaction carbamic acid also reversibly binds hydrolysis bond slower therefore acid inhibits function choline sterase results elevated choline esterase levels comparison organophosphates inhibit irreversibly therefore inhibit acetylcholinesterase even morecitation needed addition cholinergic effects methiocarb found endocrine disruptor acting estrogen
