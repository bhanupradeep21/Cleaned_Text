uroscopy historical medical practice visually examining patients urine pus blood symptoms disease first records uroscopy method determining symptoms illness date back millennium bc became common practice classical greece later reaching medical predominance byzantine era high middle ages practice eventually replaced accurate methods early modern period uroscopy considered inadequate due lack empirical evidence higher standards postrenaissance medicine modern medicine visual examination patients urine may provide preliminary evidence diagnosis generally limited conditions specifically affect urinary system urinary tract infections kidney bladder issues liver failure records urinalysis uroscopy date back far bc originating babylonian sumerian outset century bc greek physician hippocrates hypothesized urine filtrate four humors limited possible diagnoses resulting method issues dealing bladder kidneys turn led another greek physician galen refine idea urine filtrate blood black bile yellow bile phlegmcitation needed byzantine medicine followed though maintained roots grecoroman antiquity continued application study uroscopy eventually becoming primary form ailment diagnosis byzantine physicians created foundational codifications uroscopy well known example guide uroscopic methods theophilus protospathariuss urines work along others became widely popular accelerated rate uroscopy spread throughout mediterranean time byzantine works inspired interpretation prominent cultures scholars like arab jewish isaac israeli ben solomon urinehue classification chart though greater propagation led widened application uroscopy eventually uroscopic diagnoses nonurinary related diseases infections became pivotal spread uroscopy constantine africans latin translations byzantine arab texts inspired new era uroscopic interest specifically western europe throughout high middle despite popularization uroscopy still mostly maintained principals hippocratess galens first postulated aided byzantine interpretations disseminated period works french physicians era bernard de gordon gilles de practice upheld standard beginning century influence cultural movements like renaissance inspired reexamination methods reevaluate effectiveness explore new applications period lack empirical evidence supporting uroscopy introduction new medical practices developed using scientific method contributed gradual decline among licensed physicians early modern doctors like swiss medical pioneer paracelsus began researching empirically qualified approaches diagnosis treatment integral part medical renaissance redefining look medicine hastened decline since beginning century practice largely considered unverifiable unorthodox became subject satire including multiple satirical references plays shakespeare still practiced unlicensed practitioners popular demand around beginning though uroscopy longer popular modern medicine examples preliminary diagnostic utility still exist simplified empirically proven incidentally decline uroscopy continued new form divination emerged remnants uromancy analysis ones urine fortunetelling statereading
