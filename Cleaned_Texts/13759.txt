vitro meaning glass glass studies performed microorganisms cells biological molecules outside normal biological context colloquially called testtube experiments studies biology subdisciplines traditionally done labware test tubes flasks petri dishes microtiter plates studies conducted using components organism isolated usual biological surroundings permit detailed convenient analysis done whole organisms however results obtained vitro experiments may fully accurately predict effects whole organism contrast vitro experiments vivo studies conducted living organisms including humans known clinical trials whole vitro latin glass often italicized english studies conducted using components organism isolated usual biological surroundings microorganisms cells biological molecules example microorganisms cells studied artificial culture media proteins examined solutions colloquially called testtube experiments studies biology medicine subdisciplines traditionally done test tubes flasks petri dishes involve full range techniques used molecular biology contrast studies conducted living beings microorganisms animals humans whole plants called examples vitro studies include isolation growth identification cells derived multicellular organisms cell tissue culture subcellular components eg mitochondria ribosomes cellular subcellular extracts eg wheat germ reticulocyte extracts purified molecules proteins dna rna commercial production antibiotics pharmaceutical viruses replicate living cells studied laboratory cell tissue culture many animal virologists refer work vitro distinguish vivo work whole vitro studies permit speciesspecific simpler convenient detailed analysis done whole organism studies whole animals replace human trials vitro studies replacing studies whole animals living organisms extremely complex functional systems made minimum many tens thousands genes protein molecules rna molecules small organic compounds inorganic ions complexes environment spatially organized membranes case multicellular organisms organ myriad components interact environment way processes food removes waste moves components correct location responsive signalling molecules organisms light sound heat taste touch balance complexity makes difficult identify interactions individual components explore basic biological functions vitro work simplifies system study investigator focus small number example identity proteins immune system eg antibodies mechanism recognize bind foreign antigens would remain obscure extensive use vitro work isolate proteins identify cells genes produce study physical properties interaction antigens identify interactions lead cellular signals activate components immune system another advantage vitro methods human cells studied without extrapolation experimental animals cellular vitro methods miniaturized automated yielding highthroughput screening methods testing molecules pharmacology primary disadvantage vitro experimental studies may challenging extrapolate results vitro work back biology intact organism investigators vitro work must careful avoid overinterpretation results lead erroneous conclusions organismal systems example scientists developing new viral drug treat infection pathogenic virus eg may find candidate drug functions prevent viral replication vitro setting typically cell culture however drug used clinic must progress series vivo trials determine safe effective intact organisms typically small animals primates humans succession typically candidate drugs effective vitro prove ineffective vivo issues associated delivery drug affected tissues toxicity towards essential parts organism represented initial vitro studies method could help decrease animal testing use vitro batteries several vitro assays compiled cover multiple endpoints within developmental neurotoxicity reproductive toxicity hopes test batteries become easy screening methods prioritization chemicals risk assessed within ecotoxicology vitro test batteries already use regulatory purpose toxicological evaluation vitro tests also combined vivo testing make vitro vivo test battery example pharmaceutical results obtained vitro experiments usually transposed predict reaction entire organism vivo building consistent reliable extrapolation procedure vitro results vivo therefore extremely important solutions include two approaches incompatible better vitro systems provide better data mathematical models however increasingly sophisticated vitro experiments collect increasingly numerous complex challenging data integrate mathematical models systems biology models much needed pharmacology ivive used approximate pharmacokinetics pk pharmacodynamics pdcitation needed since timing intensity effects given target depend concentration time course candidate drug parent molecule metabolites target site vivo tissue organ sensitivities completely different even inverse observed cells cultured exposed vitro indicates extrapolating effects observed vitro needs quantitative model vivo pk physiologically based pk pbpk models generally accepted central case early effects without intercellular communications cellular exposure concentration assumed cause effects qualitatively quantitatively vitro vivo conditions developing simple pd model relationship observed vitro transposing
