immunological memory allows rapid production neutralizing antibodies following next exposure virus viruses use variety mechanisms evade neutralizing viral genomes mutate high rate mutations allow viruses evade neutralizing antibody selected hence prevail conversely antibodies also simultaneously evolve affinity maturation course immune response thereby improving recognition viral particles conserved parts viral proteins play central role viral function less likely evolve time therefore vulnerable antibody binding however viruses evolved certain mechanisms hinder steric access antibody
