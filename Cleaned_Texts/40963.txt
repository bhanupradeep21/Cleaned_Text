closedeye hallucinations closedeye visualizations cev hallucinations occur ones eyes closed one darkened room form phosphene people report cev influence psychedelics reportedly different nature openeye hallucinations compounds similar hallucinations occur due loss vision called visual release hallucinations five known levels cev perception achieved either chemical stimuli meditative relaxation techniquesmedical citation needed level common often happen every day still normal experience level even level small percentage population without psychedelic drugs meditation extensive visualization training basic form cev perception immediately experienced normal waking consciousness involves seemingly random noise pointillistic lightdark regions apparent shape order seen eyes

observation stopped obvious noticeable seemingly disappears normal physical perception individuals suffering visual snow syndrome see similar noise experience difficulty blocking conscious perceptioncitation needed mental control exerted closedeye visualizations usually requires bit relaxation concentration properly relaxed possible cause regions intense black bright white even colors yellow green pink appear noise regions span entire visual field seem fleeting level relatively easily accessible people use psychedelic drugs lsd however also accessible people involved deep concentration long periods time lying night closing eyes right sleep waking complex motion patterns become directly visible without great effort thanks hypnagogic hallucination patterns might resemble fractals fairly deep state level thoughts visually manifest objects environments level reached cev noise seems calm fade away leaving behind intense flat ordered blackness visual field becomes sort
