genetic incompatibility describes process mating yields offspring nonviable prone disease genetically defective way nature animals ill afford devote costly resources little reward ergo mating strategies evolved allow females choose otherwise determine mates likely result viable offspring polyandry instance female mates two males period sexual receptivity reduces chance singular mate genetically incompatible exactly females determine compatible genes prior mating completely understood various mechanisms proposed pheromones male appearance andor courtship behavior also surmised sexual selection continue copulation called cryptic female choice named takes place within body directly observed scenario incompatible male sperm rejected female genetic incompatibility engineered scientists order control pests mosquitos fruit flies introduced scientific community early concept cryptic female choice complicated offers new explanation nonadditive genetic effects thought main reason reproductive isolation recent studies concluded comparison additive genetic effects nonadditive genetic effects important role fertility embryo result scientists concluded rather genes female alone genes male alone reason pair infertile result relationship compatibility thus male genotypes may higher success rate fertilization female genotypes rather certain alleles paired together lead complete reproductive failureincompatibility result differential compatibility different another contributing factor incompatibility based surface carbohydrates multiple studies shown physical contact sperm egg cause chemical reaction reaction occurs egg comes contact noncompatible surface glycans impact sperm potential fertilization causing structural changes sperm surface numerous factors likewise contribute incompatibility male female haplotypes within example certain male drosophila melanogaster fruit flies carry drive allele average results producing less viable sperm counterparts heterozygous offspring heterozygous males less genetically competitive male female heterozygous offspring either inviable one example indirect non additive genes impact fertility comes team researchers investigated female rhodeus ocellatus rose bitterlings employ mate choice role mhc gene allowing females males mate collected dna adult bitterlings well data showed females likely choose males whose mhc gene dissimilar offspring came pair dissimilar mhc genes higher survival although researchers test theory speculated perhaps male courtship dissipates odor cues mhc gene assist female decisionmaking ddk lethal phenotype mus domesticus house mice leads developmental abnormalities eventually deterioration embryo females phenotype mate males carry inbred scientists discovered expression incompatibility within embryo depends paternal allele ddk paternal allele compatible meaning male carrying inbred strain ex ddk female x nonddk male embryo however male carries incompatible allele embryo genetic color polymorphisms genetically defined color forms animals part color morphs within population interbreed without issues however evidence shows certain cases viability interbred color morph offspring drastically lower present coloration pronounced exhibition certain phenotype individuals easily quickly differentiated human eye factors may affected easily group researchers investigated survival rates offspring erythrura gouldiae gouldian finch impacted mating pair genes different bred pure mixed pairs finches species gene producing redheaded finch dominant one produces black headed incubation eggs produced mixed pairs less likely hatch compared produced pure mixedpair offspring survive incubation stage still disadvantage burdened increase mortality time hatched days time still care even becoming independent offspring mortality mixed pairs still higher specifically rate mortality daughters mixedgenotypes much polyandry mating pattern identified species female mates two males period sexual females may engage behavior event singular mate genetically incompatible case would lose chance become pregnant season able try next mating creating offspring requires female allocate large portion resources formation partaking polyandry allows ensure offspring providing going viable waste time energy another experiment done gouldian finches researchers wanted determine effect compatibility incompatibility relationship socially monogamous pairs discovered participating extrapair mating relationships females able accurately target compatible genes thus increasing amount viable offspring researchers paired females compatible incompatible males social partner however also made available compatible incompatible males extrapair data collected revealed females mated outside pairs extrapair compatible unlike social partner female experienced increase offspring although females unable tell difference compatible incompatible partners participating polyandry likelihood yielding healthier offspring selfish genetic elements genes use various methods ensure transferred new selfish elements potential create genetic incompatibilities effects frequently depend interactions host genotype according whether selfish elements present debate whether selfish genetic elements actually influence postcopulatory sperm selection females go order determine best compatible match mice carry particular type selfish genetic element known segregation specific classification able establish offspring meiosis specific mice distorter carry known specific allele recessive lethal meaning serious effect fitness offspring well likely multiple experiments found males females avoid mating opposite sex heterozygous allele showed strong preference carriers mate heterozygous partner could potentially lead half offspring dying result lethal engineered genetic incompatibility egi technique developed manufacture incompatibility species order aid
