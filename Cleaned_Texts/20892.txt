cells developmental gene initially encodes prototypical caspase procaspase active cysteine residue cleaves aspartate residues thus becoming functional executioner caspase cysteinedependent aspartatedirected protease must dimerize initiated order become active series reactions ultimately lead apoptosis targeted programmed cell death c elegans occur embryonic postembryonic stages somatic
