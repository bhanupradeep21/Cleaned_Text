tarsiers ˈtɑːrsiərz tarseeərz haplorhine primates family tarsiidae lone extant family within infraorder tarsiiformes although group prehistorically globally widespread species living today restricted maritime southeast asia predominantly found brunei indonesia malaysia found primarily forested habitats especially forests liana since vine gives tarsiers vertical support climbing fossils tarsiiform primates found asia europe north america disputed fossils northern africa extant tarsiers restricted several southeast asian islands fossil record indicates dentition changed much except size past million years within family tarsiidae two extinct afrotarsius however placement afrotarsius sometimes listed family afrotarsiidae within infraorder considered anthropoid far four fossil species
