haplodiploidy sexdetermination system males develop unfertilized eggs haploid females develop fertilized eggs haplodiploidy sometimes called arrhenotoky haplodiploidy determines sex members insect orders hymenoptera bees ants thysanoptera system also occurs sporadically spider mites hemiptera coleoptera bark beetles rotifers system sex determined number sets chromosomes individual receives offspring formed union sperm egg develops female unfertilized egg develops male means males half number chromosomes female haploid haplodiploid sexdetermination system number peculiarities example male father sons grandfather grandsons additionally eusocialinsect colony one queen mated relatedness workers diploid females hive nest means workers monogamous singlequeen colonies significantly closely related sex determination systems relatedness siblings usually point drives kin selection theory eusociality whether haplodiploidy fact pave way evolution eusociality still matter another feature haplodiploidy system recessive lethal deleterious alleles removed population rapidly automatically expressed males dominant lethal deleterious alleles removed population every time arise kill individual arise haplodiploidy thing sexdetermination system haplodiploidy males receive one half chromosomes females receive including autosomes sexdetermination system males females receive equal number autosomes comes sex chromosomes females receive two x chromosomes males receive single x chromosome several models proposed genetic mechanisms haplodiploid sexdetermination model commonly referred complementary allele model according model individual heterozygous certain locus develops female whereas hemizygous homozygous individuals develop males words diploid offspring develop fertilized eggs normally female haploid offspring develop males unfertilized eggs diploid males would infertile cells would undergo meiosis form sperm therefore sperm would diploid means offspring would triploid since hymenopteran mother sons share genes may especially sensitive inbreeding inbreeding reduces number different sex alleles present population hence increasing occurrence diploid males mating fertile hymenopteran female stores sperm internal sac called spermatheca mated female controls release stored sperm within organ releases sperm egg passes oviduct egg social bees wasps ants modify sex ratios within colonies maximizes relatedness among members generates workforce appropriate surrounding solitary hymenopterans females lay unfertilized male eggs poorer food sources laying fertilized female eggs better food sources possibly fitness females adversely affected shortages early sex ratio manipulation also practiced haplodiploid ambrosia beetles lay male eggs chances males disperse mate females different sites honeybees drones males entirely derived queen mother diploid queen chromosomes haploid drones chromosomes drones produce sperm cells contain entire genome sperm genetically identical except mutations male bees genetic makeup therefore entirely derived mother genetic makeup female worker bees half derived mother half thus queen bee mates one drone two daughters share average genes diploid queens genome recombined daughters haploid fathers genome inherited daughters also possible laying worker bee lay unfertilised egg always male rare instances diploid drone larvae phenomenon usually arises two generations brothersister sex determination honey bees initially due single locus called complementary sex determiner csd gene developing bees conditions individual heterozygous csd gene develop females conditions individual hemizygous homozygous csd gene develop males instances individual homozygous gene instances diploid diploid males survive adulthood nurse worker bees cannibalize diploid males upon workers lay unfertilized eggs become sons haplodiploid sexdetermination system increases individuals fitness due indirect selection since worker related queens daughters sisters offspring helping queens offspring survive helps spread genes worker possesses efficiently direct batches worker bees short lived constantly replaced next batch kin selection possibly strategy ensure proper working hive however since queens usually mate dozen drones workers full sisters due separate storage drone sperm specific batch brood may closely related specific batch brood laid later date however many species bees including bumblebees bombus terrestris means sisters almost always related one another would offspring thus eliminating conflict variable relatedness present wasps genus nasonia noncsd method sex determination documented recent accepted model noncsd system called maternal effect genomic imprinting sex determination megisd model involves masculinizingvirilizing maternal effect gene imprints upon cytoplasmic component oocytes unimprinted paternal contribution female offspring provides counter effect virilization allows female development occur since diploid eggs become female due factor originating male genetic contribution prevents masculinization differs csd csd diploid eggs become males homozygous relatedness used calculate strength kin selection via hamiltons haplodiploidy hypothesis proposes unusual relatedness coefficient amongst full haplodiploid sisters responsible frequency evolution eusocial behavior eusocial worker helping mother birth sisters propagates genes reproduced normal sexual reproduction father two sets chromosomes crossing takes place chromatids pair meiosis produces sperm therefore sperms identical chromosome pair different alleles many loci father haploid sperms identical except small number gene mutations taken place germ line female offspring inherit males chromosomes intact long female mated one male daughters share complete set chromosomes male hymenoptera males generally produce enough sperm last female whole lifetime single mating event relatedness coefficients haplodiploid organisms follows assuming female mated ratios apply example throughout bee hive unless laying workers produce offspring males unfertilised eggs case average relatedness lower shown assumption mothers mate sisters strongly related daughters fact used explain evolution eusociality many hymenopterans however colonies workers multiple queens queens mated multiple times
