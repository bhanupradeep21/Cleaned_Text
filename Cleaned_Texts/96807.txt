admiraltys timber choice mast construction however finding supply chain obstructed admiraltys second choice north american white pine shipload received jamestown another penobscot bay found agreeable disagreement amongst scholars variety strongest however north american white pine considered resilient one fourth lighter weight exponentially larger reaching height feet several feet diameter base weighing much accordingly admiralty sent fleet mast ships thus began britains steady importation new england masts following development new englands shipbuilding industry became common british retail
