possessed level bacteriostatic activity almost medically relevant aerobic anaerobic bacterial genera grampositive gramnegative exceptions pseudomonas aeruginosa proteus spp display intrinsic resistance however acquired opposed inherent resistance proliferated many pathogenic organisms greatly eroded formerly vast versatility group antibiotics resistance amongst staphylococcus spp
