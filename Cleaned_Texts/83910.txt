phagocytosis ancient greek φαγεῖν phagein eat κύτος kytos cell process cell uses plasma membrane engulf large particle μm giving rise internal compartment called phagosome one type endocytosis cell performs phagocytosis called phagocyte multicellular organisms immune system phagocytosis major mechanism used remove pathogens cell debris ingested material digested phagosome bacteria dead tissue cells small mineral particles examples objects may phagocytized protozoa use phagocytosis means obtain nutrients history phagocytosis represents scientific establishment immunology process first immune response mechanism discovered understood earliest definitive account cell eating given swiss scientist albert von kölliker report zeitschrift für wissenschaftliche zoologie kölliker described

oxidative burst highly monocytes macrophages mature leave blood circulation migrate tissues resident cells form resting macrophages initiate phagocytosis mannose receptors scavenger receptors fcγ
