psychology behavioral economics endowment effect also known divestiture aversion related mere ownership effect social finding people likely retain object acquire object endowment theory defined application prospect theory positing loss aversion associated ownership explains observed exchange typically illustrated two valuation paradigm peoples maximum willingness pay wtp acquire object typically lower least amount willing accept wta give object cause attachment even item obtained minutes exchange paradigm people given good reluctant trade another good similar value example participants first given pen equal expected value coffee mug generally unwilling trade whilst participants first given coffee mug also unwilling trade controversial third paradigm used elicit endowment effect mere ownership paradigm primarily used experiments psychology marketing organizational behavior paradigm people randomly assigned receive good owners evaluate positively people randomly assigned receive good distinction paradigm first two incentivecompatible words participants explicitly incentivized reveal extent truly like value good endowment effect equated behavioural model willingness accept pay wtap formula sometimes used find much consumer person willing put lose different outcomes however model come recent criticism potentially one famous examples endowment effect literature study daniel kahneman jack knetsch richard cornell undergraduates given mug offered chance sell trade equally valued alternative pens found amount participants required compensation mug ownership mug established willingness accept approximately twice high amount willing pay acquire mug willingness pay examples endowment effect include work ziv carmon dan found participants hypothetical selling price willingness accept wta ncaa final four tournament tickets times higher hypothetical buying price willingness pay wtp also work hossain list working paper discussed economist

populations including great new world endowment effect observed ancient times things differently valued wish get belongs us give away always seems precious us psychologists first noted difference consumers wtp wta early term endowment effect however first explicitly coined economist richard thaler reference underweighting opportunity costs well inertia introduced consumers choice processes goods included endowment become highly valued goods time thalers conceptualisation endowment effect direct contrast accepted economic theory assumed humans completely rational making decisions contrasting viewpoint thaler able offer clearer understanding humans make economic years followed extensive investigations endowment effect conducted producing wealth interesting empirical theoretical leading explanation aforementioned wtpwta gap loss aversion first linked kahneman colleagues selling endowment means loss object humans aligned lossaverse less utility obtained aquirement go suggest endowment effect considered facet lossaversion would thus violate coase theorem described inconsistent standard economic theory asserts persons willingness pay wtp good equal willingness accept wta compensation deprived good hypothesis underlies consumer theory indifference curves another aspect loss aversion exhibited within endowment effect opportunity costs often undervalued overcharging selling item stems fixation losing item rather unattained gain sale falls correlation two theories high endowment effect often seen presentation loss aversion riskless setting however claims disputed researchers claim psychological differences reference prices relied buyers ownership attribution item self loss aversion key david gal proposed psychological inertia account endowment account sellers require higher price part object buyers willing pay neither welldefined precise valuation object therefore range prices neither buyers sellers much incentive trade example case kahneman et als classic mug experiments sellers demanded part mug whereas buyers willing pay average acquire mug likely range prices mug left buyers sellers without much incentive either acquire part buyers sellers therefore maintained status quo inertia conversely high price yielded meaningful incentive owner part mug likewise relatively low price less yielded meaningful incentive buyer acquire mug according

endowment effect review see morewedge giblin work morewedge shu gilbert wilson provides support theories work maddux et al example research participants given one mug asked much would pay second mug ownerbuyers wtp much ownerssellers another group participants given mug asked much wta sell groups valued mug question buyers given others argued short duration ownership highly prosaic items typically used endowment effect type studies sufficient produce connection conducting research demonstrating support points eg liersch rottenstreich working paper two paths attachment selfassociations

memory goods goods selfreferential memory effect owned goods may act thus endogenous framing effect transaction attributes good may accessible owners attributes transaction goods positive negative features accessibility bias result owners positively evaluating goods sellers may dictate price based desires multiple potential buyers whereas buyers may consider taste lead differences buying selling prices market price typically higher ones idiosyncratic price estimate according account endowment effect viewed underpricing buyers compared market price overpricing sellers compared individual taste two recent lines study support argument weaver frederick presented participants retail prices products asked specify either buying selling price products results revealed sellers valuations closer known retail prices buyers second line studies metaanalysis buying selling review empirical studies showed selling prices closer lotterys expected value normative price lottery hence endowment effect consistent buyers tendency underprice lotteries compared normative price one possible reason tendency buyers indicate lower prices risk aversion contrast sellers may assume market heterogeneous enough include buyers potential risk neutrality therefore adjust price closer risk neutral expected value several cognitive accounts endowment effect suggest induced way endowment status changes search attention recollection weighting information regarding transaction frames evoked acquisition good eg buying choosing rather another good may increase cognitive accessibility information favoring decision keep ones money acquire good contrast frames evoked disposition good eg selling may increase cognitive accessibility information favoring decision keep good rather trade dispose money review see morewedge giblin example johnson colleagues found prospective mug buyers tended recall reasons keep money recalling reasons buy mug whereas sellers tended recall reasons keep mug reasons sell money huck kirchsteiger oechssler raised hypothesis natural selection may favor individuals whose preferences embody endowment effect given may improve ones bargaining position bilateral trades thus small tribal society alternative sellers ie buyer may option moving alternative seller predisposition towards embodying endowment effect may evolutionarily beneficial may linked findings shogren et al suggest endowment effect less strong relatively artificial sense scarcity induced experimental settings lessened countervailing evidence evolutionary account provided studies showing endowment effect moderated exposure modern exchange markets eg hunter gatherer tribes market exposure likely exhibit endowment effect tribes endowment effect moderated culture maddux et al economists questioned effects hanemann noted economic theory suggests wtp wta equal goods close substitutes observed differences measures goods environmental resources personal health explained without reference endowment effect shogren et al noted experimental technique used kahneman knetsch thaler demonstrate endowment effect created situation artificial scarcity performed robust experiment goods used kahneman knetsch thaler chocolate bars mugs found little evidence endowment effect substitutable goods acknowledging endowment effect valid goods without earth resources example others argued use hypothetical questions experiments involving small amounts money tells us little actual behavior eg hoffman spitzer p n research supporting points eg kahneman knetsch thaler harless others eg knez smith williams recently plott zeiler challenged endowment effect theory arguing observed disparities wta wtp measures reflective human preferences rather disparities stem faulty experimental implications regarding endowment effect present individual corporate level presence cause market inefficiencies value irregularities buyers sellers similar consequences smaller upscaled herbert hovenkamp argued presence endowment effect significant implications law economics particularly regard welfare economics argues presence endowment effect indicates person indifference curve see however hanemann rendering neoclassical tools welfare analysis useless concluding courts instead use wta measure value fischel however raises counterpoint using wta measure value would deter development nations infrastructure economic growth endowment effect changes shape indifference curves similarly another study focused strategic reallocations endowment analyses case economicss agents welfare could potentially increase change endowment holding endowment effect linked economic psychological impacts various scale example often individuals refuse sale house upscale expected value simply due emotional attachment effort poured means might either stick property causes greater inconvenience alternatives increased level difficulties associated either scenarios negatively impact relevant economy individuals mental welfare alternatively buyer subject purchasing item wta level set market price subject overspending positively impacts economy whilst potentially reducing individual welfare yet recent years endowment effect largely leveraged within ecommerce businesses expanded rapidly previous years effective integration marketing products consumers often given sense ownership business
