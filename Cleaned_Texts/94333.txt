risk assessment one study relative risk incident coronary events higher among participants high genetic risk among low genetic cardiovascular disease may preventable established risk factors prevention involves adequate physical exercise decreasing obesity treating high blood pressure eating healthy diet decreasing cholesterol levels stopping smoking medications exercise roughly equally high levels physical activity reduce risk coronary artery disease lifes essential key measures improving maintaining cardiovascular health defined american heart association aha added sleep factor influencing heart health guidelines recommend combining preventive strategies cochrane review found evidence counseling education bring behavioral change might help highrisk groups however insufficient evidence show effect mortality actual cardiovascular diabetes mellitus little evidence tight blood sugar control improves cardiac risk although improved sugar control appears decrease problems kidney failure diet high fruits vegetables decreases risk cardiovascular disease vegetarians lower risk heart possibly due greater consumption fruits evidence also suggests mediterranean high fiber diet lower consumption trans fat commonly found hydrogenated products margarine shown cause precursor increase risk coronary artery evidence support beneficial role fatty acid supplementation preventing cardiovascular disease including myocardial infarction sudden cardiac tentative evidence intake menaquinone vitamin phylloquinone vitamin may reduce risk cad secondary prevention preventing sequelae already established disease effective lifestyle changes include aerobic exercise like walking jogging swimming reduce risk mortality coronary artery aerobic exercise help decrease blood
