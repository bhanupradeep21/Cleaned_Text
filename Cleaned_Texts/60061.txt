fibroadenomas benign breast tumours characterized admixture stromal epithelial tissue breasts made lobules milk producing glands ducts tubes carry milk nipple surrounded glandular fibrous fatty tissues fibroadenomas develop lobules glandular tissue ducts grow lobule form solid lump since fibroadenomas breast lumps sign breast cancer appear similar recommended perform ultrasound analyses possibly tissue sampling subsequent histopathologic analysis order make proper diagnosis unlike typical lumps breast cancer fibroadenomas easy move clearly defined fibroadenomas sometimes called breast mice breast mouse owing high mobility fibroadenomas benign tumours breast often present women clinically fibroadenomas usually solid breast lumps people simple fibroadenoma likely increased risk developing malignant harmful breast cancer compared general complex fibroadenomas may increase risk breast cancer male breast fibroepithelial tumors rare mostly phyllodes tumors exceptionally rare case reports exist fibroadenomas male breast however cases may associated antiandrogen cause fibroadenoma unknown connection fibroadenomas reproductive hormones suggested may explain present reproductive years increase size pregnancy regress higher intake fruits vegetables higher number live births lower use oral contraceptives moderate exercise associated lower frequency diagnostic

physical examinations performed every months optional diagnostic imaging performed every months generally surgery recommended fibroadenoma gets larger causes increased removed small margin normal
