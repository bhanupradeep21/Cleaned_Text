hypothesized physiological aspects dimetrodon haack found sail allowed dimetrodon warm faster morning reach slightly higher body temperature day ineffective releasing excess heat allow dimetrodon retain higher body temperature group mechanical engineers created computer model analyze ability sail regulate body temperature different seasons concluded sail beneficial capturing releasing heat times studies give two thermoregulatory roles sail dimetrodon one means warming quickly morning another way cool body temperature becomes high dimetrodon early permian land vertebrates assumed
