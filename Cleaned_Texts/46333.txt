counterfactual thinking concept psychology involves human tendency create possible alternatives life events already occurred something contrary actually happened counterfactual thinking states counter thoughts consist occur thinking things could turned differently counterfactual thoughts include things present could happened dependent events occur term counterfactual defined merriamwebster dictionary contrary counterfactual thought occurs person modifies factual prior event assesses consequences person may imagine outcome could turned differently antecedents led event different example person may reflect upon car accident could turned imagining factors could different example hadnt speeding alternatives better worse actual situation turn give improved disastrous possible outcomes hadnt speeding car wouldnt wrecked hadnt wearing seatbelt would counterfactual thoughts shown produce negative emotions however may also produce functional beneficial effects two types counterfactual thoughts downward upward downward counterfactuals thoughts situation could worse people tend positive view actual outcome upward counterfactuals thoughts situation could better kinds thoughts tend make people feel dissatisfied unhappy however upward counterfactuals kind thoughts allow people think better counterfactual thoughts thoughts could happened affect peoples emotions causing experience regret guilt relief satisfaction also affect view social situations deserves blame counterfactual thinking philosophical roots traced back early philosophers aristotle plato pondered epistemological status subjunctive suppositions nonexistent feasible seventeenth century german philosopher leibniz argued could infinite number alternate worlds long conflict laws philosopher nicholas rescher well others written interrelationship counterfactual reasoning modal relationship may also exploited literature victorian studies painting ruth mj byrne rational imagination people create alternatives reality proposed mental representations cognitive processes underlie imagination alternatives reality similar underlie rational thought including reasoning counterfactual conditionals recently counterfactual thinking gained interest psychological perspective cognitive scientists examined mental representations cognitive processes underlie creation daniel kahneman amos tversky pioneered study counterfactual thought showing people tend think often exceptional events normal many related tendencies since examined eg whether event action inaction whether controllable place temporal order events causal relation social psychologists studied cognitive functioning counterfactuals larger social early research counterfactual thinking took perspective kinds thoughts indicative poor coping skills psychological error bias generally dysfunctional research developed new wave insight beginning began taking functional perspective believing counterfactual thinking served largely beneficial behavioral regulator although negative feelings biases arise overall benefit positive human two portions counterfactual thinking activation content activation portion whether allow counterfactual thought seep conscious thought content portion creates end scenario counterfactual activation portion raises question allow think alternatives could beneficial harmful us believed humans tend think counterfactual ideas exceptional circumstances led event thus could avoided first place also tend create counterfactual ideas feel guilty situation wish exert control example study davis et al parents suffered death infant likely counterfactual think months later felt guilty incident unusual circumstances surrounding death case death due natural causes parents tended counterfactual think less course another factor determines much use counterfactual thought close alternative outcome especially true negative outcome close positive outcome example study meyerslevy maheswaran subjects likely counterfactual think alternative circumstances target person house burned three days forgot renew insurance versus six months forgot renew thehir insurance therefore idea outcome almost occurred plays role reason emphasize one may wonder continue think counterfactual ways thoughts tend make us feel guilty negatively outcome one functional reasons avoid making mistakes future person able consider another outcome based different path may take path future avoid undesired outcome past changed similar situations may occur future thus take counterfactual thoughts learning example person poor job interview thinks may successful responded confident manner likely respond confidently next interview another reason continue use counterfactual theory avoid situations may unpleasant us part approach avoidance behavior often people make conscious effort avoid situations may make feel unpleasant however despite best efforts sometimes find unpleasant situations anyway situations continue use counterfactual thinking think ways event could avoided turn learn avoid situations example person finds hospitals uncomfortable place find one due cutting finger dishes may think ways could avoided going hospital tending wound dishes carefully continue use counterfactual thoughts change future behavior way positive behavior intention involve making change behavior immediately negative event occurred actively making behavioral change completely avoiding problem future example forgetting mothers day immediately writing date calendar following year avoid sense behavior intention people tend use counterfactual thinking goaldirected activity studies shown counterfactuals serve preparative function individuals groups people fail achieve goals counterfactual thinking may activated eg studying disappointing engage upward counterfactual thinking people able imagine alternatives better positive outcomes outcome seems worse compared positive alternative outcomes realization motivates take positive action order meet goal markman gavanski sherman mcmullen identified repeatability event important factor determining function used events happen repeatedly eg sports increased motivation imagine alternative antecedents order prepare better future outcome onetime events however opportunity improve future performance exist likely person try alleviate disappointment imagining things could worse direction counterfactual statement also indicative function may used upward counterfactuals greater preparative function focus future improvement downward counterfactuals used coping mechanism affective function furthermore additive counterfactuals shown greater potential induce behavioral intentions improving hence counterfactual thinking motivates individuals goaloriented actions order attain failed goal future hand group level counterfactual thinking lead collective action according milesi catellani political activists exhibit group commitment likely reengage collective action following collective defeat show engaging counterfactual thinking unlike cognitive processes involved individual level abstract counterfactuals lead increase group identification positively correlated collective action intention increase group identification impacts peoples feelings abstract counterfactuals also lead increase group efficacy translates belief group ability change outcomes situations turn motivates group members make groupbased actions attain goal thinking downward counterfactual thinking ways situation could turned worse people tend feel sense relief example getting car accident somebody thinks least wasnt speeding car would totaled allows consideration positives situation rather negatives case upward counterfactual thinking people tend feel negative feelings eg regret disappointment situation thinking manner people focus ways situation could turned positively example studied wouldnt failed many cognitive processes research seeks gain better insight functions outcomes counterfactual thinking research investigating various effects might alter contribute counterfactual thinking one study rim summerville investigated distance event terms time distance affect counterfactual process results showed people generated downward counterfactuals recentpast events tended generate upward counterfactuals distantpast events consistent replications social distance well also examine possible mechanism manipulating social distance effect could responding negative events either selfimprovement selfenhancement research scholl sassenberg looked determine perceived power situation affect counterfactual thought process associated understanding future directions outlooks research examined manipulating perceived power individual given circumstance lead different thoughts reflections research demonstrated powerless vs powerful diminished selffocused counterfactual thinking lowering sensed personal control results may show relationship self perceives events determines best course action future proposed approach counterfactual reasoning two phases first uses matrix representation logical operations see vector logic inspired neural models distributed memories logical operators real matrices truth values also vectors real components counterfactual propositions virtualized premultiplying counterfactual values operator created domain quantum computing square root procedure produces logic vectors complex field combine falsehood truth evaluation second phase physical plausibility logical consistency counterfactual propositions estimated plausibility operator obtained returns complex values domain real numbers helps decide counterfactual proposition true false upward counterfactual thinking focuses situation could better many times people think could done differently example started studying three days ago instead last night could done better test since people often think could done differently uncommon people feel regret upward counterfactual thinking downward counterfactual thinking focuses situation could worse scenario person make feel better outcome realize situation worst could example im lucky earned c didnt start studying last counterfactual statement may involve addition subtraction event additive statement involves engaging event originally occur eg taken medicine whereas subtractive statement involves removing event took place eg never started additive counterfactuals frequent subtractive additive upward counterfactual thinking focuses else could done better subtractive upward counterfactual thinking focuses shouldnt done could better contrast additive downward scenario would went drinking last night well would done worse subtractive downward scenario would didnt start studying two days ago would done distinction simply refers whether counterfactual actions self eg slowed someone elses actions eg driver slowed self counterfactuals prevalent person focused construal level theory explains self counterfactuals prevalent event question psychologically closer event others kahneman miller proposed norm theory theoretical basis describe rationale counterfactual thoughts norm theory suggests ease imagining different outcome determines counterfactual alternatives created norms involve pairwise comparison cognitive standard experiential outcome discrepancy elicits affective response influenced magnitude direction example server makes twenty dollars average night positive feeling evoked student earns lower grade typical negative feeling evoked generally upward counterfactuals likely result negative mood downward counterfactuals elicit positive kahneman miller also introduced concept mutability describe ease difficulty cognitively altering given outcome immutable outcome eg gravity difficult modify cognitively whereas mutable outcome eg speed easier cognitively modify events lie somewhere middle mutable antecedents outcome greater availability counterfactual wells gavanski studied counterfactual thinking terms mutability causality event antecedent considered causal mutating event lead undoing outcome events mutable others exceptional events eg taking unusual route getting accident mutable normal events eg taking usual route getting mutability however may pertain exceptional cases eg car controllable events eg intentional decision typically mutable uncontrollable events eg natural short greater number alternative outcomes constructed unexpected event stronger emotional reaction elicited byrne outlined set cognitive principles guide possibilities people think imagine alternative experiments show people tend think realistic possibilities rather unrealistic possibilities tend think possibilities rather counterfactuals special part require people think least two possibilities reality alternative reality think possibility false temporarily assumed experiments corroborated proposal principles guide possibilities people think readily explain tendencies focus example exceptional events rather normal actions rather recent events rather earlier events functional theory looks counterfactual thinking cognitive processes benefit people counterfactuals serve preparative function help people avoid past counterfactual thinking also serves affective function make person feel better comparing ones present outcome less desirable outcome person may feel better current situation example disappointed runner win race may feel better saying least come last although counterfactual thinking largely adaptive functionality exceptions individuals experiencing severe depressive symptoms perceptions control diminished negative selfperceptions low selfefficacy result motivation selfimprovement weakened even depressed individuals focus controllable events counterfactuals less reasonable epstude roese propose excessive counterfactual thoughts lead people worry problems increase distress individuals heavily focused improving outcomes likely engage maladaptive counterfactual thinking behavior procrastination may lead less effective counterfactual thinking procrastinators show tendency produce downward counterfactuals upward counterfactuals result tend become complacent lack motivation perfectionists another group counterfactual thinking may tshilidzi marwala introduced rational counterfactual counterfactual given factual maximizes attainment desired consequent example suppose factual statement forgot set alarm consequently late counterfactual would set alarm would time theory rational counterfactuals identifies antecedent gives desired consequent necessary rational decision making example suppose explosion chemical plant rational counterfactual situation ensure possibility explosion case olympic medalists counterfactual thinking explains bronze medalists often satisfied outcome silver medalists counterfactual thoughts silver medalists tend focus close gold medal displaying upward counterfactually thinking whereas bronze medalists tend counterfactual think could received medal displaying downward counterfactual another example satisfaction college students grades medvec savitsky studied satisfaction college students based whether grade barely missed cut versus barely made cutoff category students barely made grade category tended downward counterfactual think satisfied thinking could worse students tended think terms least students extremely close making next higher category showed higher dissatisfaction tended upward counterfactual think focus situation could better students tended think terms could httpsenwikipediaorgwikicounterfactualthinking
