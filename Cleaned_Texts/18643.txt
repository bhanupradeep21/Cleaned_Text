karrikins group plant growth regulators found smoke burning plant karrikins help stimulate seed germination plant development mimic signaling hormone known strigolactone strigolactones hormones help increase growth symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi soil enhances plant growth leads increase plant smoke wildfires bushfires known long time stimulate germination butenolide karrikinolide shown responsible later several closely related compounds discovered smoke collectively known karrikins formed heating combustion carbohydrates including sugars polysaccharides mainly plant material burns carbohydrates convert karrikins burning plant products straw filter paper cigarettes sugars also produce karrikins seed germination activity generated within minutes heating plant material pyran moiety karrikins probably directly derived pyranose sugar evidence karrikins occur naturally plants postulated karrikinlike molecules long known compounds released smoke stimulate seed germination identify active compounds contribute seed germination activity smoke compounds separated liquid fractionation tested effects seed germination activity bioassays identified several related compounds named six karrikins far discovered smoke designated active also known karrikinolode first karrikin karrikins released air upon burning plants subsequently karrikins get deposited soil surface stimulate seed germination rainfall since karrikins released smoke released huge plants known firefollowers unable germinate without karrikins firefollowers need rain massive fires order germinate means may remain dormant viable decades right combination fire occur proper first karrikin discovered abbreviated initially named gavinone reference discovery chemist gavin flematti consulting

flowering families like tomatoes lettuce trees respond karrikin studies found seed ostensibly fireadapted species display sensitivity difference firefollowers plants respond karrikins dependence plants response karrikins fundamental karrikins mimic strigolactone hormones originally required growth plants firefollowers hand finetuned responses according availability carbon hydrogen oxygen make two ring structures found karrikins one sixmembered heterocyclic ring molecular formula known pyrancitation needed fivemembered lactone ring known karrikins easily dissolve water transparent melting point however unstable high temperatures common daylight means decay rapidly common active compounds sensitive mode action karrikins largely determined using genetic resources arabidopsis thaliana perception karrikins arabidopsis requires alphabetafold hydrolase named protein catalytic triad amino acids essential activity consistent hypothesis hydrolyses model consistent perception chemically related strigolactone hormones involves hydrolysis receptor protein alphabeta hydrolase related question whether karrikins act directly plants controversial studies suggest karrikins bind directly others support possible karrikins produced wildfires converted different compound plant interaction ability different plants carry conversion could partly explain differences ability respond karrikins smoke activity karrikins requires fbox protein named axillary protein also required strigolactone signaling arabidopsis homologs also required strigolactone signaling rice known petunia pea karrikin signaling also requires protein named suppressor axilary homolog protein required strigolactone signaling proteins could involved control cellular functions transport present model karrikin strigolactone signaling involves interaction proteins respectively targets proteins ubiquitination arabidopsis shown respond two signals needed two genes axillary essential understanding actions karrikins discovered arabidopsis mutants failed respond karrikins rice strigolactones interact fbox protein knowns upon hydrolysis also known proteins interaction targets ubiquitination destruction proteins responsible different aspect plant growth like outgrowth lateral shoots means strigolactones upon interaction ubiquinate destroy proteins like responsible outgrowth lateral shoots inhibition stem thickening root arabidopsis karrikins work similar way strigolactones require homologous proteins known order able interact responsible hypocotyl elongation inhibition seed germination ubiquination therefore stimulate seed germination inhibits hypocotyl karrikins could used agriculturesclarification needed considering environmental challenges occurring karrikins stimulate seed germination reported increase seedling arabidopsis karrikins influence seedling photomorphogenesis resulting shorter hypocotyls larger cotyledons responses could provide seedlings advantage emerge postfire landscape protein also required leaf development implying karrikins could influence aspects plant growth gene protein present lower plants including algae mosses whereas protein evolved seed plants probably result duplication followed functional specialisation karrikin signaling could evolved seed plants result divergence functions possibly cretaceous period fires common karrikins produced wildfires seed plants contain proteins raising question usual function protein compelling evidence plants contain endogenous compound perceived control seed germination plant development
