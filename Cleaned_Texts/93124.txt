runoff transcription assay assay molecular biology conducted vitro identify position transcription start site base pair upstream specific promoter along accuracy rate vitro runoff transcription used quantitatively measure effect changing promoter regions vitro transcription vitro nature however assay accurately predict cellspecific gene transcription rates unlike vivo assays nuclear perform runoff transcription assay gene interest including promoter cloned plasmid digested known restriction enzyme cut site downstream transcription start site expected mrna runoff product would easily separated gel dna needs highly purified prior running initiate transcription radiolabeled utp nucleotides rna polymerase added linearized transcription continues rna polymerase reaches end dna simply runs dna template resulting mrna fragment defined fragment separated gel electrophoresis alongside size standards corresponding size band represent size mrna restriction enzyme cut site transcription start site intensity band indicate amount mrna additionally used detect whether transcription carried certain conditions ie presence different httpsenwikipediaorgwikirunofftranscription
