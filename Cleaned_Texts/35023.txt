contrastenhanced ultrasound ceus application ultrasound contrast medium traditional medical sonography ultrasound contrast agents rely different ways sound waves reflected interfaces substances may surface small air bubble complex structure commercially available contrast media gasfilled microbubbles administered intravenously systemic circulation microbubbles high degree echogenicity ability object reflect ultrasound waves great difference echogenicity gas microbubbles soft tissue surroundings body thus ultrasonic imaging using microbubble contrast agents enhances ultrasound backscatter reflection ultrasound waves produce sonogram increased contrast due high echogenicity difference contrastenhanced ultrasound used image blood perfusion organs measure blood flow rate heart organs
