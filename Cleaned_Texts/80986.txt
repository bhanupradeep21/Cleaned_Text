history perpetual motion machines dates least back middle ages millennia clear whether perpetual motion devices possible modern theories thermodynamics shown impossible despite many attempts made construct machines continuing modern times modern designers proponents sometimes use terms overunity describe inventions perpetuum mobile villard de honnecourt wheel taccola orffyreus mersseburgische perpetuum mobile boyles perpetual motion scheme two types perpetual motion machines unsourced perpetual motion machine called magic wheel wheel spinning axle powered lodestones appeared bavaria historical claim appears unsubstantiated though often repeated early designs perpetual motion machines done indian bhaskara ii described wheel bhāskaras wheel claimed would run drawing perpetual
