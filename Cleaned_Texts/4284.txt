conversational constraints theory developed minsun kimclarification needed attempts explain certain conversational strategies differ across various cultures effects differences embedded social science communication approach based upon culture influences communication five universal conversational constraints clarity minimizing imposition consideration others feelings risking negative evaluation receiver effectiveness five constraints pivot notion culture social relational collectivistic cultures task oriented individualistic cultures social relational approach focuses concern receivers feelings holding importance upon saving face person concise constructing messages social relational approach takes account words actions affect listeners feelings task oriented approach emphasizes concern clarity feelings places higher value degree message communicated explicitly truest form cultures specific manners behaviors pertain conversational style behaviors preferred cultures offensive others conversational constraints theory seeks explain certain tactics work cultures others influenced customs rules norms culture central focus conversational constraints theory necessarily said said conversations typically goaloriented require coordination communicators messages developed built upon various constraints personal cultural order pursue kind interaction kim discusses need approval need dominance gender roles analyze conversational constraints approval person needs thus feminine view minimizing imposition concerned hearers feelings important dominant thus masculine view message clarity directness important concern effectiveness constraint universally important amongst cultures focused influence message receiver extent effectiveness explains capability well content message conveyed listener style verbal deliverance soft punctual effectiveness pertains potency message strong weak powerful ineffective weighty superficial collectivistic cultures tend use effectiveness within conversations diffused watereddown lessen negativity offense aspect effectiveness ease cushion message spoken structured way minimize dissonance costs hand individualistic cultures maximize punctuality effectiveness delivering message tone message focuses directness frankness straightforward listener intend bluntly honest order effective individualistic cultures generally concerned listeners feelings sacrifices effectiveness message clarity defined likelihood utterance making one intention clear explicit clarity important part conversation order conversation flow properly communication needs clear precise person trying communicate specific message explicitly uses direct imperatives ensure proper message carried hearer person attempting use hint strategy message less clear intent communicated explicitly therefore derivable literal meaning utterances kim proposes taskoriented constraints emphasize concern clarity example taskoriented constraints measure degree intentions messages communicated explicitly comparing collectivistic cultures individualistic cultures members individualistic cultures consider clarity significant members collectivistic aspiring goals members individualistic cultures thresholds exploit attention clarity members collectivistic cultures individuals display independent interdependent selfconstruals present different views importance clarity instance individuals exhibit independent selfconstruals perceive clarity significant pursuing goals individuals stimulate interdependent selfconstruals individuals display independent interdependent selfconstruals focus relational clarity restraints hand individuals exercise independent interdependent selfconstruals visualize clarity relational constraints imperative help explain conversational constraints kim uses need approval need dominance gender roles need dominance gender roles apply clarity conversational constraint instance individuals possess dominance greater emphasis placed clarity also importance clarity exhibited need masculine different displays clarity provide evidence kims conversational constraints communicating another person individuals take account listeners feelings people acknowledge intended action going affect feelings person concern speaker displays hearer relates speaker feels necessary order help hearer maintain positive self images positive face identity goals concern support three labels help determine degree strategy shows consideration hearers feelings person requests explicit action possesses higher chance hurting listeners feelings hand communicating hint sends implicit message thus delivering message successfully compared taskoriented constraints social relational constraints stress concern others withdrawing injuring hearers feelings strongly concerned communication may affect hearers reflect concern successfully accomplish communicative goals communicative goals affect hearers still thus threatening autonomy found collectivism influences importance members cultures place relational concerns conversation kim therefore members culture place emphasis facesupporting behaviors avoiding harming others feelings members pursuing goals compared members individualistic cultures members higher thresholds face support select strategies maximize face support kim individuals highlight interdependent selfconstruals want avoid face loss much possible want feel welcomed particular social groups individuals see avoiding hurt feelings significant individuals use independent selfconstruals individuals feminine need approval others tend put focus concern others dominant individuals element essential component within conversational constraints theory emphasizes role minimizing imposition theory discusses crosscultural differences observed studying communicative strategies different cultures instance members within collectivistic cultures view facesupporting behavior one way done minimizing imposition important component member pursuit goal ample reason believe individualistic cultures hand consider facesupporting behaviors important goal oriented behavior conversational constraints theory suggests feminine individuals place value minimizing imposition contrast individuals masculine tend place less value minimizing imposition addition theory also reports individual requires approval within given context higher amount importance place minimizing imposition occurs individuals minimizing imposition hearers socialrelational conversational constraint addition occur taskoriented conversational constraint returning issue research conversational constraints across different cultures researchers noted specific concerns addressed concerns found recent studies conversational constraints across different cultures current research suggests concern avoiding negative evaluation hearer one three concerns observed research studies instances particular conversational constraint occurs speaker within conversation makes attempt avoid negative evaluation individual hearing speakers message concern avoiding negative evaluation hearer conversation explains plausible reason explains individuals attempt conduct behavior ways avoid devaluation others within conversation example person might try make good first impression seek approval interview using strategies avoid negative evaluation individual conducting interview among various cultures conversational constraints studied individualistic cultures shown differences comparison types cultures individualistic cultures focused amount clarity within conversational constraint less concerned avoiding negative evaluation hearer contrast collectivistic cultures concerned behaviors include avoiding negative evaluation hearer minimizing imposition constraints considered facesupporting behavior httpsenwikipediaorgwikiconversationalconstraintstheory
