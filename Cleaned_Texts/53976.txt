depending metabolic primarily liver metabolizes absorbed xylitol main metabolic route humans occurs cytoplasm via nonspecific naddependent dehydrogenase polyol dehydrogenase transforms xylitol dxylulose specific xylulokinase phosphorylates goes pentose phosphate pathway eaten xylitol absorbed via intestines remaining absorbed intestines humans xylitol remaining gut fermented gut bacteria shortchain organic acids gases may produce flatulence remnant unabsorbed xylitol escapes fermentation excreted unchanged mostly feces less g xylitol every g ingested excreted via xylitol ingestion also increases motilin secretion may related xylitols ability cause lessdigestible fermentable nature xylitol also contributes constipation relieving research identified carbohydrates oral bacteria tooth anatomy along time interaction main pathobiological etiology dental caries sucrose deemed cariogenic carbohydrate consumed humans substrate various oral bacteria produce insoluble polysaccharides streptococcus mutans major pathological bacterium synthesises polysaccharides glucans sucrose adhere tooth surfaces resultant thick plaque becomes anaerobic plaque bacteria ferment sugars produce acidic environment dissolving outer tooth xylitol sugar alcohol containing carbonpolyol metabolized via phosphoenolpyruvatephosphotransferase pathway mutans produces competes phosphofructokinase therefore results inhibition glycolysis via accumulation long periods xylitol use mutans alters enzymatic chewing gums containing xylitol sorbitol may affect caries
