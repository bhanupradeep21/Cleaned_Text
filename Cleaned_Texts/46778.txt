blastocystosis refers medical condition caused infection blastocystis blastocystis protozoal singlecelled parasite inhabits gastrointestinal tracts humans animals many different types blastocystis exist infect humans farm animals birds rodents amphibians reptiles fish even cockroaches blastocystosis found possible risk factor development irritable bowel researchers published conflicting reports concerning whether blastocystis causes symptoms humans one earliest reports incidence reports associated symptoms began increase physicians saudi arabia reporting symptoms us physicians reporting symptoms individuals travel less developed lively debate ensued early physicians objecting publication reports blastocystis caused researchers believe debate resolved finding multiple species blastocystis infect humans causing symptoms others harmless see genetics symptomscitation needed commonly reported symptoms less commonly reported symptoms include researchers sought develop models understand variety symptoms seen humans patients symptoms others report severe diarrhea fatiguecitation needed number researchers investigated possibility species blastocystis virulent others italian researcher reported differences protein profiles isolates associated chronic acute research team malaysia reported isolates symptomatic patients produced large amoeboid forms present isolates asymptomatic development classification system blastocystis produced series studies investigating possibilitycitation needed studies followed generally found specific pathogenic nonpathogenic species blastocystis one study investigated subtypes found patients irritable bowel syndrome ibs inflammatory bowel disease ibd chronic diarrhea found subtypes diseases similar subtypes also found asymptomatic carriers researchers concluded host factors age genetics may play dominant role determining symptoms seen blastocystis colonisation positively associated ibs possible risk factor developing study ibs patients middle east showed significantly increased immune reaction ibs patients blastocystis even organism could identified stool following reports linked blastocystis infection inflammatory bowel disease humans contract blastocystis infection drinking water eating food contaminated feces infected human blastocystis infection spread animals humans humans humans humans animals animals risk factors infection reported following research studies suggested following items risk factors contracting blastocystis infection pathogenesis refers mechanism organism causes disease following diseasecausing mechanisms reported studies blastocystis infection diagnosis performed determining infection present making decision whether infection responsible symptoms diagnostic methods clinical use reported poor quality reliable methods reported research identification infection method clinically available areas ova parasite op exam identifies presence organism microscopic examination chemically preserved stool specimen method sometimes called direct microscopy united states pathologists required report presence blastocystis found op exam special test ordered direct microscopy inexpensive test identify variety gastrointestinal infections giardia entamoeba histolytica cryptosporidium however one laboratory director noted pathologists using conventional microscopes failed identify many blastocystis infections indicated necessity special microscopic equipment following table shows sensitivity direct microscopy detecting blastocystis compared stool culture sensitive technique stool culture considered researchers reliable technique recent study found stool culture detected individuals infected compared polymerase chain reaction pcr reasons given failure direct microscopy include variable shedding quantity blastocystis organisms varies substantially day day infected humans appearance forms blastocystis resemble fat cells white blood making difficult distinguish organism cells stool sample large number morphological forms blastocystis cells assume variety shapes described detail recently possible additional forms exist several methods cited literature determination significance finding blastocystis following diagnostic methods routinely available patients researchers reported reliable detecting infection cases provide physician information help determine whether blastocystis infection cause patients symptomscitation needed serum antibody testing research study performed nih united states patients suggested possible distinguish symptomatic asymptomatic infection blastocystis using serum antibody study used blood samples measure patients immune reaction chemicals present surface blastocystis cell found patients diagnosed symptomatic blastocystis infection exhibited much higher immune response controls blastocystis infection symptoms study repeated shams university egypt egyptian patients equivalent fecal antibody testing study shams university egypt indicated patients symptomatically infected could distinguished fecal antibody study compared patients diagnosed symptomatic blastocystis infection controls blastocystis infection symptoms group symptoms iga antibodies blastocystis detected fecal specimens present healthy control group stool culture culturing shown reliable method identifying infection researchers reported ability distinguish disease causing nondisease causing isolates blastocystis using stool blastocystis cultured patients sick diagnosed blastocystis infection produced large highly adhesive amoeboid forms culture cells absent blastocystis cultures healthy controls subsequent genetic analysis showed blastocystis healthy controls genetically distinct found patients symptoms protozoal culture unavailable countries due cost lack trained staff able perform protozoal culture genetic analysis isolates researchers used techniques allow dna blastocystis isolated fecal method reported reliable detecting blastocystis symptomatic patients stool method also allows species group blastocystis identified research continuing species groups associated symptomatic see genetics symptoms blastocystosiscitation needed immunofluorescence ifa stain ifa stain causes blastocystis cells glow viewed microscope making diagnostic method reliable ifa stains use giardia cryptosporidium diagnostic purposes water quality testing paper nih described laboratory development one however company currently offers stain commerciallycitation needed reports conflict regarding whether blastocystis causes disease humans reports resulted brief debate medical journals early physicians united states believed blastocystis harmless physicians united states overseas believed could cause diseasecitation needed time common practice identify blastocystis humans blastocystis hominis blastocystis animals identified differently eg blastocystis ratti rats research performed since shown concept blastocystis hominis unique species blastocystis infecting humans supported microbiological findings although one species group associated primates found also discovered humans acquire infection one nine species groups blastocystis also carried cattle pigs rodents chickens pheasants monkeys dogs research suggested types produce symptoms others produce illness intestinal researchers suggested conflicting reports may due practice naming blastocystis humans blastocystis proposed discontinuing use standard naming system blastocystis organisms humans animals proposed names blastocystis isolates according genetic identity blastocystis organism rather naming system used identifies isolates blastocystis sp subtype nn nn number indicating species group blastocystis organism identification species performed microscope time different species look alike identification requires equipment genetic analysis common microbiology laboratories available physicians new scientific papers begun using standard naming lack scientific study support efficacy particular additional review published made similar conclusion noting diagnostics use unreliable impossible determine whether drug eradicated infection made patient feel historical reports one note difficulty associated eradication blastocystis patients describing infection hard get rid vitro study pakistan found isolates resistant common antiprotozoal study isolates patients diagnosed ibs found isolates resistant metronidazole resistant drugs reported studies effective eradicating blastocystis infection included tmpsmx trimethoprim active sulphamethoxazole demonstrating doxycycline iodoquinol found less effective practice miconazole quinacrine reported effective agents blastocystis growth albendazole shown promise ivermectin demonstrated high effectiveness blastocystis hominis isolates vitro also evidence probiotic yeast saccharomyces plant mallotus may effective blastocystis infections physicians described successful use variety discontinued antiprotozoals treatment blastocystis infection emetine reported successful cases early century british soldiers contracted blastocystis infection serving vitro testing showed emetine effective metronidazole emetine available united states special arrangement center disease control clioquinol enterovioform noted successful treatment blastocystis infection removed market following adverse event stovarsol narsenol two arsenicbased antiprotozoals reported effective carbarsone available antiinfective compound united states late suggested possible reduction availability antiprotozoal drugs noted complicating factor treatment protozoal example australia production diloxanide furoate ended paromomycin available special access provisions availability iodoquinol like protozoal infections prevalence blastocystis infection varies depending area investigated population selected number different species groups blastocystis infect reported cause disease others date surveys distinguished different types blastocystis humans significance findings may difficult evaluate developing countries reported higher incidences recent studies suggest symptomatic infection blastocystis may prevalent certain industrialized countries wellcitation needed experimental infection immunocompetent immunocompromised mice produced intestinal inflammation altered bowel habits lethargy chronic diarrhea reported nonhuman higher many enteric protists subject research blastocystis unusual basic questions concerning diagnosed treated causes disease remain
