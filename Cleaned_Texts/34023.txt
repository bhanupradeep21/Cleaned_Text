salivary glands many vertebrates including mammals exocrine glands produce saliva system ducts humans three paired major salivary glands parotid submandibular sublingual well hundreds minor salivary salivary glands classified serous mucous seromucous mixed serous secretions main type protein secreted alphaamylase enzyme breaks starch maltose whereas mucous secretions main protein secreted mucin acts humans ml saliva produced every secretion saliva salivation mediated parasympathetic stimulation acetylcholine active neurotransmitter binds muscarinic receptors glands leading increased proposed fourth pair salivary glands tubarial glands first identified named location positioned front torus tubarius however finding one study yet salivary glands detailed two parotid glands major salivary glands wrapped around mandibular ramus largest salivary glands secreting saliva facilitate mastication swallowing amylase begin digestion serous type gland secretes alphaamylase also known enters oral cavity via parotid duct glands located posterior mandibular ramus anterior mastoid process temporal bone clinically relevant dissections facial nerve branches exposing different lobes since iatrogenic lesion result either loss action strength muscles involved facial produce total salivary content oral mumps viral infection caused infection parotid submandibular glands previously known submaxillary glands pair major salivary glands located beneath lower jaws superior digastric secretion produced mixture serous fluid mucus enters oral cavity via submandibular duct wharton around saliva oral cavity produced submandibular glands though much smaller parotid gland usually felt via palpation neck superficial cervical region feels like rounded ball located two fingers adams apple laryngeal prominence two inches apart chin sublingual glands pair major salivary glands located inferior tongue anterior submandibular secretion produced mainly mucous nature categorized mixed unlike two major glands ductal system sublingual glands intercalated ducts usually striated ducts either saliva exits directly excretory ducts known rivinus saliva entering oral cavity comes tubarial glands suggested fourth pair salivary glands situated posteriorly nasopharynx nasal cavity predominantly mucous glands ducts opening dorsolateral pharyngeal wall glands unknown september discovered group dutch scientists using prostatespecific membrane antigen petct discovery may explain mouth dryness radiotherapy despite avoidance three major glands however findings one study need hand interdisciplinary group scientists disagree new discovery believe accumulation minor salivary glands around minor salivary glands located throughout oral cavity within oral mucosa tissue buccal labial lingual mucosa soft palate lateral parts hard palate floor mouth muscle fibers mm diameter unlike major glands encapsulated connective tissue surrounded gland usually number acini connected tiny lobule minor salivary gland may common excretory duct another gland may excretory duct secretion mainly mucous nature many functions coating oral cavity saliva problems dentures sometimes associated minor salivary glands dry mouth minor salivary glands innervated facial nerve cranial nerve cn von ebners glands found trough circling circumvallate papillae dorsal surface tongue near terminal sulcus secrete purely serous fluid begins lipid hydrolysis also facilitate perception taste secretion digestive enzymes arrangement glands around circumvallate papillae provides continuous flow fluid great number taste buds lining sides papillae important dissolving food particles tasted salivary glands innervated either directly indirectly parasympathetic sympathetic arms autonomic nervous system parasympathetic stimulation evokes copious flow saliva gland internally divided lobules blood vessels nerves enter glands hilum gradually branch lobules secretory cells found group acinus acinus located terminal part gland connected ductal system many acini within lobule gland acinus consists single layer cuboidal epithelial cells surrounding lumen central opening saliva deposited produced secretory cells three forms acini classified terms type epithelial cell present secretory product produced serous mucoserous duct system lumina formed intercalated ducts turn join form striated ducts drain ducts situated lobes gland called interlobular ducts secretory ducts found major minor glands exception may sublingual human salivary glands terminate mouth saliva proceeds aid digestion released saliva quickly inactivated stomach acid present saliva also contains enzymes actually activated stomach acid proteincoding genes expressed human cells genes expressed normal adult salivary less genes specifically expressed salivary gland salivary gland specific genes mainly genes encode secreted proteins compared organs human body salivary gland highest fraction secreted genes heterogeneous family prolinerich human salivary glycoproteins salivary glandspecific proteins highest level expression examples specifically expressed proteins include digestive amylase enzyme mucin statherin major importance specific characteristics saliva aging salivary glands shows structural changes addition changes occur salivary contents however overall change amount saliva secreted seen salivary glands secrete saliva many benefits oral cavity health general knowledge normal salivary flow rate sfr extremely important treating dental benefits include proteins statherin prolinerich proteins within salivary pellicle inhibit demineralization promote remineralization attracting calcium sialolithiasis salivary calculus stone may cause blockage ducts commonly submandibular ducts causing pain swelling salivary gland dysfunction refers either xerostomia symptom dry mouth salivary gland hypofunction reduced production saliva associated significant impairment quality following radiotherapy head neck region salivary gland dysfunction predictable saliva production may pharmacologically stimulated sialagogues pilocarpine also suppressed socalled antisialagogues tricyclic antidepressants ssris antihypertensives cochrane review found strong evidence topical therapies effective relieving symptoms dry cancer treatments including chemotherapy radiation therapy may impair salivary radiotherapy cause permanent hyposalivation due injury oral mucosa containing salivary glands resulting xerostomia whereas chemotherapy may cause temporary salivary furthermore surgical removal benign malignant lesions may also impair graft versus host disease allogeneic bone marrow transplantation may manifest dry mouth many small salivary gland tumours may occur including mucoepidermoid carcinoma malignant sialogram radiocontrast study salivary duct may used investigate function diagnosing sj√∂gren salivary glands species modified produce proteins salivary amylase found many bird mammal species including humans noted furthermore venom glands venomous snakes gila monsters shrews actually modified salivary organisms insects salivary glands often used produce biologically important proteins
