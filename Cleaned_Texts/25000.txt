ampelosaurus ˌæmpɪloʊˈsɔːrəs ampilohsorəs meaning vine lizard titanosaurian sauropod dinosaur late cretaceous period france type species atacis named le loeuff remains found level dating million years ago representing maastrichtian like sauropods would long neck tail also carried armor form osteoderms bones assigned ampelosaurus additional material found since including partially articulated skeleton skull makes one best known dinosaurs france however recent studies suggest type locality monospecific titanosaur bone bed part bones attributed ampelosaurus probably belong second titanosaurian taxon ampelosaurus lived iberoarmorican island landmass including much presentday france iberian peninsula histological studies show characteristics related island environment slowed
