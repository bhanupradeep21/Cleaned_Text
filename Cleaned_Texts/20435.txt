voice prosthesis plural prostheses artificial device usually made silicone used conjunction voice therapy help laryngectomized patients speak total laryngectomy entire voice box larynx removed windpipe trachea food pipe esophagus separated operation opening food pipe windpipe created primary puncture opening also created later time secondary puncture opening called tracheoesophageal puncture te puncture voice prosthesis placed opening becomes possible speak occluding stoma blowing air lungs inside voice prosthesis throat creating voice sound called tracheoesophageal speech back end prosthesis sits food pipe avoid food drinks saliva coming prosthesis lungs prosthesis small flap back two ways inserting voice prosthesis mouth throat retrograde manner help guide wire directly tracheostoma anterograde manner nowadays voice prosthesis placed anterograde stoma two lines development behalf giving voice patients laryngectomized first artificial voice box larynx built theodor billroth made total laryngectomy steps implanted artificial voice new development using modern materials took place france first voice prosthesis voice rehabilitation total laryngectomy described article polish since many efforts taken place area rehabilitation several manufacturers voice prosthesis product portfolio eg internationally widely used devices made inhealth technologies atos medical first commercially available prosthesis introduced singer duckbill french diameter nonflanged device patient could remove clean replace nonindwelling first indwelling voice prosthesis groningen voice prostheis described first voice prosthesis manufactured atos medical introduced followed nonindwelling indwelling voice introduced market like indwelling voice prosthesis inserted replaced medical professionals speech pathologists physicians third generation two main categories voice prosthesis divided nonindwelling indwelling voice prostheses nonindwelling voice prostheses replaced patients whereas indwelling prostheses replaced medical professional nonindwelling voice prosthesis safety strap may also string special safety medallion wide fall tracheostoma comes different sizes lengths often noticeable color eg blue white enhance visibility selfreplacement maintenance disadvantages nonindwelling prosthesis certain amount risk inserting oneself devices shorter lifetime need changed often general takes practice insert prosthesis ability take excellent care device indwelling devices sturdier flanges replaced medical professional safety strap cut insertion choice nonindwelling indwelling devices really individual depending physical condition maintenance cost alternated period time find one suitable general design voice prosthesis quite consistent even though unique characteristics voice prosthesis retaining flanges end tracheal flange esophageal flange flanges vary size rigidity eg indwelling prostheses larger rigid flanges stability facilitate longterm placement flange near food pipe esophageal flange rigid tracheal flange near windpipe oneway valve molded one piece prosthesis often supported fluoroplastic valve seat colored ring tightly secured shaft prosthesis adding rigidity radiopaque voice prostheses safety strap cut indwelling devices prosthesis put place nonindwelling devices strap removed taped neck voice prosthesis oneway valve near esophageal flange enables pulmonary air pass esophagus pharynx sound production prevents content food pipe liquids saliva entering trachea voice prosthesis usually made medical grade silicone rubber valve flap valve seat may made silicone fluoroplastic may treated silveroxide size voice prosthesis varies length depending thickness wall foodpipe windpipe thereby length te puncture according length voice prosthesis ranges usually mm another parameter outer diameter shaft voice prosthesis ranging french outer diameter used decided clinician andor patient often matter personal preference studies shown larger outer diameter voice prosthesis allows better airflow thereby requires less effort speak positive effect overall voice even special problemsolving voice prosthesis eg laryngectomized patients short device life times less weeks current prosthesis extremely short device life times may caused excessive candida growth valve prosthesis close properly anymore content food pipe leaks voice prosthesis windpipe prostheses magnet within valve strengthens closure others made silver oxide silicone reduce biofilm formation valve use two valves case defect esophageal valve valve would seal patients short device life use voice prosthesis supporting magnets valve seat valve flap proven cost important clean voice prosthesis regularly silicone material exposed yeast candida bacteria food pipe normally present yeast begins growing area valve flap voice prosthesis may close well enough anymore happens fluid starts leak windpipe eating drinking inside voice prosthesis usually cleaned brush removes food mucus recommended patient cleans voice prosthesis regularly keeps open speech improve device lifetime also possible flush inside voice prosthesis water usually done combination brushing voice prosthesis replaced regularly certain time valve flap voice prosthesis close properly anymore due yeast natural sediments causes leakage saliva drinks enters wind pipe makes person concerned cough resolved cleaning voice prosthesis sign voice prosthesis must changed possible right away special plugs block leakage patient insert plug themself eating drinking remove afterwards speaking plug place usually possible device lifetime range couple weeks two years depending individual lifetime influenced daily food intake especially dairy also radiotherapya gerd gastro esophageal reflux disease affects voice prosthesis cause prothesis life time end mostly leakage also growing fistulae granulation tissue increasing valves opening pressure prothesis loss voice quality speaking voice prosthesis influenced pulmonary support airflow resistance voice prosthesis airflow resistance new voice although voice prosthesis responsible part total resistance neoglottis responsible part favorable airflow characteristics expected enable laryngectomized patient speak less voice sounds rather clear though loud samples individual combination voice prosthesis heat moisture exchanger laryngectomy attachment important good speech pulmonary hme sometimes combined freehandsswitch virus bacteria httpsenwikipediaorgwikivoiceprosthesis
