bladder stone stone found urinary bladder stones small mineral deposits form bladder cases bladder stones develop urine becomes concentrated one dehydrated allows minerals calcium magnesium salts crystallize form stones bladder stones vary number size consistency cases bladder stones cause symptoms discovered incidental finding plain radiograph however symptoms occur may include severe lower abdominal back pain difficult urination frequent urination night fever painful urination blood urine majority individuals symptomatic complain pain comes waves pain may also associated nausea vomiting bladder stones vary size shape texture small hard smooth whereas others huge spiked soft one one multiple stones bladder stones somewhat common men prostate enlargement large prostate presses urethra makes difficult pass urine time stagnant urine collects bladder minerals like calcium start precipitate individuals develop bladder stones include spinal cord injury paralysis type nerve damage nerves back damaged bladder empty resulting stagnant bladder stones may occur whenever kidneys bladder ureters become inflamed may occur urine becomes concentrated body becomes dehydrated minerals calcium magnesium crystallize stones cause symptoms lower back abdominal pain difficulty urination use urinary catheters may cause bladder stone individuals paralyzed unable adequately pass urine may require use small plastic tubes catheters placed bladder use tubes may lead infection irritates bladder resulting stone formation finally kidney stone may travel ureter bladder become bladder stone evidence indicating chronic irritation bladder retained stones may increase chance bladder cancer urinary schistosomiasis disease caused digenean trematode schistosoma haematobium implicated development vesical however evidence accumulated thus far supported diagnosis bladder stone includes urinalysis ultrasonography x rays cystoscopy inserting small thin camera urethra viewing bladder intravenous pyelogram also used assess presence kidney stones test involves injecting radiocontrast agent passed urinary system xray images obtained every minutes determine obstruction contrast excreted bladder today intravenous pyelogram replaced many health centers ct scans ct scans sensitive identify small stones seen urinary stones may composed following jackstone calculi rare bladder stones appearance resembling toy jacks almost always composed calcium oxalate dihydrate consist dense central core radiating spicules typically light brown dark patches usually formed urinary bladder rarely upper urinary tract appearance plain radiographs computed tomography human patients usually easily recognizable jackstones often must removed via best way prevent bladder stones drink plenty liquids juices containing citrates thought reduce risk stone formation study published clinical journal american society nephrology indicate orange juice effective preventing stone formation citrus men difficulty urination due prostate enlargement seek however urinating sitting position appears improve bladder emptying might decrease risk bladder stones prevention newborn children especially first three months life stones begin critical studies show feeding newborn infants milk mothers cow goat substitutes supplements least third month proven successful preventing increasing fluid intake facilitate passage small bladder stones however larger stones may require methods fragmentation bladder stones achieved use cystoscope inserted bladder urologist visualizes stone uses ultrasonic energy laser lithotripsy cause fragmentation stones small pieces flushed bladder procedure requires anesthesia may require admission hospital complications treatment include infection damage stones large even cystoscopic treatment may require open cystotomy incision made bladder stones removed manually children urinary stones evidence supporting treatment options weak high quality trials necessary help guide clinical cystolithotomy surgical procedure removal bladder stones case one deemed large pass naturally developed jackstone calculi may require open surgery remove stone however robotic cystolithotomy allows minimally invasive approach remove stone much smaller incisions traditional approach bladder stones dealt endoscopic procedure avoid need surgical incision open cystolithotomy performed general anesthesia inpatient procedure first step cystoscopy examine bladder incision made lower abdomen stone removed bladder repaired absorbable stitch catheter inserted bladder via urethra occasionally necessary gently drip fluid bladder period often bleeding following procedure majority patients major side effects following cystolithotomy may followed minor burning sensation light bleeding serious side effects include bladder infection prolonged need catheter use infection surgical incision rare side effects may include delayed bleeding requiring removal clots surgery injury urethra causing scar formation fever serious infection requiring longer hospital stay delayed healing bladder may require lithoclastic cystotomy attributed ammonius lithotomos stonecutter alexandria egypt term
