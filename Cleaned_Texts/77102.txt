benzyl butyl phthalate bbp organic compound historically used plasticizer largely phased due health concerns phthalate ester containing benzyl alcohol nbutanol tail groups like phthalates bbp nonvolatile remains liquid wide range temperatures mostly used plasticizer pvc also common plasticizer pvca pvb bbp commonly used plasticizer vinyl foams often used sheet vinyl flooring tiles compared phthalates less volatile dibutyl phthalate imparted better low temperature flexibility bbp classified toxic european chemical bureau ecb hence use europe declined rapidly bbp diester since bbp contains two ester bonds react variety chemical pathways carbonyl catoms weakly electrophilic therefore targets attacks strong nucleophilic compounds besides carbonyl catom target contains ch bond whereas hatom weakly acidic makes susceptible deprotonation strong base bbp hydrolyzed either acidic basic conditions hydrolysis acidic conditions reversion fischerspeier esterification whereas hydrolysis basic conditions performed saponification since bbp contains two ester bonds difficult perform chemoselective reaction basic conditions bbp undergo saponification saponification number bbp mg kohg amount carboxylic functional groups per molecule relatively high carboxylic functional groups molecular weight makes compound relatively concentrated sulfuric acid dehydrates nbutyl alcohol yield reacts phthalic anhydride produce nbutyl phthalate phthalic anhydride react directly form intermediate reaction form dibutyl phthalate occur significant extent carrying procedure using avoids side reaction monobutyl phthalate isolated added mixture benzyl bromide acetone presence potassium carbonate keep ph high facilitate substitution reaction required form second ester linkage bbp bbp absorbed human body variety ways first taken dermally meaning compound absorbed skin studies rats show uptake bbp occurs via process structure phthalate diester determines degree dermal absorption bbp also taken orally amount compound absorbed body depends dose administered absorption seems limited high meaning small amounts taken easily great amounts finally bbp inhaled case bbp absorbed via lungs bbp biotransformed human body numerous ways gut esterases metabolize bbp monoester metabolites mainly monobutyl monobenzyl phthalate mbzp plus small amounts mononbutyl ratio monobutyl monobenzyl phthalate determined metabolites absorbed excreted directly undergo phase ii reaction latter conjugated glucuronic acid excreted glucuronate studies rats shown bbp conjugated conjugated high concentrations bbp relatively less metabolite conjugated indicates conjugation pathway glucuronidation saturated high amounts administered bbp metabolites bbp excreted rapidly left body within hours consequence halflife bbp blood quite low counts however monoester metabolites bbp monophthalate longer halflife bbp metabolized quite efficiently within body major part bbp excreted monobenzyl phthalate metabolite minor fragment bbp excreted form monobutyl bbp rarely found bile original form nevertheless metabolites like monobutyl glucuronide monobenzyl phthalate glucuronide well trace amounts free monoesters found relatively little known modes action bbp experimental research hint number mechanisms though one phenomenon bbp binds estrogen receptor vitroexperiments show weak potential bbp influence estrogenmediated gene expression phthalates like bbp mimicking estrogens metabolites bbp hand weakly reactive estrogen much known mechanism plays vivo furthermore bbp binds intracellular steroid receptors causes genomic effects bbp also interferes ionchannel receptors cause nongenomic underlying mechanism bbp blocks calcium signaling coupled receptors calcium signaling mediated via eventually influence cell proliferation bone remodeling developmental phases bone remodelling high environmental exposure bbp might therefore pose problem exposure general population bbp estimated several authorities one authorities international program chemical safety ipcs came conclusion exposure bbp mainly caused food intake bbp many phthalates used increase flexibility plastics however phthalates bound plastics means easily released environment taken food crop cultivation alternatively bbp enter food via food packaging moreover children may exposed bbp mouthing various studies authorities done estimate general population exposure bbp different countries varying results adult exposure estimated μgkg body weightday bbp exposure children likely higher due differences food intake nonetheless estimates interpreted caution based different food types different assumptions used calculations levels bbp food vary different countries levels bbp food changes time next general exposure also occupationrelated exposure bbp occur via inhalation vapors via skin contact estimated μgkg body weightday however general occupational exposure thought lower noael bbp experimentally found mgkg body weightday associated margin safety ca thus bbp seem pose high risk conditions general occupational exposure based current estimates primary irritation sensitization reactions found patch test involving volunteers however bbp taken body exert toxic effects rats ranging gkg body workers pvc processing industry exposed higher levels bbp general public thus risk experiencing negative health effects effects respiratory peripheral nerve system observed workers although slightly higher levels bbp metabolites found citation needed longterm occupational exposure bbp however significantly increase risk multiple children possibly exposed higher levels bbp adults since children form vulnerable group chemical exposure studies conducted evaluate effects bbp exposure pvc flooring linked significant increase risk bronchial obstruction first two years development language delay preschool aged bbp also positively associated airway inflammation children living urban moreover evidence suggesting prenatal exposure bbp coming house dust affects risk childhood exact mechanism phthalates metabolites reach fetus remain unclear however since chemicals seem able reach fetus thought affect fetal health research needed establish effect prenatal exposure fetal development studies done reproductive effects bbp humans results inconclusive according ntpcerhr adverse reproductive effects negligible exposed men yet one study found link altered semen quality exposure monobutyl phthalate major metabolite research done teratogenic effects bbp humans however numerous studies conducted animals prenatal exposure high levels bbp rats lead lower fetal body weight increased incidence fetal malformations postimplantation loss even embryonic precise teratogenic effects observed rat fetuses seem related period exposure development exposure bbp first half pregnancy lead embryolethality exposure second half twogenerational study male offspring found macroscopic microscopic changes testes decreased serum testosterone concentrations addition reduced sperm additionally reduced seminal vesicle weight results indicate clear negative effect fertility numerous studies carried animals elucidate adverse effects bbp exposure longterm bbp exposure rats leads reduced body weight increased weight liver kidneys male rats incidence pancreatic tumors increased female rats incidence pancreatic bladder tumors although bbp linked carcinogenicity studies indicate bbp bbp like low molecular weight phthalate esters toxic aquatic organisms includes unicellular freshwater green algae selenastrum capricornutum bbp also shown toxic freshwater invertebrates like magna organisms toxic effect correlates water solubility phthalate relatively high bbp compared high molecular weight phthalates bbp affects saltwater invertebrates significantly experiments mysid shrimp show bbp acutely toxic organisms among species fish sweetwater fish bluegills shown toxically affected bbp furthermore rapid lethal effect observed saltwater fish parophrys degradation bbp taken consideration one aware fact contains two ester functional groups gives organisms handle biotransformations ester groups gives bbp hydrophilic properties therefore hydrolyze fairly easy following examination performed found biotransformations play important role degeneration bbp furthermore solubility water plays significant role effectiveness biotransformation environment butyl group gives bbp slightly hydrophobic property compared plasticizer relatively good soluble longer alkyl chain less soluble less well degenerated bbp listed developmental toxicant californias proposition december californias office environmental health hazard assessment oehha july approved maximum
