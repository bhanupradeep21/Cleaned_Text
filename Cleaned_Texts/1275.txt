psammostean shields indicating genus may ancestor giant meter long wide psammosteid heterostracans late dorsal shield portion drepanaspis carapace contains large median plate acutely notched posterior addition forming exterior margin shield along posterior end lies long elongated pointed plates called posterolateral cornual like close heterostracan relatives members drepanaspis sensory canal system specifically called lateral line sensory system complex network closed canals within dermal plates thought derived trait known psammosteids characteristically symmetrical arrangement often leading

jawless mouth drepanaspis terminal located dorsal surface opening mouth lined fine denticles similar denticles would continue inner margins mouth allowed drepanaspis suck grasp food prey using mechanism called suction specific features mouth indicates likelihood drepanaspis bottom feeder would often dwell near bottom shallow body initially debate regarding dorsal orientation mouth opening specifically whether orientation natural due crushing based arrangement mouth showed upper side mouth bound rostral plate lower side bounded small oral plates determined dorsal orientation likely evidence distortion ventral surface tooth plates fossil specimens visibly large majority first drepanaspis specimens found gemünden slate hunsrück lagerstätte rhineland fauna hunsrück lagerstätte consisted trilobites mailed fish bivalves cephalopods late devonian marine predominantly diverse range marine fauna found within slate formations strongly indicate members drepanaspis marine origin hunsrück lagerstätte primary slate formation drepanaspis commonly found early devonian age thought deposited late pragian early esmian ages subsiding basins separated slate deposits estimated meters thickness ran kilometers northwest southeast estimated observations welldeveloped eyes arthropod vertebrate specimens recovered slate formation water depth offshore environment estimated rather shallow ranging meters based sedimentary observations conclusion drepanaspis lived shallow water environments shallow seas coral reefs lakes drawn members drepanaspis likely nektobenthic bottom dwellers conclusion based flattened morphology dorsal positioning oral opening information inferred extant jawless fish species common feeding strategy bottom dwellers bottom feeders suggesting drepanaspis may likely bottom conclusion also drawn observing anatomical features dorsal facing mouth due jawless nature mouth drepanaspis may likely utilized aquatic feeding mechanism called suction feeding suction feeding mechanism drepanaspis likely specialized adaptation feeding small benthic invertebrates shallow marine environments edges mouth opening lined small denticles allowed grasping retention food suction also hypothesized denticles may also contributed degree drepanaspis belongs clade drepanaspididae subdivision family psammosteida psammosteida belongs order pteraspidiformes
