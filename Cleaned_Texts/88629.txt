humboldtian science refers movement science century closely connected work writings german scientist naturalist explorer alexander von humboldt maintained certain ethics precision observation combined scientific field work sensitivity aesthetic ideals age like romanticism science rather popular century term coined susan faye cannon example humboldts life writings allowed reach beyond academic community natural history address wider audience popular science aspects supplanted older baconian method related well single person francis bacon humboldt born berlin worked prussian mining official

science one first techniques studying organic inorganic branches examining interconnectedness vegetation respective environment one new important aspects humboldts work idea labeled terrestrial physics something scientists preceded linnaeus failed humboldtian science founded principle general equilibrium forces general equilibrium idea infinite forces nature constant conflict yet forces balance humboldt laid groundwork future scientific endeavors establishing importance studying organisms environment conjunction humboldtian science includes extensive work alexander von humboldt well many works century scientists susan cannon attributed coining term humboldtian according cannon humboldtian science accurate measured study widespread interconnected real phenomena order find definite law dynamical humboldtian science used place traditional baconianism appropriate less vague term themes century natural history eighteenth century nomination carl linnaeus preoccupied fitting nature taxonomy fixated visible towards turn eighteenth century immanuel kant became interested understanding species derived less concerned organisms physical attributes next johann reinhold forster one humboldts future partners became interested study vegetation essential way understanding nature relationship human society proceeding forster karl willdenow examined floristic plant geography distribution plants regionality whole pieces history humboldt help shape defined humboldtian science humboldt took account outward appearance inward meaning plant species attention natural aesthetics empirical data evidence set scientific work apart ecologists nicolson aptly puts humboldt effortlessly combined commitment empiricism experimental elucidation laws nature equally strong commitment holism view nature intended aesthetically spiritually holistic approach science study nature humboldt able find web interconnectedness despite multitude extensive differences different species according malcolm nicholson susan cannon characterized humboldtian science synthetic empirical quantitative impossible fit one twentieth century disciplinary central element humboldtian science use latest advances scientific instrumentation observe measure physical variables attending possible sources error humboldtian science revolved around understanding relationship accurate measurement sources error mathematical cannon identifies four distinctive features marked humboldtian science previous versions humboldt committed called terrestrial physics essentially humboldts new scientific approach required new type scientist humboldtian science demanded transition naturalist physicist humboldt described idea terrestrial physics differs traditional descriptive natural history stated traveling naturalists neglected track great constant laws nature manifested rapid flux trace reciprocal interaction divided physical humboldt consider explorer rather scientific traveler accurately measured explorers reported according humboldt goal terrestrial physicist investigate confluence interweaving physical forces incredibly extensive array precise instrumentation readily available humboldts terrestrial physicist expansive amount scientific resources characterized humboldtian scientist best described book science culture thus complete humboldtian traveller order make satisfactory observations able cope everything revolution satellites jupiter carelessness clumsy instruments included chronometers telescopes sextants microscopes magnetic compasses thermometers hygrometers barometers electrometers eudiometers furthermore necessary multiple makes models specific instrument compare errors constancy among one concept central humboldtian science general equilibrium forces humboldt explains general equilibrium reigns amongst disturbances apparent turmoil result infinite number mechanical forces chemical attractions balancing equilibrium derived infinite number forces acting simultaneously varying globally words lawfulness nature according humboldt result infinity complexity humboldtian science promotes idea forces accurately measured earths surface results greater understanding order voyage americas produced many discoveries developments help illustrate humboldts ideas equilibrium forces humboldt produced tableau physique des andes physical profile andes aimed capturing voyage americas single graphic table humboldt meant capture physical forces organisms electricity single table among many complex empirical recordings elevationspecific data table included detailed biodistribution mapped specific distributions flora fauna every elevation level mountain humboldts study plants provides example movement humboldtian science away traditional science humboldts botany also illustrates concept equilibrium humboldtian ideas interrelationship natures elements although concerned physical features plants largely focused investigation underlying connections relations among plant humboldt worked years developing understanding plant distributions geography link balancing equilibrium natural forces organism distribution evident humboldt states phenomena physical universe distribution organic beings amidst apparent disorder seems result influence multitude local causes unchanging law nature become evident soon one surveys extensive territory uses mass facts partial disturbances compensate one study vegetation plant geography arose new concerns emerged humboldtian science new areas concern science included integrative processes invisible connections historical development natural humboldtian science applied idea general equilibrium forces continuities history generation planet humboldt saw history earth continuous global distribution things heat vegetation rock formations order graphically represent continuity humboldt developed isothermal isothermal lines functioned general balancing forces isothermal lines preserved local peculiarities within general according humboldtian science natures order equilibrium emerged gradually progressively laborious observing averaging mapping increasingly extended ralph waldo emerson dubbed humboldt one wonders appear time time show us possibilities human humboldt first began studies organisms environment claimed wanted reorganize general connections link organic beings study great harmonies often considered one worlds first genuine humboldt succeeded developing comprehensive science joined separate branches natural philosophy model natural order founded concept dynamic equilibrium humboldts work reached far beyond personal expeditions discoveries figures across globe participated work participants included french naval officers east india company physicians russian provincial administrators spanish military commanders german diplomats mentioned previously charles darwin carried copy humboldts personal narrative aboard hms humboldts projects particularly related natural philosophy played significant role influx european money travelers spanish america increasing numbers early sir edward sabine british scientist worked terrestrial
