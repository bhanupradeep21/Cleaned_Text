eurasia may begun keep horses livestock food source keeping captivity may helped preserve horses also fit six core criteria livestock domestication thus could argued chose live close proximity one model horse domestication starts individual foals kept pets adult horses slaughtered meat foals relatively small easy handle horses behave herd animals need companionship thrive historic modern data shows foals bond humans domestic animals meet social needs thus domestication may started young horses repeatedly made pets time preceding great discovery pets could ridden otherwise put work however disagreement definition term domestication one interpretation domestication must include physiological changes associated selectively bred captivity merely tamed noted traditional peoples worldwide huntergatherers horticulturists routinely tame individuals wild species typically handrearing infants whose parents killed animals necessarily domesticatedcitation needed hand researchers look examples historical times hypothesize domestication occurred example native american cultures captured rode horses century onwards tribes exert significant control breeding thus horses developed genotype phenotype adapted uses climatological conditions kept making landrace planned breed defined modern standards nonetheless domesticatedcitation needed difficult question domesticated horses first ridden driven unequivocal evidence shows horses first used pull chariots warfare strong though indirect evidence riding occurring first particularly botai bit wear may correlate riding though modern hackamore demonstrates horses ridden without bit using rope evanescent materials make equipment fastens around nose absence unequivocal evidence early riding record settle question thus one

particularly noticeable direct evidence horses driven much riding may practiced millennia bce disappearance old european settlements may related attacks horsebackmounted warriors clearest influence horses ancient warfare pulling chariots introduced around bce horses bronze age relatively small modern standards led theorists believe ancient horses small ridden must used driving herodotus description sigynnae steppe people bred horses small ride extremely efficient drawing chariots illustrates stage however horses remained generally smaller modern equines well middle theory highly questionable iron age mesopotamia saw rise mounted cavalry tool war evidenced notable successes mounted archer tactics used various invading eurasian nomads parthians time chariot gradually became
