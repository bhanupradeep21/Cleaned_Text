mammalian skin epidermis maintained selfrenewal stem cells terminal differentiation progeny using cultured human epidermis genetically modified mice pioneered identification stem cell populations elucidated roles receptor tyrosine signalling regulating behavior identified first marker integrin extracellular matrix ecm receptors could used isolate epidermal stem researchers subsequently found marker enriches stem cells wide range tissues addition others amply confirmed original concept ecm key component stem cell niche labs research also shown interplay diverse intrinsic extrinsic signals
