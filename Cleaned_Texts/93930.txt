asteroid impacts late heavy bombardment caused significant changes surface environment objects solar system low gravity mars suggests impacts could ejected much martian atmosphere deep terraforming mars would entail two major interlaced changes building atmosphere heating thicker atmosphere greenhouse gases carbon dioxide would trap incoming solar radiation raised temperature would add
