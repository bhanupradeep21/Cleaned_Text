ulnar nerve entrapment condition pressure ulnar nerve passes cubital tunnel causes nerve dysfunction neuropathy symptoms neuropathy paresthesia tingling numbness loss sensibility primarily affecting little finger ring finger hand ulnar neuropathy progress weakness atrophy muscles hand interossei small ring finger lumbricals symptoms alleviated attempts keep elbow flexing sleeping sticking one arm pillow case pillow restricts flexion general ulnar neuropathy result symptoms specific anatomic distribution affecting little finger ulnar half ring finger intrinsic muscles hand specific symptoms experienced characteristic distribution depend specific location ulnar nerve compression symptoms ulnar neuropathy may motor sensory depending location injury motor symptoms consistent muscle weakness sensory symptoms paresthesias consist numbness tingling areas innervated ulnar nervecitation needed proximal impingement associated mixed symptoms proximal nerve consists mixed sensory motor innervation distal impingement associated variable symptoms ulnar nerve separates near hand distinct motor sensory branches cubital tunnel syndrome ulnar neuropathy elbow sensory motor symptoms tend occur certain sequence initially may paresthesia loss sensibility small ulnar fourth finger may transient next numbness loss sensibility becomes constant characteristic resting hand position ulnar claw small ring fingers curl occurs late disease sign severe neuropathy contrast guyons canal syndrome distal impingement motor symptoms claw hand may pronounced phenomenon known ulnar paradox also back hand normal distinct innervation hand usually enables diagnosis ulnar nerve impingement symptoms alone ulnar nerve damage causes paralysis muscles result characteristic ulnar claw position hand rest clinical tests card test froments sign easily performed assessment ulnar nerve however complete diagnosis identify source impingement radiographic imaging may necessary determine ruleout underlying imaging studies ultrasound mri may reveal anatomic abnormalities masses responsible impingement additionally imaging may show secondary signs nerve damage confirm diagnosis impingement signs nerve damage include flattening nerve swelling nerve proximal site injury abnormal appearance nerve characteristic changes muscles innervated symptoms ulnar neuropathy neuritis necessarily indicate actual physical impingement nerve injury ulnar nerve may result identical symptoms addition functional disturbances may result irritation nerve true impingement example anterior dislocation snapping ulnar nerve across medial epicondyle elbow joint result ulnar entrapment major sensory nerves upper extremities result deficits patterns distribution entrapment median nerve causes carpal tunnel syndrome characterized numbness thumb index middle half ring finger compression radial nerve causes numbness back hand thumb much simple way differentiating significant median ulnar nerve injury testing weakness flexing extending certain fingers hand median nerve injuries associated difficulty flexing index middle finger attempting make fist however ulnar nerve lesion pinky ring finger unflexed attempting extend people affected multiple nerve compressions complicate ulnar nerve entrapment classified location entrapment ulnar nerve passes several small spaces courses medial side upper extremity points nerve vulnerable compression socalled pinched nerve nerve particularly vulnerable injury disruption normal anatomy common site ulnar nerve entrapment elbow followed causes structures reported cause ulnar nerve entrapment common location ulnar nerve impingement elbow within cubital tunnel known cubital tunnel tunnel formed medial epicondyle humerus olecranon process ulna tendinous arch joining humeral ulnar heads flexor carpi ulnaris cases injury minor resolve spontaneously time chronic compression repetitive trauma may cause persistent problems commonly cited scenarios include compression ulnar nerve medial elbow may occasionally caused epitrocheloanconeus muscle anatomical ulnar nerve impingement along anatomical space wrist called ulnar canal known ulnar tunnel syndrome guyon canals recognized causes ulnar nerve impingement location include local trauma fractures ganglion classically avid cyclists experience repetitive trauma bicycle form ulnar neuropathy comprises two workrelated syndromes socalled hypothenar hammer syndrome seen workers repetitively use hammer occupational neuritis due hard repetitive compression desk syndrome categorized three zones based localization ulnar nerve within guyons cubital tunnel syndrome may prevented reduced maintaining good posture proper use elbow arms wearing arm splint sleeping maintain arm straight position instead keeping elbow tightly recent example popularization concept cell phone elbow game effective treatment cubital tunnel syndrome surgical decompression safe effective operation insitu decompression medial pain symptoms medications nsaid amitriptyline vitamin supplementation may help although evidence support claimcitation needed mild symptoms may first treated nonoperatively followingcitation needed important identify positions activities aggravate symptoms find ways avoid example person experiences symptoms holding telephone head use telephone headset provide immediate symptomatic relief reduce likelihood damage inflammation nerve cubital tunnel syndrome recommended avoid repetitive elbow flexion also avoiding prolonged elbow flexion sleep position puts stress ulnar cubital tunnel decompression surgery involves incision posteromedial medial epicondyle helps avoid medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve branches ulnar nerve identified released fascia proximally distally flexor carpi ulnaris heads release flexion extension arm performed ensure subluxation ulnar following surgery average patients report improvement patients diagnosed cubital tunnel syndrome advanced disease atrophy static numbness weakness might reflect permanent nerve damage recover diagnosed prior atrophy weakness static numbness disease arrested treatment mild intermittent symptoms often resolve people diabetes mellitus higher risk kind peripheral neuropathy including ulnar nerve cubital tunnel syndrome common people spend long periods time elbows bent holding telephone flexing elbow arm pressed hard surface leaning edge table significant risk use vibrating tools work causes repetitive activities increase risk including throwing damage deformity elbow joint increases risk cubital tunnel additionally people nerve entrapments elsewhere arm shoulder higher risk ulnar nerve entrapment evidence soft tissue compression nerve pathway shoulder bra strap many years cause
