constriction ring syndrome crs congenital disorder unknown cause unknown cause many different sometimes incorrect names malformation due intrauterine bands rings give deep grooves commonly distal extremities like fingers toes rare cases constriction ring form around parts fetus cause amputation even intrauterine death anatomy proximal site constriction amputation developmentally crs associated

theory postulates involvement intrauterine disruption pregnancy followed cascade events involving amniotic rupture spontaneous rupture amnion occurs early second trimester separation amnion chorion produces many small thin strands become entangled within digits later fetus grows bands bands become constricting constriction reduces blood circulation hence causes congenital abnormalities cases
