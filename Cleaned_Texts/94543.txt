inside messages people make link groups usually problem detecting community features one main issues study networking systems social networks naturally tend divide communities however world networks big must simplified information result effective way dealing drawback smaller communities using modularity algorithms order partition users even smaller larger ones efficient algorithm called map equation decomposes network modules optimally compressing description information flows community therefore characterised according words used based ranking algorithm determine significance word usage differences word endings word lengths also measured showed pattern found correct one moreover studies also helped predicting community membership users comparing word frequencies community word usage helped forecasting community certain user going access based words aim research study bond community structure social network environment language use within community striking pattern found suggests people different clans tend use different words based interests even though approach didnt manage cover people inside twitter several advantages ordinary surveys cover smaller scale groups systematic nonintrusive easily produces large volumes rich data moreover cultural characteristics found extending study example whether individuals belong multiple communities use different word sets process
