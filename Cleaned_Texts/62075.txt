arthrogryposis amc describes congenital joint contracture two areas body derives name greek literally meaning curving joints arthron joint grȳpōsis late latin form late greek grūpōsis children born one joint contractures abnormal fibrosis muscle tissue causing muscle shortening therefore unable perform active extension flexion affected joint amc divided three groups amyoplasia distal arthrogryposis syndromic amyoplasia characterized severe joint contractures muscle distal arthrogryposis mainly involves hands feet types arthrogryposis primary neurological muscle disease belong syndromic often every joint patient arthrogryposis affected limbs involved legs arms every joint body affected displays typical signs symptoms example shoulder internal rotation wrist volar ulnar hand fingers fixed flexion thumb palm hip flexed abducted externally rotated frequently dislocated elbow extension pronation foot clubfoot less commonly congenital vertical range motion different joints different types arthrogryposis like amyoplasia symmetrical jointlimb involvement normal contractures joints result delayed walking development first five years severity contractures necessarily predict eventual walking ability intelligence normal normal children known many children normal intelligence literature available cause syndrome syndromes like gordon syndrome craniofacial amyoplasia form arthrogryposis sometimes accompanied midline facial arthrogryposis diagnosis clinical finding disease often accompanied syndromes diseases diagnoses could affect organ patient slightly common diagnoses pulmonary hypoplasia cryptorchidism congenital heart defects tracheoesophageal fistulas inguinal hernias cleft palate eye research arthrogryposis shown anything inhibits normal joint movement birth result joint arthrogryposis could caused genetic environmental factors principle factor curtails fetal movement result congenital exact causes arthrogryposis unknown malformations arthrogryposis secondary environmental factors decreased intrauterine movement oligohydramnios low volume abnormal distribution intrauterine fluid defects fetal blood supply causes could hyperthermia limb immobilization viral infections specific virus may cause arthrogryposis contraction zika virus pregnancy congenital zika syndrome czs may occur vertical transmission zika virus myasthenia gravis mother leads also rare cases arthrogryposis major cause humans fetal akinesia however disputed arthrogryposis could also caused intrinsic factors includes molecular muscle connective tissue development disorders neurological abnormalitiescitation needed research shown specific genetic disorders associated arthrogryposis mutations missense means mutation results different amino acid mutations could cause arthrogryposis single gene defects xlinked recessive autosomal recessive autosomal dominant mitochondrial defects chromosomal disorders example trisomy mostly seen distal arthrogryposis mutations least five genes could cause distal could also connective tissue neurological muscle development loss muscle mass imbalance muscle power joint lead connective tissue leads joint fixation reduced fetal also muscle abnormalities could lead reduction fetal movement could dystrophy myopathy mitochondrial disorders mostly result abnormal function dystrophinglycoproteinassociated complex sarcolemma skeletal seventy eighty percent cases severe forms arthrogryposis caused neurological abnormalities either genetic underlying aetiology pathogenesis congenital contractures particularly arthrogryposis mechanism mutations remains active area investigation identifying factors could help develop treatment congenital finding research prenatal diagnosis shown diagnosis made prenatally approximately fetuses presenting could found routine ultrasound scanning showing lack mobility abnormal position options visualization details structures using techniques clinic child diagnosed arthrogryposis physical examination confirmed ultrasound muscle different types amc include another form related mutations leucinerich gliomainactivated treatment arthrogryposis includes occupational therapy physical therapy splinting approach occupational therapists use orthopedic management using casts order correct joint deformities effective since joints misaligned present deformities another vital intervention occupational therapists use treat arthrogryposis range motion exercises order increase joint primary longterm goals treatments increasing joint mobility muscle strength development adaptive use patterns allow walking independence activities daily living since arthrogryposis many different types treatment varies patients depending good articles exist surgical technique used treat arthrogryposis described surgeries explained belowcitation needed number passive devices enhancing limb movement intended worn aid movement encourage muscular development example wilmington robotic exoskeleton potential assistive device built back brace shadowing upper arm forearm difficult fit heavy awkward researchers university delaware developing light unobtrusive therapeutic garment suitable babies children called playskin lift garment looks like normal clothing contains bundled steel wires arms help push arms toward lifted position allowing wearer move freely children amyoplasia type arthrogryposis usually flexion ulnar deviation dorsal carpal wedge osteotomy indicated wrists excessive flexion contracture deformity nonsurgical interventions occupational therapy splinting failed improve function dorsal side level midcarpus wedge osteotomy made sufficient bone resected least able put wrist neutral position wrist also ulnar deviation bone taken radial side correct abnormality position held place two cross kwires addition tendon transfer extensor carpi ulnaris extensor carpi radialis brevis may performed correct ulnar deviation wrist extension weakness tendon transfer used extensor carpi ulnaris appears functional soft tissue envelope congenital contractual conditions clasped arthrogrypotic thumbs often deficient two planes thumbindex web flexor aspect thumb often appearance increased skin base index finger part deformity tissue used resurface thumbindex web comprehensive release tight structures allow larger range motion thumb technique called index rotation flapcitation needed flap taken radial side index finger proximally based distal edge thumbindex web flap made wide possible still small enough close excessive skin palmar side index finger flap rotated around tightest part thumb metacarpophalangeal joint thumb allowing larger range generally foot surgery usually reserved patients walking ambulatory potential foot surgery may also indicated assist brace orthosis fitting hence promote supported standing common foot deformity arthrogryposis club feet talipes equinovarus early years life serial casting according ponseti method usually yields good results ponseti method also used first line treatment older resistant severe neglected cases bony surgery form foot osteotomies arthrodesis usually indicated usually accompanied soft tissue surgery form release contracted tendon capsular structures older patients near skeletal maturity joint fusion arthrodesis may indicated less frequent patients arthrogryposis may develop congenital vertical talus also known rocker bottom foot similarly congenital vertical talus classically managed serial casting according reversed ponseti method resistant recurrent cases may offered extensive soft tissue release however fraught risk foot stiffness pain long term talectomy excision talus give room creation plantigrade foot practiced naviculectomy midtarsal resection arthroplasty represents less invasive option satisfactory shortterm amc considered nonprogressive proper medical treatment things improve joint contractures get worse time birth way resolve cure amc completely proper treatment children make significant improvements range motion ability move limbs enables carry daily activities live relatively normal livescitation needed therapeutic interventions cornerstones treatment amc include stretching range motion exercises physical occupational speech therapy splinting serial casting surgical intervention may also improve joint mobility positive prognostic factors independent walking active hips knees hip flexion contractures less degrees knee flexion contractures less degrees without severe arthrogryposis rare condition authors say overall prevalence one others say one among european live congenital clubfoot common single contracture prevalence one live
