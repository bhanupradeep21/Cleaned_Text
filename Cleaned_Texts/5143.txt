remote ischemic conditioning ric experimental medical procedure aims reduce severity ischaemic injury organ heart brain commonly situation heart attack stroke procedures heart surgery heart may temporary suffer ischaemia operation triggering bodys natural protection tissue although noted benefits experimental models animals still experimental procedure humans initial evidence small studies replicated larger clinical trials successive clinical trials failed identify evidence supporting protective role procedure involves repeated temporary cessation blood flow limb create ischemia lack oxygen glucose tissue conditioning activates bodys natural protective physiology reperfusion injury tissue damage caused low oxygen protection present many ric essentially mimics cardioprotective
