psychology empathic accuracy measure accurately one person infer thoughts feelings another person term introduced conjunction term empathic inference psychologists william ickes william since research empathic accuracy explored relationship concepts affect sharing mentalizing order accurately infer anothers psychological state one must able share state affect sharing understand cognitively label state mentalizing neuroscience research shown brain activation associated empathic accuracy overlaps areas responsible affect sharing empathic accuracy aspect william ickes called everyday mind persons understanding states others extremely important persons successful social interaction costs failing task high seen social difficulties people autism spectrum empathic accuracy linked positive peer relationship outcomes overall healthy adjustment adult relationships empathic accuracy correlates stable romantic carl rogers published clientcentered therapy work known created three guidelines psychologists follow therapeutic session client unconditional positive regard empathy genuineness rogers goal client actualize inherent potentialities termed selfactualization according rogers selfactualization could accomplished need positive regard positive selfregard selfconcept gained therapists empathy thereby helps move client towards selfactualization empathy rogerss clientcentered therapy means better understand client issues relates empathic accuracy rogerss intent make client feel pitied psychologist tune clients needs perspectives psychologist must accurate empathic accuracy topic social psychological research social psychology explored empathic accuracy relates concept empathy general social psychologists posit two main theories people empathize others simulation theory theory simulation theory understand another putting others state simulating experience theory theory cognitive find meanings others behaviors contextual cues use construct idea persons internal mental state empathic accuracy requires processes simulation theory correlates affectsharing aspect empathic accuracy theory theory relates ones ability effectively mentalize shared neuroscience research solidified shared roles simulation theory theory theory empathic accuracy neuroscience work empathy focused two main neural networks mirror system mentalizing system mirror system involves bilateral posterior ventrolateral prefrontal cortex bilateral anterior inferior parietal lobule automatic form shared mental representation corresponds simulation mentalizing system involves areas dependent upon task demands converges dorsomedial prefrontal systems rely separate neural regions activated time recentmay outdated work empathic accuracy shows concurrent activation providing evidence empathic accuracy involves follows well difficulty task would differentially activate two networks basic tasks simple emotion recognition facial expression correlate greater activation mirror system tasks require complex social judgments assess anothers state activate mentalizing system greater william ickes colleagues developed method measure accuracy perceivers inferences content target persons reported thoughts method perceiver asked view videotaped interaction previously recorded videotape paused perceiver points target person videotape reported specific thought feeling perceivers writes thought feeling content perceiver infers researchers list thoughts feelings target reported various stop points compare content inferred thought feeling reported thought feeling assess level perceivers empathic accuracy method adapted neuroscience research including fmri scanning participants watching videos others participants report perceived emotional states recorded individual participants scanner researchers measure brain activity empathic accuracy research psychotherapy audio videotapes record sessions patient therapist allows expert judges rate empathic responsivity empathic accuracy therapist towards social psychology research focuses empathic accuracy affects interpersonal relationships people differ empathic accuracy ability closeness improves empathic accuracy study friends example men better reading friends emotional states romantic relationships empathic accuracy higher couples feel stable relationships suggests people may inaccurately interpret partners states feel threatened evaluating whether partner physically attracted someone healthy relationships empathic accuracy linked better instrumental social support partners accurate inferring partners states also better providing tangible concrete supports material goods financial work empathic inaccuracy aggression toward spouses shown men likely aggressive toward wives also less accurate reading emotional states women know likely inaccurately label womens states critical rejecting suggesting basic cognitive bias within research looking explicitly partners found trend men acted violently toward partners performing poorly identifying partners emotional research gender differences mixed effects mainly showing participants made aware genderrole expectations fact empathy findings suggest men women different empathic accuracy skill social norms impact mens performance research oppositegender couples found significant differences genders women better reading partners emotions differences however dramatically diminished couples told would receive money emotion correctly identified partner men women similar according results terms skill differ terms motivation social neuroscience located regions brain correlated empathic accuracy helped clarify debate regarding simulation theory research social neuroscience explored processes may affect empathic accuracy behaviorally brain one study looked relationship oxytocin empathic oxytocin known role regulating prosocial behavior selectively improved empathic accuracy individuals scored higher autism spectrum quotient aq meaning increased levels oxytocin helped people poorer social skills already socially skilled neuroscience methods also used explore compassion meditation relates empathic compassion meditation also referred mettƒÅ lovingkindness meditation buddhist practice meditator focuses increasing empathic feelings compassion toward others study participants trained eightweek course compassion meditation found empathically accurate controls showed corresponding increased brain activation areas related empathic accuracy particularly mentalizing certain conditions impair empathic accuracy alexithymia involves difficulty labeling ones emotional states linked empathic inaccuracy considering importance mirror system empathic accuracy deficit makes sense people difficulty recognizing emotions likely would show less brain activation regions also used recognizing others emotions indeed alexithymic individuals show decreased activation mirror system presented images deficits empathic accuracy also found individuals autism higher aq scores correlate lower empathic accuracy normal similar findings found clinical populations autism spectrum experiencing greater difficulty empathic accuracy early summary research empathic accuracy found edited volume empathic accuracy recent summary available singleauthor book titled everyday mind reading understanding people think feel discussion mirror system pertains empathy empathic accuracy found marco iacobonis mirroring people science empathy connect others httpsenwikipediaorgwikiempathicaccuracy
