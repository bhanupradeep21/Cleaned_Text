injury disease symptoms brain injuries vary based severity injury much brain affected three categories used classifying severity brain injuries mild moderate symptoms mild brain injury include headaches confusions tinnitus fatigue changes sleep patterns mood behavior symptoms include trouble memory concentration attention mental fatigue common debilitating experience may linked patient original minor incident cognitive symptoms include confusion aggressiveness abnormal behavior slurred speech coma disorders consciousness physical symptoms include headaches worsen go away vomiting nausea convulsions brain pulsation abnormal dilation eyes inability awaken sleep weakness extremities loss symptoms observed children include changes eating habits persistent irritability sadness changes attention disrupted sleeping symptoms brain injuries also influenced location injury result impairments specific part brain affected lesion size correlated severity recovery brain injuries often create impairment disability vary greatly severity cases severe brain injuries likelihood areas permanent disability great including neurocognitive deficits delusions often specific monothematic delusions speech movement problems intellectual disability may also personality changes severe cases result coma even persistent vegetative state even mild incident longterm effects cause symptoms

however mean one pure alexia incapable comprehending connection working visual cortex language demonstrated fact people pure alexia still write speak even transcribe letters without understanding lesions fusiform gyrus often result prosopagnosia inability distinguish faces complex objects lesions amygdala would eliminate enhanced activation seen occipital fusiform visual areas response fear area intact amygdala lesions change functional pattern activation emotional stimuli regions distant lesions visual cortex different effects depending location damage lesions example cause blindsight different areas brain depending size lesion location relative calcarine lesions cause bilateral lesions cause loss ability perceive motion lesions parietal lobes may result agnosia inability recognize complex objects smells shapes amorphosynthesis loss perception opposite side brain injuries farreaching varied consequences due nature brain main source bodily control braininjured people commonly experience issues issues either long shortterm memories depending location severity injury sometimes memory improved rehabilitation although permanent behavioral personality changes also commonly observed due changes brain structure areas controlling hormones major emotions headaches pain occur result brain injury either directly damage due neurological conditions stemming injury due changes brain well issues associated change physical mental capacity depression low selfesteem common side effects treated psychological help antidepressants must used caution brain injury people due potential undesired effects already altered brain chemistry multiple responses body brain injury occurring different times initial occurrence damage functions neurons nerve tracts sections brain affected damage immediate response take many forms initially may symptoms swelling pain bruising loss posttraumatic amnesia also common brain damage temporary aphasia impairment time progresses severity injury becomes clear responses may become apparent due loss blood flow damaged tissue sustained injury amnesia aphasia may become permanent apraxia documented patients amnesia condition person unable remember aphasia loss impairment word comprehension use apraxia motor disorder caused damage brain may common left brain damaged loss mechanical knowledge headaches occasional dizziness temporary symptoms brain become permanent may disappear long time documented cases lasting psychological effects well emotional changes often caused damage various parts brain control human emotions individuals experienced emotional changes related brain damage may emotions come quickly intense little lasting emotional changes may triggered specific event cause stress injured party family often counseling suggested experience effect injury may available individual group session important note long term psychological physiological effects vary person injury example perinatal brain damage implicated cases neurodevelopmental impairments psychiatric illnesses concerning symptoms signs changes behaviors occurring healthcare provider consulted brain injuries result number conditions

imaging techniques used clinical setting cost lack treatment emergency traumatic brain injuries focuses assuring person enough oxygen brains blood supply maintaining normal blood pressure avoid injuries head neck person may need surgery remove clotted blood repair skull fractures cutting hole skull may necessary medicines used traumatic injuries diuretics antiseizure comainducing drugs diuretics reduce fluid tissues lowering pressure brain first week traumatic brain injury person may risk seizures antiseizure drugs help prevent comainducing drugs may used surgery reduce impairments restore blood flow case brain damage traumatic brain injury dexamethasone andor mannitol may used various professions may involved medical care rehabilitation someone impairment brain injury neurologists neurosurgeons physiatrists physicians specialising treating brain injury neuropsychologists especially clinical neuropsychologists psychologists specialising understanding effects brain injury may involved assessing severity creating rehabilitation strategies occupational therapists may involved running rehabilitation programs help restore lost function help relearn essential skills registered nurses working hospital intensive care units able maintain health severely braininjured constant administration medication neurological monitoring including use glasgow coma scale used health professionals quantify extent physiotherapists also play significant role rehabilitation brain injury case traumatic brain injury tbi physiotherapy treatment postacute phase may include sensory stimulation serial casting splinting fitness aerobic training functional sensory stimulation refers regaining sensory perception use modalities evidence support efficacy serial casting splinting often used reduce soft tissue contractures muscle tone evidence based research reveals serial casting used increase passive range motion prom decrease functional training may also used treat patients tbis date studies supports efficacy sit stand training arm ability training body weight support systems overall studies suggest patients tbis participate intense rehabilitation programs see greater benefits functional research required better understand efficacy treatments mentioned treatments brain injury include medication psychotherapy neuropsychological rehabilitation andor prognosis likely progress disorder depends nature location cause brain damage see traumatic brain injury focal diffuse brain injury primary secondary brain injury general neuroregeneration occur peripheral nervous system much rarer difficult assist central nervous system brain spinal cord however neural development humans areas brain learn compensate damaged areas may increase size complexity even change function someone loses sense may gain increased acuity another process termed many misconceptions revolve around brain injuries brain damage one misconception someone brain damage fully recover recovery depends variety factors severity location testing done note severity location everyone fully heals brain damage possible full recovery brain injuries hard predict outcome many tests specialists needed determine likelihood prognosis people minor brain damage debilitating side effects severe brain damage debilitating sideeffects brain injury depend location bodys response even mild concussion long term effects may another misconception children heal better brain damage children greater risk injury due lack maturity makes future development hard link different cortical areas
