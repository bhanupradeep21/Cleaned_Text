integrated stress response cellular stress response conserved eukaryotic cells downregulates protein synthesis upregulates specific genes response internal environmental integrated stress response triggered within cell due either extrinsic intrinsic conditions extrinsic factors include hypoxia amino acid deprivation glucose deprivation viral infection presence oxidants main intrinsic factor endoplasmic reticulum stress due accumulation unfolded proteins also observed integrated stress response may trigger due oncogene activation integrated stress response either cause expression genes fix damage cell due stressful conditions cause cascade events leading apoptosis occurs cell brought back stress signals cause protein kinases known kinases phosphorylate α subunit protein complex called translation initiation factor resulting gene turned affect gene consists three subunits contains two binding sites one phosphorylation one rna kinases work phosphorylate serine α subunit reversible cell experiencing normal conditions aids initiation mrna translation recognizing aug start however phosphorylated complex activity reduces causing reduction translation initiation protein synthesis promoting expression four known mammalian protein kinases phosphorylate including pkrlike er kinase perk hemeregulated kinase hri general control nondepressible double stranded rna dependent protein kinase pkr perk encoded humans gene responds mainly endoplasmic reticulum stress two modes kinase unique luminal domain plays role activation classical model activation states luminal domain normally bound glucoseregulated protein buildup unfolded proteins dissociates luminal domain causes perk dimerize leading autophosphorylation activation activated perk kinase phosphorylate causing

glucose deprived tumor cells although suggested indirect effect due cells using amino acids alternate energy mouse embryonic fibroblast cells human keratinocytes activated due uv light pathways activation require research although multiple models proposed including crosslinking pkr encoded humans gene activation mainly dependent presence doublestranded rna viral infection dsrna causes pkr form dimers resulting autophosphorylation activated pkr phosphorylate causes cascade events result viral host protein synthesis inhibited stressors cause activation pkr include oxidative stress endoplasmic reticulum stress growth factor deprivation bacterial infection caspase activity early apoptosis also observed trigger activation pkr however stressors differ activate pkr without using
