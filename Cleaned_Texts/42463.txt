categorized two main steps incision vocal fold modification followed thyrohyoid elevation risks complications include granuloma dysphonia tracheostomy patients recommended follow perioperative

reducing size larynx studies shown high longterm satisfaction rate pitch change surgery measured pitch change outcome known typically greater wendler glottoplasty current separate procedure also attempts increase pitch shortening vibrating length vocal cords via alternative less destructive endoscopic approach recent study notes measured changes average semitones patients comfortable speaking

individual pitch change operation could also diminish masculine neck profile caused adams apple removal anterior cartilage thus achieving feminine neck effect pronounced reduction typically achieved tracheal shave explicitly goes tracheal shave removes tissue avoided surgeon tracheal shave order feminize voice thus patient opts procedure typically need tracheal shave procedure less popular wellknown forms voice feminization surgery moment currently performed limited set surgeons includes limited several surgeons also doctors using term describe suite voice larynx feminization procedures actually perform particular procedure rather procedures glottoplasty cricothryoid approximation tracheal transgender women make patients feminization laryngoplasty puberty testosterone male sex hormone produced testes causes diameter larynx increase vocal folds thicken lengthen change irreversible even help feminizing hormone therapy fundamental resonant frequency voice decreases longer match desired vocal range suits preferred gender identity cisgender women abnormally low voice gender nonconforming individuals may also seek feminization laryngoplasty however target pitch nonbinary people may different people identify solely women instance would hope achieve androgynous voice rather completely feminine voice therefore laryngologists work closely patients tailor personal needs maximize individuals sought vocal alterations first recommended undergo voice therapy generate desirable vocal pitch resonance individuals could substantially achieve feminine voice adapting new habitual coordination muscles vocal cords however results vary greatly person person often require active effort persistent effort using feminine voice could lead straining pathological issues vocal surgical means voice feminization feminization laryngoplasty alternative vocal therapy effects training alone unsatisfactory allowing patients permanently modify comfortable speaking pitch resonance estimated transgender women opted surgical procedure voice feminization larger proportion transgender women opted nonsurgical means voice feminization ie voice transgender surgery general gained initial momentum early attention brought american transgender woman christine sexual reassignment surgeries seen exponential increase public awareness period time however decades ago voice feminization garnered recognition public audience previously gender affirmation surgery put great emphasis genital conformation last decades interpretations gender identity society shifts gender affirmation surgery expanded territories secondary sex characteristics way voice feminization seen unprecedented attention study notes throughout decades increasing trend emphasis social recognition ie interacting people community preferred gender identity rather sexual recognition alone several cosmetic surgeons claimed patients satisfied alterations secondary sexual characteristics tempted seek additional genital first experimental study surgically raise speaking pitch performed japanese otorhinolaryngologist kazutomo kitajima colleagues together discovered inverse linear relationship vocal pitch distance thyroid cartilage cricoid based principle first surgical procedure voice feminization cricothyroid approximation cta developed achieve pitch increase reducing separation two cartilages procedure remains wellknown among transgender women seeking surgical voice however results often unsatisfactory cta due unnatural falsetto quality surgical solutions also developed including wendler

glottoplasty lrg well laser tuning including laser assisted voice adjustment lava vocal fold muscle reduction vfmr glottoplasty laser tuning options falsetto issue unlike cta however generally longer complex recovery concept feminization laryngoplasty originated open laryngoplasty technique proposed cosmetic surgeon somyos first operation performed james p thomas opposed previous efforts feminization laryngoplasty results significant longlasting pitch increase along feminine voice quality function cricothyroid muscle also preserved allowing use falsetto range needed addition compared surgeries feminization laryngoplasty could undergone one single surgery thyroid chondroplasty reduce prominence adams apple solutions perform chondroplasty first surgeries performed local anesthesia however general anesthesia preferred local anesthesia prevent patients attempting talk surgery may lead complications tearing sutures operation antibiotics clindamycin ceftriaxone administered intravenously reduce surgical infection dexamethasone also given reduce better anaylze change voice pitch quality surgical operation voice recordings also taken laryngoplasty general anesthesia would administered beforehand cm long horizontal incision would made skin crease thyroid notch allowing postoperative scar hidden crease flaps created platysma strap muscles would separated along midline expose thyroid cartilage allows strip anterior thyroid cartilage removed using electrocautery effectively reduce contour adams apple diameter laryngeal quarter anterior false folds would also removed reduce diameter upper larynx provide better view true vocal folds subsequently anterior vocal folds removed length pharynx shortened raise speaking pitch overall size glottal region also reduced

holes drilled thyroid cartilage hyoid bone placement sutures screws securing suspending structure larynx higher neck still allowing move facilitate functions swallowing strap muscles reattached skin closed following surgery completion patients prescribed acetaminophen narcotic pain medication pain relief cefpodoxime levofloxacin days minimize feminization laryngoplasty patients would experience drop voice volume may experience decreased vocal pitch continuity range might also negatively affected therefore surgery might less suited vocal performance instead alternative procedure vocal fold shortening retrodisplacement anterior commissure vfsrac type modified wendler glottoplasty generally recommended preserves ability vocal fold muscle reduction standalone laser tuning procedure also considered professional voice users granuloma vocal cords also possible complication may cause soft whispery voice granuloma eventually coughed case removed dysphonia another common symptom first two months recovery issue gradually resolves patients treatment revision surgery might needed patients serious unresolved sound hoarseness extended periods vocal cords heal asymmetrical tension laser treatment generally required correct defect rare cases severe swelling could lead difficulty breathing may require tracheostomy bypass area following feminization laryngoplasty patients usually discharged without need overnight stay exceptions would made complications occurred patient would stay hospital week complete voice rest surgery also necessary fast healing vocal cords supported sutures undergone procedure advised vocal rest least weeks aerobic activity weeks weight lifting month give time scar tissue develop support also advised refrain surgery requiring intubation least maximize effects surgery adapt new feminine voice patients also highly recommended undergo vocal therapy patients could learn feminize voice intonation volume resonance nonverbal communication gesture patients still unsatisfied pitch increase surgery revision surgery laser tuning could considered improve results however revision generally recommended patient medical records voice surgery prior
