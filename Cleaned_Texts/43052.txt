osteophagy practice animals usually herbivores consume bones vegetation around world lacks sufficient amounts phosphorus essential mineral animals plays major role formation skeletal system necessary many biological processes including energy metabolism protein synthesis cell signaling phosphate deficiencies cause physiological side effects especially pertaining reproductive well side effects delayed growth failure regenerate new importance sufficient amounts phosphorus resides physiological importance maintaining proper phosphorus calcium ratio cap ratio important absorption minerals deviations optimal ratio inhibit dietary calcium phosphorus ratio along vitamin regulates bone mineralization turnover affecting calcium phosphorus transport absorption suggested osteophagy innate behavior allows animals supplement phosphorus calcium uptake order avoid costly effects deficiencies osteophagic behavior observed pastoral wild animals notably ungulates herbivores two hundred osteophagy inferred archaeological studies dental wear pleistocene fossils dating back seen domestic animals well red deer camels giraffes wildebeest antelopes tortoises grizzly due differences tooth structure herbivores tend chew old dry bones easier break carnivores prefer chew softer fresh variations behavior also observed humanscitation needed osteophagy regarded beneficial behavior combat mineral deficiencies animals osteophagic practices also observed detrimental dentition herbivores observed pattern wear cheek teeth herbivores congruous manner herbivores hold chew major cost osteophagy therefore significant wear teeth dental breakage herbivores whose teeth evolve enable regular consumption hard materials rather grinding vegetal wolverines observed finding large bones invisible deep snow specialists scavenging bones specifically cache wolverine upper molars rotated degrees inward identifying dentition characteristic family mustelidae weasel family wolverine mass

nocturnal bone collectors thousands bones stored inside den open piles vicinity bones satisfy seasonal nutritional deficiency prevent overgrown teeth shavings ingested bulk osteophagy desert tortoises

plants desert tortoises also consume vulture feces contain bones soil layers contain calcium mammal hairs feathers arthropods stones bones conspecifics well snake lizard skin desert tortoises observed exhibit mounting behavior aggressive biting repeated striking carcasses practicing osteophagy herbivores viewed serve source supplemental minerals desert plants grow mineraldeficient soil may cause mineral deficiency desert tortoise diets resulting intake supplemental material observational study tortoises near st george utah found tortoises exclusively consume mojave deserts white stones composed calcite mostly calcium carbonate opposed brown grey colored ingestion white stones attributed deliberate intake additional calcium furthermore thought additional sources food sources calcium also nutrients including phosphorus sodium iron copper also hypothesized osteophagy practice necessary maintenance desert tortoise parallels phenomenon osteophagy birds snail shells ingested egglaying females supplement increased calcium needed eggshell formation therefore would expected increased physiological needs juvenile gravid female tortoises would also increase mineral demands promote ingestion bones stones soil alternatively need consume supplemental minerals may serve purpose detoxifying plant compounds may serve purposes related nutrition dislodge gut late relatively unknown disease called botulism seen high levels south african cattle especially grazed pastures low phosphorus levels researchers found feeding cattle sterile bonemeal maize unnaturally high levels phosphorus nearly eliminated botulism simplest conclusion botulism symptoms caused lack early sir thomas thieler revisited issue began following herds cattle observe incredibly found phosphorusdeficient cattle would eat decomposing bones dead cattle animals activity highly correlated botulism next several years able show bacterial strain living decomposing carcasses clostridium botulinum true cause cattle would eat carcasses replenish phosphorus deficiency would contract diseasecitation needed recently found cows experimentally depleted phosphate extended provision lowphosphate diet exhibited specific appetite bones compared controls develop interest bones researchers increased blood plasma inorganic phosphate levels experimental group cattle appetite whole bones suppressed experiment provided evidence causal link osteophagy phosphorus deficiency grizzly bears wild observed gnaw shed moose antlers provide valuable source protein calcium grizzly bears weakest point annual cycle following emergence hibernation terms lacking mineral protein nutrition grizzly bears ursus arctos emerging hibernation may experiencing skewed phosphorustocalcium ratio due lack consumption animal resources period hibernationcitation needed winter conditions grizzly bears may able continue maintain calcium intake ingestion plants maintain levels vitamin solar radiation low protein availability results phosphorus deficiency grizzly bear diets lack protein winter conditions attributed scarcity animal proteins phenomenon occurs many ecosystems prior greenup ending winter conditions therefore overall bones serve valuable source minerals times animal protein availability resulting phosphorus deficiency grizzly bear diets results skewed calcium phosphorus ratio creates appetite bone deficiency associated cycle seasons osteophagy bears likely seasonal phenomenon rather constant dietary giraffes rely solely browsing maintain diet consists primarily leafy however commonly observed supplementing diet although exact purpose behavior unknown hypothesized ingestion bones serves additional source calcium leaves usually serve sufficient source nutrients calcium phosphorus concentrations leaves vary seasonally rainfall giraffes osteophagic behavior observed parallel variance mineral benefits behavior remain unclear researchers found actually unlikely giraffes sufficiently digest bones extract calcium also evidence suggest osteophagy associated development kidney stones medullary cortical lesions giraffes due nutritional imbalance media often portrays domestic dogs chewing bones slightly misleading dogs chew bones eat residual meat bone marrow left truly form modern toy bones dogs actually rawhide simply dried animal skin animal bones actually dangerous dogs osteophagic behavior frequently observed among several carnivorous bird species including hawks owls however motivations differ aforementioned presumably birds main purpose
