hyperbilirubinemia clinical condition describing elevation blood bilirubin level due inability properly metabolise excrete bilirubin product erythrocytes breakdown severe cases manifested jaundice yellowing tissues like skin sclera excess bilirubin deposits us records jaundice patients definition bilirubin concentration greater mgml considered hyperbilirubinemia following jaundice progressively develops becomes apparent plasma levels reach rather disease hyperbilirubinemia indicative multifactorial underlying disorders trace back deviations regular bilirubin metabolism diagnosis hyperbilirubinemia depends physical examination urinalysis serum tests medical history imaging identify cause genetic diseases alcohol pregnancy hepatitis viruses affect likelihood hyperbilirubinemia causes hyperbilirubinemia mainly arise liver include haemolytic anaemias enzymatic disorders liver damage gallstones hyperbilirubinemia often benign extreme cases kernicterus type brain injury occur therapy adult hyperbilirubinemia targets underlying diseases patients jaundice often poor varied causes hyperbilirubinemia best understood bilirubin metabolism total average daily production bilirubin humans mgkg derived haemoglobin hb produced erythrocyte breakdown remaining heme proteins like myoglobin cytochrome hb broken globin haem undergoes multistep enzymatic degradation two reactions converting hb bilirubin ixalpha unconjugated bilirubin released bloodstream binds reversibly plasma protein albumin dissociates taken liver cells organic anion transport proteins oatps cell inside hepatocytes bilirubin conjugated uridine diphosphateglucuronosyltransferase ugt form bilirubin diglucuronide otherwise termed conjugated bilirubin transported across plasma membrane multidrug resistantassociated protein finally enter bile conjugated bilirubin secreted small intestine bile portion reabsorbed cycled back liver unabsorbed bilirubin reaches colon hydrolysed reduced urobilinogen excreted classification diagnosis underlying disease hyperbilirubinemia crucial prescription physical examination reviews clinical symptoms like degree jaundice vital signs sensations pain followed urine tests blood analysis degree yellowish staining conjunctiva skin jaundice proportional hyperbilirubinemia vital signs fever tachycardia hypotension suggest hyperbilirubinemia induced viral abdominal pain could indicate biliary tract obstruction urinalysis serves firstline diagnostic tool conjugated bilirubin watersoluble excreted urine hence dark urine tested bilirubin positive signifies conjugated serum tests evaluate plasma bilirubin haemolysis liver function essential definitive diagnosis total serum bilirubin exceeds mgdl unconjugated bilirubin occupies total amount classified unconjugated complete blood cell count illustrating decreased fraction intact erythrocytes signifies haemolysis hinting haemolytic haemolysis hepatocellular injury suggestive liver diseases like hepatitis inferred increased plasma concentration aminotransferases ast alt enzyme markers liver apart physical status medical drug family social history rule unrelated diseases give

recurrent liver disorders give clues genetic mutations hence hyperbilirubinemiaassociated congenital diseases social factors like alcohol intake sexual history also upon preliminary diagnosis imaging ordered investigate suspected biliary obstruction liver damage rightupper quadrant ultrasound adopted primarily high sensitivity specificity detecting gallstones biliary pancreatic abnormalities assessed computed tomography ct magnetic resonance imaging mri whereas liver biopsy bestsuited intrahepatic risk factors hyperbilirubinemia vary depending pathophysiology genetic diseases chemicals hinder hepatic uptake bilirubin increase bilirubin synthesis rate decrease bilirubin conjugation rate risk factors examples drugs include rifampin sulfa drug ethinyl estradiol alcohol significantly increases risk hyperbilirubinemia causing liver damage hinders bilirubin uptake metabolism longterm heavy alcohol consumption induces steatosis hepatitis possibly progressing alcohol degraded fat globules accumulate liver tissues gradually develop steatosis toxic metabolites alcohol also injure liver tissues lead liver inflammation called hepatitis damagerepair cycles liver tissues eventually result cirrhosis functional cells replaced nonfunctional scar conditions collectively named chronic alcoholic liver diseases observed patients daily alcohol consumption years meanwhile acute alcoholic hepatitis may develop amount alcohol intake within hours inducing acute another risk factor hyperbilirubinemia pregnancy gallstones common pregnant women due elevated hormones cholesterol levels block bile duct obstruct bilirubin besides preeclampsia eclampsia denoted high blood pressure linked hyperbilirubinemia damaging highly perfused organs particularly liver finally acute fatty liver pregnancy caused mitochondrial dysfunction leads liver three conditions induce hyperbilirubinemia similarly diminishing liver function consequently bilirubin metabolism hepatic viral infection may cause acute chronic hyperbilirubinemia hepatitis virus causes selflimited acute hepatitis b c similar symptoms hepatitis onsets later stage reaches chronic liver hepatitis virus satellite virus infect hepatitis b patients thus complications similar acute hyperbilirubinemia found hepatitis e patients chronic infection transmission routes hepatic viruses e oralfaecal hepatic viruses b c general conditions increase risk contracting hepatitis viruses infections include hyperbilirubinemia classified unconjugated conjugated hyperbilirubinemia former referring elevated unconjugated bilirubin often caused haemolytic diseases resulting increased bilirubin production impaired bilirubin conjugation latter often attributed direct hepatocyte injury impedes conjugated bilirubin underlying conditions hyperbilirubinemia prehepatic intrahepatic posthepatic unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia arises bilirubin reaches liver liver conjugation capacity overwhelmed haemolytic anaemias red blood cells disproportionately destroyed leading excessive haem metabolism thus bilirubin may stem hereditary spherocytosis congenital disease characterized abnormally sphereshaped erythrocytes rendering erythrocytes prone causes include enzyme irregularities like deficiency produce unusually structured apart erythrocyte disorders certain drugs bind albumin competitively occupying binding sites bilirubin instance sulfonamide antibacterial drug displaces bilirubin albumin increasing free concentration unconjugated hepatocellular injury cause unconjugated conjugated hyperbilirubinemia metabolic enzyme disorders hinder conjugation varying degrees gilbert syndrome hereditary disease affecting us population leads stressinduced mild mutated gene produces defective enzymes vital bilirubin pathology shared another genetic disorder criglernajjar syndrome subdivided two types type type former displaying complete enzyme activity loss latter partially affected thus unlike displaying lifelong persistent jaundice shows milder symptoms may escape diagnosis adulthood hepatitis commonly virus alcoholinduced causes internal liver inflammation disrupts conjugated bilirubin among primary hepatotropic viruses hepatitis presents acute onset jaundice usually first days upon entering icteric phase chronic hepatitis b c manifest jaundice alcohol acute alcoholic hepatitis triggers surge bilirubin chronic alcohol consumption affects liver bile acid uptake secretion causing chronic hyperbilirubinemia diseases like steatosis dubinjohnson syndrome rotors syndrome rare hereditary metabolic defects characterized synthesis faulty proteins responsible exporting conjugated bilirubin hepatocytes responsible majority isolated dubinjohnson syndrome associated abcc gene mutations creating insufficient functional transporters bilirubin rotor syndrome caused homozygous gene mutations instruct production hepatocyte membrane mediating uptake bilirubin glucuronide innate shortage two diseases lowers bilirubin removal efficiency causing hyperbilirubinemia druginduced cholestasis adverse outcome mechanisms direct hepatocyte injury includes competitive inhibition drug metabolites troglitazone metabolites outcompete bilirubin transporters posthepatic hyperbilirubinemia touches problems arising bilirubin conjugation including intrinsic extrinsic obstruction biliary tree impedes excretion conjugated bilirubin bile gallstones gallbladder known cholelithiasis common finding may progress cholecystitis inflammation gallbladder obstructs bile infection caused cholelithiasis symptoms jaundice fever pain collectively labelled charcots secondary extrahepatic disorders involve organs excluding liver tumour develops pancreas head bile duct common bile duct
