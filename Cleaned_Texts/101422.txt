hot air ovens electrical devices use dry heat sterilize originally developed louis generally use thermostat control temperature double walled insulation keeps heat conserves energy inner layer poor conductor outer layer metallic also air filled space aid insulation air circulating fan helps uniform distribution heat fitted adjustable wire mesh plated trays aluminium trays may onoff rocker switch well indicators controls temperature holding time capacities ovens vary power supply needs vary country country depending voltage frequency hertz used temperature sensitive tapes biological indicators using bacterial spores used controls test efficacy device use require water much pressure build within oven unlike autoclave making safer work also makes suitable used laboratory environment much smaller autoclaves still effective rapid autoclave higher temperatures reached compared means use dry heat instead moist heat pathogens like prions may killed every time based principle thermal inactivation oxidationcitation needed complete cycle involves heating oven required temperature maintaining temperature proper time interval temperature turning machine cooling articles closed oven till reach room temperature standard settings hot air oven plus time required preheat chamber beginning sterilization cycle door opened time heat escapes process becomes incomplete thus cycle must properly repeated widely used sterilize articles withstand high temperatures get burnt like glassware powders linen gets burnt surgical sharps lose sharpness httpsenwikipediaorgwikihotairoven
