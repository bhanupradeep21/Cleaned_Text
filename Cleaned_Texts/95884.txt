work hermann bondi thomas gold three many deep discussions cosmology radar work paid couple trips north america took opportunity visit astronomers one trip us learned supernovae caltech mount palomar canada nuclear physics plutonium implosion explosion noticed similarity two started thinking supernova nucleosynthesis intuition time make name works eventually prescient ground breaking paper came also formed group cambridge exploring stellar nucleosynthesis ordinary stars bothered paucity stellar carbon production existing models noticed one existing processes would made billion times productive nucleus resonance mev nuclear physicists list one another trip visited nuclear physics group caltech spending months sabbatical persuaded considerable scepticism look find hoyle state developed full theory stellar nucleosynthesis coauthored hoyle members caltech war hoyle returned cambridge university lecturer st johns college cambridge hoyles cambridge years saw rise top world astrophysics theory basis startling originality ideas covering wide range topics hoyle appointed plumian professor astronomy experimental philosophy cambridge university became founding director institute theoretical astronomy subsequently renamed institute astronomy cambridge innovative leadership quickly led institution becoming one premier groups world theoretical astrophysics invited deliver macmillan memorial lecture institution engineers shipbuilders scotland chose subject astronomical instruments hoyle knighted hoyle resigned plumian professor position directorship institute move effectively cutting establishment powerbase connections steady salary leaving cambridge hoyle wrote many popular science science fiction books well presenting lectures around world part motivation simply provide means support hoyle still member joint policy committee since planning stage angloaustralian telescope siding spring observatory new south wales became chairman angloaustralian telescope board presided inauguration charles prince wales resignation cambridge hoyle moved lake district occupied time mix treks across moors writing books visiting research centres around world working science ideas nearly universally rejected november hiking across moorlands west yorkshire near childhood home gilstead hoyle fell steep ravine called shipley glen roughly twelve hours later hoyle found search dog hospitalised two months pneumonia kidney problems resulting hypothermia well broken shoulder fall thereafter entered marked decline suffering memory mental agility problems suffered series strokes died bournemouth august year hoyle authored first two research papers ever published synthesis chemical elements heavier helium nuclear reactions stars first showed cores stars evolve temperatures billions degrees much hotter temperatures considered thermonuclear origin stellar power mainsequence stars hoyle showed high temperatures element iron become much abundant heavy elements owing thermal equilibrium among nuclear particles explaining high natural abundance iron idea would later called e hoyles second foundational nucleosynthesis published showed elements carbon iron synthesized equilibrium processes attributed elements specific nuclear fusion reactions abundant constituents concentric shells evolved massive presupernova stars startlingly modern picture accepted paradigm today supernova nucleosynthesis primary elements hoyle became leader group talented experimental theoretical physicists met cambridge william alfred fowler margaret burbidge geoffrey burbidge group systematized basic ideas chemical elements universe created field called nucleosynthesis famously group produced paper known initials four authors field nucleosynthesis organized complementary nuclear processes also added much new material synthesis heavy elements neutroncapture reactions socalled process r process influential paper become remainder twentieth century became default citation almost researchers wishing cite accepted origin nucleosynthesis theory result pathbreaking hoyle paper fell obscurity historical research century brought hoyles paper back scientific prominence historical arguments first presented gathering nucleosynthesis experts attending conference caltech organized deaths fowler hoyle celebrate anniversary publication ironically paper review hoyles supernovashells attribution origin elements silicon iron despite hoyles coauthorship based many personal discussions hoyle donald clayton attributed seemingly inexplicable oversight lack proofreading hoyle draft composed caltech gr burbidge em second hoyles nucleosynthesis papers also introduced interesting use anthropic principle known name trying work routes stellar nucleosynthesis hoyle calculated one particular nuclear reaction triplealpha process generates carbon helium would require carbon nucleus specific resonance energy spin work large amount carbon universe makes possible carbonbased lifeforms kind exist demonstrated hoyle nuclear reaction must work based notion hoyle therefore predicted values energy nuclear spin parity compound state carbon nucleus formed three alpha particles helium nuclei later borne energy level needed produce carbon large quantities statistically unlikely fall scheme carbon energy levels hoyle later wrote would say supercalculating intellect must designed properties carbon atom otherwise chance finding atom blind forces nature would utterly minuscule common sense interpretation facts suggests superintellect monkeyed physics well chemistry biology blind forces worth speaking nature numbers one calculates facts seem overwhelming put conclusion almost beyond question coworker william alfred fowler eventually nobel prize physics subrahmanyan chandrasekhar hoyles original contribution overlooked electors many surprised notable astronomer missed fowler autobiographical sketch affirmed hoyles pioneering efforts concept nucleosynthesis stars first established hoyle provided way explain existence elements heavier helium universe basically showing critical elements carbon could generated stars incorporated stars planets star dies new stars formed start heavier elements even heavier elements formed hoyle theorized rarer elements could explained supernovas giant explosions occasionally occur throughout universe whose temperatures pressures would required create elements argument lemaître theory later confirmed edwin hubbles observations universe expanding hoyle disagreed interpretation found idea universe beginning pseudoscience resembling arguments creator irrational process cant described scientific terms see kalam cosmological instead hoyle along thomas gold hermann bondi worked radar second world war began argue universe steady state formulated steady state theory theory tried explain universe could eternal essentially unchanging still galaxies observe moving away theory hinged creation matter galaxies time even though galaxies get apart new ones develop fill space leave resulting universe steady state manner flowing river individual water molecules moving away overall river remains theory one alternative big bang like big bang agreed key observations day namely hubbles red shift observations hoyle strong critic big bang coined term big bang bbc radios third programme broadcast march said george gamow opponents hoyle intended pejorative script read aloud interpreted opponents vain onesided insulting worthy hoyle explicitly denied insulting said striking image meant emphasize difference two theories radio another bbc interview said reason scientists like big bang overshadowed book genesis deep within psyche scientists believe first page hoyle famously heated argument martin ryle cavendish radio astronomy group hoyles steady state theory somewhat restricted collaboration cavendish group cambridge institute astronomy hoyle unlike gold bondi offered explanation appearance new matter postulating existence dubbed creation field cfield negative pressure order consistent conservation energy drive expansion universe cfield later de sitter solution cosmic inflation cfield model acts much slower de sitter inflation jointly argued continuous creation inexplicable appearance entire universe nothing although done regular basis end mounting observational evidence convinced cosmologists steady state model incorrect big bang theory agreed better observations although hoyle continued support develop theory attempt explain evidence steady state theory presented modified version called quasisteady state cosmology qss theory widely accepted evidence resulted big bangs victory steady state model included discovery cosmic microwave background radiation distribution young galaxies quasars throughout universe indicate consistent age estimate universe hoyle died never accepted validity big bang bigbang cosmology microwave background explained despite supporters bigbang cosmology claim explained supposed explanation nothing entry gardeners catalogue hypothesis constitutes theory observation given kelvins instead kelvins temperature kelvins would entered catalogue kelvins anything together narlikar hoyle developed particle theory theory gravity made predictions roughly einsteins general relativity incorporated machs principle einstein tried failed incorporate theory hoylenarlikar theory fails several tests including consistency microwave background motivated belief steady state model universe later years hoyle became staunch critic theories abiogenesis explain origin life earth chandra wickramasinghe hoyle promoted hypothesis first life earth began space spreading universe via panspermia evolution earth influenced steady influx viruses arriving via comets belief comets significant percentage organic compounds well ahead time dominant views comets largely consisted waterice presence organic compounds highly controversial wickramasinghe wrote highly polarized polemic darwinism creationism position unique although align either side sides treat us opponents thus outsiders unusual suggestion way crisis yet hoyle wickramasinghe advanced several instances say outbreaks illnesses earth extraterrestrial origins including flu pandemic certain outbreaks polio mad cow disease flu pandemic hypothesized cometary dust brought virus earth simultaneously multiple view almost universally dismissed experts pandemic hoyle presented evolution space royal institutions omni lecture considering thought remote possibility earthbased abiogenesis concluded one proceeds directly straightforwardly matter without deflected fear incurring wrath scientific opinion one arrives conclusion biomaterials amazing measure order must outcome intelligent design possibility able think published books evolution space coauthored chandra wickramasinghe hoyle calculated chance obtaining required set enzymes even simplest living cell without panspermia one since number atoms known universe infinitesimally tiny comparison argued earth lifes place origin could ruled claimed notion biopolymer operating program living cell could arrived chance primordial organic soup earth evidently nonsense high order though hoyle declared apparent suggestion guiding hand led conclusion superintellect monkeyed physics well chemistry biology blind forces worth speaking would go compare random emergence even simplest cell without panspermia likelihood tornado sweeping junkyard might assemble boeing materials therein compare chance obtaining even single functioning protein chance combination amino acids solar system full blind men solving rubiks cubes known junkyard hoyle fallacy advocate intelligent design id philosophy sometimes cite hoyles work area support claim universe fine tuned order allow intelligent life possible hoyle wellregarded works nucleosynthesis science popularization held positions wide range scientific issues direct opposition prevailing theories scientific paul davies describes loved maverick personality contempt orthodoxy quoting hoyle saying dont care think theories discrepant redshift better interesting wrong boring hoyle often expressed anger labyrinthine petty politics cambridge frequently feuded members institutions levels british astronomy community leading resignation cambridge september way thought donald lyndenbell chosen replace retiring professor roderick oliver redman behind according biographer simon mitton hoyle crestfallen felt colleagues cambridge addition views steady state theory panspermia hoyle also supported following controversial hypotheses speculations hoyle also centre two unrelated controversies involving politics selecting winner nobel prize physics first came prize went part antony hewish leading role discovery pulsars promptly hoyle made offthecuff remark reporter montreal yes jocelyn bell actual discoverer
