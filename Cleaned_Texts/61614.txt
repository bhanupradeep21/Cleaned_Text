fossil material known dyoplosaurus walter coombs concluded one species ankylosaurid campanian age late cretaceous north america synonymized species anodontosaurus lambei dyoplosaurus acutosquameus scolosaurus cutleri euoplocephalus tutus provide justification synonymization scolosaurus cutleri euoplocephalus tutus generally accepted thus nhmuk assigned e tutus however redescription scolosaurus published canadian journal earth sciences paul penkalski william blows suggested genus valid taxon concluded scolosaurus distinguished euoplocephalus form cervical armour details armour structure forelimb also concluded scolosaurus dyoplosaurus distinct due differences noted pelvis due completeness holotype scolosaurus formed basis euoplocephalus reconstructions since therefore images euoplocephalus actually depict scolosaurus instead study found ankylosaurine oohkotokia indistinguishable scolosaurus therefore considered junior however synonymization contentious oohkotokia subsequently recognized thus much material illustrated belonging scolosaurus may actually pertain oohkotokia following cladogram based phylogenetic analysis ankylosaurinae conducted victoria arbour
