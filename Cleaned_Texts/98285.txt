genes recently researchers used transgenic mouse connect app cognitive problems among studies shown activity superoxide dismutase enzyme elevated syndrome sod converts oxygen radicals hydrogen peroxide water oxygen radicals produced cells damaging cellular structures hence important role sod however hypothesis says sod activity increases disproportionately enzymes responsible removal hydrogen peroxide eg glutathione peroxidase cells suffer peroxide damage scientists believe treatment syndrome neurons free radical scavengers substantially prevent neuronal degeneration oxidative damage neurons results rapid brain aging similar alzheimers disease dna oxidation product wellestablished marker oxidative dna damage arising oxidative stress excessive production reactive oxygen species levels dna persons ds measured saliva found significantly higher control levels also found higher persons ds compared controls fetal adult ds fibroblasts defective removal compared agematched cells control healthy findings suggest oxidative dna damage may underlie clinical premature aging features ds human chromosome contains five microrna genes trisomy entails increased risk many chronic diseases typically associated older age increased risk alzheimers disease clinical manifestations accelerated aging suggest trisomy increases biological age tissues molecular evidence hypothesis
