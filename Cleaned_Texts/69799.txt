selfregulated learning srl one domains selfregulation aligned closely educational broadly speaking refers learning guided metacognition thinking ones thinking strategic action planning monitoring evaluating personal progress standard motivation selfregulated learner monitors directs regulates actions toward goals information acquisition expanding expertise selfimprovement particular selfregulated learners cognizant academic strengths weaknesses repertoire strategies appropriately apply tackle daytoday challenges academic tasks learners hold incremental beliefs intelligence opposed entity fixed views intelligence attribute successes failures factors eg effort expended task effective use strategies within finally selfregulated learners take challenging tasks practice learning develop deep understanding subject matter exert effort towards academic part characteristics may help explain selfregulated learners usually exhibit high sense educational psychology literature researchers linked characteristics success beyond selfregulated learners successful control learning environment exert control directing regulating actions toward learning goals selfregulated learning used three different phases learning first phase initial learning second phase troubleshooting problem encountered learning third phase trying teach according winne hadwin selfregulation unfolds four flexibly sequenced phases recursive cognition phases task perception goal setting planning enacting adaptation zimmerman suggested selfregulated learning process three stages baba nitta demonstrated zimmermans cyclical selfregulatory processes extended longer periods time selfreflection close connection second language writing development complex dynamic systems theory perspective wind harding found attractor states might negatively affect cyclicality selfregulatory processesclarification according irannejhad chissom three sources selfregulated learning activeexecutive dynamic interestcreating discovery model selfregulation social cognitive perspective looks triadic interaction person eg beliefs success behavior eg engaging task environment eg feedback teacher zimmerman et al specified three important characteristics selfregulated citation needed extent one accurately reflects ones progress towards learning goal appropriately adjusts actions performed order maximize performance foreseeable outcome effectively point ones self become selfregulated students school career primary goal teachers produce selfregulated learners using theories information processing model ipm storing information longterm memory live document like runbook learner retrieve upon demand apply metalearning tasks thereby become selfregulated learner winne marx posited motivational thoughts beliefs governed basic principles cognitive psychology conceived informationprocessing terms motivation plays major role selfregulated learning motivation needed apply effort continue faced difficulty control also plays role selfregulated learning helps learner stay track reaching learning goal avoid distracted things stand way learning lovett meyer thille observed comparable student performance instructorled selfregulated learning environments subsequent study selfregulated learning shown enable accelerated learning maintaining longterm retention cassandra b whyte noted importance internal locus control tendencies successful academic performance also compatible selfregulated learning whyte recognized appreciated external factors include benefit working good teacher encouraging selfregulated hard work skillbuilding positive attitude perform better academic increase positive attitudes academic performance expert learners created expert learners develop selfregulated learning strategies one strategies ability develop ask questions use questions expand prior knowledge technique allows learners test true understanding knowledge make correction content areas misunderstanding learners engage questioning forces actively engaged learning also allows self analyze determine level active engagement allows learner organize concepts existing schemas use questions learners accommodate assimilate new knowledge existing schema process allows learner solve novel problems existing schema work novel problem learner must reevaluate assess level many practical applications selfregulated learning schools classrooms paris paris state three main areas direct application classrooms literacy instruction cognitive engagement area literacy instruction educators teach students skills necessary lead become selfregulated learners using strategies reciprocal teaching openended tasks projectbased tasks promote selfregulated learning authentic assessments autonomybased assignments portfolios strategies studentcentered inquirybased cause students gradually become autonomous creating environment selfregulated learning however students simply need know strategies need realize importance utilizing order experience academic success according dweck master students use learning strategies continued use face difficulty based beliefs strategies necessary learning effective ways overcoming obstacles students selfregulated learners may daydream rarely complete assignments forget assignments completely practice selfregulation ask questions take notes allocate time effectively use resources available pajares lists several practices successful students zimmerman colleagues developed chapter motivation selfregulated learning theory research applications behaviors include limited finishing homework assignments deadlines studying interesting things concentrating school subjects taking useful class notes class instruction using library information class assignments effectively planning schoolwork effectively organizing schoolwork remembering information presented class textbooks arranging place
