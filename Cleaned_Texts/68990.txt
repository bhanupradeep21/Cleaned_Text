cue reactivity type learned response observed individuals addiction involves significant physiological psychological reactions presentations drugrelated stimuli ie drug cues central tenet cue reactivity cues previously predicting receipt drug reward certain conditions evoke stimulus associated responses urges use drugs words learned cues signal drug reward cues previously associated drug use elicit cuereactivity arousal anticipation changes behavioral motivation responses drug cue physiological eg sweating salvation brain activity behavioral eg drug seeking symbolic expressive eg craving clinical utility cue reactivity based conceptualization drug cues elicit craving critical factor maintenance relapse drug additionally cue reactivity allows development testable hypotheses grounded established theories human therefore researchers leveraged cue reactivity paradigm study addiction antecedents relapse craving translate preclinical findings clinical samples contribute development new treatment methods testing cue reactivity human samples involves exposing individuals substance use disorder drugrelated cues eg cigarettes alcohol drug paraphernalia drug neutral cues eg pencils glasses water measuring reactions assessing changes selfreported drug craving physiological responses eg blood pressure salvation brain activity drummond identified preliminary classification cue types including four main categories exteroceptive interceptive temporal cue cues exteroceptive characterized external drugrelated stimuli sight smell visual cues include sight preferred drug advertisement environment drug use occurs eg bar house olfactory cues include smell preferred drug smells associated drug use gustation cues include sip alcohol initial inhale smoke cues exteroceptive commonly studied laboratory interoceptive cues characterized internal cues stress response negative positive mood withdrawal related states temporal cues relate proximity distance substance use time instance cues occurring proximally ingestion substance may salient produce greater reactivity compared distal additionally time day cues encountered may impact salience cue time day substance habitually consumed may become temporal cue drummond example end workday weekend day may become cue eliciting lastly theory behind cue relationships likely complex relationship drug cues rarely occur isolation realworld thus interrelationship cues eliciting cue reactivity possible drummond interrelationship described cue cluster cue chain cue cascade cue cluster describes cooccurring cues cooccurring cue necessary reactivity sufficient condition substance use cue chain describes sequential relationship cues leading use example sight preferred substance like alcohol drink may salient individual certain context like similarly cue cascade describes process cue increasing likelihood encountering salience next cue reactivity often conceptualized models classical conditioning theorized cues nearly exclusively encountered time drug administration develop ability predict administration effect words systematic association exteroceptive interoceptive cues ie conditioned stimuli drug administration ie unconditioned stimuli cues reliably signal administration drug effects cues predict administration acquire ability elicit physiological psychological responses ie cue reactivity conditioned response increase likelihood substance although substantial amount research cue reactivity exact theoretical explanation cue reactivity remains three prominent models cue reactivity conditioned withdrawal model conditioned appetitive motivational model conditioned compensatory response common across three models described terms classical conditioning cues repeatedly associated substance administration eventually elicit conditioned three models differ nature reaction conditioned withdrawal model developed wikler characterizes conditioned response unconditioned substance withdrawal instance drinking episode individual alcohol use disorder exposed cues eg sight smell preferred beverage containing alcohol point blood alcohol level falling ie unconditioned stimuli morning heavy drinking time individual likely state unconditioned alcohol withdrawal ie unconditioned response exteroceptive cue becomes associated alcohol withdrawal therefore period abstinence individual exposed exteroceptive cues ie conditioned stimuli conditioned withdrawallike reaction elicited ie conditioned response conditioned appetitive motivational model states drug cues become associated pleasurable unconditioned effects substances leads druglike conditioned words conditioned response resembles unconditioned effect conditioned compensatory response model formed siegel postulates conditioned response opposite unconditioned drug effect conditioned response part homeostatic response resulting development drug conditioning model empirically although theories substance dependence acknowledge role conditioning view research invaluable theories assume conditioning sufficient explaining phenomena cue reactivity appears complex highly therefore cognitive theories proposed cognitive urge automaticity model prominent cognitive theory addiction purposes behaviors associated substance administration become automatic cues trigger automatized model consistent addiction models emphasize habitlike processes additionally cognitive labeling theory argues contextual cue state individual contributes interpretation arousal cue may trigger arousal individual may perceive cue predicting substance administration triggers craving substance cognitive behavioral theories hypothesize cues elicit craving highlighting positive effects substance resulting substance lastly attentional bias used conceptualize cue reactivity substancerelated cues grab attention individual engaging substance use cue individual contextual substance factors affect salience cue reactivity regarding cue characteristics vivo cues cues directly experienced greater salience imaginal cues ie vividly imagined moreover interoceptive cues eg initial priming effects substance found greater salience imaginal visual overall cues greater association substance consumption likely salient cues limited research found individual variability cue reactivity instance craving highly variable among individuals reactions laboratory cues vary participants showing much cue specific sources individual variability include gender genetic factors personality eg introversion neuroticism impulsivity treatment status degree alcohol dependence additional individual factor affecting cue reactivity individuals alcohol dependent additionally contextspecific expectancies perceived availability substance efficacy expectations found pertaining substance factors latency since last use important factor critical component factor impact withdrawal withdrawal may increase salience similarly additional potential effect deprivation one substance another deprivation one substance increase urge reactivity another research shown cue reactivity experienced among individuals dependent variety substances including alcohol nicotine opiates however research focused substances primarily done isolation nuances regarding cue reactivity within substance cues elicit greatest reactivity among alcohol use disorder ingestion small amount alcohol expectancy alcohol responses commonly elicited alcohol cue exposure among alcohol use disorder includes increased salvation increased sweating greater selfreported alcohol smoking cuereactivity responses commonly reported psychophysiological arousal including skin conductance vasoconstriction heart rate craving strongest regarding opiates auditory visual role play drug sales appear influential mood states may also significantly elicit cuereactivity psychophysiological responses commonly elicited opiate cues include decreases peripheral temperature skin cocaine cue reactivity much less limited research audiovisual stimuli drug sales consumption commonly elicit significant reactivity psychophysiological responses associated cocaine use cues decreased peripheral temperature skin resistance decreased heart rate greater selfreported cue reactivity predictive relapse reinstatement dependence empirically theoretically even extended periods abstinence ie years cues reported preceding moreover degree cuereactivity may predict individual differences relapse study abrams colleagues found individuals resumed smoking smoking cessation significantly higher interceptive cue reactivity eg anxiety cigarette craving continued cessation authors concluded suggested reactivity smoking cues plays role smoking recent study grusser colleagues looked association alcohol cues relapse among sample detoxified abstinent patients alcohol use findings showed greater visual alcohol cueelicited activation dorsomedial prefrontal cortex dmpfc predicted resuming alcohol consumption following moreover findings review two functional brain imaging studies investigating association stress drugrelated cues relapse suggested specific regions corticostriatal limbic circuitry involving stress drug cue induced craving associated drug given theoretical conceptualization influence cue reactivity relapse could understood greater cueinduced craving laboratory predict risk relapse realworld similar cues encountered natural therefore psychotherapy pharmacotherapy blunts cue reactivity laboratory marker treatment efficacy gives merit research utilizing cue reactivity paradigm relevant theory treatment approach addictions cue reactivity typically studied laboratory laboratory paradigm involves participants systematically exposed substance cues elicit substance related responses cue exposure laboratory paradigms relatively standard first participants complete battery baseline measures including psychological physiological assessments preexposure measurements second participants exposed either neutral substance related cue third psychological physiological measurements repeated postexposure measurements variety cue presentations utilized procedure vivo eg sitting front preferred substance like bottle beer imaginal eg vividly imagining situations related drug use audio eg listening recording someone describing substance use pictorial eg viewing pictures substance use virtual cue presentations also combination instance participant interacting smelling seeing preferred alcohol drink listening recording recounting past substance use recommended researchers use drugrelated neutral control cues eg pencil glass water rather drugrelated cues preexposure baseline another recommended approach neutral cue psychoactive effect yet similar active substance like holding pencil smoking cue paradigm variety reactions cues assessed including selfreported craving mood states physiological changes eg heart rate skin conductance salvation blood pressure skin temperature lever pressing ie preclinical recently cue reactivity paradigm used neuroimaging methods study regional changes brain activity following exposure cue reactivity paradigm frequently used method within addictions field allows testing hypotheses regarding additions process controlled laboratory setting grounded although cue reactivity paradigm established laboratory promotes standardization cues reduce noise within paradigm lack generalizability realworld cue reactivity important limitation cue reactivity salient substance use exposed relevant cues vulnerable researchers made efforts make cue reactivity paradigm ecologically valid participants take digital pictures another commonly used methodology ecological momentary assessment ema involves realtime data collection natural ema methods allow collection realtime craving mood substance use contextual information possible laboratory setting ecologically valid methods build classic cue reactivity paradigm increase generalizability natural environment use cue reactivity paradigm useful method understand pharmacotherapy psychotherapy paradigm used evaluate treatment efficacy given hypothesis reducing cueelicited urge use withdrawal protect continued substance use among substance use moreover treatments often designed mitigate craving cue reactivity paradigm allows testing potential efficacy cue reactivity outcome measure widely used pharmacotherapy studies labeled goldstandard instance miranda colleagues tested effects naltrexone opiate receptor antagonist adolescent alcohol cue reactivity study found naltrexone blunted alcohol cue elicited craving laboratory natural regarding psychotherapy assessing cue reactivity provided insight potential relapse triggers cue exposure used treatment approach given substance related cues promote substance use common treatment strategies cognitive behavioral therapy assist patients identifying cues developing strategies avoid avoidable cue exposure treatment patients exposed personally relevant substance cues vivo imaginal repeated unreinforced exposure stimuli previously associated substance use thought extinguish rid conditioned response personally relevant cues although cue exposure treatment shown benefit validated clinical trials controversy around
