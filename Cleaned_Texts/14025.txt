erythropoietic protoporphyria commonly called epp form porphyria varies severity painful arises deficiency enzyme ferrochelatase leading abnormally high levels protoporphyrin red blood cells erythrocytes plasma skin severity varies significantly individual individual clinically similar form porphyria known xlinked dominant protoporphyria identified epp usually presents childhood common
