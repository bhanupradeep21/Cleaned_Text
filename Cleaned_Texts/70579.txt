theoretical foundations evolutionary psychology general specific scientific theories explain ultimate origins psychological traits terms evolution theories originated charles darwins work including speculations evolutionary origins social instincts humans modern evolutionary psychology however possible advances evolutionary theory century evolutionary psychologists say natural selection provided humans many psychological adaptations much way generated humans anatomical physiological adaptations general psychological adaptations said specialized environment organism evolved environment evolutionary adaptedness sexual selection provides organisms adaptations related male mammals relatively fast reproduction rate sexual selection leads adaptations help compete female mammals relatively slow reproduction rate sexual selection leads choosiness helps females select higher quality charles darwin described natural selection sexual selection relied group selection explain evolution selfsacrificing behavior group selection weak explanation group less selfsacrificing animals likely survive group become less selfsacrificing william hamilton proposed inclusive fitness theory emphasizing geneseye view evolution hamilton noted individuals increase replication genes next generation helping close relatives share genes survive reproduce according hamiltons rule selfsacrificing behavior evolve helps close relatives much compensates individual animals sacrifice inclusive fitness theory resolved issue altruism evolved theories also help explain evolution altruistic behavior including evolutionary game theory titfortat reciprocity generalized reciprocity theories help explain development altruistic behavior also account hostility toward cheaters individuals take advantage others several midlevel evolutionary theories inform evolutionary psychology rk selection theory proposes species prosper many offspring others follow strategy fewer offspring investing much one humans follow second strategy parental investment theory explains parents invest less individual offspring based successful offspring likely thus much might improve parents inclusive fitness according hypothesis parents good conditions tend invest sons best able take advantage good conditions parents poor conditions tend invest daughters best able successful offspring even poor conditions according life history theory animals evolve life histories match environments determining details age first reproduction number offspring dual inheritance theory posits genes human culture interacted genes affecting development culture culture turn affecting human evolution genetic level see also baldwin effect critics evolutionary psychology sometimes challenged theoretical underpinnings saying humans never developed powerful social instincts natural selection hypotheses evolutionary psychologists merely justsostories evolutionary psychology primarily uses theories natural selection sexual selection inclusive fitness explain evolution psychological adaptations evolutionary psychology sometimes seen simply subdiscipline psychology metatheoretical framework entire field psychology evolutionary psychologists consider charles darwins theory natural selection important understanding natural selection occurs individual organisms genetically better suited current environment leave descendants genes spread population thus explaining organisms fit environments process slow cumulative new traits layered older advantages created natural selection known evolutionary psychologists say animals evolve physical adaptations evolve psychological evolutionary psychologists emphasize natural selection mostly generates specialized adaptations efficient general point natural selection operates slowly adaptations sometimes date environment changes case humans evolutionary psychologists say much human nature shaped stone age may match contemporary sexual selection favors traits provide mating advantages peacocks tail even traits usually evolutionary psychologists point unlike natural selection sexual selection typically leads evolution sex sex differences typically make reproduction faster one sex slower case mates relatively scarce faster sexual selection favors traits increase number mates fast sex quality mates slow mammals female slower reproduction males typically evolve either traits help fight males traits impress females typically evolve greater abilities discern qualities males choosiness inclusive fitness theory proposed william hamilton emphasized geneseye view evolution hamilton noted evolution ultimately selects genes groups species perspective individuals increase replication genes next generation directly via reproduction also indirectly helping close relatives share genes survive reproduce general evolutionary theory modern form essentially inclusive fitness theory inclusive fitness theory resolved issue altruism evolved dominant prehamiltonian view altruism evolved via group selection notion altruism evolved benefit group problem one organism group incurred fitness costs benefit others group ie acted altruistically organism would reduce ability survive andor reproduce therefore reducing chances passing altruistic traits furthermore organism benefited altruistic act acted behalf fitness would increase chance survival andor reproduction thus increasing chances passing selfish traits inclusive fitness resolved problem altruism demonstrating altruism evolve via kin selection expressed hamiltons rule words altruism evolve long fitness cost altruistic act part actor less degree genetic relatedness recipient times fitness benefit recipient perspective reflects referred genecentered view evolution demonstrates group selection weak selective force bodies minds organisms made evolved adaptations designed help organism survive particular ecology example fur polar bears eye food preferences etc organisms evolve physical mental traits designed specifically attract mates eg peacocks tail compete members ones sex access opposite sex eg antlers selection occurs robustly level gene individual group species reproductive success thus indirect via shared genes kin altruistic toward kin thus genetic payoffs also see genecentered view evolution also hamilton argued sexual reproduction evolved primarily defense pathogens bacteria viruses shuffle genes create greater diversity especially immunological variability offspring two sexes often conflicting strategies regarding much invest offspring many offspring parents allocate resources offspring higher reproductive value eg mom always liked best parents offspring may conflicting interests eg wean allocation resources among offspring etc organisms adapt respond competitors depending strategies used competitors strategies evaluated probable payoffs alternatives population typically results evolutionary stable strategy evolutionary stable average bettered alternative strategies specific game strategy see shown optimal achieving evolutionary stable equilibrium situations repeated social interactions one plays nice nonkin mutually beneficially reciprocal relationship maintained across multiple interactions cheating punished also called strong reciprocity one play nice nonkin strangers even single interactions social rules cheating maintained neutral third parties eg individuals governments institutions etc majority group members cooperate generally adhering social rules social interactions create positive sum game ie bigger overall pie results group cooperation generalized reciprocity may set adaptations designed small ingroup cohesion times high intertribal warfare outgroups today capacity altruistic ingroup strangers may result serendipitous generalization mismatch ancestral tribal living small groups todays large societies entail many single interactions strangers dark side generalized reciprocity may adaptations may also underlie aggression toward outgroups capacity generalized altruism acting like good samaritan cognitive concepts justice ethics human rights outgroup members capacity xenophobia racism warfare genocide susan blackmore boyd richerson genes replicators subject evolutionary change cultural characteristics also referred eg ideas rituals tunes cultural fads etc replicate spread brain brain many evolutionary principles apply genes apply memes well genes memes may times coevolve geneculture coevolution middlelevel evolutionary theories consistent
