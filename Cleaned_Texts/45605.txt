sphenacodon meaning wedge point tooth extinct genus synapsid lived million years ago late carboniferous early permian periods like closely related dimetrodon sphenacodon carnivorous member eupelycosauria family sphenacodontidae however sphenacodon low crest along back formed bladelike bones vertebrae neural spines instead tall dorsal sail found dimetrodon fossils sphenacodon known new mexico border region north america researchers currently recognize two species sphenacodon ferox type species sphenacodon ferocior sphenacodon ferocior larger overall size ft long compared sphenacodon ferox ft addition dorsal spines sphenacodon ferocior proportionately taller sphenacodon ferox recent nearly complete skull sphenacodon ferox helped clarify distinctions two species including number teeth certain parts jaws size indented notch maxillary premaxillary bones upper jaw two species occur together formations sphenacodon ferox apparently survived later early permian sphenacodon dimetrodon typically found different geographical areas separated ancient hueco seaway penetrated equatorial pangaea early permian covered much southern new mexico parts west sphenacodon known west

amphibians diadectids early synapsids sphenacodon appears died million years ago genus dimetrodon survived million years ago large sphenacodontid predators later replaced therapsids group synapsids includes direct ancestors skull sphenacodon similar narrow side side vertically deep indented notch front maxillary bone upper jaw upper lower jaws equipped array powerful teeth divided sharp pointed incisors precaniniforms large stabbing canines caniniforms smaller slicing back teeth postcaniniforms orbit set high far back single opening temporal fenestra behind partly eye characteristic synapsids body proportions also similar dimetrodon large head short neck robust trunk relatively short front hind limbs tapering tail makes half animals entire length however tops neural spines along back bone strikingly different genus dimetrodon neural spines develop long narrow cylindrical projections support tall vertical dorsal sail ends near base tail sphenacodon neural spines enlarged retain flattipped bladelike shape along back tail form crest rather tall sail sphenacodontid genus ctenospondylus also bladelike neural spines dorsal crest taller sphenacodon although tall sail dimetrodon evidence strong epaxial muscles along base raised neural spines sphenacodon dimetrodon likely helping stiffen strengthen backbone walking lunging prey restricting sidetoside flexing motion recent structure neural spines sphenacodon confirms upper parts encased thick muscular hump instead protruded layer muscle form low dorsal crest finds sphenacodontid specimens postmortem distortion body caused dorsal spines overlap suggests spines connected hard particularly tough tissue possible function low skincovered crest sphenacodon debated thermoregulatory role seems unlikely although taller crest sphenacodon ferocior allometrically larger ferox recent research favored display role tall sails dimetrodon sphenacodon dimetrodon depicted short limbs splayed outward degrees body wide pushup position tail even belly dragging ground similar modern lizards crocodiles sprawling stance also typical sphenacodon dimetrodon skeletons currently mounted museums however trackways called dimetropus dimetrodon foot match foot configuration large sphenacodontids show animals walking limbs brought body narrow semierect gait without tail belly drag marks clear evidence efficient upright posture suggests important details anatomy locomotion sphenacodon dimetrodon may fully well preserved narrow dimetropus tracks found parts prehistoric trackways national monument new mexico match
