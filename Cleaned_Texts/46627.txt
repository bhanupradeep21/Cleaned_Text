adrenergic blocking agents class drugs exhibit pharmacological action inhibiting action sympathetic nervous body sympathetic nervous systemsns autonomic nervous system control triggers series responses body releases chemicals named noradrenaline chemicals act adrenergic receptors subtypes ultimately allow body trigger fightorflight response handle external responses include vessel constriction general vessels whereas vasodilation vessels supply skeletal muscles coronary additionally heart rate contractile force increase sns activated may harmful cardiac function increases metabolic adrenergic blocking agents treat certain diseases blocking adrenergic preventing activated noradrenaline epinephrine result stops body producing fightorflight responses drugs approved food drug administration fda whereas offlabel uses well alpha blockers mostly act smooth muscles especially ones control size thus blockers dilate blood vessels decrease blood depending site action used treat different used treat signs symptoms benign prostatic hyperplasia hypertension first line agent pheochromocytoma extravasation management reversal local label use well chronic prostatitis lower urinary tract symptoms males ureteral calculus expulsion ureteral stentrelated urinary used posttraumatic stress disorder raynaud phenomenon hypertensive crisis extravasation sympathomimetic vasopressors problem urine related neurogenic bladder functional outlet obstruction partial prostate blocker reduces transmission neurotransmitters circulating around body contributes contraction smooth instead treating diseases used antidotes reversing overdose agonist reducing toxic effect limited indications present drug research progress investigate possible use since beta receptor mainly located heart beta blockers take abnormalities associated heart treats medical conditions like hypertension arrhythmias heart failure chest pain myocardial infarction treats symptoms unrelated heart like migraines blockers promote vasodilation tissues mentioned abovearterioles skeletal muscles ciliary muscle eye etc currently blocker fda butoxamine example beta blocker clinical use used due relatively limited study receptor much development blocker therefore blocker clinical use drugs nonselective exert actions different receptors examples include nonselective beta blocker block receptor

tissue requires high level alpha adrenergic sympathetic input arterial resistance vascular capacitance outflow tract urinary undesirable symptoms mentioned following selective blocker part vasodilation smooth muscle relaxation caused around patients present undesirable effects astheniaweakness dizziness faintness adverse outcomes even uncommon include headache drowsiness palpitations urinary incontinence mild body weight gain kg may associated secondary hyperaldosteronism also observed blockers associated firstdose effect refers tachycardia response orthostatic hypotension caused systemic vasodilation initial administration first administration patients may experience short period orthostatic hypotension sensation intense faintness aggravated upright posture intravascular volume depletion concurrent administration antihypertensive apart increasing noradrenaline release selective blockers potential bind receptors serotonin however serotonin receptor antagonism side effects weight gain impaired hence blockers used clinically due extensive binding similar blocker family also present firstdose effect generally less pronounced compared central nervous system cns side effects beta blockers including sleep impairment dreaming nightmares hallucinations generally small also effects shortterm memory cardioselective blockers could cause adverse effects including bradycardia reduced exercise ability hypotension atrioventricular nodal blockage heart possible adverse effects include nausea vomiting abdominal discomfort dizziness weakness headache fatigue dryness mouth sexual impairment memory loss confusion regarded rare side diabetic patients extra risk masking hypoglycemiainduced tachycardia continuous hypoglycemia could cause acute brain blockade receptors result vasoconstriction smooth muscle effects similar agonism receptors side effects include hypertension tachycardia arrhythmia subcutaneous ischemia site possible side effects include raynaud phenomenon hypoglycemia exercise muscle cramps increase airway due relatively limited study receptor much development blocker therefore limited information adverse effects caused blocker alpha blocker dilate blood vessels lowers blood thus contraindicate patients history orthostatic hypotension current use phosphodiesterase moreover alpha blocker given patients heart failure since expands blood limited information contraindication blocker since limited clinical uses traditionally blocker several contraindications including recent history fluid retention without use diuretics complete second degree heart whilst studies suggest minor differences terms adverse effect asthma patients nonasthma patients blockers generally prescribed asthma patients patients chronic obstructive pulmonary disease due potential blockage beta additionally blocker given patients peripheral vascular diseases diabetes mellitus since blockage receptors may lead vasoconstriction delayed response hypoglycemia beta blocker avoided patients asthma copd causes may also increase chance hypoglycemic comas diabetic due relatively limited study receptor much development blocker therefore blocker clinical use contraindications blocker observed overdose blocker lead unopposed parasympathetic symptoms include bradycardia hypotension miosis sedation lack information regarding toxicity caused overdose blocker due limited clinical uses toxicity blocker contribute symptoms including bradycardia hypotension due extensive blockage moreover overdose blocker may lead loss selectivity bind receptor causing bronchopulmonary overdose lipophilic blocker disturb neurologic functioning eventually lead altered mental mitigate toxicity blocker glucagon salts like calcium sodium bicarbonate magnesium sulfate used reverse effect treating hypotension similar blocker lack information blockers toxicity due limited clinical uses due relatively limited study receptor much development blocker therefore much information regarding toxic effect blocker blockers alfuzosin doxazosin tamsulosin silodosin involve enzyme metabolism particularly blockers conjugate glucuronidation metabolism inhibitors inhibit glucuronidation hence reduce glucuronideconjugated hence potent inhibitors potentially increase exposure alpha blockers however clinically significant evidence supporting drug interaction blocker since blocker limited clinical uses lack information drug interaction regarding blocker additional hypotensive effects may occur patients taking blockers antihypertensive drugs nitrates pde inhibitors ace inhibitors calcium channel combination beta blockers antihypertensive drugs work different mechanism lower blood example coadministration blocker atenolol ace inhibitor lisinopril could produce larger reduction blood pressure using either drug antihypertensive drugs hypertensive drugs affect blood pressure opposite common hypertensive drugs uk nsaids nsaids inhibit synthesis prostaglandin increases blood pressure potentially reduce efficacy several antihypertensive since blocker limited clinical uses lack information drug interaction regarding blocker since blocker still development lack information drug interaction blocker alpha blocker exerts action receptor dilating smooth receptor gq type gprotein coupled activated lead activation phospholipase c raising intracellular level result higher intracellular concentration calcium achieved contributing smooth muscle contraction alpha blockers contrast bind act inhibitors receptors hence preventing downstream action
