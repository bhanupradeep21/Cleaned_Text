algae scrubber water filtering device confused scrubber pad used clean glass uses light grow algae process undesirable chemicals removed algae scrubbers allow saltwater freshwater pond hobbyists operate tanks using natural filtration form primary production much like oceans lakes algae scrubber filters water moving water rapidly rough highly illuminated surface causes algae start growing large amounts algae grow consume nutrients nitrate phosphate nitrite ammonia ammonium even metals copper nutrients normally problem aquariums ponds cause nuisance algae grow also cause sickness andor problems aquarium fish invertebrates algae scrubber allows algae grow algae grow inside filter instead aquarium pond removes excess nutrients scrubs water diminishing nuisance algae aquarium pond nuisance algae aquarium pond confused desired algae algae scrubber filter algae grow algae scrubber removed fed back livestock iron fertilization ocean nourishment techniques boost primary production

chaetomorpha caulerpa film algae well dinoflagellates aiptasia algae scrubber invented dr walter adey beginning late director marine systems laboratory museum natural history smithsonian institution washington dc research various types algae especially ecological role coral reefs gave insight ocean particular reef recycles nutrients designed built various exhibits ranging size gallons modeled different aquatic ecological systems including tropical coral reeflagoon years closure environment chemical parameters controlled solely algal turf scrubber system studied multidisciplinary team biologists demonstrated calcification coral growth rates equal best percent wild reefs identified species estimated species ranked per unit area biodiverse reef ever three editions book dynamic

gallons mesocosm size gallons describing algal turf scrubber designed explained removing excess nutrients function operating scrubber night main tank shifted different respiratory phase plants absorbing oxygen rather producing scrubber maintained oxygen levels helped buffer ph preventing high levels carbon dioxide building recycling means nutrients go plants animals back plants land see recycling following oxygen flow green plants use carbon dioxide release oxygen animals use oxygen release carbon dioxide oceans lakes nutrients go algae animals back algae dr adey built several versions algae scrubbers aquariums smithsonian called algal turf scrubbers time believed turf algae best type algae grow scrubber also granted first us patent dumpingbucket algae described complex dumping device poured water onto horizontal surface thus simulating waves reef environment several years development participated test large algae scrubber great barrier reef aquarium reef tank represents first application algal scrubber technology large volume aquarium systems aquaria using conventional water purification methods eg bacterial filters generally nutrient levels parts per million algal scrubbers maintained parts per billion concentrations much lower despite heavy biological loading reef tank success algal scrubbers maintaining suitable water quality coral reef demonstrated observed spawning scleractinian corals many tank unfortunately known time calcium alkalinity needed added enclosed reef tank order replace utilized growing calcifying organisms even five

elements compounds may become limiting factors surprising organisms could deplete thousands gallons seawater three six thousand elements even within two researchers added calcium andor connected tanks ocean also supplies calcium alkalinity corals began growing nevertheless problem nutrients ammonia ammonium nitrate nitrite phosphate metals always kept low numbers dr adey licensed patent individuals short number years sold limited number aquarium scrubbers hobbyists complexity design however cost license caused scrubber units expensive combined fact units noisy splashy unreliable dumping mechanism would get stuck caused sales slow scrubbers starting make headway aquarium hobby adey decided withdraw license longer allow anybody make sell turned attention instead commercial industrial applications entered private business making large scale scrubber installations lakes internet developed aquarium pond hobbyists began discussing nuisance algae problems started noticing trend aquariums ponds high amounts nuisance algae detectable nutrients water first seemed odd since amount nuisance algae increase nutrients water increased could large amount nuisance algae measurable nutrients water support biologists began pointing amount nuisance algae became large enough algae actually consumed available nutrients water faster new nutrients added dr adey theorized interest using algae nutrient control increased time form keeping algae sump small aquarium connected main aquarium via plumbing added lighting flow algae would grow area algae would consume nutrients water dr adeys algae scrubber units sumps small aquariums used purpose became known name refugium used growing algae provided safe place small microscopic animals breed grow thus refuge large fish invertebrates main aquarium would otherwise consume however refugiums indeed consume nutrients water consume fast enough situations caused many hobbyists continue nuisance algae problems main aquariums recent variations built simple waterfall driven gravity using simple pvc plumbing pipe flow water piece plastic knitting screen also known plastic canvas roughed allow algae attach almost every case homemade algae scrubbers reduced nutrients low levels reduced eliminated nuisance algae problems addition turf algae focus dr adeys dumpingbucket design replaced green hair turf algae tends dark brown thick like artificial turf sports fields blocks light water reaching screen slows growth filtering algae bottom layers algae attached screen start die detach green algae however especially lightgreen hair algae allows light water penetrate way screen growth kept less mm allows algae grow faster absorb nutrients without dying losing attachment screen fortunate green hair algae exact type algae grows automatically properly constructed algae scrubber models also use upflowing air bubbles version basically exact opposite waterfall allows algae scrubber placed underwater aquarium sump pond instead greatly simplifies construction since device need waterproof allows placement scrubber tight areas room water line design also keeps algae drying event power failure algae water design also removes almost splashing upflowing bubble design falls three categories attach shine aquarium sump glass float top aquarium sump pond water surface go completely underwater like submarine generally except specific continuousfiltering continuouscultivating versions algae scrubbers require algae removed harvested periodically scrubber removal algae effect removing undesired nutrients
