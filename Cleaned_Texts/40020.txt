reference animals eg surgical removal ovaries laboratory animals removal ovaries females biological equivalent castration males term castration occasionally used medical literature refer oophorectomy women veterinary medicine removal ovaries uterus called ovariohysterectomy spaying form sterilization first reported successful human oophorectomy carried sir sydney jones sydney infirmary australia partial oophorectomy ovariotomy term sometimes used describe variety surgeries ovarian cyst removal resection parts kind surgery fertilitypreserving although ovarian failure may relatively frequent longterm risks consequences oophorectomy partially present partial oophorectomy humans oophorectomy often performed diseases ovarian cysts cancer prophylaxis reduce chances developing ovarian cancer breast cancer conjunction hysterectomy removal uterus people believed oophorectomies could cure menstrual cramps back pain headaches chronic coughing although evidence existed procedure impacted

georgia championed procedure variety conditions successfully ovarian bilateral oophorectomies performed without medical indication performed together conversely unilateral oophorectomy commonly performed medical indication cyst endometriosis benign tumor inflammation etc less commonly conjunction hysterectomy special indications include several groups women substantially increased risk ovarian cancer highrisk brca mutation carriers women endometriosis also frequent ovarian cystscitation needed bilateral oophorectomy traditionally done belief benefit preventing ovarian cancer would outweigh risks associated removal ovaries however clear prophylactic oophorectomy without reasonable medical indication decreases longterm survival rates deleterious longterm effects health wellbeing even postmenopausal procedure postulated possible treatment method female sex procedure sometimes performed time hysterectomy transgender men nonbinary people long term effects oophorectomy population well oophorectomy significantly improve survival women highrisk brca mutations prophylactic oophorectomy around age reduces risk ovarian breast cancer provides significant substantial longterm survival average earlier intervention provide additional benefit increases risks adverse effects women highrisk mutations oophorectomy around age relatively modest benefit survival positive effect reduced breast ovarian cancer risk nearly balanced adverse effects survival advantage substantial oophorectomy performed together prophylactic risks benefits associated oophorectomy mutation carrier population different general population prophylactic riskreducing salpingooophorectomy rrso important option highrisk population consider women mutations undergo salpingooophorectomy lower allcause mortality rates women population undergo procedure addition rrso shown decrease mortality specific breast cancer ovarian cancer women undergo rrso also lower risk developing ovarian cancer first occurrence breast cancer specifically rrso provides mutation carriers prior breast cancer reduction ovarian cancer risk mutation carriers prior breast cancer benefit reduction highrisk women prior breast cancer benefit mutation mutation reduction breast cancer risk benefits important highlight unique mutation carrier rare cases oophorectomy used treat endometriosis eliminating menstrual cycle reduce eliminate spread existing endometriosis well reducing pain since endometriosis results overgrowth uterine lining removal ovaries treatment endometriosis often done conjunction hysterectomy reduce eliminate recurrencecitation needed oophorectomy endometriosis used last resort often conjunction hysterectomy severe side effects women reproductive age however higher success rate retaining partial oophorectomy ie ovarian cyst removal involving total oophorectomy often used treat milder cases endometriosis nonsurgical hormonal treatments fail stop cyst formation removal ovarian cysts partial oophorectomy also used treat extreme pelvic pain chronic hormonalrelated pelvic problems oophorectomy intraabdominal surgery serious complications stemming directly surgery rare performed together hysterectomy influence choice surgical technique combined surgery much less likely performed vaginal hysterectomycitation needed laparotomic adnexal surgeries associated high rate adhesive small bowel obstructions infrequent complication injuring ureter level suspensory ligament oophorectomy serious longterm consequences stemming mostly hormonal effects surgery extending well beyond menopause reported risks adverse effects include premature cardiovascular disease cognitive impairment osteoporosis bone fractures decline psychological decline sexual function hormone replacement therapy always reduce adverse oophorectomy associated significantly increased allcause longterm mortality except performed cancer prevention carriers highrisk brca mutations effect particularly pronounced women undergo oophorectomy age effect limited women oophorectomy performed menopause impact survival expected even surgeries performed age surgery age reduces probability survival age survival surgery age effect due excess cardiovascular risk hip removal ovaries causes hormonal changes symptoms similar generally severe menopause women oophorectomy usually encouraged take hormone replacement drugs prevent conditions often associated menopause women younger ovaries removed face mortality risk higher women retained retaining ovaries hysterectomy performed associated better longterm hormone therapy women oophorectomies performed age improves longterm outcome allcause mortality women bilateral oophorectomy surgeries lose ability produce hormones estrogen progesterone lose half ability produce testosterone subsequently enter known surgical menopause opposed normal menopause occurs naturally women part aging process natural menopause ovaries generally continue produce low levels hormones especially androgens long menopause may explain surgical menopause generally accompanied sudden severe onset symptoms natural menopause symptoms may continue natural age symptoms commonly addressed hormone therapy utilizing various forms estrogen testosterone progesterone combinationcitation needed ovaries removed woman seven times greater risk cardiovascular mechanisms precisely known hormone production ovaries currently sufficiently mimicked drug therapy ovaries produce hormones woman needs throughout entire life quantity needed time needed response part complex endocrine system oophorectomy associated increased risk osteoporosis bone potential risk oophorectomy performed menopause fully reduced levels testosterone women predictive height loss may occur result reduced bone women age undergone oophorectomy hormone replacement therapy hrt often used offset negative effects sudden hormonal loss earlyonset osteoporosis well menopausal problems like hot flashes usually severe experienced women undergoing natural menopause oophorectomy substantially impairs substantially women oophorectomy hysterectomy reported libido loss difficulty sexual arousal vaginal dryness less invasive procedure either hysterectomy alone alternative procedure hormone replacement therapy found improve addition oophorectomy greatly reduces testosterone levels associated greater sense sexual desire however least one study shown psychological factors relationship satisfaction still best predictor sexual activity following sexual intercourse remains possible oophorectomy coitus continue reconstructive surgery remains option women experienced benign malignant side effects oophorectomy may alleviated medicines hormonal replacement nonhormonal biphosphonates fosamax actonel increase bone strength available onceaweek pills lowdose selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors paxil prozac alleviate vasomotor menopausal symptoms ie hot general hormone replacement therapy somewhat controversial due known carcinogenic thrombogenic properties estrogen however many physicians patients feel benefits outweigh risks women may face serious health qualityoflife issues
