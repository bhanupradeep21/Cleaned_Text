adrenal glands also known suprarenal glands endocrine glands produce variety hormones including adrenaline steroids aldosterone found kidneys gland outer cortex produces steroid hormones inner medulla adrenal cortex divided three main zones zona glomerulosa zona fasciculata zona adrenal cortex produces three main types steroid hormones mineralocorticoids glucocorticoids androgens mineralocorticoids
