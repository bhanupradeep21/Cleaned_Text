gate control theory pain asserts nonpainful input closes nerve gates painful input prevents pain sensation traveling central nervous system gate control theory pain describes nonpainful sensations override reduce painful sensations painful nociceptive stimulus stimulates primary afferent fibers travels brain via transmission cells increasing activity transmission cells results increased perceived pain conversely decreasing activity transmission cells reduces perceived pain gate control theory closed gate describes input transmission cells blocked therefore reducing sensation pain open gate describes input transmission cells permitted therefore allowing sensation pain first proposed ronald melzack patrick wall theory offers physiological explanation previously observed effect
