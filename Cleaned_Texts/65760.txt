defecation defaecation follows digestion necessary process organisms eliminate solid semisolid liquid waste material known feces digestive tract via anus act variety names ranging common like pooping crapping technical eg bowel movement obscene shitting euphemistic going number two dropping deuce taking dump juvenile making doodoo topic usually avoided polite company become basis potty humor humans expel feces frequency varying times daily times waves muscular contraction known peristalsis walls colon move fecal matter digestive tract towards rectum undigested food may also expelled way process called egestion birds defecate also expel urine urates mass whereas animals may also urinate time spatially separated defecation may also accompany childbirth death babies defecate unique substance called meconium prior eating external foods number medical conditions associated defecation diarrhea constipation serious feces expelled carry diseases often contamination food e coli particular concern potty training human feces often collected diaper thereafter many societies people commonly defecate toilet however open defecation practice defecating outside without using toilet kind still widespread developing people defecate ocean first world countries use sewage treatment plants andor onsite treatment rectum ampulla stores fecal waste also called stool excreted waste fills rectum expands rectal walls stretch receptors rectal walls stimulate desire defecate urge defecate arises reflex contraction rectal muscles relaxation internal anal sphincter initial contraction skeletal muscle external anal sphincter urge acted upon material rectum often returned colon reverse peristalsis water absorbed feces stored next mass peristaltic movement transverse descending colon rectum full increase pressure within rectum forces apart walls anal canal allowing fecal matter enter canal rectum shortens material forced anal canal peristaltic waves push feces rectum internal
