species cimoliasaurus tricleidus okeefe wahl found sister taxon kimmerosaurus two genera well aristonectes considered part cimoliasauridae kaiwhekea either member family closest known okeefe street considered utilizing name cimoliasauridae group poor choice since found cimoliasaurus actually belong different group elasmosauridae group containing tatenectes kimmerosaurus aristonectes kaiwhekea subsequently named however okeefe colleagues noted problematic nature aristonectes kaiwhekea due unusual morphology two genera difficult classify making relation tatenectes studies recovered tatenectes member cryptoclididae still found close relative kimmerosaurus addition aristonectes kaiwhekea however thought derived elasmosaurids known following cladogram follows roberts colleagues

eurymerus kimmerosaurus langhami tatenectes laramiensis djupedalia engeri spitrasaurus spp ophthalmothule cryostea pachyostosis seen tatenectes unusual among plesiosaurs handful genera pachycostasaurus exhibit many skeletal elements pachycostasaurus pachyostoic tatenectes even unusual gastralia pachyostotic bones dorsal ribs unmodified pachyostosis describes thickening bones periosteal cortex thereby making bone larger often occurs osteosclerosis increased bone density conversely animals bone density decreased osteoporosis despite gastralia pachyostotic tatenectes exhibit osteosclerosis layer osteoporotic bone layers pachyostotic bone unprecedented pachyostotic bone concentrated around midline ventral thorax together unusually flat body shape led okeefe colleagues hypothesize tatenectes would resistant turbulence particularly roll plesiosaurs increasing stability swimming close surface shallow addition pachyostosis lung deflation could also used tatenectes plesiosaurs gain negative buoyancy helping plesiosaurs swallowed stones known gastroliths proposed could used ballast buoyancy control effectiveness controversial stones may digestive function ingestion may accidental also possible although controversial gastroliths used purposes alleviation discomfort mineral supplements additionally gastroliths may variety functions instead limited
