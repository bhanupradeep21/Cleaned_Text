cerebral hypoxia form hypoxia reduced supply oxygen specifically involving brain brain completely deprived oxygen called cerebral anoxia four categories cerebral hypoxia order increasing severity diffuse cerebral hypoxia dch focal cerebral ischemia cerebral infarction global cerebral ischemia prolonged hypoxia induces neuronal cell death via apoptosis resulting hypoxic brain cases total oxygen deprivation termed anoxia hypoxic origin reduced oxygen availability ischemic origin oxygen deprivation due disruption blood flow brain injury result oxygen deprivation either due hypoxic anoxic mechanisms generally termed hypoxicanoxic injuries hai hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy hie condition occurs entire brain deprived adequate oxygen supply deprivation total hie associated cases oxygen deprivation neonate due birth asphyxia occur age groups often complication cardiac brain requires approximately ml oxygen per g brain tissue per minute initially body responds lowered blood oxygen redirecting blood brain increasing cerebral blood flow blood flow may increase twice normal flow increased blood flow sufficient supply brains oxygen needs symptoms however blood flow increased doubled blood flow correct problem symptoms cerebral hypoxia begin appear mild symptoms include difficulties complex learning tasks reductions shortterm memory oxygen deprivation continues cognitive disturbances decreased motor control skin may also appear bluish cyanosis heart rate increases continued oxygen deprivation results fainting longterm loss consciousness coma seizures cessation brain stem reflexes brain objective measurements severity cerebral hypoxia depend cause blood oxygen saturation may used hypoxic hypoxia generally meaningless forms hypoxia hypoxic hypoxia saturation considered normal considered mild moderate anything considered cerebral hypoxia refers oxygen levels brain tissue blood blood oxygenation usually appear normal cases hypemic ischemic hystoxic cerebral hypoxia even hypoxic hypoxia blood measures approximate guide oxygen level brain tissue depend body deals reduced oxygen content bloodcitation needed cerebral hypoxia caused event severely interferes brains ability receive process oxygen event may internal external body mild moderate forms cerebral hypoxia may caused various diseases interfere breathing blood oxygenation severe asthma various sorts anemia cause degree diffuse cerebral hypoxia causes include status epilepticus work nitrogenrich environments ascent deepwater dive flying high altitudes unpressurized cabin without supplemental oxygen intense exercise high altitudes prior acclimatization severe cerebral hypoxia anoxia usually caused traumatic events choking drowning strangulation smoke inhalation drug overdoses crushing trachea status asthmaticus also recreationally selfinduced fainting game erotic asphyxiation hypoxicanoxic events may affect fetus various stages fetal development labor delivery postnatal period sometimes even infant still womb may exhibit signs hie hypoxic ischemic injury fetal distress one common signs hie oxygendepriving problems pregnancy may include preeclampsia maternal diabetes vascular disease congenital fetal infections substancealcohol use severe fetal anemia cardiac disease lung malformations problems blood flow placenta problems labor delivery include umbilical cord occlusion torsion prolapse rupture placenta uterus excessive bleeding placenta abnormal fetal position breech position prolonged late stages labor low blood pressure mother problems delivery include severe prematurity severe lung heart disease serious infections trauma brain skull congenital malformations brain low blood pressure due suffocation cases m√ºnchausen syndrome severity neonatal hypoxicischaemic brain injury may assessed using sarnat staging based clinical presentation eeg findings also using signs symptoms hie may include details mechanism damage cerebral hypoxia along anoxic depolarization found mechanism anoxic depolarization brain cerebral hypoxia typically grouped four categories depending severity location brains oxygen cerebral hypoxia also classified cause reduced brain newborn infants starved oxygen birth evidence hypothermia therapy neonatal encephalopathy applied within hours cerebral hypoxia effectively improves survival neurological adults however evidence less convincing first goal treatment restore oxygen brain method restoration depends cause hypoxia mildtomoderate cases hypoxia removal cause hypoxia may sufficient inhaled oxygen may also provided severe cases treatment may also involve life support damage control measures deep coma interfere bodys breathing reflexes even initial cause hypoxia dealt mechanical ventilation may required additionally severe cerebral hypoxia causes elevated heart rate extreme cases heart may tire stop pumping cpr defibrilation epinephrine atropine may tried effort get heart resume severe cerebral hypoxia also cause seizures put patient risk selfinjury various anticonvulsant drugs may need administered treatment long debate whether newborn infants cerebral hypoxia resuscitated oxygen normal demonstrated high concentrations oxygen lead generation oxygen free radicals role reperfusion injury research ola didrik saugstad others led new international guidelines newborn resuscitation recommending use normal air instead brain damage occur oxygen deprivation oxygen deprivation cells die due increasing acidity brain tissue acidosis additionally period oxygen deprivation materials easily create free radicals build oxygen enters tissue materials interact oxygen create high levels oxidants oxidants interfere normal brain chemistry cause damage known reperfusion injury techniques preventing damage brain cells area ongoing research hypothermia therapy neonatal encephalopathy evidencesupported therapy antioxidant drugs control blood glucose levels hemodilution thinning blood coupled druginduced hypertension treatment techniques currently hyperbaric oxygen therapy evaluated reduction total myocardial creatine phosphokinase levels showing possible reduction overall systemic inflammatory severe cases extremely important act quickly brain cells sensitive reduced oxygen levels deprived oxygen begin die within five mild moderate cerebral hypoxia may result seizures impaired memory going forward outcome severe cerebral hypoxia depend success damage control amount brain tissue deprived oxygen speed oxygen restored cerebral hypoxia localized specific part brain brain damage localized region general consequence may epilepsy longterm effects depend purpose portion brain damage brocas area wernickes area brain left side typically causes problems speech language damage right side brain may interfere ability express emotions interpret one sees damage either side cause paralysis opposite side body effects certain kinds severe generalized hypoxias may take time develop example longterm effects serious carbon monoxide poisoning usually may take several weeks appear recent research suggests may due autoimmune response caused carbon monoxideinduced changes myelin sheath surrounding hypoxia results coma length unconsciousness often indicative longterm damage cases coma give brain opportunity heal general longer coma greater likelihood person remain vegetative state even patient wakes brain damage likely significant enough prevent return normal functioning longterm comas significant impact patients families coma patients often idealized images outcome based
