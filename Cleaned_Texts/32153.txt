mirror called mark test mirror selfrecognition msr test red spot technique rouge behavioral technique developed american psychologist gordon gallup jr attempt determine whether animal possesses ability visual msr test traditional method attempting measure physiological cognitive selfawareness however agreement reached animals selfaware ways measured mirror test distinguishing others songs classic msr test animal anesthetized marked eg paint sticker area body animal normally see eg forehead animal recovers anesthetic given access mirror animal touches investigates mark taken indication animal perceives reflected image image rather another animal species passed msr test species include great apes single asiatic elephant giant oceanic manta rays dolphins orcas eurasian magpie cleaner wrasse wide range species reported fail test including several species monkeys giant pandas sea inspiration mirror test comes anecdote charles darwin captive orangutan visiting london zoo darwin observed orangutan named jenny throwing tantrum teased apple keeper started thinking subjective experience also watched jenny gaze mirror noted possibility recognized gordon gallup jr experimentally investigated possibility selfrecognition two male two female wild preadolescent chimpanzees pan troglodytes none presumably seen mirror previously chimpanzee put room two days next fulllength mirror placed room total hours periodically decreasing distances multitude behaviors recorded upon introducing mirrors chimpanzees initially chimpanzees made threatening gestures images ostensibly seeing reflections threatening eventually chimps used reflections selfdirected responding behaviors grooming parts body previously observed without mirror picking noses making faces blowing bubbles reflections gallup expanded study manipulating chimpanzees appearance observing reaction reflection mirror gallup anesthetized chimps painted red alcoholsoluble dye eyebrow ridge top half opposite ear dye dried virtually olfactory tactile cues gallup removed mirror returning chimpanzees cage regaining full consciousness recorded frequency chimps spontaneously touched marked areas skin minutes mirror reintroduced cage frequency touching marked areas determined frequency increased four ten mirror present compared one mirror removed chimpanzees sometimes visually olfactorily inspected fingers touching marks markdirected behavior included turning adjusting body better view mark mirror tactile examination mark appendage viewing important aspect classical marktest rouge test markdye nontactile preventing attention drawn marking additional perceptual cues somesthesis reason animals majority classical tests anesthetized tests use tactile creature stares unusually long part body mark tries rub said pass test animals considered able recognize mirror typically progress four stages behavior facing gallup conducted followup study two chimps prior experience mirror put anesthesia marked observed recovery made markdirected behaviors either provided mirrorcitation needed rouge test also done michael lewis jeanne brooksgunn purpose selfrecognition human mothers default implication drawn gallups test animals pass test possess form selfrecognition however number authors suggested alternative explanations pass example suggests animal may see reflection odd entity able control movements reflected entity mark animal remove mark alert reflected entity using movements critically explanation assume animals necessarily see reflected entity self msr test criticized several reasons particular may result false negative msr test may limited value applied species primarily use senses example dogs mainly use smell hearing vision used third may dogs fail msr test mind biologist marc bekoff developed scentbased paradigm using dog urine test selfrecognition tested dog results dog cognition researcher alexandra horowitz formalized bekoffs idea controlled experiment first reported published compared dogs behavior examining others odors also examining odor added smell mark analogous visual mark msr tests subjects discriminated odor dogs bekoff found also spent time investigating odor image modified subjects pass msr test suggested ethological approach sniff test selfrecognition stsr shed light different ways checking selfrecognition another concern msr test species quickly respond aggressively mirror reflection threatening conspecific thereby preventing animal calmly consider reflection actually represents may gorillas monkeys fail msr msr test animals may recognise mark abnormal may sufficiently motivated react however mean unable recognize example msr test conducted three elephants one elephant passed test two elephants failed still demonstrated behaviors interpreted selfrecognition researchers commented elephants might touched mark important enough similarly lesser apes infrequently engage selfgrooming may explain failure touch mark heads mirror frans de waal biologist primatologist emory university stated selfawareness binary mirror test relied upon sole indicator selfawareness though good test different animals adapt mirror different several studies using wide range species investigated occurrence spontaneous markdirected behavior given mirror originally proposed gallup marked animals given mirror initially respond social behavior aggressive displays continue repeated testing species touched directed behavior toward mark thereby passing classic msr test findings msr studies always conclusive even chimpanzees species studied convincing findings clearcut evidence selfrecognition obtained individuals prevalence young adults considerably less young aging study magpies selfrecognition thought reside neocortex area brain however brain region absent nonmammals selfrecognition may case convergent evolution similar evolutionary pressures result similar behaviors traits although species arrive different routes underlying mechanism may animals reportedly failed classic msr test include gibbon g hylobates symphalangus nomascus failed show selfrecognition least two however modified mirror tests three species gibbons hylobates syndactylus h gabriellae h leucogenys showed convincing evidence selfrecognition even though animals failed standard version mirror another study published documents cases spontaneous selfrecognition front mirror pair siamangs symphalangus pigs use visual information seen mirror find food show evidence selfrecognition presented reflections experiment seven eight pigs tested able find bowl food hidden behind wall revealed using mirror eighth pig looked behind mirror bbc earth also showed food bowl test matching shapes holes test extraordinary animals two captive giant manta rays showed frequent unusual repetitive movements front mirror suggesting contingency checking also showed unusual selfdirected behaviors exposed manta rays largest brains fish csilla ari tested captive manta rays atlantis aquarium bahamas exposing mirror manta rays appeared extremely interested mirror behaved strangely front mirror including flips moving fins also blew bubbles interact reflection another manta ray try socialize however actual mirror test determine actually recognize reflections demonstrating exploratory behavior classic mirror test yet done manta another fish may pass mirror test common archerfish toxotes chatareus study showed archerfish discriminate human faces researchers showed testing archerfish spit stream water image face recognized archerfish would trained expect food spat certain image archerfish shown images human faces fish spit spit image archerfish normally wild use spitting streams knock prey water study showed archerfish could trained recognize threedimensional image one face compared image different face would spit face recognized archerfish even able continue recognizing image face even rotated rouge test version mirror test used human using rouge makeup experimenter surreptitiously places dot face child children placed front mirror reactions monitored depending childs development distinct categories responses demonstrated test widely cited primary measure mirror selfrecognition human ages months child typically sees sociable playmate mirrors reflection selfadmiring embarrassment usually begin months months children demonstrate avoidance finally months half children recognize reflection mirror months selfrecognition climbs children evincing markdirected behavior touch noses try wipe marks selfrecognition mirrors apparently independent familiarity reflecting cases rouge test shown differing results depending sociocultural orientation example cameroonian nso sample infants months age extremely low amount selfrecognition outcomes study also found two strong predictors selfrecognition object stimulation maternal effort attracting attention infant object either person touched mutual eye strong correlation selfconcept object permanence also demonstrated using rouge rouge test measure selfconcept child touches rouge nose upon looking mirror demonstrates basic ability understand young people gained sight blind sometimes react reflection mirror though another individualcitation needed theorists remarked significance period childs life example psychoanalyst jacques lacan used similar test marking mirror stage growing current views self psychology position self playing integral part human motivation cognition affect social debate interpretation results mirror researchers one study identified potential problems test means gauging selfawareness young children proposing selfrecognizing child animal may demonstrate markdirected behavior motivated clean faces thus providing incorrect results study compared results standard rouge test methodology modified version classic test experimenter first played children making sure looked mirror least three times rouge test performed using dot rouge childs right eye modified testing experimenter introduced doll rouge spot eye asked child help clean doll experimenter would ask three times cleaning doll doll put away mirror test performed using rouge dot childs face modifications shown increase number results uncovered study least suggest issues classic mirror test primarily assumes children recognize dot rouge abnormal attempt examine remove classic test may produced false negatives childs recognition dot lead cleaning modified test doll cleaned first found stronger relationship cleaning dolls face child cleaning face demonstration doll postulated demonstrate children may lead reliable confirmation general level remains debatable whether recognition ones mirror image implies likewise converse may also may hold selfawareness present positive result mirror test early steps taken make robot pass mirror httpsenwikipediaorgwikimirrortest
