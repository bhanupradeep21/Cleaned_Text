status epilepticus se status seizure medical condition consisting single seizure lasting minutes seizures within period without person returning normal previous definitions used time seizures type regular pattern contraction extension arms legs types involve contractions absence seizures complex partial status epilepticus lifethreatening medical emergency particularly treatment status epilepticus may occur history epilepsy well underlying problem underlying brain problems may include trauma infections strokes among diagnosis often involves checking blood sugar imaging head number blood tests psychogenic nonepileptic seizures may present similarly status conditions may also appear status epilepticus include low blood sugar movement disorders meningitis delirium among status epilepticus also appear tuberculous meningitis becomes severe benzodiazepines preferred initial treatment typically phenytoin possible benzodiazepines include intravenous lorazepam well intramuscular injections number medications may used effective phenobarbital propofol initial treatment benzodiazepines typical antiseizure drugs given including valproic acid valproate fosphenytoin levetiracetam similar empirically based treatments exist headtohead clinical trials exist best approach remains said consensusbased best practices offered neurocritical care intubation may required help maintain persons people status epilepticus die within underlying cause persons age length seizure important factors status epilepticus occurs per people per status epilepticus make people visit emergency status epilepticus divided two categories convulsive nonconvulsive convulsive status epilepticus presents urgent neurological condition characterized elongated uncontrollable onsets seizures regular pattern contraction extension arms legs observed symptoms managed initially introducing seizure suppressing medication first stage treatment optimally works stage delay reduce efficacy medications convulsive status epilepticus frequently affects elderly young children responsible mortality elderly patients young children patients survive initial onset often left cognitive neurological epilepsia partialis continua variant involving hour day even weeklong jerking consequence vascular disease tumors encephalitis drugresistant generalized myoclonus commonly seen comatose people following cpr seen indication catastrophic damage neocortex myoclonus status situation usually always considered agonal refractory status epilepticus defined status epilepticus continues despite treatment benzodiazepines one antiepileptic superrefractory status epilepticus defined status epilepticus continues recurs hours onset anaesthetic therapy including cases status epilepticus recurs reduction withdrawal nonconvulsive status epilepticus relatively long duration change persons level consciousness without largescale bending extension limbs due seizure two main types either prolonged complex partial seizures absence quarter cases se case complex partial status epilepticus seizure confined small area brain normally temporal lobe absence status epilepticus marked generalized seizure affecting whole brain eeg needed differentiate two conditions cases nonconvulsive status epilepticus characterized longlasting stupor staring unresponsiveness recent studies indicated cases involve patients semiconscious way respond confused spontaneously shown decelerated thought process cases nonconvulsive status epilepticus marked prolonged fragmentary people experience seizures status epilepticus following list possible causes diagnostic criteria vary though practitioners diagnose status epilepticus one continuous unremitting seizure lasting longer five recurrent seizures without regaining consciousness seizures greater five previous definitions used time nonconvulsive status epilepticus believed newonset refractory status epilepticus norse defined status epilepticus respond anticonvulsant lacks obvious cause two days benzodiazepines preferred initial treatment typically phenytoin fosphenytoin first aid guidelines seizures state rule ambulance called seizures lasting longer five minutes sooner persons first seizure episode precipitating factors known said se happens person epilepsy whose seizures previously absent wellcontrolled considerable given intravenously lorazepam appears superior diazepam stopping seizure intramuscular midazolam appears reasonable alternative especially benzodiazepine choice north america initial treatment lorazepam due relatively long duration action hours injected particularly due rapid onset action thought due high affinity gaba receptors low lipid solubility causes drug remain vascular compartment lorazepam available intravenous access possible diazepam alternatively medication glucagon given bone several countries outside north america intravenous clonazepam regarded drug first cited advantages clonazepam include longer duration action diazepam lower propensity development acute tolerance use clonazepam indication recognized north america perhaps available intravenous formulation particularly children another popular treatment choice midazolam given side mouth sometimes failure lorazepam alone considered enough classify case se resistant treatment phenytoin another firstline although prodrug fosphenytoin administered three times fast far fewer injection site reactions hydantoin derivatives used cardiac monitoring necessary administered intravenously hydantoins take minutes work benzodiazepine barbiturate often coadministered diazepams short duration action often administered together present remain recommended secondline followup treatments acute setting per guidelines groups like neurocritical care society united benzodiazepines invented barbiturates used purposes similar benzodiazepines general still used today se instance benzodiazepines hydantoins option used induce barbituric coma barbiturate commonly used phenobarbital thiopental pentobarbital may also used purpose seizures stopped immediately person already compromised underlying illness toxicmetabolicinduced however situations thiopental agent said even benzodiazepines available certain united use phenobarbital second thirdline treatment se use adjunctive least one us study showed phenobarbital used alone controlled seizures hence preference addon valproate available given intravenously may used status epilepticus carbamazepine available intravenous formulation play role status found valproate phenobarbital fosphenytoin phenytoin midazolam levetiracetam considered second line drugs benzodiazepine used first line treatment found specially valproate contrast antiepileptic drugs effective treatment nonconvulsive status epilepticus commonly used proves ineffective barbiturates used reason general anesthetic may tried sometimes used second failure would entail putting person artificial ventilation propofol shown effective suppressing jerks seen myoclonus status ketamine nmda antagonist drug used last resort drugresistant status lidocaine used cases improve typical one concern seizures often begin minutes additionally recommended heart liver sources vary firsttime se patients sources indicating patients die within firsttime se patients experience lifelong mortality figure great majority people underlying brain condition causing status seizure brain tumor brain infection brain trauma stroke people diagnosed epilepsy status seizure also increased risk death condition stabilized quickly medication sleep regimen adapted adhered stress stimulant seizure trigger levels controlled however optimal neurological care adherence medication regimen good prognosis underlying uncontrolled brain organic disease people diagnosed otherwise good health survive minimal brain damage decrease risk death even avoid future prognosis refractory status epilepticus different prognosis method developed refractory status epilepticus rse prognosis studies shown clear structure symptoms since range gastrointestinal flulike symptoms considered mild represent remaining majority clinical cases unknownclarification needed found takes period days patient reach prodromal stage episode yet come first time found frequency initial seizures starts short inconsistent seizures lasts hours may
