somatic marker hypothesis formulated antonio damasio associated researchers proposes emotional processes guide bias behavior particularly somatic markers feelings body associated emotions association rapid heartbeat anxiety nausea disgust according hypothesis somatic markers strongly influence subsequent decisionmaking within brain somatic markers thought processed ventromedial prefrontal cortex vmpfc amygdala hypothesis tested experiments using iowa gambling task economic theory human decisionmaking often modeled devoid emotions involving logical reasoning based costbenefit contrast somatic marker hypothesis proposes emotions play critical role ability make fast rational decisions complex uncertain patients frontal lobe damage phineas gage provided first evidence frontal lobes associated decisionmaking frontal lobe damage particularly vmpfc results impaired abilities organize plan behavior learn previous mistakes without affecting intellect terms working memory attention language comprehension vmpfc patients also difficulty expressing experiencing appropriate emotions led antonio damasio hypothesize decisionmaking deficits following vmpfc damage result inability use emotions help guide future behavior based past experiences consequently vmpfc damage forces affected rely slow laborious costbenefit analyses every given choice antonio damasio portuguese antónio damásio portugueseamerican neuroscientist currently david dornsife professor neuroscience psychology philosophy university southern california adjunct professor salk damasio heads brain creativity institute authored several books recent work feeling knowing making minds conscious explores relationship brain feelings damasios research neuroscience shown emotions play central role social cognition individuals make decisions must assess incentive value choices available using cognitive emotional processes individuals face complex conflicting choices may unable decide using cognitive processes may become overloaded emotions consequently hypothesized guide decisionmaking emotions defined damasio changes body brain states response physiological changes muscle tone heart rate endocrine activity posture facial expression forth occur body relayed brain transformed emotion tells individual something stimulus encountered time emotions corresponding bodily changes called somatic markers become associated particular situations past outcomes making subsequent decisions somatic markers evoked emotions consciously unconsciously associated past outcomes influence decisionmaking favor behaviors instead instance somatic marker associated positive outcome perceived person may feel happy thereby motivated pursue behavior somatic marker associated negative outcome perceived person may feel sad acts internal alarm warn individual avoid course action situationspecific somatic states based reinforced past experiences help guide behavior favor advantageous choices therefore adaptive according hypothesis two distinct pathways reactivate somatic marker responses first pathway emotion evoked changes body projected brain called body loop instance encountering feared object like snake may initiate fightorflight response cause fear second pathway cognitive representations emotions imagining unpleasant situation particular situation activated brain without directly elicited sensory stimulus called asif body loop thus brain anticipate expected bodily changes allows individual respond faster external stimuli without waiting event actually amygdala vmpfc subsection orbital medial prefrontal cortex ompfc essential components hypothesized mechanism therefore damage either structure disrupt effort produce simple neuropsychological tool would assess deficits emotional processing

damage vmpfc likely engage behaviors negatively impact personal relationships distant future never engage actions would lead immediate harm evolution prefrontal cortex associated ability represent events may occur somatic marker hypothesis applied trying understand risky behaviors risky sexual behavior drug addiction according hypothesis riskier sexual behaviors exhilarating pleasurable therefore likely stimulate repetitive engagement idea tested individuals infected hiv substance dependent differences found persons scored well iowa gambling test scored poorly high scorers showed correlation amount distress reported hiv status acceptance risk sexual behavior greater distress greater risk people would take low scorers hand showed correlation results interpreted indicating persons intact decisionmaking abilities better able rely past emotional experiences weighing risks persons deficient abilities acceptance risk serves ameliorate emotional drug abusers thought ignore negative consequences addiction seeking drugs according somatic marker hypothesis abusers impaired ability recall consider past unpleasant experiences weighing whether consider drug seeking researchers analyzed neuroendocrine responses substancedependent individuals healthy individuals shown pleasant unpleasant images response unpleasant images drug users showed decreased levels several neuroendocrine markers including norepinephrine cortisol adrenocorticotropic hormone addicts showed lesser responses pleasant unpleasant images suggesting may diminished emotional neuroimaging studies utilizing fmri indicate drugrelated stimuli ability activate brain regions involved emotional evaluation reward processing shown film people smoking cocaine cocaine users showed greater activation anterior cingulate cortex right inferior parietal lobe caudate nucleus nonusers conversely cocaine users showed lesser activation viewing sex film researchers believe use somatic markers ie afferent feedback would inefficient method influencing behavior damasios notion asif experience dependent feedback whereby bodily responses rerepresented utilizing somatosensory cortex postcentral gyrus also proposes inefficient method affecting explicit rolls stated would inefficient noisy place execution route peripheral response transducers attempt measure peripheral response notoriously difficult procedure p reinforcement association located orbitofrontal cortex amygdala incentive value stimuli decoded sufficient elicit emotionbased learning affect behavior via example orbitofrontalstriatal process occur via implicit explicit somatic marker hypothesis represents model feedback body may contribute advantageous disadvantageous decisionmaking situations complexity uncertainty much supporting data comes data taken iowa gambling iowa gambling task proven ecologically valid measure decisionmaking impairment exist three assumptions need hold true first claim assesses implicit learning rewardpunishment design inconsistent data showing accurate knowledge task mechanisms workingmemory appear strong influence second claim knowledge occurs preventive marker signals supported competing explanations psychophysiology generated lastly claim impairment due myopia future undermined plausible psychological mechanisms explaining deficits tasks reversal learning risktaking workingmemory deficits may also variability control performance previously thought thus complicating interpretation findings furthermore although somatic marker hypothesis accurately identified many brain regions involved decisionmaking emotion bodystate representation failed clearly demonstrate processes interact psychological evolutionary level many experiments could implemented test somatic marker hypothesis one way would develop variants iowa gambling task control methodological issues interpretation ambiguities generated may good idea include removing reversal learning confound would make task difficult consciously comprehend additionally causal tests somatic marker hypothesis could practiced insistently greater range populations altered peripheral feedback like patients facial paralysis conclusion somatic marker hypothesis needs tested experiments wider range empirical approaches employed order test somatic marker hypothesis appears framework simply intriguing idea need better supporting evidence despite issues somatic marker hypothesis iowa gambling task reestablish notion emotion potential benefit well problem decisionmaking process
