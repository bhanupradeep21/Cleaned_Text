environmental physiology comparative physiology considers diversity functional characteristics across study human physiology medical field originates classical greece time hippocrates late century outside western tradition early forms physiology anatomy reconstructed present around time elsewhere hippocrates incorporated theory humorism consisted four basic substances earth water air fire substance known corresponding humor black bile phlegm blood yellow bile respectively hippocrates also noted emotional connections four humors galen would later expand critical thinking aristotle emphasis relationship structure function marked beginning physiology ancient greece like hippocrates aristotle took humoral theory disease also consisted four primary qualities life hot cold wet galen c ad first use experiments probe functions body unlike hippocrates galen argued humoral imbalances located specific organs including entire modification theory better equipped doctors make precise diagnoses galen also played hippocrates idea emotions also tied humors added notion temperaments sanguine corresponds blood phlegmatic tied phlegm yellow bile connected choleric black bile corresponds melancholy galen also saw human body consisting three connected systems brain nerves responsible thoughts sensations heart arteries give life liver veins attributed nutrition galen also founder experimental next years galenic physiology powerful influential tool jean fernel french physician introduced term galen ibn alnafis michael servetus realdo colombo amato lusitano william harvey credited making important discoveries circulation santorio santorio first use device measure pulse rate pulsilogium thermoscope measure luigi galvani described role electricity nerves dissected frogs césar julien jean legallois studied respiration animal dissection lesions found center respiration medulla oblongata year charles bell finished work would later become known law compared functional differences dorsal ventral roots spinal cord françois magendie described sensory roots produced first evidence cerebellums role equilibration complete law french physiologist henri milneedwards introduced notion physiological division labor allowed compare study living things machines created industry man inspired work adam smith milneedwards wrote body living beings whether animal plant resembles factory organs comparable workers work incessantly produce phenomena constitute life individual differentiated organisms functional labor could apportioned different instruments systems called joseph lister studied cause blood coagulation inflammation resulted previous injuries surgical wounds later discovered implemented antiseptics operating room result decreased death rate surgery substantial physiological society founded london dining american physiological society aps nonprofit organization founded society devoted fostering education scientific research dissemination information physiological ivan pavlov performed research conditional responses involved dogs saliva production response bell visual century physiological knowledge began accumulate rapid rate particular appearance cell theory matthias schleiden theodor radically stated organisms made units called cells claude bernards discoveries ultimately led concept milieu interieur internal would later taken championed homeostasis american physiologist walter b cannon homeostasis cannon meant maintenance steady states body physiological processes words bodys ability regulate internal environment william beaumont first american utilize practical application physiology nineteenthcentury physiologists michael foster max verworn alfred binet based haeckels ideas elaborated came called general physiology unified science life based cell later renamed century cell century biologists became interested organisms human beings function eventually spawning fields comparative physiology major

golden age large part field given birth active domains todays biological sciences neuroscience endocrinology furthermore physiology still often seen integrative discipline put together coherent
