mendels work introducing term mutation developing mutation theory evolution de vries born eldest son gerrit de vries lawyer deacon mennonite congregation haarlem later prime minister netherlands maria everardina reuvens daughter professor archaeology leiden university father became member dutch council state moved family hague early age hugo showed much interest botany winning several prizes herbariums attending gymnasium haarlem hague enrolled leiden university major botany enthusiastically took part wfr suringars classes excursions mostly drawn experimental botany outlined julius von sachs lehrbuch der botanik also deeply impressed charles darwins evolution theory despite suringars skepticism wrote dissertation effect heat plant roots including several statements darwin provoke professor graduated short period teaching de vries left september take classes chemistry physics heidelberg university work laboratory wilhelm hofmeister second semester school year joined lab esteemed julius sachs würzburg study plant growth september taught botany zoology geology schools amsterdam vacation returned lab heidelberg continue research prussian ministry agriculture offered de vries position professor still constructed landwirtschaftliche hochschule royal agricultural college berlin anticipation moved back würzburg studied agricultural crops collaborated sachs berlins college still plan briefly took position teaching university hallewittenberg year offered position lecturer plant physiology newly founded university amsterdam made adjunct professor full professor birthday partly keep moving berlin college finally opened year de vries also professor director amsterdams botanical institute garden de vries published book intracellular based modified version charles darwins theory pangenesis postulated different characters different hereditary carriers specifically postulated inheritance specific traits organisms comes particles called units pangenes term years later shortened genes wilhelm johannsen support theory pangenes widely noticed time de vries conducted series experiments hybridising varieties multiple plant species unaware mendels work de vries used laws dominance recessiveness segregation independent assortment explain ratio phenotypes second observations also confirmed hypothesis inheritance specific traits organisms comes particles speculated genes could cross species barrier gene responsible hairiness two different species flower although generally true sense orthologous genes inherited common ancestor species tend stay responsible similar phenotypes de vries meant physical cross species actually also happens though rarely higher organisms see horizontal gene transfer de vries work genetics inspired research jantina tammes worked period late de vries became aware mendels obscure paper thirty years earlier altered terminology match published results experiments french journal comptes rendus de lacadémie des sciences neglected mention mendels work criticism carl correns conceded mendels priority correns erich von tschermak share credit rediscovery mendels laws correns student nägeli renowned botanist mendel corresponded work peas failed understand significance coincidentally tschermaks grandfather taught mendel botany student days vienna time de vries best known mutation theory discovered new forms among group oenothera lamarckiana species evening primrose growing wild abandoned potato field near hilversum escaped nearby taking seeds found produced many new varieties experimental gardens introduced term mutations suddenly appearing variations twovolume publication mutation theory postulated evolution especially origin species might occur frequently largescale changes via darwinian gradualism basically suggesting form saltationism de vriess theory one chief contenders explanation evolution worked leading example thomas hunt morgan study mutations fruit fly modern evolutionary synthesis became dominant model early decades twentieth century de vries theory enormously influential continued fascinate nonbiologists long scientific community abandoned much retaining idea mutations crucial source natural variation largescale primrose variations turned result various chromosomal abnormalities including ring chromosomes balanced lethals chromosome duplications polyploidy term mutation generally restricted discrete changes dna sequence however popular understanding mutation sudden leap new species remained staple theme science fiction eg xmen movies comic books preceded published lecture befruchtung und bastardierung veit leipzig de vries also first suggest occurrence recombinations homologous chromosomes known chromosomal crossovers within year chromosomes implicated mendelian inheritance walter botanist daniel trembly macdougal attended lectures united states mutation theory helped published lectures book species varieties origin de vries became member
