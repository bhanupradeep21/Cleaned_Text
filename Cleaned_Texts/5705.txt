autotopagnosia greek gnosis meaning without knowledge topos meaning place auto meaning oneself autotopagnosia virtually translates lack knowledge ones space clinically described autotopagnosia form agnosia characterized inability localize orient different parts psychoneurological disorder also referred bodyimage agnosia somatotopagnosia somatotopagnosia argued better suited term describe condition autotopagnosia emphasizes deficiencies localizing ones body parts orientation somatotopagnosia also considers inability orient recognize body parts others representations body eg manikins typically cause autotopagnosia lesion found parietal lobe left hemisphere however also noted patients generalized brain damage present similar symptoms concept autotopagnosia criticized nonspecific claim manifestation greater symptomatic complex anomia marked inability name things parts human patients autotopagnosia exhibit inability locate parts body body examiners parts representation human body deficiencies localizing parts certain area body entire bodycitation needed patients demonstrating symptoms autotopagnosia decreased ability locate parts multipart object patients considered pure autotopagnosia however deficiency specific body part patients pure autotopagnosia often problems carrying tasks involved everyday life require body part awareness patients difficulty locating body parts directly asked carry activities putting pants without difficulty patients describe function appearance body parts yet still unable locate damage left parietal lobe result called gerstmann syndrome include rightleft confusion difficulty writing difficulty mathematics addition also produce language deficiencies inability recognize objects normally agnosia related disorders include due subjective nature autotopagnosia many hypotheses presented underlying causation since condition definition inability recognize human body parts disorder could stem language deficit specific body parts hand patient could disrupted body image variation inability separate parts whole also believed autotopagnosia multiple underlying causes categorized either languagespecific bodyimagespecific rarity autotopagnosia frequently combined manifestation psychoneurological disorders makes prime cause extremely difficult study many cases one accompanying masking patients autotopagnosia although still unclear precise deficits brain function cause symptoms autotopagnosia location brain damage ambiguous autotopagnosia often attributed lesions parietal lobe left hemisphere brain however also believed disorder caused general brain damage many different types brain lesions cause autotopagnosia however neoplastic lesions seem common pure autotopagnosia often seen smaller lesions larger lesions tend create unseen deficits confuse mask appearance symptoms aphasia discussed parietal lobe involved integration sensory information visuospatial processing left parietal lobe specifically important

g denes et al conducted series tests two patients autotopagnosia order verify body schema uses body representation determine ones spatial arrangement two subjects condition affected parietal lobe
