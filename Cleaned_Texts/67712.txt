sexual selection spiders shows sexual selection explains evolution phenotypic traits spiders male spiders many complex courtship rituals avoid eaten females males species survive matings short life spans precopulatory mate choice processes observed wide range spider species including stegodyphus lineatus argiope aurantia schizocosa floridana hygrolycosa rubrofasciata schizocosa sexual selection occurs copulation well postcopulatory sexual selection involves sperm competition cryptic female choice sperm competition occurs sperm one male competes fertilize egg female cryptic female choice involves expelling males sperm size factor reproductive success males species stegodyphus lineatus argiope aurantia argyroneta aquatica showing sexual dimorphism beneficial larger males stronger aggressive fight smaller ones using large chelicerae leads decrease paternal success smaller males since unable gain access argiope aurantia males lose legs combat loss prevalent smaller males evidence larger males favored maletomale water spider argyroneta aquatica males females permanently live males larger indicating sexual selective pressures large body size large male water spiders mobile helping obtain females sexual selection provides benefits smaller male spiders certain conditions misumena vatia nephila clavipes whose smaller males climb faster reach explained gravity outcompeting larger males thus reproductive especially females live high patches whereas females live low lying areas larger males spiders like tetragnathidae araneidae thomisidae optimal body size favors climbing speed smaller males advantage largest males species however smallest male fastest optimal body size climbing observed different males species express phenotypes weapons chelicerae teeth even legs fight competition used fight oncoming rivals larger bodied spiders contained larger cases body size correlated mating observed lysommanes viridis whose males display weapons pronounced comparison females selected help males fight time takes develop crucial overall fitness spider idea true however mean larger males always better fitness latrodectus hasselti larger males outcompete smaller males getting females web first however large male spiders long development times meaning larger male need time able copulate smaller males tend quick development time gives advantage mating female advantage correlates high paternal success species latrodectus hasselti larger males able outcompete smaller males able mate smaller males risk getting outcompeted likely paternal sperm competition occurs many species unicorn catleyi nephila pilipes argiope males acting limit guarding female inserting parts male genitalia females reproductive using mating come males seminal process observed species unicorn catleyi species males plug females insemination duct portion palp contains ejaculatory duct called embolus embolus found females posterior receptaculum suggests males trying limit sperm spider species nephila pilipes multiple males try mate one female harmful female forces participate energy costly matings response polyandry female produces mating plugs prevent many males copulating mating plugs transferred females males believed possible cause example spider species argiope aurantia males sometimes plug female pedipalps prevent sperm competition occurs male loses ability mate one mate choice typically displayed females males choosy well traits associated winning competitive bouts likely chosen females body size effects maletomale competition females choose male efficient body size wolf spider schizocosa floridana females assess males based ability cope changing environment observing way males adapt differences food availabilities different times males able adapt changes food availability well conditioned usually show courtship displays tapping forelegs waving females choose males express courtship displays larger size based predictions males foraging courtship displays degrees ornamentation colors movements commonly expressed individuals species attract opposite sex male hygrolycosa rubrofasciata spider displays certain signals known drumming male taps legs rough surface leaf signal ready speed influencing female choice towards faster drummers females chooses male body starts shake signal ready mate males exhibit better drumming behavior typically schizocosa stridulans males ornamentation traits affect mating success courtship rates high ornamentation increase reproductive rates males correlation aggressiveness spider degrees ornamentation due correlation hypothesized females choose males without ornamentation avoid aggression males females able choosy courtship rates high worry missing copulations plenty male spiders mate courtship rates low males high degrees ornamentation able get female quickly thus giving advantage non ornamented sometimes facial color leg brightness play role mate choice several species jumping spiders including habronattus pyrrithrix cosmophasis umbratica males show different brightness color body parts prior colors used males advantage attracting mate species habronattus pyrrithrix males faces red non bright green legs likely attract mate males indicating females prefer males particular although females species hygrolycosa rubrofasciata schizocosa floridana schizocosa stridulans tend choosier sex uncommon observe males different spider species zygiella xnotata latrodectus hesperus choosy orb weaving spider zygiella xnotata reproduction rates affected male choice different external conditions depend amount competition males species competition rates low males mate opportunistically many females competition males high larger males choose mate large female opposed smaller males choose mate female belief advantages larger size competition give larger males opportunity increase paternal success allowing selective sometimes males choose females large better conditioned avoid eaten choosing malnourished female result male cannibalized cannibalism females often expressed way females get nutrition mates cannibalistic behavior females makes males selective mate males species latrodectus hesperus show high mate preference better conditioned females choosing well nourished females males able increase mating success limiting chance consumed well nourished females less likely eat mates malnourished cryptic female choice postcopulatory process mate process observed numerous spider species physocyclus globosus argiope example argiope bruennichi species males produce energetic courtship displays prior copulation regardless displays females observed mate multiple males copulation offspring female likely courtship display phenotype females species must cryptically discarding sperm non courtship males keeping males sperm allows females mate many males wants prior copulation choosy males copulation discarding sperm male perform courtship displays indicates females feel males perform courtship displays greatest httpsenwikipediaorgwikisexualselectioninspiders
