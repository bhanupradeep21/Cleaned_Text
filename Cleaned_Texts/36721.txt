deaedextran glass polystyrene plastic microcarrier development began van wezel found material could support growth anchoragedependent cells used however synthetic polymers prevent sufficient cell interactions environment stunts cells may differentiate properly without feedback environment attachment levels would therefore second generation microcarrier development involves use natural polymers gelatin collagen chitin derivatives materials easily obtained natural materials provide attachment sites cells similar microenvironment provides cell signaling pathways necessary proper furthermore biocompatible resulting suspension used delivery cell therapies although liquid microcarriers developed large majority commercially available microcarriers solid particles synthesized suspension however cells grown solid microcarriers risk damage external forces collisions particles therefore extra precaution must taken determining stir speed mechanism resulting fluid dynamic forces strong

prominent advantage using microcarrier suspensions culture cells traditional twodimensional plates capacity hold cells smaller hallmark regular cell culture lab protocol continual passaging cells reach confluence plates fairly quickly bottleneck biologics multilayer vessels stacked plates hollow fibers packed bed reactors technologies developed combat capacity limit plate cell although improvement cell numbers produced methods still reach threshold clinical microcarrier cell culture however breakthrough required cell culture reach industrial clinical studies shown microcarrier suspensions compared multilayer vessel culture improve cell yield ten percent good manufacturing practice space sixty percent original without need continual passaging less risk bacterial contamination labor costs minimized twodimensional culture also suffers poor diffusivity nutrients gases requiring added media supplements manually evenly distributed may result irreproducible microcarrier cell suspensions stirred tank bioreactors allows even distribution homogenous parameters ph oxygen pressure media supplement concentrations continually monitored within bioreactor opposed manually testing small samples however high stir speeds cause damaging collisions particles reactor low speed inhibit cell growth causing accumulation particles dead zone preventing even distribution essential therefore minimum maximum velocity gradients must calculated keep suspension homogeneous also sheltered unnecessary often efficient mechanism axial stirrer within bioreactor allows efficient mixing minimal stir homogenous nature wellfunctioning bioreactors also allows simple sampling monitoring procedures compared two dimensional culture often suffers tedious sampling furthermore threedimensional highdensity suspension environment promotes natural cell morphology differentiation mechanical hand twodimensional plate culture tends dedifferentiate cells several passages therefore total passage number must microcarrier suspensions also easily scaled larger concentrations microparticles larger stirred tank reactors laboratory space used culture still kept however scaleup microcarrier platform also entails certain challenges downstream production includes reworking cell detachment isolation larger volumes suspension liquid must removed larger vats bioreactors therefore
