skin layer usually soft flexible outer tissue covering body vertebrate animal three main functions protection regulation sensation animal coverings arthropod exoskeleton different developmental origin structure chemical composition adjective cutaneous means skin latin cutis skin mammals skin organ integumentary system made multiple layers ectodermal tissue guards underlying muscles bones ligaments internal organs skin different nature exists amphibians reptiles skin including cutaneous subcutaneous tissues plays crucial roles formation structure function extraskeletal apparatus horns bovids eg cattle rhinos cervids antlers giraffids ossicones armadillos osteoderm os penisos mammals hair skin even marine mammals like whales dolphins porpoises appear hairless skin interfaces environment first line defense external factors example skin plays key role protecting body excessive water functions insulation temperature regulation sensation production vitamin folates severely damaged skin may heal forming scar tissue sometimes discoloured depigmented thickness skin also varies location location organism humans example skin located eyes around eyelids thinnest skin body mm thick one first areas show signs aging crows feet wrinkles skin palms soles feet thickest skin body mm thick speed quality wound healing skin promoted fur dense primarily fur augments insulation skin provides also serve secondary sexual characteristic camouflage animals skin hard thick processed create leather reptiles fish hard protective scales skin protection birds hard feathers made tough betakeratins amphibian skin strong barrier especially regarding passage chemicals via skin often subject osmosis diffusive forces example frog sitting anesthetic solution would sedated quickly chemical diffuses skin amphibian skin plays key roles everyday survival ability exploit wide range habitats ecological word skin originally referred dressed tanned animal hide usual word human skin hide skin borrowing old norse skinn animal hide fur ultimately protoindoeuropean root sek meaning cut probably reference fact times animal hide commonly cut used mammalian skin composed two primary layers epidermis composed outermost layers skin forms protective barrier bodys surface responsible keeping water body preventing pathogens entering stratified squamous composed proliferating basal differentiated suprabasal keratinocytes keratinocytes major cells constituting merkel cells melanocytes langerhans cells also present epidermis subdivided following strata layers beginning outermost keratinocytes stratum basale proliferate mitosis daughter cells move strata changing shape composition undergo multiple stages cell differentiation eventually become anucleated process keratinocytes become highly organized forming cellular junctions desmosomes secreting keratin proteins lipids contribute formation extracellular matrix provide mechanical strength keratinocytes stratum corneum eventually shed surface desquamation epidermis contains blood vessels cells deepest layers nourished diffusion blood capillaries extending upper layers dermis epidermis dermis separated thin sheet fibers called basement membrane made action tissues basement membrane controls traffic cells molecules dermis epidermis also serves binding variety cytokines growth factors reservoir controlled release physiological remodeling repair dermis layer skin beneath epidermis consists connective tissue cushions body stress strain dermis provides tensile strength elasticity skin extracellular matrix composed collagen fibrils microfibrils elastic fibers embedded hyaluronan skin proteoglycans varied specific example hyaluronan versican decorin present throughout dermis epidermis extracellular matrix whereas biglycan perlecan found epidermis harbors many mechanoreceptors nerve endings provide sense touch heat nociceptors thermoreceptors also contains hair follicles sweat glands sebaceous glands apocrine glands lymphatic vessels blood vessels blood vessels dermis provide nourishment waste removal cells well epidermis dermis subcutaneous tissues thought contain germinative cells involved formation horns osteoderm extraskeletal apparatus dermis tightly connected epidermis basement membrane structurally divided two areas superficial area adjacent epidermis called papillary region deep thicker area known reticular region papillary region composed loose areolar connective tissue named fingerlike projections called papillae extend toward epidermis papillae provide dermis bumpy surface interdigitates epidermis strengthening connection two layers skin reticular region lies deep papillary region usually much thicker composed dense irregular connective tissue receives name dense concentration collagenous elastic reticular fibers weave throughout protein fibers give dermis properties strength extensibility elasticity also located within reticular region roots hair sweat glands sebaceous glands receptors nails blood vessels subcutaneous tissue also hypodermis part skin lies dermis purpose attach skin underlying bone muscle well supplying blood vessels nerves consists loose connective tissue elastin main cell types fibroblasts macrophages adipocytes subcutaneous tissue contains body fat fat serves padding insulation body microorganisms like staphylococcus epidermis colonize skin surface density skin flora depends region skin disinfected skin surface gets recolonized bacteria residing deeper areas hair follicle gut urogenital openings epidermis fish amphibians consists entirely live cells minimal quantities keratin cells superficial generally permeable case many amphibians may actually major respiratory dermis bony fish typically contains relatively little connective tissue found tetrapods instead species largely replaced solid protective bony apart particularly large dermal bones form parts skull scales lost tetrapods although many reptiles scales different kind cartilaginous fish numerous toothlike denticles embedded skin place true sweat glands sebaceous glands unique mammals types skin gland found fish typically numerous individual mucussecreting skin cells aid insulation protection may also poison glands photophores cells produce watery serous fluid amphibians mucus cells gathered together form saclike glands living amphibians also possess granular glands skin secrete irritating toxic although melanin found skin many species reptiles amphibians fish epidermis often relatively colorless instead color skin largely due chromatophores dermis addition melanin may contain guanine carotenoid pigments many species chameleons flounders may able change color skin adjusting relative size amphibians possess two types glands mucous granular serous glands part integument thus considered cutaneous mucous granular glands divided three different sections connect structure gland whole three individual parts gland duct intercalary region lastly alveolar gland sac structurally duct derived via keratinocytes passes surface epidermal outer skin layer thus allowing external secretions body gland alveolus sac shaped
