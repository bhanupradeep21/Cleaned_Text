ear organ enables hearing mammals body balance using vestibular system mammals ear usually described three parts outer ear middle ear inner ear outer ear consists pinna ear canal since outer ear visible portion ear animals word ear often refers external part middle ear includes tympanic cavity three ossicles inner ear sits bony labyrinth contains structures key several senses semicircular canals enable balance eye tracking moving utricle saccule enable balance stationary cochlea enables hearing ear self cleaning organ relationship earwax ear ears vertebrates placed somewhat symmetrically either side head arrangement aids sound localization ear develops first pharyngeal pouch six small swellings develop early embryo called otic placodes derived ectoderm ear may affected disease including infection traumatic damage diseases ear may lead hearing loss tinnitus balance disorders vertigo although many conditions may also affected damage brain neural pathways leading ear ear adorned earrings jewelry numerous cultures thousands years subjected surgical cosmetic alterations human ear consists three outer ear middle ear inner ear canal outer ear separated airfilled tympanic cavity middle ear eardrum middle ear contains three small transmission sound connected throat nasopharynx via pharyngeal opening eustachian tube inner ear contains otolith utricle semicircular canals belonging vestibular system well cochlea auditory outer ear external portion ear includes fleshy visible pinna also called auricle ear canal outer layer eardrum also called tympanic pinna consists curving outer rim called helix inner curved rim called antihelix opens ear canal tragus protrudes partially obscures ear canal facing antitragus hollow region front ear canal called concha ear canal stretches inch cm first part canal surrounded cartilage second part near eardrum surrounded bone bony part known auditory bulla formed tympanic part temporal bone skin surrounding ear canal contains ceruminous sebaceous glands produce protective ear wax ear canal ends external surface two sets muscles associated outer ear intrinsic extrinsic muscles mammals muscles

localisation sound brain accomplishes comparing arrivaltimes intensities ear circuits located superior olivary complex trapezoid bodies connected via pathways middle ear lies outer ear inner ear consists airfilled cavity called tympanic cavity includes three ossicles attaching ligaments auditory tube round oval windows ossicles three small bones function together receive amplify transmit sound eardrum inner ear ossicles malleus hammer incus anvil stapes stirrup stapes smallest named bone body middle ear also connects upper throat nasopharynx via pharyngeal opening eustachian three ossicles transmit sound outer ear inner ear malleus receives vibrations sound pressure eardrum connected longest part manubrium handle ligament transmits vibrations incus turn transmits vibrations small stapes bone wide base stapes rests oval window stapes vibrates vibrations transmitted oval window causing movement fluid within round window allows fluid within inner ear move stapes pushes secondary tympanic membrane fluid inner ear moves pushes membrane round window corresponding amount middle ear ossicles help amplify sound waves nearly inner ear sits within temporal bone complex cavity called bony labyrinth central area known vestibule contains two small fluidfilled recesses utricle saccule connect semicircular canals cochlea three semicircular canals angled right angles responsible dynamic balance cochlea spiral shellshaped organ responsible sense hearing structures together create membranous bony labyrinth refers bony compartment contains membranous labyrinth contained within temporal bone inner ear structurally begins oval window receives vibrations incus middle ear vibrations transmitted inner ear fluid called endolymph fills membranous labyrinth endolymph situated two vestibules utricle saccule eventually transmits cochlea spiralshaped structure cochlea consists three fluidfilled spaces vestibular duct cochlear duct tympanic hair cells

auricular artery petrosal branch middle meningeal artery labyrinthine artery arising either anterior inferior cerebellar artery basilar sound waves travel outer ear modulated middle ear transmitted vestibulocochlear nerve inner ear nerve transmits information temporal lobe brain registered sound sound travels outer ear impacts eardrum causes vibrate three ossicles bones transmit sound second window oval window protects fluidfilled inner ear detail pinna outer ear helps focus sound impacts eardrum malleus rests membrane receives vibration vibration transmitted along incus stapes oval window two small muscles tensor tympani stapedius also help modulate noise two muscles reflexively contract dampen excessive vibrations vibration oval window causes vibration endolymph within vestibule inner ear houses apparatus necessary change vibrations transmitted outside world via middle ear signals passed along vestibulocochlear nerve brain hollow channels inner ear filled liquid contain sensory epithelium studded hair cells microscopic hairs cells structural protein filaments project fluid hair cells mechanoreceptors release chemical neurotransmitter stimulated sound waves moving fluid flows receptor cells organ corti fluid pushes filaments individual cells movement filaments causes receptor cells become open receive potassiumrich endolymph causes cell depolarise creates action potential transmitted along spiral ganglion sends information auditory portion vestibulocochlear nerve temporal lobe human ear generally hear sounds frequencies hz khz audio range sounds outside range considered infrasound ultrasound although hearing requires intact functioning auditory portion central nervous system well working ear human deafness extreme insensitivity sound commonly occurs abnormalities inner ear rather nerves tracts central auditory system providing balance moving stationary also central function ear ear facilitates two types balance static balance allows person feel effects gravity dynamic balance allows person sense acceleration static balance provided two ventricles utricle saccule cells lining walls ventricles contain fine filaments cells covered fine gelatinous layer cell small filaments one large filament kinocilium within gelatinous layer lie otoliths tiny formations calcium carbonate person moves otoliths shift position shift alters positions filaments opens ion channels within cell membranes creating depolarisation action potential transmitted brain along vestibulocochlear dynamic balance provided three semicircular canals three canals orthogonal right angles end canal slight enlargement known ampulla contains numerous cells filaments central area called cupula fluid canals rotates according momentum head person changes acceleration inertia fluid changes affects pressure cupula results opening ion channels causes depolarisation passed signal brain along vestibulocochlear dynamic balance also helps maintain eye tracking moving via reflex embryogenesis ear develops three distinct structures inner ear middle ear outer structure originates different germ layer ectoderm endoderm implantation around second
