frequencydependent foraging defined tendency individual selectively forage certain species morph based relative frequency within specifically pollinators refers tendency visit particular floral morph plant species based frequency within local plant community even nectar rewards equivalent amongst different morphs pollinators forage frequencydependent manner exhibit flower certain morph preferred

frequencydependent foraging apparent many flowers visited therefore considering morph frequency within localized patches flowers natural settings may sufficient instead morph frequency may need
