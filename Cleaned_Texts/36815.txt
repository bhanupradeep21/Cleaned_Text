studies exact classification pisanosaurus topic debate scientists years consensus pisanosaurus oldest known ornithischian part diverse group dinosaurs lived nearly entire span mesozoic era recently authors begun consider nondinosaurian though hypothesis reached consensus pisanosaurus traditionally classified basal within ornithischia postcrania seem lack good ornithischian synapomorphy even suggested paul sereno fossil however recent studies suggest fossils belong single years pisanosaurus classified heterodontosaurid fabrosaurid hypsilophodont also considered earliest known ornithischian study placed pisanosaurus outside basal heterodontosauridae study pisanosaurus earliest primitive assignment also supported norman et al langer et al controversial ornithoscelida hypothesis baron norman barrett primitive ornithischians include eocursor trimucrodon possibly fabrosaurus hypothesis ornithischian affinities pisanosaurus fallen favor despite competition alternative hypothesis silesauridlike traits example may dinosaurian plesiomorphies ancestral conditions rather unique characteristics phylogenetic analysis informally conducted agnolin recovered pisanosaurus
