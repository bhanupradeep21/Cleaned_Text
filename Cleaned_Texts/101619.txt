selfevaluation maintenance sem concerns discrepancies two people relationship theory posits individual maintain well enhance selfesteem via social comparison another selfevaluation refers selfperceived social ranking one towards continuous process determining personal growth progress raised lowered behavior others abraham tesser created selfevaluation maintenance theory selfevaluation maintenance model assumes two things person try maintain increase selfevaluation selfevaluation influenced relationships persons selfevaluation similar selfesteem may raised close performs example sibling scores winning goal important game selfevaluation increase person sharing hisher success closer psychological relationship greater success person share considered reflection process closeness performance high selfevaluation raised reflection process someone psychologically close performs well task irrelevant persons selfdefinition person able benefit sharing success achievement time success close decrease someones selfevaluation comparison process success close invites comparison ones capabilities thereby directly affecting ones also strengthened closeness psychological relationship successful using similar example sibling scores winning goal important game also team comparison selfevaluation lowered closeness sibling performance scored winning goal high selfevaluation decreased comparison process expressed comparison related something value personal identity aspiring become professional soccer player sibling scores winning goal comparison aspect sem decrease selfevaluation reflection comparison processes closeness performance level significant factors closeness another decreases person less likely share success andor compare himherself lessens likelihood decreasing selfevaluation person likely compare himherself someone close himher like sibling best friend stranger different factors person assume closeness family friends people similar characteristics etc individual close particular person makes sense heshe share success threatened success time persons performance low reason share success increase selfevaluation also reason compare himherself person performance low reason raise lower hisher selfevaluation according tessers theory sibling well hisher game reason individuals selfevaluation affected closeness performance either raise selfevaluation reflection lower selfevaluation comparison relevance selfidentity determines whether reflection comparison occur many different dimensions important individuals selfdefinition selfdefining factor factor personally relevant identity example skills music may important ones selfdefinition time good math may important even skilled relating selfdefinition may consider musician mathematician even skilled relevance assumes particular factor important individual also important another person relevance simple shared dimension one considers important relevance high one engage comparison relevance low one engage example athletics important person person considers athletics important dimension hisher selfdefinition sibling well athletics comparison process take place hisher selfevaluation decrease hand athletics dimension heshe uses selfdefinition reflection process take place heshe celebrate siblings success sibling hisher selfevaluation increase along siblings heshe threatened challenged siblings athletic capability tesser suggests people may things reduce decrease selfevaluation comparison one spend less time particular individual thereby reducing closeness one change important selfdefinition take new hobby focus different selfdefining activity reduces relevance eg siblings success favorite sport may lead stop playing third way avoiding decrease selfevaluation comparison process affect anothers performance eg hiding siblings favorite shoes believe hisher performance based luck one improve skills practicing conditions predict whether individual interfere anothers performance sake selfevaluation include closeness individuals relevance activity relevance high comparison process important reflection process relevance high activity high selfdefining importance person poses larger threat relevance low mazar et al investigated selfconcept maintenance applies moral behavior found participants engaged dishonest behaviors achieve external benefits point however need maintain positive view honest limited extent dishonest behavior tesser smith experimented theory men recruited asked bring friend put groups four man man friend along man b man bs friend half subjects told studys purpose measuring important verbal skills leadership high relevance group two subjects told task nothing verbal skills leadership anything important considered low relevance group activity based game password persons guess word based clues man given opportunity guess word three gave clues list three give clues easy difficult based judgment whether would like help person guess word clues given person necessary guess word first pair partners performed poorly instructed experimental design experiment interested behavior second group men next pairing designed partner stranger friend researchers trying see friend helped stranger stranger helped friend results supported hypothesis sessions relevance high told activity measures important verbal leadership skills stranger helped friend also sessions relevance low subjects told activity determined nothing importance friend helped prediction selfevaluation maintenance theory strongly supported previously discovered positive evaluations occurred participants low relevance high closeness another individual tesser sought test whether emotional arousal mediated relation sibling sport examples evident selfevaluation process emotionally stimulating one tesser interested whether emotional effect sideeffect selfevaluation process whether mediating effect ie whether partial factor influencing evaluation tesser believed emotion mediating factor emotional arousal engaged misattributed selfevaluation process would activated factors controlled test subjects arrived pairs knew one another prior two conditions given vitamin c pills control condition truthfully told pills would effect misattribution condition told pills would cause arousal activating placebo effect subjects completed relevant nonrelevant tasks subjects close close ratings participants measured results found subjects misattribution condition much extreme ratings participants task high relevancy subject rating participant much worse control condition findings show emotional activation factor determining evaluations mediating factor effect zuckerman jost compares selfevaluation maintenance theory work feld selfevaluatory maintenance theory would lead one judge stranger higher friends based popularity order prevent drop selfevaluation felds research demonstrated people must fewer friends friends order remain popular based mathematical equation explains popular people involved social circles unpopular people two research examples examples see references graph illustrates basic principles tessers selfevaluatory maintenance model behavior relevance determines whether reflection comparison occur relevance low factor affect selfdefinition others performance increases selfevaluation allowing person share celebration person reflection relevance high factor important selfdefinition also others performance increases selfevaluation decreases person compared person comparison
