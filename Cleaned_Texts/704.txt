use technique inadequate late endoscopic endonasal approach used neurosurgeons augment microsurgery allowed view objects line sight another surgeon axel perneczky considered pioneer use endoscope neurosurgery perneczky said endoscopy improved appreciation microanatomy apparent surgery pioneered algeria bouyoucef kheireddine faiza endoscope consists glass fiber bundle cold light illumination mechanical housing optics component four different views degree straight forward degrees forward plane degrees lateral view degrees retrospective endoscopic endonasal surgery rigid rodlens endoscopes used better quality vision since endoscopes smaller normal endoscope used endoscope eyepiece surgeon rarely used requires surgeon fixed position instead video camera broadcasts image monitor shows surgical fieldcitation needed several specialties need involved determine complete surgical plan include endocrinologist neuroradiologist ophthalmologist neurosurgeon otolaryngologist endocrinologist involved preparation endoscopic endonasal surgery tumor located pituitary gland tumor first treated pharmacologically two ways controlling levels hormones pituitary gland secretes reducing size tumor approach work patient referred surgery main types pituitary adenomas neuroradiologist takes images defect surgeon prepared expect surgery includes identifying lesion tumor controlling effects medical therapy defining spatial situation lesions verifying removal lesions associated endoscopic endonasal surgery include suprasellar tumors invade chiasmatic cistern causing impaired vision cases
