frozen zoo storage facility genetic materials taken animals eg dna sperm eggs embryos live tissue stored low temperatures tanks liquid material preserved way stored used artificial insemination vitro fertilization embryo transfer cloning frozen zoos across world implement technology conservation efforts several different species introduced technology including pyrenean ibex blackfooted ferret potentially white rhinoceros first frozen zoo established san diego zoo pathologist kurt benirschke time technology available make use collection benirschke believed technology would developed frozen

eggs females usually low increased hormone treatment obtain oocytes dependent species frozen zoos prefer fertilize eggs freeze resulting embryo embryos resilient cryopreservation centers also collect skin cell samples endangered animals extinct species scripps research institute successfully made skin cells cultures special cells called induced pluripotent stem cells ips cells theoretically possible make sperm egg cells ips several animals whose cells preserved frozen zoos cloned increase genetic diversity endangered species one attempt clone extinct species made newborn pyrenean ibex

regenerative bioscience center building frozen zoo rbc director steven stice animal dairy science assistant professor franklin west created facility thought saving endangered cat species scientists already extracted cells sumatran tiger could used artificial insemination artificial insemination provides remedy animals due anatomical physiological reasons unable reproduce natural way reproduction stored genetic material also allows fostering genetic improvements prevention inbreeding modern technology allows genetic manipulation animals without keeping captivity however success restoration wild would require application new science sufficient amount previously collected due low temperatures required varying levels stress put dna samples spermatozoa include particular stressed temperature shock osmotic stress oxidative stress latter temperature shock occurs membrane damaged freezing thawing sperm osmotic stress occurs ice crystals form inside nucleus freezing process causing differing osmotic pressures within cell oxidative stress result many reactive oxygen species ros highly reactive damaging parts although stressors present within cell solutions introducing cholesterol samples temperature shock reduced use antifreeze proteins provides one solution osmotic stress oxidative stress difficult combat highly reactive components ros measures like adding certain proteins limit freezethaw damage increase survival rate gaur died natural causes skin cells frozen added san diego frozen zoo eight years later dna cells inserted domesticcow egg create embryo
