necrosuchus extinct genus caiman modern day argentina lived paleocene epoch selandian age million years ago inhabited fluviolacustrine environment patagonian salamanca fossil remains necrosuchus unearthed april first scarritt expedition argentinian salamanca formation presented american paleontologist charles c mook mook however busy research unable describe specimen initial description deemed vital works several student researches time mook handed specimen back george g simpson study eventually published preliminary description writing research carries study far necessary hopes detailed description later published mook however would come postcranial described holotype amnh consists much postcranial anatomy alongside right dentary assorted cranial fragments recognized although material paleocene patagonia shares similarities necrosuchus none safely referred genus simpson explains meaning generic name compound word nekros meaning dead suchus meaning crocodile simpson described wellmeaning lady asked us dead inspired choice name specific name refers las violetas site ion violet dentary teeth necrosuchus less evenly spaced throughout holotype teeth lying closer together others however even without direct contact upper margin jaw notably concave tooth remains straight teeth show little differentiation one another morphology however difference tooth size striking almost equal degree extant genus caiman although degree enlargement similar distribution similar seen leidyosuchus many species used comparison considered borealosuchus according simpson first two teeth size followed decrease size tooth three dentary tooth largest lower jaw followed series noticeably smaller teeth similar condition seen extant caimans unlike extant taxa however tooth enlarged point almost rivals dentary tooth size transition size much less tooths status second largerst tooth dentary differentiates necrosuchus caimans purussaurus brasiliensis species paleosuchus necrosuchus differs purussaurus slender mandibular ramus well size first four dentary paleosuchus anatomy atlantal ribs lack mediolaterall compression posterior dentary postcranial remains include dorsal vertebrae preserved articulation procoelous rectangular neural spines lacking transverse processes due preservation point past vertebrae identified dorsals basis assignment known however study brochu confirms assumption correct based anatomy hypapophyseal keel last two dorsals also preserved articulation sacral vertebrae sutures dorsal sacral neurocentrals unfused still open suggesting animal yet fully grown time death pectoral girdle largely preserved parts scapulacoracoids missing scapula blade humeri ulnae radii well one radiale largely resemble forelimbs modern crocodilians pelvic girdles preserved although one ilia distorted corresponding bone side preserves natural state blades pubis less symmetrical modern crocs hindlimbs preserve femur tibia parts fibula various foot bones osteoderms preserved early analysis necrosuchus believed close relative leidyosuchus time believed crocodylid later research showed necrosuchus shows derived features alligatoroids precisely caimanines time brochu described postcrania necrosuchus many species leidyosuchus originally used comparison reclassified species borealosuchus postcranial material however differs significantly borealosuchus shows affinities following taxonomic revision amended diagnosis published cicade colleagues recovered necrosuchus derived member caimaninae nested within large polytomy extant
