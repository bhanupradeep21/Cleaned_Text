cold urticaria essentially meaning cold hives disorder large red welts called hives urticaria form skin exposure cold hives usually itchy often hands feet become itchy swollen well hives vary size mm diameter big mm larger disorder perhaps two disorders clinical manifestations inherited familial cold urticaria acquired primary acquired cold urticaria acquired form likely begin ages although occur early years old cases lifethreatening risks include suffocation resulting swollen tissue pharyngeal angioedema induced cold foods beverages drowning shock swimming cold water anaphylactic cold urticaria may divided following primary cold contact urticaria cutaneous condition characterized wheals occurs rainy windy weather swimming cold water contact cold objects including ice secondary cold contact urticaria cutaneous condition characterized wheals due serum abnormalities cryoglobulinemia cryofibrinogenemia extremely rare associated manifestations raynauds phenomenon reflex cold urticaria cutaneous condition generalized cooling body induces widespread familial cold urticaria also properly known familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome fcas autosomal dominant condition characterized rash conjunctivitis feverchills elicited exposure cold sometimes temperatures mapped slightly milder member disease family including syndrome nomid rare estimated prevalence per million people mainly affects americans fcas one cryopyrinassociated periodic syndromes caps caused mutations aka gene location effect fcas quality life patients far reaching survey patients united states found cope underlying disease try avoid symptomatic painful flares patients reported limiting work school family social activities seventyeight percent survey participants described impact disease work including absenteeism impaired job advancement frequently quit job consequence treatment using anakinra kineret shown effective fcas although mean daily injections immunosuppressant area lower monoclonal antibody canakinumab ilaris also body exposed cold individuals affected condition hives appear skin affected area typically becomes itchy hives result dilation capillaries allow fluid flow surrounding tissue epidermis resolve body absorbs fluidcitation needed border hive described polycyclic made many circles changes fluid leaks pressing hive causes skin blanch turn pale blood flow interrupted distinguishing bruise papule hives may appear immediately hives last minutes days vary person person also burning sensation occurs serious reaction likely occur patients hives occur less

immune cells investigators named condition antibody deficiency immune dysregulation diagnosis typically obtained allergist licensed practitioner performing cold test cold test piece ice placed inside thin plastic bag held forearm typically positive result specific looking mark raised red hives hives may shape ice may radiate contact area however techniques assist diagnosis provide information temperature stimulation time thresholds patients start develop essential establish disease severity monitor effectiveness management largely consists avoiding exposures could trigger reaction taking medicine manage reaction best treatment allergy avoiding exposure cold anything lowers skin temperature bodys core temperature trigger reaction affected people avoiding exposures limits risk reaction reaction usually affects body parts exposed cold air could trigger reaction exposed skin breathing passages cold air inhaled risky exposures include firstline therapy symptomatic relief secondgeneration standard dosing ineffective increasing dosages fourfold recommended control secondgeneration rupatadine found significantly reduce development chronic cold urticaria symptom without increase adverse effects doses mg allergy medications containing antihistamines diphenhydramine benadryl cetirizine zyrtec loratadine claritin cyproheptadine periactin fexofenadine allegra may taken orally prevent relieve severe anaphylactic reactions prescribed medicine doxepin taken daily help prevent andor lessen likelihood reaction thus anaphylaxis effectiveness topical antihistamine creams
