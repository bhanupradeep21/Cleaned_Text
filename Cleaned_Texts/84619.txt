monocytes type leukocyte white blood cell largest type leukocyte blood differentiate macrophages monocytederived dendritic cells part vertebrate innate immune system monocytes also influence adaptive immune responses exert tissue repair functions least three subclasses monocytes human blood based phenotypic receptors monocytes amoeboid appearance nongranulated thus classified agranulocytes although might occasionally display azurophil granules andor vacuoles diameter Î¼m monocytes largest cell type peripheral monocytes mononuclear cells ellipsoidal nucleus often lobulatedindented causing beanshaped kidneyshaped monocytes compose leukocytes human body monocytes produced bone marrow precursors called monoblasts bipotent cells differentiated hematopoietic stem monocytes circulate bloodstream one three days typically migrate tissues throughout body differentiate macrophages dendritic cells first clear description monocyte subsets flow cytometry dates back late population monocytes today three types monocytes recognized human humans level expression used differentiate nonclassical intermediate monocytes slan lacnac cell surface marker shown give unequivocal separation two cell ghattas et al state intermediate monocyte population likely unique subpopulation monocytes opposed developmental step due comparatively high expression surface receptors involved reparative processes including vascular endothelial growth factor receptors type well evidence intermediate subset specifically enriched bone mice monocytes divided two subpopulations inflammatory monocytes equivalent human classical monocytes resident monocytes equivalent human nonclassical monocytes resident monocytes ability patrol along endothelium wall steady state inflammatory monocytes mechanically active migrate blood inflammatory site perform functions explained differentiate macrophages dendritic cells different monocyte subpopulations also exert specific functions general monocytes macrophage dendritic cell progeny serve three main functions immune system phagocytosis antigen presentation cytokine production phagocytosis process uptake microbes particles followed digestion destruction material monocytes perform phagocytosis using intermediary opsonising proteins antibodies complement coat pathogen well binding microbe directly via pattern recognition receptors recognize pathogens monocytes also capable killing infected host cells via antibodydependent cellmediated cytotoxicity vacuolization may present cell recently phagocytized foreign matter monocytes migrate tissues replenish resident macrophage populations macrophages high antimicrobial phagocytic activity thereby protect tissues foreign substances cells possess large smooth nucleus large area cytoplasm many internal vesicles processing foreign material although derived monocytes large proportion already formed prenatally yolk sac foetal vitro monocytes differentiate dendritic cells adding cytokines granulocyte macrophage colonystimulating factor gmcsf interleukin monocytederived cells however retain signature monocytes transcriptome cluster monocytes bona fide dendritic aside differentiation capacity monocytes also directly regulate immune responses explained able perform phagocytosis cells classical subpopulation efficient phagocytes additionally secrete inflammationstimulating factors intermediate subpopulation important antigen presentation lymphocyte briefly antigen presentation describes process microbial fragments present monocytes phagocytosis incorporated mhc molecules trafficked cell surface monocytes macrophages dendritic cells presented antigens activate lymphocytes mount specific immune response antigen nonclassical monocytes produce high amounts proinflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor stimulation microbial products furthermore monocyte patrolling behavior demonstrated humans classical nonclassical monocytes meaning slowly move along endothelium examine said et al showed activated monocytes express high levels might explain higher expression monocytes compared monocytes triggering monocytesexpressed ligand induces production activates cells inhibits cell many factors produced cells regulate chemotaxis functions monocytes factors include particularly chemokines monocyte chemotactic monocyte chemotactic certain arachidonic acid metabolites leukotriene members acid acid family receptor agonists eg nformylmethionine leucylphenylalanine nformylated oligopeptides made bacteria activate formyl peptide receptor microbial products directly activate monocytes leads production proinflammatory delay antiinflammatory cytokines typical cytokines produced monocytes tnf monocyte count part complete blood

disease progression monocytosis state excess monocytes peripheral blood may indicative various disease states examples processes increase monocyte count include high count monocytes found severe infection field atherosclerosis high numbers intermediate monocytes shown predictive cardiovascular events populations cmml characterized persistent monocyte count blood analysis monocyte subsets demonstrated predominance classical monocytes absence absence nonclassical monocytes assist diagnosis disease use slan marker improve monocytopenia form leukopenia associated deficiency monocytes low
