suminia extinct genus basal anomodont lived tatarian age late permian spanning approximately suminia recognized youngest nondicynodont fossil localities primarily derived kotel nich locality kirov oblast russia however isolated specimen found different localities eastern european regions suminia along otsheria ulemica make monophyletic group russian basal anomodonts named venyukovioid anomodonts understood derived ancestor dispersed gondwana suminia getmanovi defined species within genus known specializations teeth effective functional oral processing plant material well one first species proposed arboreal new material suminia recently excavated upper permian kotel nich locality single large block articulated skeletons least specimen suminia getmanovi found new material suminia getmanovi consisted mainly subadult adult specimen well preserved signs weathering predation suggesting rapid burial perhaps due catastrophic suminia diagnosed small venyukoviid various autapomorphies large orbit almost skull length large teeth relation skull size reduced number presacral vertebrae long wide cervical vertebrae suggests elongated neck elongated limbs manus pes equal length respective limb enlarged distal carpal tarsal suminia getmanovi recognized wellpreserved skulls suminia skull length fairly small measuring long characterized short snout squamosal regions expanded orbit composes around total skull length external naris also large measured compose total skull cranial features shared ulemica distinguish suminia ulemica anomodonts preparietal absence reduced

significant implications feeding ecology discussed study suminia post cranial anatomy reveal many autapomorphies single specimen significant post cranial autapomorphies suminia reduced number presacral dorsal vertebrae exclusively amphicoelous lack fusion sacral region vertebrae suggests high flexibility wide pre postzygapophyses longer proportions cervical pleurocentra distinct proportionally longer limbs manus forms length forelimb particularly long curved terminal phalanges pes makes hindlimb enlarged carpal tarsal suggests divergent first different morphological features indicate significantly deviated post cranial anatomy anomodonts suggesting suminia adopted arboreal lifestyle see combination masticatory architecture similar dicynodonts defined sliding jaw articulation suminia canineless large leaf shaped teeth follow occluding dentition completely marginal differs species leafshaped teeth present provides indications herbivory mechanisms oral one interesting feature occlusal pattern suminia dentition angle occluding surfaces angle degrees jaw plane suggested suminia posterior shreds food material rather crush anterior teeth observed significantly larger devoid occlusial pattern therefore anterior teeth suggested responsible cutting pieces plant posterior teeth suminia therefore understood obligatory herbivores dentition mandibular function permits shredding plant material via posterior teeth replacement discovered infrequent shown certain specimen suminia getmanovi seen teeth worn almost however wear facets upper lower posterior teeth consistent herbivory locations wear labial lingual aspects upper lower posterior teeth respectively distinct evidence wear isnt consequence toothtofood rather toothtotooth evidence suminia extensive oral processing suggest suminia dentition highly specialized high fiber herbivory provides alternative explanation ability process tough high fiber plant material may basal feature anomodonts previously adaptations arboreal lifestyle understood evolve convergent evolution however many arboreal vertebrates share similar physical mechanisms grasping clinging suminia referred earliest known arboreal tetrapod due suggested grasping abilities inferred notably enlarged phalangiform carpal tarsal indicate possess divergent first digit capable grasping first digit measured angle degrees remaining digits manus pes grants ability first digit flex ventrally independent rest digits compared opposable supported elongated limbs claw shaped laterally compressed terminal phalanges would aid clinging ability addition tail anatomy expansion anterior region suggests ability balance well prehensile grasping abilities providing evidence arboreal via morphometric analysis well comparison arboreal vertebrates suminia getmanovi provides anatomical evidence lived among trees stamping significant mark evolutionary history arboreal suminia belong
