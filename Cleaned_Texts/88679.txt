behavioral enrichment animal husbandry principle seeks enhance quality captive animal care identifying providing environmental stimuli necessary optimal psychological physiological enrichment either active passive depending whether requires direct contact animal enrichment variety enrichment techniques used create desired outcomes similar animals individual species history techniques used intended stimulate animals senses similarly would activated wild provided enrichment may seen form auditory olfactory habitat factors food research projects training environmental enrichment improve overall welfare animals captivity create habitat similar would experience wild environment aims maintain animals physical psychological health increasing range number speciesspecific behaviors increasing positive interaction captive environment preventing reducing frequency abnormal behaviors stereotypies increasing individuals ability cope challenges stereotypies seen captive animals due stress boredom includes pacing selfharm overgrooming headweaving environmental enrichment offered animal captivity including environmental enrichment beneficial wide range vertebrates invertebrates land mammals marine mammals united states specific regulations animal welfare act must followed enrichment plans order guarantee regulate provide appropriate living environments stimulation animals moreover association zoos aquariums also known aza requires animal husbandry welfare main concern caring animals captivity passive enrichment provides sensory stimulation direct contact control type enrichment commonly used potential benefit several animals simultaneously well requiring limited direct animal visual enrichment typically provided changing layout animals holding area type visual enrichment vary something simple adding pictures walls videotapes television visual enrichment television especially benefit animals housed single mirrors also potential form enrichment specifically animals display understanding selfrecognition nonhuman primates addition using mirrors reflect animals image mirrors also angled animal able see normally outofsight areas holding enclosures modern zoos often designed facilitate environmental enrichment example denver zoos exhibit predator ridge allows different african carnivores rotated among several enclosures providing animals differently sized environment wild animals exposed variety sounds normally encounter captivity auditory enrichment used mimic animals natural habitat types naturebased auditory enrichment include rain forest sounds conspecific common form auditory enrichment music whose principal stems primarily benefit humans benefits classical music widely studied animals nonhuman studies also looked various genres pop rock ability provide effective enrichment remains types music selected enrichment based human preferences causing anthropomorphic biases may translate therefore music specifically attuned animals auditory senses could speciesspecific sounds require research find pitch frequency range suitable animal active enrichment often requires animal perform sort physical activity well direct interaction enrichment object active enrichment items temporarily reduce stereotypic behaviors beneficial effects usually limited short periods active foodbased enrichment meant mimic captive animal would wild food extremely important wild animals adapted work hard eat lot time energy spent finding food tactic used make challenging animal rather feeding simple feeding enrichment techniques causes animal indulge natural active behaviors allow stimulation prevents form enrichment forms active behaviors also help captive animals mental health animals physical example food hidden spread across enclosure making animal actively search common manipulable tactile objects include rubber toys stuffed treats instead providing food directly foraging devices useful increasing amount searching foraging food comparable amount time would spend foodbased enrichment occurs context searching food cracking open nut digging holes tree trunks wormscitation needed structural enrichment objects added enclosure mimic animals natural habitat objects switched occasionally kept environment captive animals switched frequently since environment wild would bring new objects exploration research constitutes beneficial appropriate forms enrichment must used considering provision enrichment options especially species naturallike settings may difficult animal never become familiar environment cause boredom stimulation stereotypical examples could swings climbing stones also shown encourage exploratory behavior japanese macaques interaction stones exhibited behaviors gathering rolling hands rubbing common forms include cardboard forage even texture food ie hard smooth cold olfactory enrichment stimulate naturalistic behavior enhance exploration reduce inactive olfactory enrichment utilized paired novel toys paired foodbased enrichment type enrichment commonly used species commonly utilize olfactory senses wild although highly beneficial important researchers analyze longterm effects certain odors captive animals odors scattered novel toy ball semirandomly throughout enclosure various forms odors include catnip odor conspecific perfume feces prey species spices cognitive enrichment defined improving animal welfare providing opportunities captive animals use cognitive skills problem solving providing limited control aspects wild animals deal ecological challenges order acquire resources food shelter require challenges arise interactions animals changes environment require individuals exercise cognitive ability improve behavioral therefore challenges act important problemsolving element animals daytoday lives inturn increases overall animal anticipates positive benefits challenging directly affect emotional cognitive enrichment provided addition diverse environment already structurally socially enriched goes beyond basic needs social enrichment either involve housing group conspecifics animals different species would naturally encounter wild social animals particular ie primates lions flamingos etc benefit social enrichment positive effect creating confidence social enrichment encourage social behaviors seen wild including feeding foraging defense territoriality reproduction common form humaninteraction enrichment training human animal interaction training builds trust increases animals cooperation clinical research procedures addition training sessions shown benefit welfare individually housed animals communally housed animals providing cognitive stimulation increasing social play decreasing inactivity mitigating social aggression range methods used assess environmental enrichment provided based premises captive animals perform behaviors similar way ethogram ancestral animals allowed perform activities interactions prefer ie preference test animals allowed perform activities highly motivated ie motivation environmental enrichment way ensure animals natural instinctual behaviors kept able passed taught one generation next enrichment techniques encourage species specific behaviors like discovered wild studied found help process reintroduction endangered species natural habitats well helping create offspring natural traits main way success environmental enrichment measured recognizing behavioral changes occur techniques used shape desired behaviors animal compared behaviors found ways success environmental enrichment assessed quantitatively range behavioral physiological indicators animal welfare addition listed behavioral indicators include occurrence abnormal behaviours eg cognitive bias effects physiological indicators include heart immune eggshell difficult zookeepers measure effectiveness enrichment terms stress due fact animals found zoos oftentimes display presented abnormal conditions cause uneasiness stress measuring enrichment terms reproduction easier ability record offspring numbers fertility making necessary environment changes providing mental stimulation animals captivity seen reproduce similar rate wild ancestors comparison provided less behavioral environmental although environmental enrichment provide sensory social stimulations also limited efficacy changed frequently animals become habituated environmental enrichments showing positive behaviors onset exposure progressively declining time environmental enrichments effective primarily offers novelty stimuli making animals daily routines less predictable would wild therefore maintaining novelty important efficacy enrichment frequently changing type environmental enrichment help prevent usage highly advanced enrichment devices computerized devices requires training lead issues training often consists food reward food encourages animal participate device animal could associate device food result interaction enrichment would bring behaviors associated training instead desired playful voluntary process producing providing environmental enrichment usually require large allocation time resources time taken animal care staff complete tasks significant factor influencing environmental enrichment provisions scheduling therefore important develop appropriate environmental enrichment programs effectively carried size staff time available httpsenwikipediaorgwikibehavioralenrichment
