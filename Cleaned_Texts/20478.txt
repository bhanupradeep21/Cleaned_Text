listener fatigue also known listening fatigue ear fatigue phenomenon occurs prolonged exposure auditory stimulus symptoms include tiredness discomfort pain loss sensitivity listener fatigue clinically recognized state term used many professionals cause listener fatigue still yet fully understood thought extension quantifiable psychological perception sound common groups risk becoming victim phenomenon include avid listeners music others listen work loud noise constant basis musicians construction workers military personnel exact causes listener fatigue associated pathways mechanisms still studied popular theories presented musicality especially radio contains musical aspects timbre emotional impact melody artifacts arise nonmusical aspects soundstaging dynamic range compression sonic balance introduction sonic artifacts affects balance musical nonmusical aspects volume music higher artifacts become apparent uncomfortable ear cause listeners tune lose focus become tired listeners may unconsciously avoid type music radio station may heard exposed multitude sounds several different sources sensory overload may occur overstimulation result general fatigue loss sensation ear associated mechanisms explained detail sensory overload usually occurs environmental noise induced listening music type hearingrelated disorder related physiology within ear central auditory system regards listening fatigue relevant mechanical biochemical mechanisms primarily deal inner ear cochlea stereocilia hair cells inner ear become subjected bending loud noises regeneratable humans major damage loss hair cells leads permanent hearing impairment hearingrelated outer hair cells serve acoustic amplifiers stimulation inner hair cells outer hair cells respond primarily lowintensity excessive vibrations occur inner ear result structural damage affect hearing vibrations result increase metabolic demands auditory system exposure sound metabolic energy needed maintain relevant electrochemical gradients used transduction sounds extra demands metabolic activity system result damage propagate throughout ear exposed noise human ears sensitivity sound decreased corresponding increase threshold hearing shift usually temporary may become permanent natural physiological reaction threshold shifts vasoconstriction reduce amount blood reaching hair cells organ corti cochlea resultant oxygen tension diminished blood supply reaching outer hair cells response sound levels lessened exposed loud sounds rendering less effective putting stress inner hair lead fatigue temporary hearing loss outer hair cells get opportunity recover periods cells get chance recover vulnerable death temporary threshold shifts result different types fatigue recovery temporary threshold shifts take matter minutes shifts essentially independent length exposure also shifts maximal frequencies exposure longterm fatigue defined full recovery temporary threshold shifts taking least several minutes occur recovery take several days threshold shifts result longterm fatigue dependent level sound length temperature heat levels body directly correlated temporary threshold shifts levels blood temperature increase threshold shifts increase well transduction sounds requires oxygen supply readily depleted due prolonged threshold shifts combining exercise exposure loud noises humans observed experience long temporary threshold shift physical activity also results increase metabolic activity already increased result vibrations loud sounds factor particularly interesting due fact large population people listen music exercising people deaf hard hearing use hearing may likely suffer listening fatigue difficulties associated disability study conducted japan reports fatigue sensation shown subjects listened metronome six metronome used part technique test effects musical rhythmic stimulation physical rehabilitation programs series tests involving physical therapy exercises songs different tempos played subjects asked evaluate levels fatigue results showed statistically significant difference fatigue levels without listening various music however many patients respond fatigue music recorded highest level fatigue possible evaluation scale experiment paves way study distinction perception listening fatigue individuals lin et al conducted experiment taiwan tested effect generation reactive oxygen species temporary threshold shift noiseinduced hearing subjects employees steel manufacturing company one assessed personal noise exposure work shifts statistical analysis yielded correlation exposure higherfrequency sounds lower temporary threshold shifts greater levels tiredness hearing loss multitude animal studies conducted help understand hearing loss fatigue difficult quantify levels fatigue animals opposed humans experiment done ishii et al subjects asked rate levels fatigue however techniques used ishii et al perfect recorded fatigue levels selfperceived prone bias studies done variety animal species including guinea however studies conclusions associate levels fatigue prolonged exposure high levels sound first glance would seem reducing noise volume would sufficient reduce prevent listening fatigue altogether however evident issue least partly physiological nature cases sensory overload related purposeful listening hazardous noises
