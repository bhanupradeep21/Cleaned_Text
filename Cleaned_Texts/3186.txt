hawking feeding strategy birds involving catching flying insects air term usually refers technique sallying perch snatch insect returning different perch though also applies birds spend almost entire lives wing technique called flycatching birds known several families flycatchers old world flycatchers monarch flycatchers tyrant flycatchers however species known flycatchers use foraging methods grey titflycatcher birds swifts swallows nightjars also take insects wing continuous aerial feeding term hawking comes similarity behavior way hawks take prey flight although whereas raptors may catch prey feet hawking behavior catching insects bill many birds combined strategy hawking insects gleaning foliage various methods taking insects categorized gleaning perched bird takes prey branch tree trunk snatching flying bird takes prey ground branch hawking bird leaves perch takes prey air pouncing bird drops ground takes prey pursuing flying bird takes insects hawking behavior bird watch prey suitable perch spies potential prey bird fly swiftly perch catch insect bill return perch sometimes different perch maneuver also called sally prey small relative bird gnats may consumed immediately flight larger prey bees moths usually brought back perch eaten sometimes prey attempt escape result fluttering pursuit returning perch depending species bird observable variations behavior species olivesided flycatcher north ashy drongo indian tend choose exposed perch dead tree branch overlooking clearing whereas others north american acadian asian small perch within cover foliage deep forest woodland habitat many birds make use variety tactics study feeding behaviors family tyrannidae categorized following moves ways taking insect prey aerial hawking ie flycatching perchtoground sallying ground feeding chasing insects ground perchtowater sallying sallygleaning involve hovergleaning rapid strike gleaning tyrant flycatchers choose prominent perch hawk insects tendency return perch sally others particularly forest interior show less similar pattern seen great britain two flycatchers spotted flycatcher pied flycatcher spotted flycatcher specialist tends return perch sally pied flycatcher generalist gleaning well flycatching changes perches birds name flycatcher ones engage flycatching behavior example lewiss woodpecker feeds flycatching honeyeaters australasia employ hawking gleaning feeding tactics beeeaters catch bees similar manner return perch remove sting consuming furthermore many small owls take insect prey wing examples include western screech owl north brown boobook continuous aerial feeding different way hawking insects requires long wings skillful flying nightjars swallows swifts swifts masters aerial feeding several species spend virtually entire lives air nonmating common swifts spent much months air without landing come rely insects main source food swallows though visually similar swifts unrelated feed similar manner less continuously dont glide much stop perch bouts aerial prey swifts fly higher pursuit smaller lighter insects scattered rising air currents swallows generally chase mediumsized insects lower ground flies swallows fly higher go smaller insects adjust fight style glide like birds nightjar family employ variety moves catching insects common nighthawk north america flies swiftlike fashion long slender pointed common poorwill hand flies low perches low ground sally air many birds known engage hawking opportunistic feeding technique supplemental source nutrition among cedar waxwing mostly eats fruit also often observed hawking insects terns genus chlidonias black tern fly search insects sometimes chasing dragonflies even large owls normally feed rodents snatch flying insects opportunity hawking insects like feeding strategy must provide bird sufficient nourishment make expenditure energy worthwhile strategies tactics feeding airborne insects inextricably related adaptations lifestyles birds employ flight especially flight driven musclepowered flapping wings strenuous physical activity although sally perch may look like single rapid movement human eye actually bird must perform several moves begins takeoff pushing feet get air flaps wings generate forward motion thrust pursues prey item turns air flies back final flurry wings lands perch bird hawks insects prey must substantial enough pay terms biological energy budget words bird must take energy food using pursuit food therefore flycatchers tend prefer insect prey moderate size flies smaller insects like birds live forest habitat setting short bursts flight used sallies getting tree branch tree branch short rounded wings suitable rapid flapping required maneuver tight spaces birds open settings sally larger insects like bees kingbirds beeeaters benefit longer pointed efficient generate lift less drag swallows swifts glide totally open spaces even longer wings another function long pointed wings enable birds turn quickly smoothly midglide wingtips create little vortices air within low air pressure creates additional lift furthermore long forked tails provide additional lift stability steering ability important flying slower speeds swifts though capable flying fast actually must fly relatively slowly intercept airborne fact swifts bodies well adapted flying unable perch branches land ground nest roost precipices rocky cliffs behind waterfalls black swift north great dusky swift south known chimneys case chimney swift bill size shape also important compared bills birds specialized gleaning relatively larger broader bill ideal catching sizeable insects bees presence bristles near bill rictal bristles flycatchers may adaptation hawking insects scientists sure function may help protect might actually help provide bird sensory information location swallows swifts nightjars large bills widegaping mouths nightjars also bristles around bill common poorwill common nighthawk different kinds birds adaptations similarities necessarily indicative familial relationship bird species rather result convergent evolution consider example marked resemblance body size shape coloration flycatchers several families though species closely related asian brown flycatcher muscicapidae old world flycatcher family acadian flycatcher tyrannidae tyrant flycatcher family new world slaty monarch monarchidae monarch flycatcher family endemic fiji three use flycatching acquire three families belong separate branches evolutionary tree songbirds diverged two branching events million years ago continued evolve independently different parts likewise similarities swifts swallows led naturalists conclude related established unrelated lifestyle led temperate climates availability flying insects food source seasonal probably many birds rely food source breeding season migrate migration timed availability birds preferred food instance observed great britain migrating swallows arrive earlier spring swifts correlates later profusion small insects swifts feed weather also affects availability flying insects swallows example obliged go insects depending weather may adjust choice prey forced seek prey different preference certain kinds aerial insect food source seems correlate gregarious colonial behavior versus territoriality birds take advantage swarming insects nature found local concentrations colonial breeding successful strategy example cliff swallow western north america relative barn swallow hunts larger nonswarming insects certain neotropical tyrant flycatchers join mixedspecies
