sarcosaurus latin flesh lizard genus basal neotheropod dinosaur roughly metres ft long lived england maybe ireland scotland hettangiansinemurian stages early jurassic million years ago sarcosaurus one earliest known jurassic theropods one handful theropod genera time period along dracoraptor hanigani one two described neotheropods lowermost jurassic united holotype nhmuk pv partial skeleton includes posterior dorsal vertebra partial left right ilia fused proximal portion pubis lacking femoral head specimen shows evidence skeletal maturity meaning early juvenile exact ontogenetic stage

species sarcosaurus woodi first described charles william andrews shortly partial skeleton found sl wood near barrowonsoar scunthorpe mudstone generic name derived greek sarx flesh specific name honours wood holotype bmnh consists pelvis vertebra upper part femur preserved length femur centimetres second species sarcosaurus andrewsi named friedrich von huene based millimetres tibia bmnh described arthur smith woodward found near confusingly von huene publication named fossil magnosaurus woodwardi later made choice andrewsi valid huene also discussed warms partial skeleton also wilmcote specimens blue lias andrewsi reclassified megalosaurus andrewsi michael waldman probably erroneous assumption later study concluded two species indistinguishable except size authors consider identity unprovable comparable remains conclude species lack autapomorphies therefore nomina von huene referred partial skeleton collection warwick museum woodi identity unproven given informal name remained nomen nudum specimen likely one individual located stratiagraphic position holotypic specimen unfortunately available overlapping elements specimen holotype specimens preserve relatively complete femur however features anteromedially directed head relatively long fourth trochanter trochanteric shelf plesiomorphic thus indicate conspecifity clade membership noted however features
