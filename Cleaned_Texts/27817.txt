animals including siblings compete resources food territory potential mating partners animal sibling rivalry individuals compete parental care limited resources sometimes result siblicide killing sibling rivalry occurs many different forms siblings may compete resources prenatal andor postbirth environment degree rivalry varies ranging low level violence nonaggressive killing kin siblicide multiple offspring single brood potential sibling rivalry arises due competition food parental attention natural selection may favor behaviors allow individual offspring gain resources even behavior decreases siblings fitness competition food resources seen many bird species example bluefooted booby sula nebouxii siblings often exhibit aggression towards older chicks pecking younger chicks behavior increases food shortages indicating intense bird species siblings compete food manipulation parental behavior rather direct aggressive acts increased parental attention may mean food offspring favoring development begging behavior nestlings american robin turdus migratorius chicks compete food provided parents louder prominent cheeps vocalizations food given chicks exhibiting intense begging sibling rivalry may seem align kin selection theory predicts altruistic behaviors may evolve inclusive fitness benefits including relatives behaviors outweigh theoretically helping relatives would allow individuals spread genes related however species may show sibling rivalry fitness costs outweigh benefits helping relatives sibling relatedness influence degree rivalry canary nestlings selfish competitive nestlings less offspring beg food parents also competing future siblings decreasing fitness parents reducing ability invest future offspring known interbrood rivalry lead conflict siblicide consequence sibling rivalry occurrence may due variety factors food shortages limited parental care killing sibling could advantageous animal monopolizes resources elimination competitor moreover different types siblicide example obligate siblicide unconditional killing sibling species birds exhibit behavior larger chick commits act siblicide hand facultative siblicide refers situations death sibling always occur usually motivated environmental factors limited facultative siblicide exhibited previously discussed case bluefooted booby sula nebouxii species senior chicks may sometimes eliminate siblings food shortages shortages chicks exhibit higher levels pecking aggression decreases food levels brought back sufficient species parents evolved behaviors take advantage siblicide increase fitness example laughing gull exhibits asynchronous hatching patterns order cut parental losses species birds lay eggs different times produce average larger number fledglings per nest comparison birds synchronous staggered hatching creates chicks different stages growth older thus larger chicks kill younger siblings reducing brood size allowing parent concentrate efforts food scarce brood reduced sibling rivalry decreases fewer competitors benefitting surviving offspring also benefits parents minimizing unproductive parental investment offspring unlikely successful especially advantageous food shortages parents unable adequately feed offspring siblicide also noted mammalian species instance spotted hyenas crocuta crocuta known exhibit facultative siblicidal behavior intense sibling aggression begins minutes birth continues function sibling aggression establish maintain rank relationship litter mates aggression always lead sibling however periods intense feeding competition aggression escalate spotted hyena aggression demonstrates facultative siblicide triggered environmental factors intrauterine cannibalism see also cannibalism occurs siblings eat embryonic phase take form embryophagy siblings eat embryos oophagy siblings eat intrauterine cannibalism benefit embryos providing increased nutrition fire salamander

cannibalism form precocious teeth use feed intrauterine eggs siblings yolk supply used sand tiger sharks carcharias taurus first embryo reach certain size referred hatchling always consume smaller lessdeveloped siblings first embryo may different father eaten embryos form siblicide early development may indirectly involved male competition phenomenon embryonic cannibalism may play role sexual selection males compete postfertilization thus intrauterine cannibalism sharks may reflect sibling rivalry also male competition successful mating females example sexual selection forms sibling rivalry animals involve direct aggression death sibling extremely aggressive form rivalry however still results reduced sibling fitness fetal programming see also barkers hypothesis refers persisting

mediated andor encouraged parents especially bird species sibling rivalry also negative impact parent fitness future offspring due interbrood conflict may lead conflict conflict may force parents exert extra energy expense future broods parents may play passive role encouraging sibling rivalry common case food distribution parent birds distribute food favor individual offspring great tits parus major preferentially distribute food similar locations offspring compete prime spots closest feeding site get food leading unequal growth offspring behavior exemplified young interpreted optimal foraging strategy driven scramble alternatively parents may take active role mediating intensity rivalry siblings great tit parents choose location distribute food means controlling competition nestlings parents feed chicks one two feeding locations nest distance male female parents influences level competition nestlings words parents may decrease sibling competition varying locations within nest receive food interbrood conflict occurs current brood demands expense future broods sibling rivalry lead conflict different optimal levels parental investments whether viewed parental offspring perspective biological signalling theory suggests young communicate parents maximize amount food get therefore young need want food may solicit beg higher levels parents respond providing food based assumption honest begging chicks beg actually need food however young start soliciting higher levels incurs cost parents need expend energy searching food increased travel nest may attract predators well factors reduce energy resources parents future offspring example nestling intrabrood competition influence parents investment future
