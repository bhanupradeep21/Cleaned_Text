triosephosphate isomerase enzyme humans encoded gene gene encodes enzyme consisting two identical proteins catalyzes isomerization glyceraldehyde dihydroxyacetone phosphate dhap glycolysis gluconeogenesis mutations gene associated triosephosphate isomerase deficiency pseudogenes identified chromosomes alternative splicing results multiple transcript triose phosphate isomerase member alpha beta αβ class proteins homodimer subunit contains amino acids monomer contains full set catalytic residues enzyme active oligomeric therefore enzyme must dimer order achieve full function enzyme even though believed two active sites participate cooperativity subunit contains exterior alpha helices surrounding interior beta strands form conserved structural domain called closed alphabeta barrel αβ specifically tim barrel characteristic tim barrel domains presence enzymes active site lower loop regions created eight loops connect ctermini beta strands ntermini alpha helices tim barrel proteins also share structurally conserved phosphate binding motif phosphate group found substrate chain nonpolar amino acids pointing inward beta strands contribute hydrophobic core structure alpha helices amphipathic outer watercontacting surfaces polar inner surfaces largely hydrophobic tpi catalyzes transfer hydrogen atom carbon carbon intramolecular oxidationreduction reaction isomerization ketose aldose proceeds cisenediolate intermediate isomerization proceeds without cofactors enzyme confers rate enhancement relative nonenzymatic reaction involving chemical base acetate addition role

characterized shortage red blood cells anemia movement problems increased susceptibility infection muscle weakness affect breathing heart function anemia condition begins infancy since anemia results premature breakdown red blood cells hemolysis known hemolytic anemia shortage red blood cells carry oxygen throughout body leads extreme tiredness fatigue pale skin pallor shortness breath red cells broken iron molecule called bilirubin released individuals triosephosphate isomerase deficiency excess substances circulating blood excess bilirubin blood causes jaundice yellowing skin whites eyes movement problems typically become apparent age people triosephosphate isomerase deficiency movement problems caused impairment motor neurons specialized nerve cells brain spinal cord control muscle movement impairment leads muscle weakness wasting atrophy causes movement problems typical triosephosphate isomerase deficiency including involuntary muscle tensing dystonia tremors weak muscle tone hypotonia affected individuals may also develop seizures weakness muscles heart condition known cardiomyopathy muscle separates abdomen chest cavity diaphragm also occur triosephosphate isomerase deficiency diaphragm weakness cause breathing problems ultimately leads respiratory failure individuals triosephosphate isomerase deficiency increased risk developing infections poorly functioning white blood cells immune system cells normally recognize attack foreign invaders viruses bacteria prevent infection common infections people triosephosphate isomerase deficiency bacterial infections

deficiency commonly caused mutations although mutations isoforms identified common marker tpi deficiency increased accumulation dhap erythrocyte extracts defective enzyme longer ability catalyze isomerization gap point mutation affect catalysis rate rather affects assembly enzyme recent discoveries alzheimers disease research indicated amyloid beta peptideinduced nitrooxidative damage
