sexual mimicry occurs one sex mimics opposite sex behavior appearance chemical signalling commonly seen within invertebrate species although sexual mimicry also seen among vertebrates spotted hyenas sexual mimicry commonly used mating strategy gain access mate defense mechanism avoid dominant individuals survival strategy also physical characteristic establishes individuals place society sexual mimicry employed differently across species part strategy survival reproduction examples intraspecific sexual mimicry animals include spotted hyena certain types fish passerine birds species insect interspecific sexual mimicry also occur plant species especially orchids plants employing sexual mimicry flowers mimic mating signals pollinator insects insects attracted pollinate flowers pseudocopulations sexual behaviors performed flower sexual mimicry play role development species social system perhaps extreme example seen spotted hyena crocuta crocuta female hyenas ages possess pseudomasculinized genitalia including pseudopenis formed clitoris false scrotum formed labia characteristics likely initially evolved reduce rates intrasex aggression received cub juvenile females adult females however trait evolved beyond initial use become highly relevant spotted hyena communication subordinate hyenas greet dominant individuals erecting penis pseudopenis allowing dominant individual lick likely initially evolved means discerning sex subordinate individual pseudopenis less closely resembles genuine penis erect tasting area could allow detection sex specific hormone concentrations however behaviour continues engaged adult parous females longer convincingly resemble males visually olifactorily spotted hyenas way males mate females females full cooperation females peniform clitoris increase males status gave access dominant females clan nondominant females observed copulating often lowerranking costly female hyenas give birth long peniform clitoris umbilical cord cm long journey uterus clitoris end cm umbilical cord often breaks cub emerges leading death anoxia many young journey harmful cubs also mother tissue clitoris sometimes rip open giving birth first time fatal sexual mimicry also used mateguarding strategy species mateguarding process member species prevents another member species mating partner mateguarding seen cotesia rubecula parasitic wasp family braconidae whose mating system polygynous males attracted females pheromones induce females mate vibrations female responds assuming specific position male copulated female sees another male trying court often adopt female receptive position postcopulatory female mimicry male offers advantage acting mateguarding mechanism second male arrives soon enough female copulates first male second male may able induce second copulation compete first one however first male copulated mimics female distracts second male long enough female becomes sneaky copulation strategy used many aquatic organisms portray sexual mimicry several studies found small male fish look behave like female species order gain access female territory copulate fish family blenniidae female salaria pavo show specific colour pattern movement want approach male copulate male guards territory female lays eggs parental male protects territory eggs hatch second type males sneaker males parasitic resembles female bleniid fish small size colour movement patterns allows intrude nest guarded parental males sneaker males approach nests colour patterns movements females hold cases sneaker males seen female already inside nest although sometimes sneaker fish enters nest alongside female species fish releases sperm female releases eggs making possible sneaker fish fertilize egg even female present sepiina family giant cuttlefish sepia apama males large able guard females nest males small resemble females order sneak copulations giant cuttlefish male courts female transfers sperm pouch females beak process female displays body pattern black splotches white background eggs laid male guards nest possible suitors opponents second female sometimes seen malefemale interaction close proximity couple femalelooking cuttlefish black blotches real female male leaves fight males individual approaches female copulates usually success however absence rivals mimicking female males display phenotype mature similar phenomenon sneaker fish males observed darkedged splitfin girardinichthys multiradiatus juveniles resemble pregnant females species dark spot near vent case however mimicking males capability resemble females become morphologically mature male throughout adult life dark spot allows femalelooking males escape aggression dominant males well reducing chance female nearby flee due persisting courting males mature males attack subordinate fish subordinate fish decides initiate fights gives advantage mature male expecting dark spot also permits access subordinate males females characteristic advantageous females eggs fertilized fiveday fertilizing sexual mimicry avoid aggression also seen birds bird species males femalelike plumage colour second year life sy males sy males sexually mature able breed morphology differs greatly older second year asy males various studies looked delayed plumage maturation dpm found dpm sy males reduces aggression asy female mimicry birds first found european pied flycatcher ficedula hypoleuca dullcoloured male area mature males reduce aggressiveness behave intruder female dull plumage seen mostly younger males likely due born later previous spring resemblance females benefit young males trying occupy territory many males already present young males gain information access territory would accessible big cost looking like male comes defending territory attracting mate females show aggression dullcoloured males making harder however dpm benefits mentioned reduces aggression older well femalelooking birds able get access territories mates food may available otherwise another benefit dpm provides sy birds longer lifespan compete males mortality rate lower advantage however benefits individuals species longer potential lifespan therefore dpm would benefit shortlived known breeding threshold hypothesis states sy males delay breeding large mortality difference sy males attempt breed ones studies addressed dpm type sexual done deception male asy birds able tell females sy males apart however muheter et al found territorial males perceive dullcoloured males males show less aggression dullcoloured plumage promotes low competitive ability referred honest signalling sexual another example sexual mimicry occurs broadleys flat lizard platysaurus broadleyi males mimic females flat lizard males tend territorial aggressive towards males therefore beneficial males mimic females order avoid aggressive encounters move freely males territory looking mates two types males population shemales mimic females hemales look like males shemales visually fool hemales believing female due female morphology however shemales fool hemales scent hemales detect difference therefore successful shemales avoid close contact males thereby reducing chances detection chemical lekking shorebird species ruff philomachus pugnax three distinct male morphs independent males primary darkfeathered morph establishes aggressively defends lekking territory satellite males lightfeathered morph defend territory seeks prominent independent males display alongside faeder males lack typical male breeding plumage instead closely resembling females possess smaller body size intermediate typical male female consistently occupy single territory move freely different independent male territories perhaps owing femalelike plumage
