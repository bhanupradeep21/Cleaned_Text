theory developed many different fields including education health communications marketing economics although model differs meaning implications field general idea expectations well values beliefs affect subsequent behavior john william atkinson developed theory effort understand achievement motivation jacquelynne eccles expanded research field according theory students achievement achievement related choices proximally determined two expectancies success subjective task values expectancies refer confident individual ability succeed task whereas task values refer important useful enjoyable individual perceives task work suggests expectancies values interact predict important outcomes engagement continuing interest academic achievement factors including demographic characteristics stereotypes prior experiences perceptions others beliefs behaviors affect achievement related outcomes indirectly expectancies values model widely applied used research field education expectancies specific beliefs individuals regarding success certain tasks carry shortterm future longterm individuals expectancies related behaviors well choices make expectancies related abilitybeliefs selfconcept selfefficacy selfconcept domain specific concept involves ones beliefs abilities based past experiences specific selfefficacy belief individual ability successfully engage future specific task series related tasks according eccles subjective task value thought motivation allows individual answer question want activity subjective task values broken four attainment value importance identity self intrinsic value enjoyment interest utility value usefulness relevance cost loss time overlyhigh effort demands loss valued alternatives negative psychological experiences stress traditionally attainment value intrinsic value highly correlated whats two constructs tend related intrinsic motivation interest task alternatively utility value intrinsic extrinsic related intrinsic extrinsic outcomes course performance research shows utility value timedependent characteristics cost relatively neglected empirical however construct received attention feather combined subjective task values universal human suggested former one type general human motives help direct researchers found expectancies values distinguished separate types motivation early years similarly types value eg attainment vs utility distinguished within academic domain early fifth generally speaking eccles implicate wide array different factors determine individuals expectancies values including experts agree student motivation tends decline throughout time longitudinal research confirmed general trend motivational decline also demonstrated motivation domain researchers also demonstrated gender differences motivation decline particularly steep math achievement less reading sports domains among boys researchers offer two general explanations declines first students conceptualizations different domains become complex differentiate subdomains results appearance meanlevel decrease fact children young years old demonstrated differentiate academic second focus environment changes age students reach higher grades focus shifts learning achievement fact large body research exists showing shifts learning performance educational focus detrimental student theory constructs applied intervention programs strive change motivational beliefs interventions able increase decrease interventions target motivation also ultimately increase general student achievement help close traditionally problematic achievement example value focused interventions developed help teachers design curriculum ways allow students see connections material learn classroom intervention able boost students performance interest particularly students low initial expectancy according theory intervention effective increases students interest theory originally created order explain predict
