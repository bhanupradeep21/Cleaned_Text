laypersons interested question implications human social behavior could theoretically offer biological explanations human sexual behavior however science weak due relatively small number studies several small studies found fertile women appear attractive men women infertile portions menstrual cycle women using hormonal also suggested womans voice may become attractive men two small studies monogamous human couples found women initiated sex significantly frequently fertile maleinitiated sex occurred constant rate without regard womans phase menstrual may womans awareness mens courtship

phases except menstruation contrary studies found female sexual desire extrapair copulations epcs increase midfollicular ovulatory phases highly fertile findings differences womaninitiated versus maninitiated sex likely caused womans subconscious awareness ovulation cycle hormonal changes causing feel increased sexual desire contrasting mans inability detect ovulation hiddencitation needed researchers announced discovery human semen hormones usually found ovulating women theorized follicle stimulating hormone luteinising hormone estradiol may encourage ovulation women exposed semen

authors theorized concealed ovulation menstruation key factors development symbolic culture early human evolutionary psychologists advanced number different possible explanations concealed posit lack signaling species trait retained evolutionary ancestors something existed previously later disappeared signaling supposed existed lost could merely due reduced adaptive importance lessened due direct adaptive advantages concealment ovulation yet another possibility regarding humans specifically highly specific signaling ovulation absent human female anatomy evolved mimic permanent signaling paternal investment hypothesis strongly supported many evolutionary several hypotheses regarding human evolution integrate idea women increasingly required supplemental paternal investment offspring shared reliance idea across several hypotheses concerning human evolution increases significance terms specific phenomenon hypothesis suggests women concealed ovulation obtain mens aid rearing offspring summarizes hypothesis outlined alexander noonans paper women longer signaled time ovulation men would unable detect exact period fecund led change mens mating strategy rather mating multiple women hope least fecund period men instead chose mate particular woman repeatedly throughout menstrual cycle mating would successful resulting conception occurred ovulation thus frequent matings necessitated effects concealed ovulation would evolutionarily successful similar hypothesis proposed lovejoy argued concealed ovulation reduced canines bipedalism evolved reproductive strategy males provisioned food resources paired female dependent continuous female sexual receptivity suggests human sexuality solely defined reproduction large part revolves around conjugal love communication partners copulations partners woman pregnant infertile period menstrual cycle achieve conception strengthen bond partners therefore increased frequency copulations due concealed ovulation thought played role fostering pair bonds pair bond would advantageous reproductive fitness partners throughout period pregnancy lactation rearing offspring pregnancy lactation caring postlactation offspring require vast amounts energy time part woman must first consume food provide food offspring ability forage reduced throughout supplemental male investment mother offspring advantageous parties man

mother shared parental investment man woman would increase offsprings chances survival thereby increasing reproductive fitness way natural selection would favor establishment pair bonds humans extent concealed ovulation strengthened pair bonding selective pressure would favor concealed ovulation well another recent hypothesis concealed ovulation adaptation response promiscuous mating system similar closest evolutionary relatives bonobos chimpanzees theory concealed ovulation evolved women lessen paternity certainty would lessen chances infanticide father less likely kill offspring might potentially increase number men motivated assist caring offspring partible paternity supported fact mammals concealed ovulation dolphins gray langurs promiscuous ape species multimale communities humans promiscuous argued evidence coolidge effect showing man seem naturally geared towards sexual mateguarding behavior preventing males access sexual partner supports conclusion sexual monogamy though perhaps social monogamy andor pair bonding rare early modern hypothesis suggests adaptive advantage women hidden estrus would reduction possibility infanticide men would unable reliably identify kill rivals hypothesis supported recent studies wild hanuman langurs documenting concealed ovulation frequent matings males outside fertile ovulatory heistermann et al hypothesize concealed ovulation used women confuse paternity thus reduce infanticide primates explains ovulation always concealed women men determine paternity thus decide whether kill womans child probabilistically based previous mating frequency would unable escape possibility child might even aware promiscuous matings womans part reviews hypothesis symons hill hunting men exchanged meat sex women women continuously mimicked estrus may benefited meat occurred enough frequency definite period estrus would lost sexual signaling specific ovulation would disappeared presents idea gradual diminution midcycle estrus concomitant continuous sexual receptivity human women facilitated orderly social relationships throughout menstrual cycle eliminating periodic intensification aggressiveness competition extended

bonobo theory concealed ovulation evolved frequently rejected schröder outlines two objections hypothesis natural selection would need work level individual difficult prove selection acts individuals reproductive success would thus favor greater reproductive success social integration expense reproductive success however since written group selection models seen see group selection reciprocal

hypothesis regarding concealed ovulation even evolutionary benefits accrue child woman clandestine partner regular sexual partner presents importance bipedalism mechanics necessity ovulation signaling open savannah environment inhabited early humans brought greater danger predators would caused humans live denser groups scenario longdistance sexual signaling provided female genital swellings would
