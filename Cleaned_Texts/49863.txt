garbage model also known garbage process garbage theory describes chaotic reality organizational decision making organized model originated seminal paper garbage model organizational choice written michael cohen james g march johan p organized anarchies organizations decision situations also known choice opportunities characterized problematic preferences unclear technology fluid organizations

decision making garbage model symbolizes choiceopportunitydecisionsituation example meeting ideas discussed decided garbage participants chaotically dumping problems solutions generated garbage terms significance best understood considering manner items trash organized messy chaotic mix model portrays problems solutions participantsdecisionmakers three independent streams generated separately flow

generated mix garbage single also depend speed garbage collected removed scene example long problems solutions andor participants move choice opportunities depending long current choice opportunity remains anarchic view decision making contrasts traditional decision theory organized anarchies characterized sense chaos dynamism problems solutions loosely coupled proposed solutions change bargaining participants involved get chance fully participate limitations time energy many things happen competing amongst confusion participants try make sense role behavioral theory organized anarchy views organizations andor decisionsituationschoiceopportunities generally characterized three properties problematic preferences unclear technology fluid participation detailed properties organized anarchy characteristic organization part part organization clear preference operates basis variety inconsistent illdefined preferences goals organization described accurately loose collection ideas rather coherent structure organizations discover preferences actions actions taken basis unclear problems matter organizations processes understood organizations members organization operates based trial error procedures learning accidents past experiences pragmatic inventions clear consequences proposed solutions solve problems solutions lack participants vary much time effort commit different domains participant involvement also varies depending time consequently boundaries organization continuously uncertain changing audiences decision makers type choice change suddenly organizations viewed vehicles solving problems structures conflict resolved bargaining however organizations also provide procedures participants gain understanding organizations especially organized anarchies may difficulty creating collective platform situations ambiguity decision making moves away ideas reality causality intentionality thoughts meaning therefore decisions become seen vehicles constructing meaningful interpretations fundamentally confusing worlds instead outcomes produced comprehensible complexity decision situations increase closely resemble reality become meaning generators instead consequence generators organized anarchies need structures processes symbolically reinforce espoused values provide opportunities individuals assert confirm status allow people understand many competing claims attention respond require means irrelevant problems participants encouraged seek alternative ways expressing decisionmakers jobs also able keep people busy occasionally entertain give variety experiences keep streets provide pretexts storytelling allow socializing weicks social psychology organizing p birnbaum robert latent organizational functions academic senate senates work go away journal higher education vol p hence understand organized anarchies meaning makers need within organizations feel like reasons identities present organization address many types concerns meetings issues may may relevant existing topic within perspective organization collection choices seeking problems issues feelings seeking decision situations raised solutions seeking issues may able solve decision makers seeking whereas theory organized anarchy provided larger view describe organizations decision situations function garbage model focuses decisions get made within organized model details elements involved decisionmaking process outcomes generated whowhat able access interaction garbage model views decisions outcomes four independent streams detailed within organizations prior garbage model decision process imagined differently visually displayed based references foundational literature figures problems arise people inside outside organization many different reasons consuming attention examples may include family career distribution status money even current events problems need real actually important perceived decision solutions individuals collectives product examples may include ideas bills programs operating none solutions need pertain existing problem instead participants use solutions generated actively seek problems solutions may able participants demands time actively arrive leave decisionmaking process may also different preferences different choice opportunities give organizations chances act ways called decisions opportunities occur regularly organizations able determine moments choice examples may include signing contracts hiring firing employees spending money assigning first three streams problems solutions participants flow fourth stream choice opportunities mix based chance timing happens first three streams problems solutions participants meet stream choice opportunity example
