specifically procedure dermabrasion practiced many years advent lasers involves controlled deeper abrasion wearing away upper mid layers skin variety strong abrasive devices including wire brush diamond wheel fraise sterilized sandpaper salt crystals mechanical means dermabrasion procedures surgical invasive procedures typically require local anaesthetic often performed surgical suites professional medical centers since procedure typically remove top deeper layers epidermis extend reticular dermis always minor skin bleeding procedure carries risks scarring skin discoloration infections facial herpes virus cold sore reactivation aggressive dermabrasion cases often tremendous skin bleeding spray procedure controlled pressure afterward skin normally red rawlooking depending level skin removal dermabrasion takes average days skin fully heal reepithelialize often procedure performed deeper acne scarring deep surgical scars dermabrasion currently rarely practiced doctors trained still perform surgery dermabrasion largely replaced technologies including lasers erbiumyag laser laser technologies carry advantage little bleeding often less operator dependent dermabrasion purpose surgical dermabrasion help diminish appearance deeper scars skin imperfections often goal smooth skin process remove small scars acne uneven skin tone scars birthmarks sun damage tattoos age

small handheld skincare tool instead expensive equipment used salon method microdermabrasion rose popularity early widely available today often called microderm short microdermabrasion procedure help

typically regenerates approximately intervals skin improvement microdermabrasion temporary needs repeated average intervals two four weeks continued improvement multiple treatments combination sunscreen sun avoidance skin care creams yield best results dermabrasion generally used refer true surgical procedure aggressively abrades away top mid layers skin term microdermabrasion generally refers nonsurgical procedure abrades less deeply dermabrasion although mechanism two procedures similar difference depth abrasion results different recovery times dermabrasion recovery time may take much several weeks several months whereas microdermabrasion recovery time may little one two microdermabrasion skin much sensitive sun exposure best keep sun wear sunscreen times procedurecitation
