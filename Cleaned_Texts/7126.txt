also used medicinally mexico hemostatic throat lung tonic purported antiinflammatory manner puffball splits open dehisces described american mycologist william henry long thick leathery peridium mature puffball remains unopened several months without splitting several alternating cycles wetting drying fissures develop across top fissures usually radiate common center near top fruit body finally produce irregular starlike teeth time entire upper half puffball open exposed dry weather condition spores blown wind widely distributed every rainy spell puffball promptly closes open dry weather returns alternate opening closing peridium split finally expanded flat shape even curls backward puffball outer layer peridium comprises cells arranged wet adsorb water expand thus closing top puffball upon drying outer cells lose water gradually shrink thus producing unequal tension outer inner cells peridium tension causes irregular starlike pieces peridium gradually separate curve
