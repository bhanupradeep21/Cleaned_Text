intramuscular injection often abbreviated im injection substance muscle medicine one several methods parenteral administration medications intramuscular injection may preferred muscles larger numerous blood vessels subcutaneous tissue leading faster absorption subcutaneous intradermal injections medication administered via intramuscular injection subject firstpass metabolism effect affects oral medications common sites intramuscular injections include deltoid muscle upper arm gluteal muscle buttock infants vastus lateralis muscle thigh commonly used injection site must cleaned administering injection injection administered fast darting motion decrease discomfort individual volume injected muscle usually limited milliliters depending injection site site signs infection muscle atrophy chosen intramuscular injections used people myopathies trouble clotting intramuscular injections commonly result pain redness swelling inflammation around injection site side effects generally mild last days rarely nerves blood vessels around injection site damaged resulting severe pain paralysis proper technique followed intramuscular injections result localized infections abscesses gangrene historically aspiration pulling back syringe injection recommended prevent inadvertent administration vein longer recommended injection sites countries intramuscular injection commonly used medication administration medication administered muscle generally quickly absorbed bloodstream avoids first pass metabolism occurs oral medication may considered bioavailable must still absorbed muscle occurs intramuscular injection less invasive intravenous injection also generally takes less time site injection muscle versus vein much larger medications administered muscle may also administered depot injections provide slow continuous release medicine longer period certain substances including ketamine may injected intramuscularly recreational disadvantages intramuscular administration include skill technique required pain injection anxiety fear especially children difficulty selfadministration limits use outpatient vaccines especially inactivated vaccines commonly administered via intramuscular however estimated every vaccine injected intramuscularly injections given administer drugs include medications antibiotics immunoglobulin hormones testosterone case severe allergic reaction anaphylaxis person may use epinephrine autoinjector selfadminister epinephrine intramuscular injection used administer many types medications specific contraindications depend large part medication injections medications necessarily invasive forms administration mouth topical require training perform appropriately without complications arise regardless medication administered reason unless desired differences rate absorption time onset pharmacokinetic parameters specific situation less invasive form drug administration usually mouth intramuscular injections generally avoided people low platelet count clotting problems prevent harm due potential damage blood vessels injection also recommended people hypovolemic shock myopathy muscle atrophy conditions may alter absorption damage muscle caused intramuscular injections may interfere accuracy certain cardiac tests people suspected myocardial infarction reason methods administration preferred people active myocardial infarction decrease circulation may result slower absorption im specific sites administration may also contraindicated desired injection site infection swelling within specific site administration injection given directly irritation redness birthmarks moles areas scar injection necessitates piercing skin risk infection bacteria organisms present environment skin injection risk minimized using proper aseptic technique preparing injection sanitizing injection site intramuscular injections may also cause abscess gangrene injection site depending specific medication amount administered also risk nerve vascular injury nerve blood vessel inadvertently hit injection singleuse sterilized equipment used risk transmission infectious disease users practitioner inadvertently injures used needle termed needlestick injections deltoid site arm result unintentional damage radial axillary nerves rare cases performed properly injection may result shoulder frequent complications deltoid injection include pain redness inflammation around injection site almost always mild last days dorsogluteal site injection associated higher risk skin tissue trauma muscle fibrosis contracture hematoma nerve palsy paralysis infections abscesses furthermore injection gluteal muscle poses risk damage sciatic nerve may cause shooting pain sensation burning sciatic nerve damage also affect persons ability move foot affected side parts body controlled nerve damage sciatic nerve prevented using ventrogluteal site instead selecting appropriate size length needle intramuscular injection administered multiple different muscles body common sites intramuscular injection include deltoid dorsogluteal rectus femoris vastus lateralis ventrogluteal sites bruised tender red swollen inflamed scarred generally specific medication amount administered influence decision specific muscle chosen injection injection site first cleaned using antimicrobial allowed dry injection performed quick darting motion perpendicular skin angle degrees practitioner stabilize needle one hand using hand depress plunger slowly inject medication rapid injection causes discomfort needle withdrawn angle inserted gentle pressure may applied gauze bleeding pressure gentle massage muscle following injection may reduce risk aspirating blood rule injecting blood vessel recommended us cdc public health agency canada norway institute public health injection sites contain large blood vessels aspiration results greater evidence aspiration useful increase safety intramuscular injections injecting site

medication tracked subcutaneous tissue sealing medication muscle minimizing irritation medication using ztrack technique skin pulled laterally away injection site injection medication injected needle withdrawn skin released method used overlying tissue deltoid muscle outer portion upper arm used injections small volume usually equal less ml includes intramuscular recommended use deltoid repeated injections due small area makes difficult space injections deltoid site located locating lower edge acromion process injecting area forms upside triangle base acromion process midpoint line injection deltoid muscle commonly administered using long needle may use long needle younger people frail elderly ventrogluteal site hip used injections require larger volume administered greater ml medications

hand ventrogluteal site less painful injection sites deltoid vastus lateralis site used infants less months old people unable walk loss muscular site located dividing front thigh thirds vertically horizontally form nine squares injection administered outer middle site also usual site administration epinephrine autoinjectors used outer thigh corresponding location vastus lateralis dorsogluteal site buttock site routinely used due location near major blood vessels nerves well inconsistent depth adipose many injections site penetrate deep enough skin correctly administered current evidencebased practice recommends using site many healthcare providers still use site often due lack knowledge alternative sites site located dividing buttock four using cross shape administering injection upper outer quadrant intramuscular injection site aspiration recommended syringe injection due higher likelihood accidental intravenous administration however aspiration recommended centers disease control prevention considers outdated intramuscular populations require different injection site needle length technique young weak elderly patients normallength needle may long inject properly patients shorter needle indicated avoid injecting also recommended consider using anterolateral thigh injection site infants one year help infants children cooperate injection administration advisory committee immunization practices united states recommends using distractions giving something sweet rocking baby side side people overweight needle may used ensure injection given subcutaneous layer skin needle may used people weigh kilograms lb case skin need pinched injecting appropriate length needle injections muscular tissue may taken place early year ad beginning late
