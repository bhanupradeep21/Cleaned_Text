autoinflammatory diseases aids group rare disorders caused dysfunction innate immune system characterized periodic chronic systemic inflammation usually without involvement adaptive immunity autoinflammatory diseases separate class autoimmune diseases characterized immune system malfunction may cause similar symptoms rash swelling fatigue cardinal cause mechanism diseases different key difference malfunction innate immune system aids autoimmune diseases malfunction adaptive immune boundaries autoinflammation overactivity innate immunity autoimmunity overactivity adaptive immunity immunodeficiency decreased activity innate adaptive immunity often fluid clinical phenotypes associated processes driven cell type affected particular mutation signal excessive activation neutrophils
