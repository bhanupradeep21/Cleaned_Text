hampshire device made however rang order wake french inventor antoine redier first patent adjustable mechanical alarm clock alarm clocks like almost consumer goods united states ceased production spring factories made converted war work world war ii one first consumer items resume manufacture civilian use november time critical shortage alarm clocks developed due older clocks wearing breaking workers late missed completely scheduled shifts jobs critical war pooling arrangement overseen office price administration several clock companies allowed start producing new clocks continuations prewar designs new designs thus becoming among first postwar consumer goods made war even price emergency clocks however still strictly regulated office price first radio alarm clock invented james f reynolds another design also invented paul l schroth clock radio alarm clock radio receiver integrated one clock may turn radio designated time wake user usually includes buzzer alarm typically clock radios placed bedside stand models offer dual alarm awakening different times snooze usually large button top silences alarm sets resume sounding minutes clock radios also sleep timer turns radio set amount time usually around one hour useful people like fall asleep listening radio newer clock radios available music sources ipod iphone andor audio cd alarm triggered play set radio station music selected music source awaken sleeper models come dock ipodiphone also charges device docked play amfm radio ipodiphone cd like typical music player well without triggered alarm function popular models offer nature sounds like rain forest wind sea waterfall etc place buzzer clock radios powered ac power wall socket event power interruption older electronic digital models used reset time midnight lose alarm settings would cause failure trigger alarm even power restored home alone lost new york many newer clock radios feature battery backup maintain time alarm settings advanced radio clocks confused clocks amfm radios feature sets time automatically using signals atomic clocksynced time signal radio stations wwv making clock accurate immune time reset due power interruptions alarm clock software programs developed personal computers webbased alarm clocks may allow virtually unlimited number alarm times ie personal information manager personalized however unlike mobile phone alarms limitations work computer shut sleep many modern mobile phones feature builtin alarm clocks need phone switched alarm ring mobile phones feature ability user set alarms ringtone cases music downloaded phone chosen play scientific studies sleep shown sleep stage awakening important factor amplifying sleep inertia alarm clocks involving sleep stage monitoring appeared market alarm clocks use sensing technologies eeg electrodes accelerometers wake people dawn simulators another technology meant mediate sleepers become accustomed sound alarm clock used period time making less due progressive alarm clocks complex waking procedure deter adaptation due body needing adapt stimuli simple sound deaf hard hearing often unable perceive auditory alarms asleep may use specialized alarms including alarms flashing lights instead addition noise alarms connect vibrating devices small ones inserted pillows larger ones placed bedposts shake bed also time switches used turn anything awaken sleeper therefore used alarms lights bells radio tv sets easily elaborate devices also used machines automatically prepare tea coffee sound produced drink ready sleeper awakes find freshly brewed drink
