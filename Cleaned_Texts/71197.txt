ploidy ˈplɔɪdi number complete sets chromosomes cell hence number possible alleles autosomal pseudoautosomal genes sets chromosomes refer number maternal paternal chromosome copies respectively homologous chromosome pair chromosomes naturally exist somatic cells tissues individual organisms described according number sets chromosomes present ploidy level monoploid set diploid sets triploid sets tetraploid sets pentaploid sets hexaploid sets sets etc generic term polyploid often used describe cells three sets virtually sexually reproducing organisms made somatic cells diploid greater ploidy level may vary widely different organisms different tissues within organism different stages organisms life cycle half known plant genera contain polyploid species twothirds grasses many animals uniformly diploid though polyploidy common invertebrates reptiles amphibians species ploidy varies individuals species social insects others entire tissues organ systems may polyploid despite rest body diploid mammalian liver many organisms especially plants fungi changes ploidy level generations major drivers speciation mammals birds ploidy changes typically however evidence polyploidy organisms considered diploid suggesting polyploidy contributed evolutionary diversification plants animals successive rounds polyploidization humans diploid organisms normally carrying two complete sets chromosomes somatic cells one copy paternal maternal chromosomes respectively homologous pairs chromosomes humans normally results two homologous pairs within homologous pairs providing full complement chromosomes total number individual chromosomes counting complete sets called chromosome number chromosome complement number chromosomes found single complete set chromosomes called monoploid number x haploid number n refers total number chromosomes found gamete sperm egg cell produced meiosis preparation sexual reproduction normal conditions haploid number exactly half total

diploid chromosome complement split half form haploid gametes fusion male female gamete containing set chromosomes fertilization resulting zygote full complement chromosomes sets chromosomes euploidy aneuploidy describe number chromosomes exact multiple number chromosomes normal gamete number respectively example person turner syndrome may missing one sex chromosome x resulting karyotype instead usual type aneuploidy cells person may said aneuploid diploid chromosome complement term ploidy backformation haploidy diploidy ploid combination ancient greek πλόος plóos fold ειδής eidḗs εἶδος eîdos form likenessa principal meaning greek word haplóos ἁ ha one διπλόος diplóos means duplex twofold diploid therefore means duplexshaped compare humanoid humanshaped polish botanist eduard strasburger coined terms haploid diploid authors suggest strasburger based terms august weismanns conception id germ hence haploid diploid two terms brought english language german william henry langs translation textbook strasburger needed term haploid used two distinct related definitions generic sense haploid refers number sets chromosomes normally found two gametes necessarily combine sexual reproduction form single zygote somatic cells generated healthy gametes always possess exactly half number sets chromosomes found somatic cells therefore haploid sense refers exactly half number sets chromosomes found somatic cell definition organism whose gametic cells contain single copy chromosome one set chromosomes may considered haploid somatic cells containing two copies chromosome two sets chromosomes diploid scheme diploid somatic cells haploid gametes widely used animal kingdom simplest illustrate diagrams genetics concepts definition also allows haploid gametes one set chromosomes given gametes definition haploid regardless actual number sets chromosomes contain organism whose somatic cells tetraploid four sets chromosomes example produce gametes meiosis contain two sets chromosomes gametes might still called haploid even though numerically diploidcitation needed alternative usage defines haploid single copy chromosome one one set case nucleus eukaryotic cell said haploid single set chromosomes one part pair extension cell may called haploid nucleus one set chromosomes organism may called haploid body cells somatic cells one set chromosomes per cell definition haploid therefore would used refer gametes produced tetraploid organism example since gametes numerically diploid term monoploid often used less ambiguous way describe single set chromosomes second definition haploid monoploid identical used interchangeablycitation needed gametes sperm ova haploid cells haploid gametes produced organisms combine form zygote n pairs chromosomes ie chromosomes total chromosomes pair one comes sperm one egg said homologous cells organisms pairs homologous chromosomes called diploid example animals diploid produce haploid gametes meiosis sex cell precursors number chromosomes halved randomly choosing one member pair chromosomes resulting haploid gametes homologous chromosomes usually differ genetically gametes usually differ genetically one plants many fungi algae switch
