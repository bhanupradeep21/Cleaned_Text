arterial spin labeling asl also known arterial spin tagging magnetic resonance imaging technique used quantify cerebral blood perfusion labelling blood water flows throughout brain asl specifically refers magnetic labeling arterial blood imaging slab without need gadolinium number asl schemes possible simplest flow alternating inversion recovery fair requires two acquisitions identical parameters exception outofslice saturation difference two images theoretically inflowing spins may considered perfusion asl technique developed alan p koretsky donald williams john detre john leigh jr arterial spin labeling utilizes water molecules circulating brain using radiofrequency pulse tracks blood water circulates throughout brain period time microseconds enough allow blood circulate brain label image captured control image also acquired labeling blood water subtraction technique gives measurement perfusion order increase snr collections control label images averaged also specifications mri increase snr like amount head coils mri stronger field strength standard satisfactory order properly scale perfusion values cerebral blood flow units cbf min separate proton density map parameters longer tr fully relax blood spins recommended acquired well alternatively average control image used generate cbf case phillips pcasl readouts usually background suppression also applied increase snr due different variations implementations recommended large multiscanner study design protocol minimizing variety readout methods used scanner one study shown suggests although voxel differences different readout methods used average gray matter cbf still comparable differences snr apparent voxel compared collectively examples continuous arterial spin labeling casl blood water inverted flows brain one plane casl characterized one single long pulse around seconds may disadvantageous certain scanners designed maintain radiofrequency pulse long therefore would require adjustments rf amplifier rectified pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling pcasl single long pulse replaced multiple thousand millisecond pulses leads higher labelling efficiency pcasl preferred implementation different readout modules pcasl depending scanner used pcasl usually implemented scanners pcasl stack spirals implemented ge scanners pulse arterial spin labeling pasl blood water inverted passes
