accuracy lack certainty packet loss research group set developing hardware generate better quality hardware subsequent iterations introduced two fundamental innovations hardware timestamping hardware accounting packet loss conventionally packet cell given timestamp host machines kernel ie software kernel driver notified new packet arrived approach results poor quality timestamps several reasons among considerable latency jitter packet arriving network interface receipt kernel driver uncertainty caused interrupt coalescing wherein one host interrupt signifies arrival several packets poor quality limits research usefully done network performance related fields solve dag generates timestamps hardware close network interface possible obviate latency jitter problems caused interrupt coalescing hardware capable much greater accuracy precision softwaregenerated timestamps precision comes freedom custom hardware assign many bits timestamp required accuracy assured reference external time source gps accurate contrast accuracy ntp kernel clocks corrected internet order milliseconds times less accurate depending conditions involved dag produces bit timestamps fixedpoint format fractional bits giving potential precision displaystyle seconds picoseconds actual precision offered varies particular model dag oldest giving fractional bits nanoseconds better precisions offered dags higher bandwidth timestamp derived freerunning clock provided crystal oscillator accuracy crystals drift temperature age dags solution use direct digital synthesis using hz pulsepersecond output
