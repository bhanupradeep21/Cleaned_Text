accommodation process vertebrate eye changes optical power maintain clear image focus object distance varies distances vary individuals far maximum distance eye clear image object seen near minimum distance clear image accommodation usually acts like reflex including part accommodationconvergence reflex also consciously controlled main ways animals may change focus changing shape lens changing position lens relative retina changing axial length eyeball changing shape cornea focusing light scattered objects three dimensional environment two dimensional collection individual bright points light requires light bent get good image points light defined area requires precise systematic bending light called refraction real image formed millions points light animals see using retinas even systematic curvature parts cornea lens produces systematic bending light onto retina due nature optics focused image retina always inverted relative object different animals live different environments different refractive indexes involving water air often eyes therefor required bend light different amounts leading different mechanisms focus used different environments aircornea interface involves larger difference refractive index hydrated structures within eye result animals living air bending light achieved aircornea interface lens involved finer focus image generally mammals birds reptiles living air vary eyes optical power subtly precisely changing shape elastic lens using ciliary body small difference refractive index water hydrated cornea means fish amphibians need bend light using internal structures eye therefore eyes evolved water mechanism involving changing distance rigid rounder refractive lens retina using less uniform muscles rather subtly changing
