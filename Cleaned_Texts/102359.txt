fruit tree propagation usually carried vegetatively nonsexually grafting budding desired variety onto suitable rootstock perennial plants propagated either sexual vegetative means sexual reproduction begins male germ cell pollen one flower fertilises female germ cell ovule incipient seed species initiating development fruit containing seeds seed germinated grow become new specimen tree however new tree inherits characteristics parents grow true variety either parent came fresh individual unpredictable combination characteristics although desirable terms producing novel combinations richness gene pool two parent plants sexual recombination source new cultivars rarely resulting new fruit tree directly useful attractive tastes humankind new plants characteristics lie somewhere two parents therefore orchard grower gardeners point view preferable propagate fruit cultivars vegetatively order ensure reliability involves taking cutting scion wood desirable parent tree grown produce new plant clone original effect means original bramley apple tree example successful variety grown pip every bramley since propagated taking cuttings living matter tree one descendants simplest method propagating tree vegetatively rooting taking cuttings cutting usually piece stem parent plant cut stuck soil artificial rooting hormones sometimes used improve chances success cutting die rotinducing fungi desiccation first roots grow buried portion cutting become new complete plant however although works well plants figs olives fruit tree cultivars method much low success rate commercially viable root cuttings pieces root cut induced grow new trunk also used propagate fruit trees although method successful herbaceous plants refinement rooting layering rooting piece wood still attached parent

grafting onto rootstocks essence involves physically joining part shoot hybrid cultivar onto roots different closely related species cultivar two parts grow together one plant process joining two
