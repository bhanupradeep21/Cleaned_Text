bradycardia medical term used describe resting heart rate beats per minute bradycardia result variety pathologic processes commonly physiologic response cardiovascular conditioning due asymptomatic type atrioventricular block resting heart rates less bpm often normal sleep young healthy adults large population studies adults without underlying heart disease resting heart rates bpm appear lower limits normal dependent age bradycardia likely discovered elderly age underlying cardiac disease progression contribute bradycardia may associated symptoms fatigue dyspnea dizziness confusion frank syncope due reduced forward blood flow brain lungs skeletal types symptoms often depend etiology slow heart rate classified anatomic location dysfunction within cardiac conduction generally classifications involve broad categories sinus node dysfunction snd atrioventricular block conduction tissue however bradycardia also result without dysfunction native conduction system arising secondary medications including beta blockers calcium channel blockers antiarrythmics cholinergic drugs excess vagus nerve activity carotid sinus hypersensitivity neurological causes transient symptomatic bradycardia hypothyroidism metabolic derangements common extrinsic causes management bradycardia generally reserved patients symptoms regardless minimum heart rate sleep presence concomitant heart rhythm abnormalities see sinus pause common untreated snd shown increase future risk heart failure syncope sometimes warranting definitive treatment implanted atrioventricular causes bradycardia permanent pacemaker implantation often required reversible causes disease snd atrioventricular blocks little role medical therapy unless patient hemodynamically unstable may require use medications atropine isoproterenol interventions transcutaenous pacing time appropriate workup undertaken long term treatment asymptomatic bradycardias rarely require treatment consultation physician recommended especially elderlycitation needed term relative bradycardia refer heart rate lower expected particular disease state often febrile chronotropic incompetence ci refers inadequate rise heart

units cardiomyocytes heart muscle cells like cells cardiomyocytes maintain highly regulated negative voltage rest capable propagating action potentials much like rest negative cellular voltage cardiomyocyte raised certain threshold called depolarization incoming action potential causing myocyte contract contractions occur coordinated fashion atria ventricles heart pump delivering blood rest normally origination action potential causing cardiomyocyte contraction originates sinoatrial node sa node collection specialized conduction tissue located right atrium near entrance superior vena sa node contains pacemaker cells demonstrate automaticity capable generating impulses travel heart create steady heart beginning cardiac cycle sa node generates electrical action potential spreads across right left atria causing atrial contraction cardiac electrical impulse carries atrioventricular node av node another specialized grouping cells located base right atrium anatomically normal electrical
