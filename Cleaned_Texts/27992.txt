social learning refers learning facilitated observation interaction another animal social learning observed variety animal reptiles mammals including social learning fundamentally different individual learning asocial learning involves learning appropriate responses environment experience trial though asocial learning may result acquisition reliable information often costly individual therefore individuals able capitalize individuals selfacquired information may experience fitness however social learning relies actions others rather direct contact unreliable especially true variable environments appropriate behaviors may change frequently consequently social learning beneficial stable environments predators food stimuli likely change social learning actively facilitated experienced individual classified teaching mechanisms inadvertent social learning relate primarily psychological processes observer whereas teaching processes relate specifically activities studying mechanisms information transmission allows researchers better understand animals make decisions observing others behaviors obtaining social learning occurs one individual influences learning another various processes local enhancement opportunity providing attention individual drawn specific location stimulus enhancement emulation observational conditioning observer learns relationship stimulus result directly copy behavior experienced individual imitation observer directly copies behavior animal order complete novel task emulation observer learns goal observed animal behavior seeks achieve results following steps mechanisms possible inadvertent social learning without active facilitation experienced individual actively influences anothers behavior one mechanisms individual becomes local enhancement demonstrator attracts observers attention particular one seminal study guppies poecilia reticulata demonstrated local enhancement influenced foraging untrained adult female guppies observers given five days experience swimming demonstrator fish trained take one two equivalent routes food observers later isolated preferentially used route demonstrators used results indicate guppies learn local environments social learning mechanism local local enhancement also observed transmit foraging information among birds rats opportunity providing social learning mechanism experienced individual puts observer situation facilitates acquisition knowledge new well known example unintentional opportunity providing transmission feeding behavior black rats rattus rattus one pilot study determined black rats living forests israel preferentially fed pine cones instead fresh fruits vegetation nearby rats also methodically stripped pine cones rather gnawing determine food preferences developed researchers provided naive adult black rats fresh pine cones captivity observed behavior three months experimentation found none rats successfully opened pine cones instead haphazardly inefficiently attempted feed experiments rats allowed observe experienced individuals opening pine cones still unable pick skill pinecone stripping eventually researchers determined naive adult rats could learn strip pine cones efficiently presented already partially stripped cone consistent opportunity providing experienced individuals inadvertently provide naive rats partially

learning suitable foods divided four life many mechanisms involved inadvertent social learning also employed teaching distinction drawn based upon role demonstrator perspective pupil teaching would identical inadvertent social learning equivalent teaching tutor actively demonstrates behavior pattern draws attention location specific function transmitting information pupil individual must meet three criteria qualify teacher modifies behavior presence naive observer incurs cost least benefit naive observer acquires knowledge skill rapidly efficiently might criteria rarely met animals recently convincing examples adequately identified examples still conclusively proven meet criteria primarily serve suggest teaching may occur acknowledging research adult killer whales orcinus orca

pups appear unable safely subdue consume without assistance older individuals adults display teaching behavior response pup begging calls adults modify specific teaching behaviors based upon age pup begging providing assistance younger presumably less experienced pups instances providing prey pups appears costly adults pups initially unable find consume prey rapidly gain predatory abilities learning experiences teacher suggesting adult teaching facilitates speed efficiency skill acquisition species appear similarly teach young provisioning weakened otherwise subdued prey cheetahs

information asocial learning particularly costly would increase risk predation parasitism expending unnecessary energy types scenarios social learners may observe behaviors experienced individual allows observer gain information environment without individually put animal generally learns natural predators direct experience thus predator learning costly increases predation risk individual group learning scenarios members experience danger predation transmit acquired predator recognition throughout group consequently future encounters entire group recognize threat predation respond accordingly social learning method shown group mobbing behavior common blackbird turdus merula blackbird groups likely mob object member group previously conditioned recognize behavior also recorded guppies naive guppies environments less natural predators significantly improved antipredator behavior placed group guppies high predation learning brood parasites direct experience also costly errorprone birds actively defend brood parasitism cuckoos cowbirds via variety behaviors including mobbing socially learned example study eurasian reed warblers acrocephalus scirpaceus showed individuals observed neighbors mob common cuckoo cuculus canorus subsequently likely mob cuckoos harmless results indicate social learning provides mechanism hosts rapidly increase nest defense brood parasites enabling hosts track finescale spatiotemporal variation local risk brood social learning also provides individuals information food sources environment include information find food eat eat several examples animal kingdom animals utilize social learning find example birds likely forage areas already see birds norway rat rattus norvegicus also utilizes social learning behaviors find food sources mature rats leave sensory trails food sources preferentially followed naive animals also learn eat social learning conspecifics experimentally discerning harmful foods edible foods dangerous naive individual however inexperienced individuals avoid cost observing older individuals already acquired knowledge example several species bird avoid food see another individual eat become observation also educate observer eat particular foods red squirrels sciurus vulgaris shown successfully open hickory nuts watching experienced squirrels open social learning necessarily mean transmitted behavior efficient response stimulus socially learned behavior expends unnecessary energy efficient strategy utilized employing social learning maladaptive experimentally demonstrated guppies group guppies trained swim energetically costly route food naive guppies added group new members likely follow larger group even shorter effective route provided however naive guppies introduced trained individuals preferentially used efficient route food norway rats shown abandon previously individually learned habits due actions conspecifics rats modified established aversions certain foods observed conspecifics eating foods previous aversion formed adaptive reasons ie food nutrientpoor reversion consumption food source could reduce fitness theoretically social learning become maladaptive certain point animal populations social learners asocial learners particular group information transferred individuals less likely reliable could result maladaptive information transfer social learners decreasing fitness social learners comparison asocial learners therefore social learning adaptive strategy number individual learners equal greater number social many individuals residing within area employ social learning local traditions formed cultural transmission occur learned behavior complexes shared individuals appear population generation generation
