identify bird future catchandrelease radio tracking involves attaching small radio transmitter animal following signal rdf receiver sophisticated modern techniques use satellites track tagged animals gps tags keep log animals location emergence iot ability make devices specific species tracked possible one many goals animal migration research determine animals going however researchers also want know going researchers look animals migration also migration endpoints determine species moving new locations based food density change water temperature stimulus animals ability adapt changes migration tracking vital tool efforts control impact human civilization populations wild animals prevent mitigate ongoing extinction endangered species fall american naturalist john james audubon wondered whether migrating birds returned place year tied string around leg bird flew south following spring audubon saw bird indeed come back scientists today still attach tags metal bands track movement animals metal bands require recapture animals scientists gather data data thus limited animals release destination points recent technologies helped solve problem electronic tags give repeating signals picked radio devices satellites electronic tags could include archival tags data loggers scientists track locations movement tagged animals without recapturing using rfid technology satellites electronic tags provide great deal data modern technologies also smaller minimizing negative impact tag tracking animal radio telemetry involves two devices telemetry general involves use transmitter attached animal sends signal form radio waves radio station scientist might place transmitter around animals ankle neck wing carapace dorsal fin alternatively may surgically implant internal radio transmitters advantage remaining intact functioning longer traditional attachments protected environmental variables transmitter typically uses frequency vhf band antennas band conveniently small conserve battery power transmitter usually transmits brief pulses perhaps one per second specialized radio receiver called radio direction finding rdf receiver picks signal receiver usually truck atv receiver directional antenna usually simple yagi antenna receives strongly single direction means indicating strength received signal either meter loudness pulses earphones antenna rotated received radio signal strongest antenna pointing toward animal keep track signal scientist follows animal using receiver approach using radio tracking used track animal manually also used

including stable isotope analysis require organism captured tagged recaptured later time capture organism provides information based diet three types intrinsic markers used tools animal migration studies contaminants parasites pathogens trace elements stable isotopes certain geographic regions specific stable isotope ratios affect chemistry organisms foraging locations creates isoscapes scientists use understand organism eating couple prerequisites must met order use stable isotope analysis successfully animal must least one light isotope interest specific tissues sampled condition almost always met since light isotopes building blocks animal tissues organism needs migrate isotopically different regions isotopes must retained tissue order differences stable isotope analysis lot

electronic tags giving scientists complete accurate picture migration patterns example scientists used radio transmitters track one herd caribou learned two important things first learned herd moves much previously thought second learned year herd returns place give birth information would difficult impossible obtain low tech tags tracking migrations important tool better understand protect species example florida manatees endangered species therefore need protection radio tracking showed florida manatees may travel far rhode island migrate information suggests manatees may need protection along much atlantic coast united states previously protection efforts focused mainly florida area wake bp oil spill efforts tracking animals increased gulf researchers use electronic tags
