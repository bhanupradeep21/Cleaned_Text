corneal dystrophy group rare hereditary disorders characterised bilateral abnormal deposition substances transparent front part eye called corneal dystrophy may significantly affect vision early stages however require proper evaluation treatment restoration optimal vision corneal dystrophies usually manifest first second decade sometimes later appears grayish white lines circles clouding cornea corneal dystrophy also crystalline appearancecitation needed corneal dystrophies affect parts cornea diseases share many traitscitation needed corneal dystrophies affect vision widely differing ways cause severe visual impairment cause vision problems diagnosed specialized eye examination ophthalmologist dystrophies may cause repeated episodes pain without leading permanent loss different corneal dystrophies caused mutations tgfbi genes mutations tgfbi encodes transforming growth factor beta induced cause several forms corneal dystrophies including granular corneal dystrophy lattice corneal dystrophy epithelial basement membrane dystrophy reisbucklers corneal dystrophy dystrophycitation needed corneal dystrophies may simple autosomal dominant autosomal recessive rarely xlinked recessive mendelian mode inheritance corneal dystrophy caused accumulation extraneous material cornea including lipids cholesterol crystalscitation needed diagnosis established clinical grounds may enhanced studies surgically excised corneal tissue cases molecular genetic analyses clinical manifestations widely vary different entities corneal dystrophies suspected corneal transparency lost corneal opacities occur spontaneously particularly corneas especially presence positive family history offspring consanguineous parentscitation needed superficial corneal dystrophies meesmann dystrophy characterized distinct tiny bubblelike punctate opacities form central corneal epithelium lesser extent peripheral cornea eyes infancy persists throughout life symmetrical reticular opacities form superficial central cornea eyes years age reisbücklers corneal dystrophy patient remains asymptomatic epithelial erosions precipitate acute episodes ocular hyperemia pain photophobia visual acuity eventually becomes reduced second third decades life following progressive superficial haze irregular corneal surface dystrophy subepithelial corneal opacities form honeycombshaped pattern superficial cornea multiple prominent gelatinous mulberryshaped nodules form beneath corneal epithelium first decade life gelatinous droplike corneal dystrophy cause photophobia tearing corneal foreign body sensation severe progressive loss vision lisch epithelial corneal dystrophy characterized feather shaped opacities microcysts corneal epithelium arranged bandshaped sometimes whorled pattern painless blurred vision sometimes begins sixty years lifecitation needed corneal stromal dystrophies macular corneal dystrophy manifested progressive dense cloudiness entire corneal stroma usually first appears adolescence eventually causing severe visual impairment granular corneal dystrophy multiple small white discrete irregular spots resemble bread crumbs snowflakes become apparent beneath bowman zone superficial central corneal stroma initially appear within first decade life visual acuity less normal lattice dystrophy starts fine branching linear opacities bowmans layer central area spreads periphery recurrent corneal erosions may occur hallmark schnyder corneal dystrophy accumulation crystals within corneal stroma cause corneal clouding typically ringshaped fashioncitation needed posterior corneal dystrophies fuchs corneal dystrophy presents fifth sixth decade life characteristic clinical findings excrescences thickened descemet membrane cornea guttae generalized corneal edema decreased visual acuity advanced cases abnormalities found layers cornea posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy small vesicles appear level descemet membrane patients remain asymptomatic corneal edema usually absent congenital hereditary endothelial corneal dystrophy characterized diffuse groundglass appearance corneas markedly thickened times thicker normal corneas birth infancycitation needed main differential diagnosis include various causes monoclonal gammopathy lecithincholesterolacyltransferase deficiency fabry disease cystinosis tyrosine transaminase deficiency systemic lysosomal storage diseases several skin diseases xlinked ichthyosis keratosis follicularis spinolosa decalvans historically accumulation small gray variable shaped punctate opacities variable shape central deep corneal stroma immediately anterior descemet membrane designated deep filiform dystrophy cornea farinata resemblance commas circles lines threads

lines superficial cornea autosomal dominant mode transmission initially suspected later realized individuals affected hemizygous males asymptomatic female carriers xlinked systemic metabolic disease caused deficiency αgalactosidase known fabry corneal dystrophies commonly subdivided depending specific location within cornea anterior stromal posterior according layer cornea affected dystrophycitation needed classification classified disease four groups follows following historic classification superficial dystrophies stromal dystrophies posterior dystrophies early stages may asymptomatic may require intervention initial treatment may include hypertonic eyedrops ointment reduce corneal edema may offer symptomatic improvement prior surgical interventioncitation needed suboptimal vision caused corneal dystrophy may helped scleral contact lenses eventually usually requires surgical intervention form corneal transplantation penetrating keratoplasty common type corneal transplantation commonly performed extensive corneal dystrophycitation needed penetrating keratoplasty corneal transplant longterm results good excellent recent surgical improvements made increased success rate procedure however recurrence disease donor graft may happen superficial corneal dystrophies need penetrating keratoplasty deeper corneal tissue unaffected therefore lamellar keratoplasty may used insteadcitation needed phototherapeutic keratectomy ptk used excise ablate abnormal corneal tissue patients superficial corneal opacities suitable candidates
