wernickes aphasia also known receptive sensory aphasia posterior aphasia type aphasia individuals difficulty understanding written spoken patients wernickes aphasia demonstrate fluent speech characterized typical speech rate intact syntactic abilities effortless speech writing often reflects speech tends lack content meaning cases motor deficits ie hemiparesis occur individuals wernickes therefore may produce large amount speech without much meaning individuals wernickes aphasia typically unaware errors speech realize speech may lack typically remain unaware even profound language deficits like many acquired language disorders wernickes aphasia experienced many different ways many different degrees patients diagnosed wernickes aphasia show severe language comprehension deficits however dependent severity extent severity levels may range unable understand even simplest spoken andor written information missing minor details many diagnosed wernickes aphasia difficulty

includes formal informal formal assessments include informal assessments aid diagnosis patients suspected aphasia diagnostic information scored analyzed appropriately treatment plans individual goals developed based diagnostic information well patient caregiver needs desires currently standardized treatment wernickes aphasia meaning treatment varies patient patient depending severity lesion resulting deficits majority patients kind aphasia speech language therapy primary treatment focuses improving language skills learning communicate various ways allow needs met since wernickes patients face comprehension deficits often unaware condition may pose unique challenges treatment lack awareness concern deficit treatment plans usually devised team healthcare workers including speech therapist neuropsychologist according bates et al primary goal rehabilitation prevent complications minimize impairments maximize function topics intensity timing intervention widely debated across various results contradictory studies indicate better outcomes early studies indicate starting therapy early may detrimental patients recent research suggests therapy functional focus communication goals appropriate patients individual specific treatment considerations working individuals wernickes aphasia exhibit deficits auditory comprehension include using familiar materials using shorter slower utterances speaking giving direct instructions using repetition neuroplasticity defined brains ability reorganize lay new pathways rearrange existing ones result neuronal changes damage brain collateral sprouting increased activation homologous areas map extension demonstrate brains neuroplastic abilities according thomson portions right hemisphere extended left brain sites shown recruited perform language functions brain neuronal changes recruit areas originally directly responsible large portions linguistic principles neuroplasticity proven effective neurorehabilitation damage brain principles include incorporating multiple modalities treatment create stronger neural connections using stimuli evoke positive emotion linking concepts simultaneous related presentations finding appropriate intensity duration treatment individual auditory comprehension primary focus treatment wernickes aphasia main deficit related diagnosis therapy activities may include anomia consistently seen aphasia many treatment techniques aim help patients word finding problems one example semantic approach referred semantic feature analyses process includes naming target object shown picture producing words semantically related target production semantically similar features participants develop skills naming stimuli due increase lexical neuroplasticity central component restorative therapy compensate brain damage approach especially useful wernickes aphasia patients stroke left brain schuells stimulation approach main method traditional aphasia therapy follows principles retrieve function auditory modality language influence surrounding regions stimulation guidelines effective stimulation follows auditory stimulation language intensive always present language modalities schuells stimulation utilizes stimulation therapy tasks beginning simplified task progressing become difficult including social approach involves collaborative effort behalf patients clinicians determine goals outcomes therapy could improve patients quality life conversational approach thought provide opportunities development use strategies overcome barriers communication main goals treatment method improve patients conversational confidence skills natural contexts using conversational coaching supported conversations partner additionally important include families patients aphasia treatment programs clinicians teach family members support one another adjust speaking patterns facilitate loved ones treatment recently researchers developing medical treatments aphasia using clinical trials pharmacological nonpharmacological approaches medications include drugs affecting catecholaminergic system nootropic drugs medications used treat alzheimers disease nonpharmacological approaches include transcranial magnetic stimulation transcranial direct prognosis strongly dependent location extent lesion damage brain many personal factors also influence person recover include
