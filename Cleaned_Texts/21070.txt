anomic aphasia also known dysnomia nominal aphasia amnesic aphasia mild fluent type aphasia individuals word retrieval failures express words want say particularly nouns contrast anomia deficit expressive language symptom forms aphasia patients whose primary deficit word retrieval diagnosed anomic individuals aphasia display anomia often describe object detail maybe even use hand gestures demonstrate object used find appropriate word name patients anomic aphasia relatively preserved speech fluency repetition comprehension grammatical speech anomic aphasia occurring may caused damage almost anywhere left hemisphere cases seen instances right hemisphere anomia genetic caused damage various parts parietal lobe temporal lobe brain due traumatic injury stroke brain anomic aphasia primarily caused structural lesions may also originate alzheimers disease anomia may earliest language deficit posterior cortical atrophy variant alzheimers neurodegenerative although main causes specifically known many researchers found factors contributing anomic aphasia people damage left hemisphere brain likely anomic aphasia brocas area speech production center brain linked source speech execution problems use functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri commonly used study anomic experts believe damage wernickes area speech comprehension area brain connected anomia patients comprehend words although many experts believed damage brocas area wernickes area main causes anomia current studies shown damage left parietal lobe cause anomic one study conducted using word repetition test well fmri order see highest level activity well lesions brain fridrikkson et al saw damage neither brocas area wernickes area sole sources anomia subjects therefore original anomia model theorized damage occurred surface brain grey matter debunked found damage white matter deeper brain left specifically damage part nerve tract called arcuate fasciculus mechanism action unknown though known connect posterior back brain anterior front vice anomic aphasia associated lesions throughout left hemisphere severe isolated anomia considered sign deep temporal lobe lateral temporooccipital damage damage areas seen patients showing infarction limited regions supplied dominant posterior cerebral artery pca referred posterior cerebral artery best way see anomic aphasia developed using verbal imaging tests combination seems effective since either test done alone may give false positives false negatives example verbal test used see speech disorder presents whether problem speech production comprehension patients alzheimers disease speech problems linked dementia progressive aphasias include imaging test mostly done using mri scans ideal lesion mapping viewing deterioration brain however imaging diagnose anomia lesions may located deep enough damage white matter arcuate fasciculus however anomic aphasia difficult associate specific lesion location brain therefore combination speech tests imaging tests highest sensitivity picturenaming tests philadelphia naming test pnt also utilized diagnosing aphasias analysis picturenaming compared reading picture categorizing word categorizing considerable similarity among aphasia syndromes terms picturenaming behavior however anomic aphasiacs produced fewest phonemic errors multiword circumlocutions results suggest minimal wordproduction difficulty anomic aphasia relative aphasia anomic aphasia diagnosed studies using aachen aphasia test aat tests language functioning brain injury test aims identify presence aphasia provide profile speakers language functioning according different language modalities speaking listening reading writing different levels linguistic description phonology morphology semantics syntax give measure severity test administered patients participating study researchers found naming subtest aat patients showed relevant naming difficulties tended substitute words could produce western aphasia battery another test conducted goal classifying aphasia subtypes rating severity aphasiac impairment test composed four language three performance domains syndrome classification determined pattern performance four language subtests assess spontaneous speech comprehension repetition hearing test first important case patient clearly hear words sentences needed speech repetition speech tests person asked repeat sentence common words person identify word describe person highly likely anomic aphasia however completely sure test given test subject fmri scanner exact location lesions areas activated speech simpler cheaper options available lesion mapping speech repetition tests main ways diagnosing anomic aphasiacitation needed anomic aphasia anomia type aphasia characterized problems recalling words names numbers speech fluent receptive language impaired someone anomic subjects often use circumlocutions speaking roundabout way avoid name recall express certain word remember sometimes subject recall name given clues additionally patients able speak correct grammar main problem finding appropriate word identify object personcitation needed sometimes subjects may know object still able give name object example subject shown orange asked called subject may well aware object peeled eaten may even able demonstrate actions even verbal responses however recall object called orange sometimes person condition multilingual might confuse language speaking trying find right word inadvertent codeswitchingcitation needed method available completely cure anomic aphasia however treatments help improve wordfinding skills although person anomia may find recalling many types words difficult common nouns proper nouns verbs etc many studies shown treatment object words nouns shown promise rehabilitation treatment includes visual aids pictures patient asked identify object activity however possible patient shown picture surrounded words associated object throughout process positive encouragement provided treatment shows increase word finding treatment however word identifying decreased two weeks rehabilitation therefore shows rehabilitation effort needs continuous wordfinding abilities improve baseline studies show verbs harder recall repeat even methods treating anomic aphasia include circumlocutioninduced naming therapy cin wherein patient uses circumlocution assist naming rather told name item pictured given sort cue results suggest patient better properly naming objects undergoing therapy cin strengthens weakened link semantics phonology patients anomia since often know object used verbally name anomia often challenging families friends affected one way overcome computerbased treatment models effective especially used clinical therapy leemann et al provided anomic patients computerizedassisted therapy cat sessions along traditional therapy sessions using treatment lists words patients received drug known help relieve symptoms anomia levodopa others received placebo researchers found drug significant effects improvement treatment lists almost patients improved cat sessions concluded form computerized treatment effective increasing naming abilities anomic additionally one study researched effects using excitatory anodal transcranial direct current stimulation right temporoparietal cortex brain area seems correlate language electrical stimulation seemed enhance language training outcome patients chronic contextual repetition priming treatment technique involves repeated repetition names pictures related semantically phonologically unrelated patients impaired access lexicalsemantic representations show longterm improvement naming patients good access semantics show longterm development selfcueing strategies also facilitate word retrieval patients identify core words retrieved without struggle establish relationship cue words words begin sound retrieved patients learn use cue word facilitate word retrieval target many different populations anomia instance deaf patients stroke demonstrate semantic phonological errors much like hearing anomic patients researchers called subtype sign multilingual patients typically experience anomia greater degree one fluent languages however evidence conflicts language first second impacted research children anomia indicated children undergo treatment part able gain back normal language abilities aided brain plasticity however longitudinal research children anomic aphasia due head injury shows even several years injury signs deficient word retrieval still observed remaining symptoms sometimes cause academic difficulties later disorder may extremely frustrating people without disorder although persons anomic aphasia may know specific word may able recall difficult everyone conversation positive reinforcements although many literary cases mention anomic aphasia many nonfiction books written living aphasia one man lost language sheila hale story hales husband john hale scholar stroke lost speech formation abilities book hale also explains symptoms mechanics behind aphasia speech formation adds emotional components
