animals primarily invertebrates hermaphrodites capable producing viable gametes sexes great majority tunicates mollusks earthworms hermaphroditism normal condition enabling form sexual reproduction either partner act female male hermaphroditism also found fish species rare absent vertebrate groups hermaphroditic species exhibit degree selffertilization distribution selffertilization rates among animals similar plants suggesting similar pressures operating direct evolution selfing animals rough estimate number hermaphroditic animal species animal species excluding insects insects almost exclusively gonochoric definitive cases hermaphroditism demonstrated hermaphroditic species among flowering plant species either hermaphroditic flowers produce male female gametes monoecious male female flowers occur plant also mixed breeding systems plants animals hermaphrodite individuals coexist males called androdioecy females called gynodioecy three exist species called trioecy sometimes male hermaphrodite flowers occur plant andromonoecy female hermaphrodite flowers occur plant gynomonoecy hermaphrodism confused intersexuality separate unrelated phenomenon usage term hermaphrodite
