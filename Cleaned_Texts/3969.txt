interaction dydrogesterone estrogens assessed clinically significant interaction observedcitation needed dydrogesterone highly selective progestogen due unique structure unlike progesterone many progestins binds almost exclusively progesterone receptor affinity dydrogesterone pr relatively low however vivo dydrogesterone comparatively much potent oral route equivalent dose terms endometrial

clinically used progestogens except trengestone closely related similarly trengestone also unlike clinically used progestogens dydrogesterone hyperthermic effect humans ie increase body said lack ovulation inhibition hyperthermic effect retroprogesterone derivatives like dydrogesterone may represent dissociation peripheral central progestogenic however related retroprogesterone derivative
