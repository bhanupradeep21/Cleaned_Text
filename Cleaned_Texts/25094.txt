human shoulder made three bones clavicle collarbone scapula shoulder blade humerus upper arm bone well associated muscles ligaments tendons articulations bones shoulder make shoulder joints shoulder joint also known glenohumeral joint major joint shoulder broadly include acromioclavicular joint human anatomy shoulder joint comprises part body humerus attaches scapula head sits glenoid shoulder group structures region shoulder joint main joint shoulder ball socket joint allows arm rotate circular fashion hinge away body joint capsule soft tissue envelope encircles glenohumeral joint attaches scapula humerus head biceps lined thin smooth synovial membrane rotator cuff group four muscles surround shoulder joint contribute shoulders stability muscles rotator cuff supraspinatus subscapularis infraspinatus teres minor cuff adheres glenohumeral capsule attaches humeral head shoulder must mobile enough wide range actions arms hands stable enough allow actions lifting pushing pulling shoulder consists ballandsocket joint formed humerus scapula surrounding structures ligaments muscles tendons support bones maintain relationship one supporting structures attach clavicle humerus scapula latter providing glenoid cavity acromion coracoid processes main joint shoulder shoulder joint glenohumeral joint humerus glenoid process acromioclavicular joint sternoclavicular joint also play role shoulder white hyaline cartilage ends bones called articular cartilage allows bones glide move joint space surrounded synovial membrane around joint space muscles rotator cuff directly surrounds attaches shoulder joint muscles help provide stability facilitate movement two filmy saclike structures called bursae permit smooth gliding bone muscle tendon cushion protect rotator cuff bony arch glenoid labrum second kind cartilage shoulder distinctly different articular cartilage cartilage fibrous rigid cartilage ends ball socket also cartilage also found around socket shoulder joint also known glenohumeral joint main joint ball socket joint allows arm rotate circular fashion hinge away body formed articulation head humerus lateral scapula specificallythe glenoid cavity scapula ball joint rounded medial anterior surface humerus socket formed glenoid cavity dishshaped portion lateral scapula shallowness cavity relatively loose connections shoulder rest body allows arm tremendous mobility expense much easier dislocate joints body approximately disproportion size large head humerus shallow glenoid cavitycitation neededthe glenoid cavity made deeper addition fibrocartilaginous ring glenoid labrum capsule soft tissue envelope encircles glenohumeral joint attaches scapula humerus head biceps lined thin smooth synovial membrane capsule strengthened coracohumeral ligament
