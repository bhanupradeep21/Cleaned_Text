pulmonary artery stenosis pas narrowing pulmonary artery pulmonary artery blood vessel moving blood right side heart lungs narrowing due many causes including infection pregnancy congenital heart defect problem blood clotting childhood early adulthood genetic narrowing occur many points along pulmonary artery specific location indicates severity affects treatment options people highrisk pas neonates newborns young children severe disease likely present symptoms highrisk patients necessary acceptable actively treat avoid worsening blood pressure poor heart function worsening vessel disease across blood flows methodical way body blood already delivered oxygen returns heart arrives right upper chamber gets pumped though tricuspid valve lower right chamber travels pulmonary valve pulmonary artery toward lungs oxygenated blood returns left side heart pumped throughout pulmonary artery narrows increases blood pressure right side heart causes heart work pas pulmonary valve stenosis pulmonary valve opening right heart pulmonary artery valve narrowing similar effects however treatment different long term consequences condition also vary present pulmonary artery stenosis symptoms depend location cause narrowing common symptoms symptoms caused lack oxygenated blood flow causes individuals present blood reach lungs narrowing blood back lead swelling body parts hands feet present similarly right sided heart although individuals underlying heart problems pas still occur individuals congenital heart disease genetic infectious conditions immediate way know child pas abnormal heart sounds also known murmurs heard physical exam dictate testing three treatments balloon angioplasty cutting balloon angioplasty stenting balloon angioplasty expands diameter vessel counter narrowing treatment catheter balloon end inserted larger peripheral vessel moved narrowing site goal tear two three layers artery increases vessel diameter blood flow relatively stiff balloon achieves efficacy risk procedure performed several factors help determine success major reasons simple balloon angioplasty failure inability tear vessel wall restenosis areas narrowing due compression another body part rather issues vessel even given evidence vessel wall tearing rate restenosis studies reported rate restenosis increases time procedure increases rates complications overall estimated around including higher risk complications complications procedure likely much vessel damage include full vessel tears deep vein thrombosis clot vessel complete artery rupture pulmonary younger patients typically treated balloon angioplasty older risk metal stents significantly cutting balloon angioplasty invented help reduce vessel damage method utilizes balloons blade cut vessel walls rather simply causing vessel wall tearing via crushingexpansion balloon balloon inflated blades protected inside balloon folds ensuring accidentally damage use cutting balloon larger higherpressure balloon used improve efficacy multicenter studies reported safety profiles simple versus cutting adverse effect rates respectively highpressure balloon used cutting balloon angioplasty rate effectiveness increased cutting balloon angioplasty provides areas vessel damage especially vessels heart overall cutting balloon angioplasty similar complications restenosis rates simple offers effective treatment better option smaller solve restenosis external compression metal stents introduced stents deployed via catheter expanded site stents form rigid structure remain site newer studies reported successful dilation patients average newer studies indicating success rate benefits stents long term efficacy prevention long term heart disease stents improved right side heart pressures blood flow lungs pressure difference right left sides stents last years much longer balloon angioplasty stents lowest rate restenosis stents allow normal vessel growth childhood adolescent years damage heart vasculature young children required replacement larger stent first years placement complication rates around include drift due blood flow damage vessels clot formation stent concerns necessary removal stent occur stent must monitored frequently another concern fracturing breaking due repetitive pressure patients experience adverse event rate major events fracture studies reported adverse event rate decreased patient age likely due less growth vessel replacement rates high increases prior development balloon angioplasty surgical angioplasty main treatment lack efficacy limited accessibility certain areas stenosis increased risk scarring high rate repeat stenosis surgical angioplasty used methods fail surgeons observe narrowing repairing another defect studies reported surgical success rate surgical angioplasty alternative treatments would required patients exposing risks initially soft balloon used patients experienced even increase blood flow efficacy similar surgical angioplasty large risk reduction later stiffer balloon achieved better results httpsenwikipediaorgwikipulmonaryarterystenosis
