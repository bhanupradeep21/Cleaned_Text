crops pasture grasses horticultural ornamental vegetable rootknot nematodes become established deeprooted perennial crops control difficult options limitedcitation needed meloidogyne spp first reported cassava neal damage cassava variable depending cultivar planted range negligible earlyseason infection leads worse crops nematode damage reduces plant health growth cassava though nematode damage sometimes leads increased aerial growth plants try compensate possibly enables plant maintain reasonable level production therefore aerial correlations nematode density positive negative vegetable crops grown warm climates experience severe losses rootknot nematodes often routinely treated chemical nematicide rootknot nematode damage results poor growth decline quality yield crop reduced resistance stresses eg drought diseases high level damage lead total crop loss nematodedamaged roots use water fertilisers effectively leading additional losses grower cassava suggested levels
