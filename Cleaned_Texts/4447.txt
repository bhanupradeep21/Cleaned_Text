machairodus greek μαχαίρα machaíra knife greek ὀδούς odoús genus large machairodont sabertoothed cat lived africa eurasia north america late miocene animal subfamily machairodontinae gets name since become wastebasket taxon years many genera sabertooth cat still occasionally lumped machairodus first named german naturalist johann jakob kaup though remains known since believed georges cuvier fossils come species bear called ursus cultridens known today megantereon based composite sample teeth different countries species geologic ages leading would become long series complications kaup however recognized teeth felids promptly reclassified existing specimens machairodus including cultridens name quickly gained acceptance end century many species felid related feliform nimravids lumped genus machairodus including limited sansanosmilus megantereon paramachairodus amphimachairodus nimravides homotherium among others would eventually turn machairodus something wastebasket taxon

discovery true species representative genus machairodus described north america reassigned genera nimravides amphimachairodus presence north america suggests either widespread population genus cat throughout africa eurasia north america simultaneous instances independent evolution machairodonts multiple continents overall skull machairodus noticeably narrow compared skulls extant pantherine cats orbits relatively small canines long thin flattened side side broad front back like blade knife homotherium front back edges canines serrated first grew serrations worn first years animals life however skull horribilis shown similar extant pantherines cranial characters suggesting new evidence diversity killing bites even largest sabertoothed carnivorans offering additional mechanism mosaic evolution leading functional morphological diversity sabertooth machairodus probably hunted ambush predator legs short sustain long chase likely good jumper used canines cut open throat prey teeth rooted mouth delicate related genera unlike sabertoothed cats nimravids time often extremely long canines hung mouths fangs machairodus however able easily fit mouth comfortably long effective despite great size largest example machairodus horribilis better equipped hunt relatively smaller prey smilodon evidenced moderate jaw gape degrees similar gape modern fossil species assigned genus machairodus divided turner two grades evolutionary development aphanistus north american nimravides catacopis representing primitive grade coloradensis giganteus representing derived characteristics advanced grade include relative elongation forearm shortening lumbar region spine resemble living pantherine subsequently derived forms assigned new genus amphimachairodus includes coloradensis kurteni kabir addition catacopsis reclassified n studies machairodus indicate cat relied predominantly neck muscles make killing bite applied victims cervical vertebrae show clear adaptations making vertical motions neck skull also clear adaptations precise movements strength flexibility neck show compatibility canineshearing bite technique machairodontine cats believed performed adaptations believed also partial compensation primitive machairodont high percentage canine breakages seen machairodus seemed prefer open woodland habitat evidenced finds cerro de los batallones vallesian age top predator batallones would hunted large herbivores time herbivores would included horses like hipparion hornless rhinoceros aceratherium giraffes decennatherium birgerbohlinia deer euprox lucentia antelopes paleoreas tragoportax miotragocerus dorcatherium gomphotherid elephantoid tetralophodon porcupine hystrix suid microstonyx machairodus would competed prey amphicyonid magericyon fellow machairodonts promegantereon paramachairodus bears agriotherium indarctos small hyaenid protictitherium agriotherium magericyon would likely strongly competitive machairodus food promegantereon paramachairodus protictitherium likely less potential evidence also exists indicating machairodus may prone niche partitioning magericyon possibly living slightly different habitats machairodont preferring heavily vegetated habitats beardog hunted open areas dietary preferences may also played role coexistence two large predators based jaw gape largest species horribilis probably hunter relatively slowmoving horses genus would also lived alongside large pig kubanochoerus lahayishupup would likely preyed large animals lived alongside included rhinoceroses machairodus aphanistus fossils recovered batallones reveal high percentage tooth breakages indicating unlike later machairodonts due lack protruding incisors machairodus often used sabers subdue prey manner similar modern
