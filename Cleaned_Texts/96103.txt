risk perception subjective judgement people make characteristics severity risk perceptions often differ statistical assessments risk since affected wide range affective emotions feelings moods etc cognitive gravity events media coverage riskmitigating measures etc contextual framing risk information availability alternative information sources etc individual personality traits previous experience age etc several theories proposed explain different people make different estimates dangerousness three major families theory developed psychology approaches heuristics cognitive anthropologysociology approaches cultural theory interdisciplinary approaches social amplification risk framework study risk perception arose observation experts lay people often disagreed risky various technologies natural hazards mid saw rapid rise nuclear technologies promise clean safe energy however public perception shifted new technology fears longitudinal dangers environment immediate disasters creating radioactive wastelands turned public new technology scientific governmental communities asked public perception use nuclear energy scientific experts declaring safe really problem nonexperts perceived difference scientific facts exaggerated public perception key early paper written chauncey starr used revealed preference approach find risks considered acceptable society assumed society reached equilibrium judgment risks whatever risk levels actually existed society acceptable major finding people accept risks times greater voluntary eg driving car involuntary eg nuclear disaster early approach assumed individuals behave rationally weighing information making decision individuals exaggerated fears due inadequate incorrect information implied assumption additional information help people understand true risk hence lessen opinion researchers engineering school pioneer research risk perception adapting theories economics little use practical setting numerous studies rejected belief additional information alone shift psychological approach began research trying understand people process information early works maintained people use cognitive heuristics sorting simplifying information leading biases comprehension later work built foundation became psychometric paradigm approach identifies numerous factors responsible influencing individual perceptions risk including dread novelty stigma research also shows risk perceptions influenced emotional state valence theory risk perception differentiates positive emotions happiness optimism negative ones fear anger according valence theory positive emotions lead optimistic risk perceptions whereas negative emotions influence pessimistic view research also found whereas risk benefit tend positively correlated across hazardous activities world negatively correlated peoples minds earliest psychometric research done psychologists daniel kahneman amos tversky performed series gambling experiments see people evaluated probabilities major finding people use number heuristics evaluate information heuristics usually useful shortcuts thinking may lead inaccurate judgments situations case become cognitive biases another key finding experts necessarily better estimating probabilities lay people experts often overconfident exactness estimates put much stock small samples majority people public express greater concern problems appear possess immediate effect everyday life hazardous waste pesticideuse longterm problems may affect future generations climate change population people greatly rely scientific community assess threat environmental problems usually directly experience effects phenomena climate change exposure people climate change impersonal people virtual experience documentaries news media may seem like remote area however coupled population waitandsee attitude people understand importance changing environmentally destructive behaviors even experts provide detailed clear risks caused climate research within psychometric paradigm turned focus roles affect emotion stigma influencing risk perception melissa finucane paul slovic among key researchers researchers first challenged starrs article examining expressed preference much risk people say willing accept found contrary starrs basic assumption people generally saw risks society unacceptably high also found gap voluntary involuntary risks nearly great starr claimed slovic team found perceived risk quantifiable predictable people tend view current risk levels unacceptably high things equal greater people perceived benefit greater tolerance person derived pleasure using product people tended judge benefits high risks low activity disliked judgments research psychometrics
