evolutionary history origin turtle family remains attributed niolamia seemingly first uncovered santiago roth well preserved skull found shortly afterwards name niolamia however coined roth contacts florentino ameghino briefly wrote said another skull discovered brother ameghinos name retained animal later publications entirely based roths material ameghino neither diagnosed figured fossil fact ameghinos material never recovered initial communication led researchers believe two specimens one british paleontologist arthur smith woodward sent photograph meiolaniid tail ring fossil collector santiago worked francisco pascasio moreno woodward writes able study fossil early material sent argentina london allowing compare remains meiolania platyceps turtle named richard owen australia according woodward moreno tasked roth followup expedition recovered additional remains form carapace skull associated year argentinian paleontologist florentino ameghino coined name niolamia argentina skull claimed brother carlos discovered guaranitic however little information given ameghino time researcher didnt established holotype didnt diagnose species even figured fossil material imprecise information accident result rivalry ameghino moreno rivalry similar bone wars edward drinker cope othniel charles marsh america saw two intentionally hide records one another eventually leading complete loss around time moreno authored short communication describing material roth reportedly uncovered second expedition although various postcranial remains also described skull specimen mlp element figured two years later arthur smith woodward published detailed paper illustrated material extensively assigned species mentioned previously ameghino however rather using name niolamia woodward created combination miolania argentina based accidental misspelling despite declaring niolamia junior synonym ameghino seemingly concurred woodward using combination later however sterli raises possibility rather accepting synonymity ameghino never meant call material niolamia first place also misspelled meiolania prior naming issue somewhat resolved george gaylord simpson coleman williams established roths material neotype niolamia reasoning ameghinos material described thoroughly enough serve holotype paper researchers also officially described additional meiolaniid remains eocene parts sarmiento formation named casamayor formation named crossochelys although simpson argued material crossochelys juvenile eugene gaffney reasoned contrary review meiolaniids declaring crossochelys junior synonym meiolaniid research received considerable boost gaffney fossils niolamia remained storage publications released time primarily based work woodward rather first hand observation convoluted history poor description early meiolaniid discoveries south america eventually led full redescription neotype authored juliana sterli marcelo de la fuente like gaffney argue crossochelys simply younger niolamia individual distinguishing features simply representing individual variation traits would change later publication sterli would comment complex history taxon impact intense rivalry ameghino moreno history niolamia according sterli competition may explain whereabouts rather absence ameghinos fossil seemingly disappeared research history following initial short description subsequent authors figured described even compared ameghino skull roth skull juliana sterli offers two possible explanations possible ameghinos skull simply lost however likewise possibility ameghino roth skulls specimen ameghino misattributed discovery brother would explain improbability two well preserved skulls discovered quick succession different teams also explain researcher ever figured ameghino skull compared roth material subsequently sterli refers neotype holotype purposeful lack information locality first niolamia remains found general ambiguity around whether ameghinos roths skulls distinct led lot confusion subsequent years ameghino named guaranitic formation chubut province place origin fossils claiming material collected near rio sehuen rio

meiolania among findings paper meiolaniids elongated vestibulum nasi although feature associated aquatic turtles today correlating snorkellike nose also interpreted adaptation life deserts based

species although possibility dorsal region nasal cavity could aided vocalisation thermoregulation based comparison ornithischian dinosaurs dismissed outright considered relatively unlikely given much simple structure leaving aside potential additional uses enhanced sense smell inferred large nasal cavity could served several functions foraging intraspecific communication particular focus placed later modern turtles displaying wide variety glands used produce chemical secretions musk glands cloacal secretions mental glands presence glands observed meiolaniid fossils may tied keen sense smell inferred furthermore chemical cues associated combat aggression modern turtles especially courtship may entail various shellbased maneuvers congruent prior studies suggesting combat function highly

semicircular canals modern tortoises angle approximately aquatic turtles like geoemydids plesiochelydids meiolaniids terrestrial species wide angle semicircular canals servers improve stability head walking given similarities modern turtles however assumed sensitive low frequency sounds especially vocal animals relying heavily smell however significant changes inner ear anatomy may often subtle
