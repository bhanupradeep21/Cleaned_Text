primarily adipose tissues striated muscle skeletal cardiac first evidence distinct glucose transport protein provided david james gene encodes mapped cell surface permits facilitated diffusion circulating glucose concentration gradient muscle fat cells within cells glucose rapidly phosphorylated glucokinase liver hexokinase tissues form enters glycolysis polymerized glycogen diffuse back cells also serves maintain concentration gradient glucose passively enter like proteins unique amino acid arrangement primary sequence allows transport glucose across plasma membrane addition phenylalanine nterminus two leucine residues acidic motifs coohterminus believed play key role kinetics endocytosis total glut proteins separated classes based sequence similarities class consists glut class contains glut class glut although sequence differences glut proteins basic structural components example n c termini glut proteins exposed cytoplasm cell transmembrane striated skeletal muscle cells concentration plasma membrane increase result either exercise muscle contraction exercise body needs convert glucose atp used energy concentrations decrease hexokinase becomes less inhibited glycolytic oxidative pathways make atp able proceed also means muscle cells able take glucose intracellular concentrations decrease order increase glucose levels cell primary transporter used facilitated although muscle contractions function similar way also induce translocation plasma membrane two skeletal muscle processes obtain different forms intracellular carrier vesicles either
