electromyoneurography emng combined use electromyography technique allows measurement peripheral nerves conduction velocity upon stimulation electroneurography alongside electrical recording muscular activity electromyography combined use proves clinically relevant allowing source location particular neuromuscular disease known accurate diagnoses electromyoneurography technique uses surface electrical probes obtain electrophysiological readings nerve muscle cells nerve activity generally recorded using surface electrodes stimulating nerve one site recording another minimum distance two time difference potential measure time taken potential travel distance across two sites measure conduction velocity along nerve amplitude potential measured baseline peak peak peak measure number fibers conducting response abnormality data obtained nerve measurements absent low amplitude indicates potential nerve technique used many medical fields today one example use detect neuropathy due diseases like diabetes also used detect muscle weakness paralysis due sepsis multiorgan failure comatose method remains largely used medical technique due efficiency relative simplicity especially attractive due lack special precautions preparation involved procedure minimal pain significant risks except associated needle technique electromyoneurography first practiced late american academy general practice use technique enhances diagnostic capability defining localizing target site milton b spiegel research physician rehabilitation institute south florida wrote one first major academic papers surrounding uses benefits electromyoneurography paper dr spiegel suggested preexamination patients range motion reflexes would eliminate time exploration nerve entrapments electromyoneurographic early practice utilizing electromyoneurography became widely accepted medical community specifically aiding diagnoses neuropathy radiculopathy axonopathy recent use electromyoneurography employed throughout century aiding diagnosis carpal tunnel syndrome abnormal glucose levels many myopathies procedure analyzes nerve conduction muscle potentials use hreflex fwave studies combined preexamination electromyoneurography utilized detect neuromuscular electromyoneurography variety modern applications high level sensitivity electromyoneurography employs makes ideal detecting peripheral nerve damage well variety myopathies early stages electrophysiological data obtaining technique able heighten diagnostic capabilities looking peripheral neuropathy disorders like radiculopathy axonopathy addition myopathies muscular dystrophy myotonia myasthenia electromyoneurography main technique used study detect diabetic polyneuropathy serious condition progressive electromyoneurography also used measure patient recovery surgical procedures nerve repair study conducted patients proximal radial nerve injuries used procedure indicate degree pre postoperative nerve particular study electromyoneurography preferred method measuring recovery chosen magnetic resonance imaging mri computed tomography ct scans looking sample data table one see postoperative patients generally see increase mean radial nerve amplitude decrease mean radial nerve latency increases nerve motor conduction velocity results general trends would expected operating damaged nerves effort increase performancecitation needed electromyoneurographys unique combination recording muscle nerve simultaneously typically results higher level diagnostic ability field medicine heightened utility often results lesser demand invase techniques acquiring electrophysiological data procedure complications uncommon amount attention required postoperative care involved electromyoneurography found particularly useful diagnosing following neuromuscular conditions though exhaustive list electromyoneurography procedure recording muscle done insertion needle recordings taken muscle rest muscle contracting muscle contract based directions one performing test instructing patient move certain body parts certain directions forming muscle contractions various regions muscle body examined electromyoneurography test procedure lasts anywhere minutes minutes per muscle addition examining muscles conduction velocity nerve signals measured nerves ability transmit signals tested inserting recording electrodes capture data signal electrodes initiate signals nerve applying small shock selfgenerated potentials also occur naturally recording addition artificial shock evaluating nerves conduction velocity together testing potentials allows beneficial diagnosis detect pain sensory problems neuromuscular needle normally attached recording device known electromyography machine results show appearance action potential graded potential spikes interpretation results requires background knowledge irregular data used diagnose many diseases activity nerves rest abnormal may indicate nerve lesion radiculopathy lower motor nerve degeneration amplitude duration potential spike may also used gather information decreased amplitude duration may indicate nerve damage due muscle diseases
