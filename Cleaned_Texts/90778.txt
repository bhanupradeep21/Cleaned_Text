average annual temperature alternatively restricted regions found may served display structures addition two adult specimens distinctive wavy crests snouts sides high central crest probably used display presence feathers large basal tyrannosauroid suggests possibility later tyrannosaurids also feathered even adult despite however scaly skin impressions reported various late cretaceous tyrannosaurids gorgosaurus tarbosaurus tyrannosaurus parts body yutyrannus feathered since positive evidence plumage tyrannosaurids researchers suggested may evolved scales scaly skin dominant epidermal trait later genera extent nature integumentary covering may changed time response body size warmer climate possible integumentary structures yutyrannus might represent true feathers
