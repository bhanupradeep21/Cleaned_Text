psychological trauma resulting adverse interactions people interpersonal trauma could include sexual violence domestic violence abuse childhood people instances present ptsd often complex interpersonal trauma continues significant public health problem united states contributing significant psychological distress functional sexual violence victims predominantly women interviewing women

several possible treatment modalities advantageous treating trauma symptoms patients cognitions modalities include learning address trauma memories specifying triggers reconditioning flashbacks
