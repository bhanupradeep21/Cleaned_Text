croup also known laryngotracheobronchitis type respiratory infection usually caused infection leads swelling inside trachea interferes normal breathing produces classic symptoms barkingbrassy cough inspiratory stridor hoarse fever runny nose may also symptoms may mild moderate often starts worse night normally lasts one two croup caused number viruses including parainfluenza influenza rarely due bacterial croup typically diagnosed based signs symptoms potentially severe causes epiglottitis airway foreign body ruled investigations blood tests xrays cultures usually many cases croup preventable immunization influenza cases croup mild patient treated home supportive care croup usually treated single dose steroids severe cases inhaled epinephrine may also hospitalization required one five percent croup relatively common condition affects children commonly occurs six months five years age may rarely seen children old slightly common males occurs often vaccination croup frequently caused diphtheria often cause rare western world due success diphtheria croup characterized barking cough stridor hoarseness difficult breathing usually worsens barking cough often described resembling call sea stridor worsened agitation crying heard rest may indicate critical narrowing airways croup worsens stridor may decrease symptoms include fever coryza symptoms typical common cold indrawing chest hoovers drooling sick appearance indicate medical conditions epiglottitis croup usually deemed due viral others use term broadly include acute laryngotracheitis laryngitis tracheitis together spasmodic croup laryngeal diphtheria bacterial tracheitis laryngotracheobronchitis laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis first two conditions involve viral infection generally milder respect symptomatology last four due bacterial infection usually greater viral croup acute laryngotracheitis commonly caused parainfluenza virus member paramyxovirus family primarily types viral causes include influenza b measles adenovirus respiratory syncytial virus spasmodic croup caused group viruses acute laryngotracheitis lacks usual signs infection fever sore throat increased white blood cell treatment response

bacterial tracheitis laryngotracheobronchitis laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis usually due primary viral infection secondary bacterial growth common cocci implicated staphylococcus aureus streptococcus pneumoniae common bacteria haemophilus influenzae moraxella viral infection causes croup leads swelling larynx trachea large due infiltration white blood cells especially histiocytes lymphocytes plasma cells swelling produces airway obstruction significant leads dramatically increased work breathing characteristic turbulent noisy airflow known croup typically diagnosed based signs first step exclude obstructive conditions upper airway especially epiglottitis airway foreign body subglottic stenosis angioedema retropharyngeal abscess bacterial frontal xray neck routinely done may show characteristic narrowing trachea called steeple sign subglottic stenosis resembles steeple shape steeple sign suggestive diagnosis absent half investigations blood tests viral culture discouraged may cause unnecessary agitation thus worsen stress compromised viral cultures obtained via nasopharyngeal aspiration used confirm exact cause usually restricted research bacterial infection considered

treatment less children require endotracheal since croup usually viral disease antibiotics used unless secondary bacterial infection use cough medicines usually contain dextromethorphan guaifenesin also supportive care children croup includes resting keeping child infections mild suggested treated home croup contagious washing hands children croup generally kept calm counter medications pain
