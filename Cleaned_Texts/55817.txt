worldwide breast cancer common invasive cancer womennote breast cancer comprises invasive cancers female breast cancer caused deaths worldwide cancer deaths women cancer deaths men women lung cancer second common cause cancerrelated death women caused cancer deaths women cancer deaths men women number cases worldwide significantly increased since phenomenon partly attributed modern breast cancer strongly related age breast cancers occurring women years incidence breast cancer varies greatly around world lowest lessdeveloped countries greatest moredeveloped twelve world regions annual agestandardized incidence rates per women follows eastern asia south central asia subsaharan africa southeastern asia north africa western asia south central america eastern europe southern europe northern europe oceania western europe north america lifetime risk breast cancer united states usually given women age chance dying breast calculation assumes women live least age except die breast cancer age recent work using realworld numbers indicate actual risk probably less half theoretical united states highest annual incidence rates breast cancer world per whites per among african secondmost common cancer skin cancer secondmost common cause cancer death lung cancer breast cancer expected cause deaths us cancer deaths almost figure includes annual deaths among men cancer us incidence death rates breast cancer declining last us ageadjusted incidence breast cancer per women rose around cases per year around late since fallen holding steady around since ageadjusted deaths breast cancer per women rose slightly declined steadily since nevertheless us study conducted indicated breast cancer remains feared even though heart disease much common cause death among studies suggest women overestimate risk breast breast cancer common cancer uk around women men diagnosed disease every year fourth common cause cancer death around women men die year second common cause death agestandardised incidence rate breast cancer per populations wales significant increase incidence breast cancer wales last three decades likely partly due introduction national health service breast screening breast cancer less developed countries south america major public health issue leading cause cancerrelated deaths women countries argentina uruguay brazil expected numbers new cases deaths due breast cancer south america year approximately however lack funding resources treatment always available suffering breast cancer also shown overall incidence breast cancer appears higher caucasian women black african women tend present younger age aggressive disease pattern pattern also reported among black women born bred london suggesting genetic link rather environmental cause late data breast cancer sub saharan africa available though extremely limited compared developed breast cancer highest incidence among sub saharan african women also highest mortality rate many countries region cervical breast cancer causes cancer deaths women represents cancers incidence rates breast cancer varies region region sub saharan africa respectively eastern africa central africa western africa southern sub saharan africa lower incidence rates breast cancer developed countries mortality rates reflected region much many reasons found source disparity including fact breast cancer diagnosed later stages sub saharan example central africa mortalityincidence ratio us addition diagnosed later stages breast cancer sub saharan africa also found earlier onset compared western screening considered important tool tackle late stage diagnosis breast cancer policy makers african countries especially given treatment greatly limited lack research also required produce updated data breast cancer better understand variances affect burden disease one major challenges reducing burden breast cancer sub saharan africa remains lack national cancer control programs lack human well financial majority countries lack integrated prevention treatment programs complicates control disease countries also regions disposes disproportionally low number cancer registries along resources facilities factors different countries difficulties ensure women high risk identified disease diagnosed early enough better chances lack affordable effective treatment methods also renders efforts promote early detection affected faced inaccessible unaffordable resources cases challenges tackling breast cancer africa varied fully understood complicated possible unique risk factors could highlighted developing strategies foster early detection viewed literature priority effective fight male breast cancer much less talked issue due lower incidence less breast cancer sub saharan review disease found male female ratio higher sub saharan countries developed countries onset disease occurred average years later men noticeable decrease male female breast cancer ratio recent years might associated recent increase female breast cancer region still little understanding causes higher risk male breast cancer sub saharan africa male breast cancer general leading poor clinical management
