urethra greek οὐρήθρα ourḗthrā pl urethras urethrae tube connects urinary bladder urinary meatus removal urine body females males human females primates urethra connects urinary meatus vagina whereas marsupials females urethra empties urogenital females use urethra urinating males use urethra urination external urethral sphincter striated muscle allows voluntary control internal sphincter formed involuntary smooth muscles lining bladder neck urethra receives nerve supply sympathetic division autonomic nervous internal sphincter present males urethra fibrous muscular tube connects urinary bladder external urethral meatus length differs sexes passes penis males human male urethra average centimeters inches long opens end external urethral urethra divided four parts men named prostatic urethra common site obstruction outflow urine bph patients inadequate data typical length male urethra however study men showed average length cm sd cm ranging cm human female urethra cm exits body clitoris vagina extending internal external urethral orifice meatus located clitoris placed behind symphysis pubis embedded anterior wall vagina direction obliquely downward forward slightly curved concavity directed forward proximal twothirds urethra lined transitional epithelial cells distal third lined stratified squamous epithelial superior inferior fascia urogenital diaphragm female urethra surrounded urethral sphincter cells lining urethra epithelium start transitional cells exits bladder variable layers flat cuboidal cells change shape depending whether compressed contents along urethra pseudostratified columnar stratified columnar lining becomes multiple layers flat cells near end urethra external skin around small mucussecreting urethral glands well bulbourethral glands cowper secrete mucous acting lubricate urethra consists three coats muscular erectile mucous muscular layer continuation bladder somatic conscious innervation external urethral sphincter supplied pudendal nerve developing embryo hind end lies cloaca fourth seventh week divides urogenital sinus beginnings anal canal wall forming two inpouchings called urorectal urogenital sinus divides three parts middle part forming urethra upper part largest becomes urinary bladder lower part changes depending biological sex cells lining urethra epithelium come endoderm whereas connective tissue smooth muscle parts derived third month urethra also contributes development associated structures depending biological sex embryo male epithelium multiples form prostate female upper part urethra forms urethra paraurethral urethra vessel urine passes leaving bladder urination smooth muscle lining urethra relaxes concert bladder contractions forcefully expel urine pressurized stream following urethra reestablishes muscle tone contracting smooth muscle layer bladder returns relaxed quiescent state urethral smooth muscle cells mechanically coupled coordinate mechanical force electrical signaling organized unitary male urethra conduit semen sexual urine removed ejaculation preejaculate fluid called cowpers fluid bulbourethral infection urethra urethritis often causes purulent urethral often due sexually transmitted infection gonorrhoea chlamydia less commonly due bacteria ureaplasma mycoplasma trichomonas vaginalis viruses herpes simplex virus investigations gram stain discharge might reveal cause nucleic acid testing based first urine sample passed day swab urethra sent bacterial culture sensitivity may also treatment usually involves antibiotics treat gonorrhoea chlamydia often occur person treated urethritis sex infection treated spread infection spread may occur incubation period person gets symptoms often contact tracing sexual partners affected person found treatment cancer also develop lining cancer present common symptom affected person blood urine physical medical examination may otherwise normal except late cancer urethra often due cancer cells lining urethra called transitional cell carcinoma although rarely occur squamous cell carcinoma type cells lining urethra changed due chronic schistosomiasis investigations performed usually include collecting sample urine inspection malignant cells microscope called cytology well examination flexible camera urethra called urethroscopy malignancy found biopsy taken ct scan performed body parts ct scan chest abdomen pelvis look additional metastatic cancer staged treatment may involve chemotherapycitation needed passage kidney stones urethra painful damage urethra kidney stones chronic infection cancer catheterisation lead narrowing called urethral location structure narrowing investigated medical imaging scan dye injected urinary meatus urethra called retrograde additional forms imaging ultrasound computed tomography magnetic resonance imaging may also used provide injuries urethra eg pelvic foreign bodies urethra uncommon medical case reports selfinflicted injuries result insertion foreign bodies urethra electrical hypospadias epispadias forms abnormal development urethra male meatus located distal end penis occurs lower normal hypospadias higher epispadias severe chordee urethra develop penis scrotum tube called catheter inserted urethra drain urine bladder called indwelling urinary catheter bypass urethra catheter may directly inserted abdominal wall bladder called suprapubic may relieve bypass obstruction monitor much urine someone produces person difficulty urinating example due neurological cause multiple complications associated catheter insertion include catheterassociated infections injury urethra nearby structures word urethra comes ancient greek stem uro relating urination structure described early time confusingly however time called ureter thereafter terms ureter urethra variably used refer thereafter anatomists bartolomeo eustacchio jacques dubois began use terms specifically consistently refer modern english called ureter following centuries multiple terms relating structures urethritis urethrography kidney stones identified recorded long written historical records urinary tract well function drain urine kidneys described galen second century surgery urethra remove kidney stones described since least first century ad aulus cornelius position urethra males transverse section penis male urethral opening glans penis female
