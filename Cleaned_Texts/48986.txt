white blood cells also called leukocytes immune cells also called immunocytes cells immune system involved protecting body infectious disease foreign invaders white blood cells include three main subtypes granulocytes lymphocytes white blood cells produced derived multipotent cells bone marrow known hematopoietic stem leukocytes found throughout body including blood lymphatic white blood cells nuclei distinguishes blood cells anucleated red blood cells rbcs platelets different white blood cells usually classified cell lineage myeloid cells lymphoid cells white blood cells part bodys immune system help body fight infection diseases types white blood cells granulocytes neutrophils eosinophils basophils agranulocytes monocytes lymphocytes cells b myeloid cells myelocytes include neutrophils eosinophils mast cells basophils monocytes subdivided dendritic cells macrophages monocytes macrophages neutrophils phagocytic lymphoid cells lymphocytes include cells subdivided helper cells memory cells cytotoxic cells b cells subdivided plasma cells memory b cells natural killer cells historically white blood cells classified physical characteristics granulocytes agranulocytes classification system less frequently used produced bone marrow white blood cells defend body infections disease excess white blood cells usually due infection inflammation less commonly high white blood cell count could indicate certain blood cancers bone marrow disorders number leukocytes blood often indicator disease thus white blood cell count important subset complete blood count normal white cell count usually us usually expressed white blood cells per microliter white blood cells make approximately total blood volume healthy making substantially less numerous red blood cells however blood makes large difference health immunity depends increase number leukocytes upper limits called leukocytosis normal part healthy immune responses happen frequently occasionally abnormal neoplastic autoimmune origin decrease lower limit called leukopenia indicates weakened immune system name white blood cell derives physical appearance blood sample centrifugation white cells found buffy coat thin typically white layer nucleated cells sedimented red blood cells blood plasma scientific term leukocyte directly reflects description derived greek roots leuk meaning white cyt meaning cell buffy coat may sometimes green large amounts neutrophils sample due hemecontaining enzyme myeloperoxidase produce white blood cells nucleated distinguishes anucleated red blood cells platelets types leukocytes classified standard ways two pairs broadest categories classify either structure granulocytes agranulocytes cell lineage myeloid cells lymphoid cells broadest categories divided five main types neutrophils eosinophils basophils lymphocytes types distinguished physical functional characteristics monocytes neutrophils phagocytic subtypes classified granulocytes distinguished agranulocytes nucleus shape lobed versus round polymorphonuclear versus mononuclear cytoplasm granules present absent precisely visible light microscopy thus visible dichotomy lineage myeloid cells neutrophils monocytes eosinophils basophils distinguished lymphoid cells lymphocytes hematopoietic lineage cellular differentiation lymphocytes classified cells b cells natural killer cells neutrophils abundant white blood cell constituting circulating defend bacterial fungal infection usually first responders microbial infection activity death large numbers form pus commonly referred polymorphonuclear pmn leukocytes although technical sense pmn refers granulocytes multilobed nucleus consists three five lobes connected slender gives neutrophils appearance multiple nuclei hence name polymorphonuclear leukocyte cytoplasm may look transparent fine granules pale lilac stained neutrophils active phagocytosing bacteria present large amount pus wounds cells able renew lysosomes used digesting microbes die phagocytosed neutrophils common cell type seen early stages acute inflammation average lifespan inactivated human neutrophils circulation reported different approaches eosinophils compose white blood cells circulating blood count fluctuates throughout day seasonally menstruation rises response allergies parasitic infections collagen diseases disease spleen central nervous system rare blood numerous mucous membranes respiratory digestive lower urinary primarily deal parasitic infections eosinophils also predominant inflammatory cells allergic reactions important causes eosinophilia include allergies asthma hay fever hives parasitic infections secrete chemicals destroy large parasites hookworms tapeworms big one white blood cell phagocytize general nuclei bilobed lobes connected thin cytoplasm full granules assume characteristic pinkorange color eosin staining basophils chiefly responsible allergic antigen response releasing chemical histamine causing dilation blood vessels rarest white blood cells less total count share physicochemical properties blood cells difficult recognized several coarse dark violet granules giving blue hue nucleus bi trilobed hard see number coarse granules hide secrete two chemicals aid bodys defenses histamine heparin histamine responsible widening blood vessels increasing flow blood injured tissue also makes blood vessels permeable neutrophils clotting proteins get connective tissue easily heparin anticoagulant inhibits blood clotting promotes movement white blood cells area basophils also release chemical signals attract eosinophils neutrophils infection lymphocytes much common lymphatic system blood lymphocytes distinguished deeply staining nucleus may eccentric location relatively small amount cytoplasm lymphocytes include monocytes largest type white blood cell share vacuum cleaner phagocytosis function neutrophils much longer lived extra role present pieces pathogens cells pathogens may recognized killed causes antibody response mounted monocytes eventually leave bloodstream become tissue macrophages remove dead cell debris well attack microorganisms neither dead cell debris attacking microorganisms dealt effectively neutrophils unlike neutrophils monocytes able replace lysosomal contents thought much longer active life kidneyshaped nucleus typically granulated also possess abundant cytoplasm leucocytes migrate tissues body take permanent residence location rather remaining blood often cells specific names depending upon tissue settle fixed macrophages liver become known kupffer cells cells still serve role immune system two commonly used categories white blood cell disorders divide quantitatively causing excessive numbers proliferative disorders causing insufficient numbers leukocytosis usually healthy eg fighting infection also may dysfunctionally proliferative proliferative disorders white blood cells classed myeloproliferative lymphoproliferative autoimmune many neoplastic another way categorize disorders white blood cells qualitatively various disorders number white blood cells normal cells function neoplasia white blood cells benign often malignant various tumors blood lymph cancers white blood cells broadly classified leukemias lymphomas although categories overlap often grouped together range disorders cause decreases white blood cells type white blood cell decreased usually neutrophil case decrease may called neutropenia granulocytopenia less commonly decrease lymphocytes called lymphocytopenia lymphopenia may neutropenia acquired decrease levels neutrophils lab tests due either decreased production neutrophils increased removal following list causes complete symptoms neutropenia associated underlying cause decrease
