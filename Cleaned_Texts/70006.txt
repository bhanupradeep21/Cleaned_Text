directly related investigation gain access information information gathered marked confidential measures put place stop inappropriate dissemination views opposed viet dinh believed alterations would hinder terrorism investigations james x dempsey argued section allows roving surveillance fisa reasonable considering investigators already ability perform roving surveillance criminal cases however says many provisions patriot act concern section authority rather issue lack adequate checks balances dempsey believes section lacks two important safeguards present corresponding legislation criminal investigations agents actually ascertain location suspect turning recording devices additional changes fisa adopted outside normal process intelligence authorization act months patriot act probably unintended effect seeming authorize john doe roving taps fisa orders identify neither target location interception dempsey also believes law changed surveillance via fisa also notified surveillance ceased wrongly targeted placed surveillance challenge governments however paul rosenzweig disagreed dempseys premise relaxation particularity requirement constitutionally suspect believed colored argument section modified rosenzweig believes addition ascertainment requirement requirement identification individuals specific seem unnecessary unwise rosenzweigs view would unnecessarily burden ability law enforcement intelligence agents perform surveillance terrorist suspects dempsey also argued section deals seizure voicemails use normal search warrant unnecessarily overlooked importance notice fourth amendment title iii wiretap believes way seek redress new provisions ordinary search warrant may never find voicemail seized repealed section similar current provision homeland security act allows emergency disclosure electronic communications certain circumstances believes leaves law open abuse agency may cut corners informing isp potential emergency leading isp making emergency disclosures based information dempsey suggests several modifications implement checks balances section make aftertheact judicial review mandatory suppression evidence deemed properly justified mandatory disclosure person whose privacy invaded information provided government make illegal government official intentionally recklessly mislead service provider existence emergency dempsey also believes section allows nationwide service search warrants electronic evidence made difficult distant service provider appear issuing court object legal procedural defects solution suggested dempsey problem would allow warrant challenged district served well district orin kerr also agreed james dempsey sections uncontroversial argued kept kerr believes part jim dempseys proposals reform would impose greater privacy restrictions online investigations equivalent offline investigations believes dempseys proposal require aftertheact judicial review exigent circumstances parallel fourth amendment allowing recipients orders challenge orders within recipients district would follow traditional rule challenge extremely rare event must filed issuing district disclosure person whose electronic voicemail seized also parallel fourth amendment notice must given home owner whose house searched done allow challenge order rather shows due legal process followed search conducted rogue agent kerr believes current law appears satisfy policy concern providing notice heather mac donald argued section provides socalled sneak peek provisions patriot act necessary temporary delay notification search order stops terrorists tipping counterparts investigated claims section allows government conduct secret searches without notification organizations aclu century foundation wrong listed several arguments believed easily discredited called conceal legal precedent hide judge amend statute reject james x dempsey countered section perfect example good idea gone far argued secrecy already dealt fisa amended allow government carry secret searches dempsey objects fact section enacted limited terrorism cases dempsey believes section confuses law hastily cobbled together primary example reference definition adverse result argues unrelated regards patriot acts purposes believes definition broad offer little guidance judges bring national uniformity sneak peek cases also believes reasonable period vague leaves judges uniform standard may leave courts outside ninth second circuit ability make rules also wonders sneak peak orders timehonored tool used courts decades necessary justice department push make section applicable cases measure used answer dempsey posits shaky constitutional ground trying bolster congressional action even action congress thought voting antiterrorism bill general crimes bill dempseys reasons believing shaky ground although united states v freitas cir united states v villegas cir circuit opinions premised assumption notice element fourth amendment wilson v arkansas us justice thomas supreme court found notice part fourth amendment order fix believes serious flaws section dempsey proposes several changes made section requirement reasonable cause found judge changed probable cause section apply every case delayed notification congress require delay notification extend seven days without additional judicial andrew c mccarthy believed sections deals pen register trap trace authority fisa expanded records could accessed fisa retained argues federal rules criminal procedure rule authorizes compulsory production books papers documents data objects criminal investigators mere subpoena section merely brought fisa line current criminal law also states records included section records held third parties therefore exempt citizens reasonable expectations privacy light mccarthy believes three main reasons access library records problem firstly believes government always authority compel reading records subpoena empirical indication systematic prying private choices else wed surely heard robustly organized librarians secondly believes current information age much information inappropriate access records thirdly believes priori ban investigative access reading records would unprecedented wrong points literature evidence staple terrorism prosecutions throughout reading records already led convictions terrorists though government must specify records concerned sought authorized investigation instead providing specific articulable facts perform surveillance agent foreign power points prohibits investigations violate first amendment rights citizens says specified corresponding criminal procedures says fisc meant apply searching judicial review surveillance orders role judiciary make sure executive branch abusing powers requiring fbi make solemn representations court mandating attorney general report semiannually provisions implementation section provides suitable metrics oversight necessary reform however mccarthy believe section amended clarify order recipients may move fisa court quash narrow production however says us doj already decided implicit section probably unnecessary believes amendment unnecessary unwise section mccarthy believes prepatriot act version fisa required government agencies certify monitored communications would likely either international terrorist spy involved violation us criminal law agent foreign power involved terrorism espionage unnecessary imprudently high hurdle pen registers wiretaps violate fourth amendment therefore argues constitutional reason require investigators seek court authorization thus mccarthy says amendments fisa made section modest eminently peter p swire much skeptical section mccarthy explains fisa originally apply business records designed surveillance oklahoma world trade center bombing amended apply travel documents section made broad changes allow access business records also explains legal standing changed way fisa order access business records could apply anyone necessary government could ask access whole databases argues fisa orders apply anyone target investigation longer necessary fisa orders targeted foreign power agents foreign power used gain records nothing foreign power says weak constraints base order authorized investigation surveillance must based entirely first amendment activities swire pointed business records obtained fisa different obtained similar criminal legislation gag orders may applied criminal investigations also argues us dojs assertion gain access documents held third party documents protected fourth amendment flawed mistakenly asserts something constitutional also desirable policy points see mistake consider percent income tax almost certainly constitutional people think therefore would wise policy light argues better policy sensitive library documents significant oversight andrew c mccarthy argued section changed fisa stating purpose foreign surveillance gather intelligence information significant purpose intelligence information gathering kept even though already clear meant fisa case explains fisa misinterpreted primary purpose tests surveillance nearly quartercentury april foreign intelligence surveillance court review found similarly mccarthy argues separation foreign intelligence criminal investigation false dichotomy existence crime national security threat objective reality entirely independent investigators subjective mindsets investigating believes wrong suspect systematically dishonest resort fisa fisa applications require specialized rigorous internal approval process presentation court assuming arguendo agent willing act corruptly would far easier less detectable fabricate evidence necessary get ordinary criminal wiretap fabricate national security reason use fisa mccarthy believes time us justice department misinterpreted fisa believe criminal investigations could undertaken fisa began construing certification mere announcement purpose something restrictive substantive limitation use fisa evidence criminal cases mccarthy explains foreign intelligence surveillance court review found clearly preclude limit governments use foreign intelligence information included evidence certain kinds criminal activity criminal prosecution mccarthy notes practical consequences us dojs misinterpretation fisa light matters mccarthy believes although section legally necessary remain anyway clarify clearly act says remove misunderstanding meant fisa believes section david cole argued changes law unnecessary accused proponents usa patriot act equally guilty propagating competing myths debate nowhere respect section wall agrees wall required fisa maintains section sufficient reduce barriers information sharing amongst agencies says remains bureaucratic issue statutory one blames cia trusting fbi believes prepatriot act fisa cause problems communications two agencies coles argument primary purpose test applied acquiring foreign intelligence information undertaking surveillance simply sought reduce risk fisa permits searches less criminal probable cause would become end run around constitutional requirement criminal probable cause searches conducted criminal law purposes although secondary criminal purpose may later arise agency firstly must primarily gain order gain foreign intelligence information also dismissed claims section enacted possible terrorist prosecution possible citing prosecution sami alarian us doj used fisa wiretaps undertaken patriot act enacted fell prepatriot fisa law also attacks suggestions investigation turned foreign intelligence primarily criminal investigation wiretap would need taken instead positing became criminal government agents would simply satisfy standards applicable criminal investigations namely showing probable cause tap would reveal evidence criminal conduct tap search would continue cole believes fisa based untested us supreme court assumption fisa searches performed lower showing suspicion would mandated criminal searches believes term foreign power broad enough encompass political organization comprised majority noncitizens though must show reasonable evidence crime targeting us citizen agency must show evidence foreign person agent foreign power states fisa based administrative search exception fourth amendment relaxed probable cause requirement searches search serves special need beyond criminal law enforcement however cole believes administrative search exception apply criminal law enforcement therefore investigation turns primarily criminal investigation traditional standards criminal probable cause would apply crux coles argument cole believes section makes likely information obtained fisa wiretaps searches used defendants criminal cases suggests criminal defendants cleared counsel able review initial application fisa wiretap search contesting admissibility evidence obtained fisa search using amendment requiring disclosure fisa applications evidence sought used criminal trial would encourage adherence law putting federal officials notice point legality fisa warrant would subjected adversarial testing confidentiality could kept limiting access information cleared council applying restrictions classified information procedures mccarthy totally disagreed everything cole said stating apt professor david cole begins title response imaginary walls submission largely imaginary creating rather relating myths structural impediments good intelligence plagued world believes coles whole argument pinned belief fisa unconstitutional something mccarthy totally disagreed mccarthys mind coles objection fisa believes incorrectly fourth amendment searches inappropriate absent probable cause crime argues cole wrong states fisa requires lower standard suspicion authorize searches rather requires different standard required criminal searches mccarthy says coles suggestion foreign power fisa could political organization comprised predominantly noncitizens overwrought organizations proven engaged clandestine operations targeted also says cole wrong fisa government searches surveillance never restricted searches whose primary purpose intelligence gathering therefore section constitutionally suspect mccarthy says though enforcing wall criminal foreign investigations fisa misunderstanding us doj reality misunderstanding act mean structural restrictions established ends stating one claims wall tainted propriety intelligence gathering blocked sharing intelligence gathered bureaucratic monstrosity dismantled section without clarification law disastrous primary purpose doctrine would undisturbed unnecessary wall would still place dots would remain unconnected prosecutions like alarian would occurred united states would considerably greater final response cole defended stating argument constitutionality section deprives fisa constitutional justification previously says fisa searches justified without reasonable cause justifications fell administrative search exception constitution however cole says supreme court held apply governments purpose criminal law enforcement patriot act makes foreign intelligence gathering significant sole reason fisa searches allowing criminal searches fisa cole believes searches would constitutionally shaky ground cole argues mccarthys argument based false premise section constitutional mccarthys words mandates intelligence gathering primary purpose constrains government way neither fourth amendment fisa cole disputes says purpose section eliminate primary purpose requirement cole also believes mccarthy wrong asserts fisa targets foreign powers engaged intelligence gathering sabotage international terrorism mccarthy cited usc c cole cites usc fisa defines foreign power foreignbased political organization substantially composed united states persons defines agent foreign power officer employee foreign power says broad giving example british citizen working employee amnesty international agent foreign power cole finally points mccarthy address suggestion fisa amended permit
