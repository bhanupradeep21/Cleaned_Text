unilateral hearing loss uhl type hearing impairment normal hearing one ear impaired hearing ear patients unilateral hearing loss difficulty quiet conditions speech discrimination worse normal hearing partial however noisy environments speech discrimination almost always prevalence individuals diagnosed single sided deafness difficulties sound localization speech noise children ssd likely experience developmental delays school speech behavioral known causes include genetics maternal illness injury examples causes physical trauma acoustic neuroma maternal prenatal illness measles labyrinthitis microtia meningitis ménières disease waardenburg syndrome mumps epidemic parotitismastoiditis due overstrained nervus vestibulocochlearis brain surgery close nerve ssds severe form unilateral hearing loss caused sudden sensorineural hearing loss ssnhl acoustic neuroma anomalies inner ear abnormalities cochlear nerve deficiency cnd mumps congenital cytomegalovirus cmv infection meningitis auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder ansd treatment based cause hearing loss limited treatment cause central auditory system auditory study schoolchildren found per thousand form unilateral hearing loss moderate profound unilateral hearing loss estimated schoolaged children united states unilateral hearing profound unilateral hearing loss specific type hearing loss one ear functional hearing ability db greater hearing loss people profound unilateral hearing loss hear monaural mono profound unilateral hearing loss singlesided deafness ssd makes hearing comprehension difficult speech background noise presented level persons unilateral deafness found listen person ssd needs make effort communicating patient hear one ear limited possibilities compensate disability eg changing listening position group discussions dynamic listening situations become difficult individuals profound unilateral hearing loss often perceived socially awkward due constant attempts maximize hearing leading socially unique body language uhl also negatively affects hearing comprehension making impossible patient determine direction distance movement sound evaluation using speech spatial qualities hearing scale ssq questionnaire ssd results greater handicap subjects severe hearing loss ears profound ssd often confused sensory discrimination disorder sdd type sensory processing disorder lead incorrect processing sensory information auditory input interpersonal communications profound unilateral hearing loss known cause several hearing devices shown benefit individuals unilateral hearing loss contralateral routing signals cros hearing aids hearing aids take sound ear poorer hearing transmit ear better hearing consist microphone placed near impaired ear amplifier hearing aid near normal ear two units connected either wire behind neck wireless transmission aid appears two behindtheear hearing aids sometimes incorporated bone anchored hearing aids bahas bone conduction devices surgically implanted mastoid bone abutment protruding skin external hearing aid clicks onto abutment uses bone conduction transmit sound cochlea normal hearing ear external component also attached headband softband used nonsurgical bonebridge bone conduction implant surgically implanted mastoid bone completely underneath skin audio processor worn externally held place magnets sends sound electrical signals skin implant implant sends sound vibrations cochlea normal hearing ear skull via bone adhear bone conduction system nonsurgical device sticks skin behind ear vibrates send sound vibrations skin skull bone cochlea normal hearing soundbite intraoral bone conduction system used bone conduction via teeth one component resembled conventional behindtheear hearing aid wirelessly connects second component worn mouth resembles conventional dental appliance device discontinued longer cochlear implant also used treat unilateral hearing loss many countries device surgically implanted cochlea nonhearing ear sound processor worn externally using electrical stimulation cochlea sound sent hearing nerve onto according snapp cros technology solutions provide noninvasive aesthetically appealing lowcost option individuals single sided deafness ssd primary benefits cros hearing devices improved sound awareness impaired side better hearing noise speech located impaired side however cros solutions provide restoration binaural hearing improve tasks requiring binaural input one study baha system showed benefit depending patients transcranial another study showed sound localization improved effect head shadow reduced baha system shown higher patient satisfaction greater perceived benefit users cros bonebridge system shown provide good hearing outcomes patients also reported high subjective device shown decrease head shadow sprinzl et al also found bonebridge system lower complication rate compared implanted bone conduction studies adhear system shown patients report higher comfort satisfaction longer daily wearing times compared baha system headband softband due lack pressure better outcomes compared cros hearing aids also studies soundbite system showed strong hearing benefit high patient satisfaction particularly due nonsurgical design users reported acoustic feedback cochlear implants cis shown benefit patients unilateral hearing loss terms tinnitus reduction localization speech understanding quality life increased ability locate sounds explained fact unlike treatments available treating unilateral hearing loss cochlear implant results cochleae stimulated helps brain better decipher location sound however patients may still difficulties frontal locations ci schoolage children unilateral hearing loss tend poorer grades require educational assistance case everyone however also perceived behavioral people affected uhl great difficulty locating source sound may unable locate alarm ringing telephone swimming game marco polo generally impossible wearing stereo headphones people unilateral hearing loss hear one channel hence panning information volume time differences channels lost instruments may heard better others mixed predominantly one channel extreme cases sound production complete stereo separation stereoswitching part composition heard games using audio effects sound may perceived
