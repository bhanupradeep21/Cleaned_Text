pearson used substantial amount francis galtons statistical concepts formulation biometrical school inheritance law regression biometric school unlike mendelians focused providing mechanism inheritance rather providing mathematical description inheritance causal nature galton proposed discontinuous theory evolution species would change via large jumps rather small changes built time pearson pointed flaws galtons argument actually used galtons ideas continuous theory evolution whereas mendelians favored discontinuous theory evolution galton focused primarily application statistical methods study heredity pearson colleague weldon expanded statistical reasoning fields inheritance variation correlation natural sexual pearson theory evolution intended identify biological
