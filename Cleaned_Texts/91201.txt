distance head remainder body would allowed dinocephalosaurus approach potential prey without majority bulk detected would effective murky waters li colleagues suggested dinocephalosaurus may also used neck capture prey via suction feeding flexing neck side would facilitated slenderness cervical ribs act straightening neck would caused cervical ribs splay outwards due action neck muscles attached
