anthropometry ancient greek ἄνθρωπος ánthrōpos human μέτρον métron measure refers measurement human individual early tool physical anthropology used identification purposes understanding human physical variation paleoanthropology various attempts correlate physical racial psychological traits anthropometry involves systematic measurement physical properties human body primarily dimensional descriptors body size shapecitation needed since commonly used methods approaches analysing living standards helpful enough anthropometric history became useful historians answering questions interested today anthropometry plays important role industrial design clothing design ergonomics architecture statistical data distribution body dimensions population used optimize products changes lifestyles nutrition ethnic composition populations lead changes distribution body dimensions eg rise obesity require regular updating anthropometric data collections history anthropometry includes spans various concepts scientific pseudoscientific craniometry paleoanthropology biological anthropology phrenology physiognomy forensics criminology phylogeography human origins craniofacial description well correlations various anthropometrics personal identity mental typology personality cranial vault brain size factors various times history applications anthropometry ranged accurate scientific description epidemiological analysis rationales eugenics overtly racist social movementscitation needed one misuses discredited pseudoscience phrenology auxologic broad term covering study aspects human physical growth human height varies greatly individuals across populations variety complex biological genetic environmental factors among others due methodological practical problems measurement also subject considerable error statistical sampling average height genetically environmentally homogeneous populations often proportional across large number individuals exceptional height variation around deviation populations average within population sometimes due gigantism dwarfism caused specific genes endocrine important note great degree variation occurs even common bodies person considered average extreme population comparisons example average female height bolivia cm ft average male height dinaric alps cm ft average difference cm ft similarly shortest tallest individuals chandra bahadur dangi robert wadlow ranged cm ft ft age range females stop growing years age range males stop growing human weight varies extensively individually across populations extreme documented examples adults lucia zarate weighed kg lb jon brower minnoch weighed kg lb population extremes ranging kg lb bangladesh kg lb adult brain size varies cu cu females cu cu males average cu cu right cerebral hemisphere typically larger left whereas cerebellar hemispheres typically similar size size human stomach varies significantly adults one study showing volumes ranging cu cu weights ranging grams oz grams male female genitalia exhibit considerable individual variation penis size differing vaginal size differing significantly healthy human beauty physical attractiveness preoccupations throughout history often intersect anthropometric standards cosmetology facial symmetry ratio three examples measurements commonly thought fundamental anthropometric studies today conducted investigate evolutionary significance differences body proportion populations whose ancestors lived different environments human populations exhibit climatic variation patterns similar largebodied mammals following bergmanns rule states individuals cold climates tend larger ones warm climates allens rule states individuals cold climates tend shorter stubbier limbs warm climates microevolutionary level anthropologists use anthropometric variation reconstruct smallscale population history instance john relethfords studies early anthropometric data ireland show geographical patterning body proportions still exhibits traces invasions english norse centuries ago similarly anthropometric indices namely comparison human stature used illustrate anthropometric trends study
