molecules pass one direction slowmoving molecules pass kinetic temperature gas depends velocities constituent molecules demons actions cause one chamber warm cool would decrease total entropy system without applying work thereby violating second law thermodynamics concept maxwells demon provoked substantial debate philosophy science theoretical physics continues present day stimulated work

question suggested leó later léon szilárd pointed reallife maxwells demon would need means measuring molecular speed act acquiring information would require expenditure energy since demon gas interacting must consider total entropy gas demon combined expenditure energy demon cause increase entropy demon larger lowering entropy gas rolf landauer raised exception realized measuring processes need increase thermodynamic entropy long thermodynamically reversible suggested reversible measurements could used sort molecules violating second law however due connection entropy thermodynamics information theory also meant recorded measurement must erased words determine whether let molecule demon must acquire information state molecule either discard store discarding leads immediate increase entropy demon store indefinitely charles bennett showed however well prepared eventually demon run information storage space must begin erase information previously erasing information thermodynamically irreversible process increases entropy system although bennett reached conclusion szilards paper maxwellian demon could violate second law entropy would created reached different reasons regarding landauers principle minimum energy dissipated deleting information experimentally measured eric lutz et al furthermore lutz et al confirmed order approach landauers limit system must asymptotically approach zero processing john earman john norton argued szilárd landauers explanations maxwells demon begin assuming second law thermodynamics violated demon derive properties demon assumption including necessity consuming energy erasing information would therefore circular invoke derived properties defend second law demonic argument bennett later acknowledged validity earman nortons argument maintaining landauers principle explains mechanism real systems violate second law although argument landauer bennett answers consistency second law thermodynamics whole cyclic
