emotion perception refers capacities abilities recognizing identifying emotions others addition biological physiological processes involved emotions typically viewed three components subjective experience physical changes cognitive appraisal emotion perception ability make accurate decisions anothers subjective experience interpreting physical changes sensory systems responsible converting observed changes mental representations ability perceive emotion believed innate subject environmental influence also critical component social interactions emotion experienced interpreted depends perceived likewise emotion perceived dependent past experiences interpretations emotion accurately perceived humans emotions perceived visually audibly smell also bodily sensations process believed different perception nonemotional material emotions perceived visual auditory olfactory taste physiological sensory processes nonverbal actions provide social partners information subjective emotional states nonverbal information believed hold special importance sensory systems certain brain regions suspected specialize decoding emotional information rapid efficient processing visual system primary mode perception way people receive emotional information people use emotional cues displayed social partners make decisions regarding affective state emotional cues form facial expressions actually combination many distinct muscle groups within face bodily postures alone relation others found interpretation situation environment known particular emotional properties ie funeral wedding war zone scary alley etc visual system means emotional information gathered cognitive interpretation evaluation information assigns emotional value garners appropriate cognitive resources initiates physiological response process means exclusive visual perception fact may overlap considerably modes perception suggesting emotional sensory system comprising multiple perceptual processes processed similar channels great deal research conducted emotion perception revolves around people perceive emotion others facial expressions whether emotion contained someones face classified categorically along dimensions valence arousal face provides reliable cues ones subjective emotional state efficient humans identifying recognizing emotion anothers face accuracy goes considerably emotions exception happiness facial features inverted ie mouth placed eyes nose suggesting primary means facial perception includes identification spatial features resemble prototypical face two eyes placed nose mouth formation features immediately constitute face requires extra spatial manipulation identify features resembling face research classification perceived emotions centered around debate two fundamentally distinct viewpoints one side debate posits emotions separate discrete entities whereas side suggests emotions classified values dimensions valence positive versus negative arousal calmsoothing versus excitingagitating psychologist paul ekman supported discrete emotion perspective groundbreaking work comparing emotion perception expression literate preliterate ekman concluded ability produce perceive emotions universal innate emotions manifest categorically basic emotions anger disgust fear happiness sadness contempt surprise possibly contempt alternative dimensional view garnered support psychologist james russell best known contributions toward circumplex emotion russell described emotions constructs lie dimensions valence arousal combination values delineate psychologist robert plutchik sought reconcile views proposed certain emotions considered primary emotions grouped either positively negatively combined form complex emotions sometimes considered secondary emotions remorse guilt submission anticipation plutchik created wheel emotions outline culture plays significant role emotion perception notably facial perception although features face convey important information upper eyesbrow lower mouthnose regions face distinct qualities provide consistent conflicting information values etiquette quality social interactions vary across cultures facial perception believed moderated accordingly western cultures overt emotion ubiquitous emotional information primarily obtained viewing features mouth expressive part face however eastern cultures overt emotional expression less common therefore mouth plays lesser role emotional expression emotional information often obtained viewing upper region face primarily cultural differences suggest strong environmental learned component emotion expression emotion perception although facial expressions convey key emotional information context also plays important role providing additional emotional information modulating emotion actually perceived facial expression contexts come three categories stimulusbased context face physically presented sensory input informational value perceiverbased context processes within brain body perceiver shape emotion perception cultural contexts affect either encoding understanding facial auditory system provide important emotional information environment voices screams murmurs music convey emotional information emotional interpretations sounds tend quite consistent traditionally emotion perception voice determined research studies analyzing via prosodic parameters pitch duration way speaker expresses emotion known encoding alternatively listener attempts identify particular emotion intended speaker decode emotion sophisticated methods include manipulating synthesizing important prosodic parameters speech signal eg pitch duration loudness voice quality natural simulated affective pitch duration tend contribute emotional recognition music long known emotional qualities popular strategy emotion regulation asked rate emotions present classical music music professionals could identify six basic emotions happiness sadness represented decreasing order importance anger fear surprise emotions happiness sadness fear peacefulness perceived short length exposure little including instrumentalonly music aromas scents also influence mood example humans extract emotional information scents facial expressions emotional music odors may able exert effects learning conscious perception responses typically associated particular odors learned association matched emotional experiences indepth research documented emotion elicited odors pleasant unpleasant affects physiological correlates emotion seen sensory theories emotion focused perception subjective experience appraisal predominant theories emotion emotion perception include type emotion perceived emotion perceived somatically stage event emotion perceived translated subjective physical experience following influence ren√© descartes ideas regarding split body mind william james proposed theory human body acts response emotional state common sense might suggest rather interpret emotions basis already present bodily state words james feel sad cry angry strike afraid tremble neither cry strike tremble sorry angry fearful case may james believed particular distinct physical patterns map onto specific experienced emotions contemporaneously psychologist carl lange arrived conclusion experience emotions thus idea felt emotion result perceiving specific patterns bodily responses called jameslange theory support jameslange theory emotion silvan tomkins proposed facial feedback hypothesis suggested facial expressions actually trigger experience emotions way around theory tested james laird experiment laird asked participants hold pencil either teeth artificially producing smile upper lip nose artificially producing frown rate cartoons laird found cartoons rated funnier participants holding pencil teeth addition paul ekman recorded extensive physiological data participants posed basic emotional facial expressions found heart rate raised sadness fear anger yet change al happiness surprise disgust skin temperature raised participants posed anger emotions contemporary psychologists still agree jameslange theory emotion human subjective emotion complex physical reactions antecedents fully explain subjective emotional experience walter bradford cannon doctoral student philip bard agreed physiological responses played crucial role emotions believe physiological responses alone could explain subjective emotional experiences argued physiological responses slow relative relatively rapid intense subjective awareness emotion often emotions similar imperceptible people short timescale cannon proposed mind body operate independently experience emotions differing brain regions cortex versus subcortex process information emotionproducing stimulus independently simultaneously resulting emotional physical response best illustrated imagining encounter grizzly bear would simultaneously experience fear begin sweat experience elevated heart rate attempt run things would happen stanley schachter doctoral student jerome singer formulated theory emotion based evidence without actual emotionproducing stimulus people unable attribute specific emotions bodily states believed must cognitive component emotion perception beyond physical changes subjective feelings schachter singer suggested someone encounters emotionproducing stimulus would immediately recognize bodily symptoms sweating elevated heart rate case grizzly bear emotion fear theory devised result study participants injected either stimulant adrenaline causes elevated heart rate sweaty palms shaking placebo participants either told effects drug told nothing placed room person know according research plan would either play hula hoop make paper airplanes euphoric condition ask participant intimate personal questions angry condition found participants knew effects drug attributed physical state effects drug however knowledge drug received attributed physical state situation person room results led conclusion physiological reactions contributed emotional experience facilitating focused cognitive appraisal given physiologically arousing event appraisal defined subjective emotional experience emotions thus result twostage process first physiological arousal response evoking stimulus second cognitive elaboration context stimulus emotion perception primarily cognitive process driven particular brain systems believed specialize identifying emotional information subsequently allocating appropriate cognitive resources prepare body respond relationship various regions still unclear key regions implicated particular aspects emotion perception processing including areas suspected involved processing faces emotional information fusiform face area part fusiform gyrus area believe specialize identification processing human faces although others suspect responsible distinguishing well known objects cars animalscitation needed neuroimaging studies found activation area response participants viewing images prototypical faces scrambled inverted faces suggesting region specialized processing human faces material area area increasing debate psychologists may approach fusiform face area simplistic manner specializes processing human faces likely area implicated visual processing many objects particularly familiar prevalent environment impairments ability recognize subtle differences faces would greatly inhibit emotion perception processing significant implications involving social

child escape however biases considered maladaptive anger overidentified inappropriate contexts may result development psychopathology researchers employ several methods designed examine biases toward emotional stimuli determine salience particular emotional stimuli population differences emotion perception also attentional biases toward away emotional stimuli tasks commonly utilized include modified stroop task dot probe task visual search tasks spatial cuing tasks stroop task modified stroop task displays different types words eg threatening neutral varying colors participant asked identify color word ignoring actual semantic content increased response time indicate color threat words relative neutral words suggests attentional bias toward stroop task however interpretational addition lack allowance measurement spatial attention address limitations stroop task dot probe task displays two words pictures computer screen either one top left bottom right respectively brief stimuli presentation often less probe appears location one two stimuli participants asked press button indicating location probe different response times target eg threat neutral stimuli infer attentional biases target information shorter response times probe place target stimuli indicating attention bias type another task examines spatial attentional allocation visual search task asks participants detect target stimulus embedded matrix distractors eg angry face among several neutral emotional faces vice versa faster detection times find emotional stimuli among neutral stimuli slower detection times find neutral stimuli among emotional distractors infer attentional bias spatial cuing task asks participants focus point located two rectangles point cue presented either form
