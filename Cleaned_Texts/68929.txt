halogenated ether subcategory larger group chemicals known ethers ether organic chemical contains ether oxygen atom connected two substituted alkyl groups good example ether solvent diethyl differentiates halogenated ether types ethers substitution halogenation one hydrogen atoms halogen atom halogen atoms include fluorine chlorine bromine perhaps common use halogenated ethers first widely used inhalation anesthetic diethyl ether nonsubstituted nonhalogenated ether drug enabled surgeons perform otherwise painful operations patients rendering diethyl ether unfortunate disadvantage extremely flammable especially presence enriched oxygen property resulted many instances fires even explosions operating rooms surgery among important reasons diethyl ether fallen favor general anesthetic diethyl ether still commonly used solvent reagent organic chemistry laboratories though diethyl ether initially replaced nonflammable toxic halogenated hydrocarbons chloroform trichloroethylene halothane another halogenated hydrocarbon anesthetic agent introduced clinical practice due ease use improved safety profile respect organ toxicity halothane quickly replaced chloroform trichloroethylene inhalation anesthetics current clinical use halogenated ethers except halothane halogenated hydrocarbon haloalkane nitrous oxide halogenated ethers advantages nonflammable well less toxic earlier general anesthetics halogenated ethers differ ethers contain least one halogen atom molecule examples halogenated ethers include general anesthetics isoflurane desflurane sevoflurane however halogenated ethers anesthetic effects compounds flurothyl opposite stimulant convulsant effects inhalation anesthetics vaporized mixed gases prior inhalation patient surgery gases always include oxygen air may also include gases nitrous oxide helium surgical situations drugs opiates used pain skeletal muscle relaxants used cause temporary paralysis additional drugs midazolam may used produce amnesia surgery although newer intravenous anesthetics propofol increased options anesthesiologists halogenated ethers remain mainstay general anesthesia httpsenwikipediaorgwikihalogenatedether
