biology paternal care parental investment provided male offspring complex social behaviour vertebrates associated animal mating systems life history traits paternal care may provided concert mother biparental care rarely male alone called exclusive paternal care provision care either males females presumed increase growth rates quality andor survival young hence ultimately increase inclusive fitness variety vertebrate species eg males females invest heavily offspring many biparental species socially monogamous individuals remain mate least one breeding season exclusive paternal care evolved multiple times variety organisms including invertebrates fishes male mammals employ different behaviors enhance reproductive success eg courtship displays mate choice however benefits paternal care rarely studied mammals largely mammals exhibit care mostly present primates rodents species males provide extensive care offspring indirect evidence suggests costs example mammalian fathers care young may undergo changes body mass increase production number costly hormones eg androgens glucocorticoids nonetheless evidence suggest across mammals males carry groom offspring female partner fecundity increases males provision females litter size tend human cultures societies vary widely expression paternal care cultures recognize paternal care via celebration fathers day according carta

males males compete one another access although paternal care rare among mammalians males across many primate species still play paternal role infant care paternal care hypothesis paternal care investment designated biological offspring increasing infants chance survival therefore increasing males hypothesis requires male use recognition behavioural cues distinguish offspring paternal uncertainty high multimalemultifemale primate groups males must use cues recognize bias care towards offspring allows males provide short longterm investment primates living monogamous pairs singlemale groups exhibit high paternity certainty assist paternal care hypothesis mating effort hypothesis males provide care infants order increase mating opportunities means males likely engage affiliative behaviours infant presence mother form male mating effort order enhance future reproductive theory independent genetics evolved independent paternity maternal relief hypothesis males provide care infants help reduce reproductive burdens female ultimately resulting shorter interbirth intervals successful stems male alleviating female parental duties order keep resources becoming depleted subsequently allowing produce high quality milk similarly mating effort hypothesis maternal relief hypothesis independent genetics require male biological father take part infant care several species rodents studied models paternal care including prairie voles microtus ochrogaster campbells dwarf hamster mongolian gerbil african striped mouse california mouse peromyscus californicus monogamous rodent exhibits extensive essential paternal care hence studied model organism one study species found fathers larger hindlimb muscles nonbreeding quantitative genetic analysis identified several genomic regions affect paternal fathers contribute equally mothers care offspring many bird species sometimes including incubating eggs paternal care associated biparental care socially monogamous mating systems species approximately species fathers provide care eggs unusually high incidence paternal care birds compared vertebrate taxa often assumed stem extensive resource requirements production flightcapable offspring contrast bats extant flying vertebrate lineage care offspring provided females although males may help guard pups contrast large clutch sizes found many bird species biparental care bats typically produce single offspring may limitation related lack male help suggested though without controversy paternal care ancestral form parental care paternal care occurs number species anuran including glass frogs according encyclopedia fish physiology genome environment known fish families show form parental care often time care provided one parent usually male male care much common female care biparental care accounting although recent comparative analysis suggests male care may common three common theoretical explanations high levels paternal care fish third one currently favoured first external fertilization protects paternity loss however sneaker tactics strong sperm competition evolved many times second earlier release eggs sperm gives females opportunity flee however many paternal care species eggs sperm released simultaneously third male already protecting valuable spawning territory order attract females defending young adds minimal parental investment giving males lower relative cost parental one wellknown example paternal care seahorses males brood eggs brood pouch ready hatch males centrarchidae sunfish family exhibit paternal parental care eggs fry variety behaviors nest guarding nest fanning aerating jawfish female lays eggs male takes mouth male eggs mouth one time male cant feed hosts young young get older spend time sometimes termed mouthbrooding breeding season male threespined sticklebacks defend nesting territories males attract females spawn nests defend breeding territory intruders predators spawning female leaves males territory male solely responsible care eggs incubation period male fans oxygenates eggs removes rotten eggs debris defends territory even embryos hatch father sticklebacks continue tend newly hatched offspring days chasing retrieving fry stray nest spitting back paternal care rare occurs species including giant water arachnid iporangaia pustulosa several species crustaceans males provide care offspring building defending burrows nest exclusive paternal care males provide sole investment egglaying rarest form known taxa giant water bugs sea spiders two genera leaffooted bugs two genera assassin bugs three genera phlaeothripid thrips three genera harvestmen millipedes family mathematical models related prisoners dilemma suggest female reproductive costs higher male reproductive costs males cooperate females even reciprocate view paternal care evolutionary achievement compensates higher energy demands reproduction typically involves models suggest basic lifehistory differences males females adequate explain evolutionary origins maternal paternal biparental care specifically paternal care likely male adult mortality high maternal care likely
