reason second common false belief saccade information passed optic nerve brain whereas low spatial frequencies fuzzier parts attenuated higher spatial frequencies images fine details would otherwise

saccade back image even longer visible shows brain somehow able take account intervening eye movement thought brain temporarily recording copy command eye movement comparing remembered image target called spatial updating neurophysiologists recorded cortical areas saccades spatial updating found memoryrelated signals get remapped saccadecitation needed also thought perceptual memory updated saccades information gathered across fixations compared synthesized however entire visual image updated saccade scientists believe visual working memory spatial updating eye movement accounted process retaining information across saccade called transsaccadic memory process integrating information one fixation called transsaccadic integration saccades widespread phenomenon across animals imageforming visual systems observed animals across three phyla including animals fovea vertebrates animals move eyes independently head therefore saccades serve humans primates increase effective visual resolution scene must additional reasons behavior frequently suggested reasons avoid blurring image would occur response time photoreceptor cell longer time given portion image stimulating photoreceptor image drifts across eye birds saccadic eye movements serve function avian retina highly developed thicker mammalian retina higher metabolic activity less vasculature obstruction greater visual retinal cells must obtain nutrients via diffusion choroid vitreous pecten specialised structure avian retina highly vascular structure projects vitreous humor experiments show saccadic eye
