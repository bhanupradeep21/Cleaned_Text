endocrinology parenting subject considerable study focus human females males females males mammalian species parenting adaptive problem mammals involves specific endocrine signals naturally selected respond infant cues environmental infants across species produce number cues inform caregivers needs include visual cues like facial characteristics species smiling auditory cues vocalizations olfactory cues tactile commonly mentioned hormone parenting however many hormones relay key information results variations behavior include estrogen progesterone prolactin cortisol testosterone hormones necessary expression maternal behavior may influence based cross species evidence aspects mechanisms phylogenetically conserved rodents meaning mechanisms adaptive mammalian parenting environment evolutionary adaptedness parenting mechanisms may evolved mammals first evolved importance mechanisms regulate parental investment inform offspring environment primarily involving responsiveness sensitivity commonly mentioned humans important parenting characteristics inform infants many nonhuman studies used potential models humans show phylogenetic conservation endocrine estrogen progesterone released ovaries pregnancy make oxytocin receptors sensitive female associated onset maternal behaviors species maestripieri found similar relationship estrogen progesterone increased pregnancy whereas oxytocin increased presence estrogen progesterone estradiol pregnant mammals species appears exhibit correlation maternal behavior mammals birth offspring well interactions however increase hormones influences maternal behavior always cause onset maternal behavior females studies primates increased estrogen progesterone negative absent correlation maternal responsivity black tuftedear common lowland alternatively one experimental study showed nulliparous rats tend avoid pups transfused postpartum rat blood high estrogen progesterone resulted responsiveness pups due variation species effects hormones listed give much weight phylogenetic conservation neuroendocrine mechanisms although saltzman points social structure species may social species previous exposure infants relies less hormones activate mechanisms modulating maternal behavior parenting behaviors always dependent hand nonhuman primates specifically lactating females multiple species alarming correlation increased estrogen progesterone species include black tuftedear rhesus endogenous signals increase estrogen compared decrease progesterone causes increase levels prolactin lactating hormone bloodstream furthermore exogenous cues infants suckling induces hormone oxytocin similarly prolactin found increase increase estrogen presence infant cues oxytocin found nonhuman species inhibit rejection oxytocin essential responsive sensitive specific examples include franciss study female rats linked high amount oxytocin receptors increased another study maestripieri linked oxytocin levels freeranging macaques increased nursing however experimental results less conclusive aforementioned nulliparous mice respond pup calls administered oxytocin similar study conducted holman goy tested nulliparous rhesus females behavior post injection elicit drastic response infants however adults presented change behavior notable increase proximity oxytocin often described hormone facilitates bonding one directly increases also mice responding pup calls rhesus macaque infants werent necessarily providing cues would induce maternal care support saltzman proposes due primates living socially slower developmental trajectory learning function oxytocin may lead increase maternal behavior subsequently reducing anxiety found regulate anxiety social recognition coping stress early studies found oxytocin influenced maternal behavior mother rats depending environment placed oxytocin seemed opposing effect anxiety placed novel environment opposed familiar one mother rats better able cope higher levels stress due increased oxytocin levelscitation needed like many nonhuman animals human mothers go period high progesterone pregnancy followed decrease progesterone subsequent increase estrogen prolactin oxytocin near parturition pregnancy postpartum high estradiol progesterone ratio associated mothers reporting higher feelings high levels progesterone associated pregnancy inhibits prolactin therefore prolactin increases initial stages lactation stimulated estrogen research however focuses role prolactin breastfeeding less prolactin increases infant suckling forms infant oxytocin hand increases suckling physical contact human oxytocin levels human females associated degree physical affection bonding feldman found mothers displayed high affectionate contact increased oxytocin levels post interaction mothers displayed low affectionate oxytocin believed provide feedback loop meaning maternalinfant contact increases oxytocin oxytocin increases maternal behavior facilitates one study oxytocin also played role mother reported attachment studies shown plasma oxytocin pregnant women higher compared nonpregnant wynneedwards timonin recognize paternal care primed way maternal care simply males undergo pregnancy therefore males go hormonal changes simplest way natural selection paternal care evolve maintained use similar pathways wynne reburn suggest fathers pair bonded spend time soon mother may activate paternal pathways various estradiol increases offsprings birth blacktuftedear marmosets dwarf hamsters possibly activates certain pathways involved paternal similar estrogen progesterone pregnant females however manipulation estradiol increase decrease paternal may similar finding women breastfeed vaginal births still responds like expecting new mothers fathers multiple mammals elevated prolactin levels compared nonfathers species include california mongolian dwarf cottontop however previously listed studies different cues associated different paternal behaviors may due species specific mechanisms simply different contexts species biparental elevated prolactin levels males exclusive fatherscitation needed variable results effects oxytocin paternal care males different species oxytocin levels unchanged california mice becoming amount paternal exposure rats associated increase oxytocin increased however multiple studies biparental species show association paternal care since species studies biparental excluding rats unclear california mice change oxytocin postpartum human mothers oxytocin associated high physical contact affection however studies fathers show oxytocin related high stimulatory contact exploratory supports three hypotheses one study exhibited proposed effects oxytocin tsimane men hunting varying periods time men returned home found oxytocin levels higher men hunted longer periods time result longer time period spent hunting increased levels oxytocin thought interconnected familial social contact dating back humans evolutionary pastcitation needed across multiple species cases across sexes evidence phylogenetic conservation parental hormones include relationships hormones estrogen progesterone prolactin oxytocin males across species including humans increased prolactin levels associated nonhuman primates humans increase estrogen progesterone pregnancy often followed decrease progesterone increase prolactin one study utilized silastic implants containing estradiol progesterone implanted nulliparous rats either maintained function pituitary glands underwent hypophysectomy determine length time maternal care ensue rats hypophysectomies exposed conditions days affected treatment consequently induce maternal behavior however found rats functioning pituitary glands exhibited maternal behavior within days studies females across species estrogen progesterone prepartum also related although relationships hormones similar across species variation degree oxytocin effects behavior example species like rats increase oxytocin greatly increases interactions increase oxytocin macaques mildly increased however importance oxytocin increased interactions relevant cited studies well majority studies cited fathers across species effects oxytocin variable however general oxytocin associated increased paternal human fathers increased oxytocin linked increased involvement however type involvement different fathers mothers fathers focus stimulatory contact exploratory human mothers oxytocin associated general care one study examined effects intranasal oxytocin spray administration relation individuals childhood experiences punishment maternal love found oxytocin effects absent individuals experienced high maternal love withdrawal indicating parental behavior associated withdrawal causes alterations genetic expression endogenous oxytocin levels affects children adulthood contrary positive effects oxytocin maternal behavior heightened levels cortisol postpartum linked decrease maternal care nonhuman species including western lowland japanese rhesus however evidence support increase cortisol levels pregnancy results increased maternal care two baboon variation possibly shows ontogenetic difference role cortisol functions prolactin extensively studied rats revealed effects profound role maternal care role prolactin found induce maternal behavior nulliparous rats exposed hypophysectomized steroid treatment noted prolactin secreting pituitary implants placed kidney capsule caused shortened latency participate maternal behavior towards foster functions prolactin extensively studied rats revealed effects profound role maternal care role prolactin found induce maternal behavior nulliparous rats exposed hypophysectomized steroid treatment noted prolactin secreting pituitary implants placed kidney capsule caused shortened latency participate maternal behavior towards foster pups different study used nonhypophysectomized steroidtreated nulliparous rats exposed dopamine agonist called bromocriptine used decrease release bromocriptine turn consequently lowered maternal behavioral tendency foster young pups conversely bromocriptine used conjunction prolactin maternal behavior returned another experiment also utilized bromocriptine inhibit release prolactin mother rats lactating pups inhibition prolactin release appears indicate critical period development prolactin mechanisms within pups one study demonstrated deficiency prolactin postnatal period rats potential affect maternal study bromocriptinetreated juvenile rats exhibited hyperactivity distractibility pups maternal behavior test suggesting importance prolactin promote maternal behavior adult rats also treated bromocriptine showed similar differences exposed pups opposed control rats exhibited maternal tendencies towards pups determined prolactin deficiency may lead disruptions maternal behavior adulthood affect neural substrates promote maternal behavior behavioral deficits caused developmental delay systems regulating maternal cortisol human mothers elevated human mothers elevated cortisol pregnancy easily recognized attracted infants odors postpartum affect maternal attitudes toward behaviorally mothers higher levels cortisol postpartum displayed higher levels affectionate women higher cortisol levels also alert sympathetic infant fleming colleagues discovered variation cortisol affected mothers one offspring one cortisol levels high women one offspring displayed affectionate contact women multiple offspring spent time caretaking activities however authors report whether two groups women significantly different levels cortisol different specific levels cortisol may contributing factor different behaviors couvade syndrome sympathy pregnancy defined masoni colleagues fathers two pregnancy human fathers couvade syndrome higher levels prolactin cortisol levels fathers crossculturally couvade syndrome associated close mother father prior birth postpartum period fathers invested direct increased paternal care likely associated offspring survival study canadian fathers found birth infant fathers significantly higher prolactin cortisol fathers prolactin cortisol levels correlated mothers although levels significantly higher provides evidence wynne reburns hypothesis mothers may provide cues father activate paternal care separate study fathers higher prolactin compared fathers responded positively infant levels also positively correlated father experience study cortisol levels response infant cries negatively correlated father experience higher cortisol levels associated higher father alertness responsiveness infant crying increased levels cortisol response infant cries greater inexperienced behaviors associated elevated cortisol levels appears related whether mother pre postpartum however behaviors varied across species multiple studies nonhuman females across species found high levels cortisol postpartum linked low levels maternal however cortisol levels high pregnancy increase maternal difference hold true humans females first time fathers increased cortisol levels general increased maternal increased cortisol levels first time human fathers correlated increase responsiveness infants crying fathers one studies conducted show interaction brain circuits respond babystimuli infant cries testosterone oxytocin pathways found acute amounts testosterone oxytocin administered nulliparous women exposed infant cries cause decreased responses amygdala increased insula inferior frontal gyrus responses alterations responses within brain regions seen induce maternal behaviors speculation increasing availability testosterone oxytocin alters maternal brain induce nonaversive response infant cries commonly associated hormone males testosterone believed antiparental hormone inhibits activation paternal many cases testosterone levels decrease fathers actively care infants however testosterone converted estradiol supports paternal testosterone converted estradiol process stated previously repeated presence pups nonparental rats caregiving mechanisms inhibit mechanism like avoidance similar inhibitions occur male male marmosets hold infants increased testosterone response novel females otherwise would words holding infant inhibited mating mechanisms could mean caregiving supersedes mating situations example may adaptive continue invest current offspring rather potentially create another multiple studies fathers shown reduction testosterone results increased responsiveness infant fathers general lower testosterone testosterone human males decreases number offspring human males however human males higher level testosterone greater activation neural mechanisms interacting may due activation paternal protection species variation behaviors associated testosterone biparental species noted across species father
