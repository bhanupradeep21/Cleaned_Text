sensory ecology relatively new field focusing information organisms obtain environment includes questions information obtained obtained mechanism information useful organism function sensory ecology study organisms acquire process respond information environment individual organisms interact environment consisting animate inanimate components exchange materials energy sensory information ecology generally focused exchanges matter energy sensory interactions generally studied influences behavior functions certain physiological systems sense organs relatively new area sensory ecology emerged researchers focus questions concerning information field covers topics ranging neurobiological mechanisms sensory systems behavioral patterns employed acquisition sensory information role sensory

marine amphibious pests managers used sensory ecology create highly individualized visual pheromonal chemical traps pests visual traps important management number insect species example tsetse flies vector african trypanosomiasis sleeping sickness attracted blue colors flies therefore lured killed blue fabric traps imbued scientists believe flies attracted blue fabrics blue colors similar color ground shady tree since flies must seek cool places heat day blue colors exploitation visual cues also used control aphids whiteflies many aphid species show strong preference yellow colors scientists
