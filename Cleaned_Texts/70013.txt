body transfer illusion illusion owning either part body entire body ones thus sometimes referred body ownership research literature induced experimentally manipulating visual perspective subject also supplying visual sensory signals correlate subjects occur bottomup perceptual mechanisms input visual information must override topdown knowledge certain body part belong results illusion transfer body typically induced using virtual ehrsson spence passingham studies rubber hand illusion originally reported botvinick cohen subjects normal brain function positioned left hand hidden sight saw lifelike rubber left hand front experimenters stroked subjects hidden left hand visible rubber hand paintbrush experiment showed two hands stroked synchronously direction subjects began experience rubber hand asked use right hand point left hand time pointed toward rubber hand real rubber hands stroked different directions different times subjects experience rubber hand experiment going experimenters also recorded activity brains functional mri scanner scans showed increased activity parietal lobe right subjects began experience rubber hand premotor cortex region brain involved planning movements hand stroking real rubber hands uncoordinated subjects experience rubber hand premotor cortex become activated experimenters concluded parietal cortex involved visual touch processing premotor cortex getting transmitted information parietal cortex involved feeling ownership rubber hand another study laboratory provided evidence ownership rubber hand ehrsson et al slater et al experimenters used procedure previous experiment establish feeling ownership involved stimulation premotor cortex threatened rubber hand making stabbing movement toward needle actually making contact rubber hand mri scans showed increase activity region brain called anterior cingulate cortex normally activated person anticipates pain along supplementary motor area normally activated person feels urge move arm fried et al peyron laurent garcialarrea anticipation needle made subjects react rubber hand moving real hand avoid needle even though never actually one ways body transfer illusion studied virtual reality simulation first person perspective lifesized virtual human female body appeared substitute male subjects body demonstrated subjectively questionnaire physiologically heartrate deceleration response threat virtual body results support notion bottomup perceptual mechanisms involving premotor cortex cerebellum temporarily override top knowledge therefore resulting radical illusion transfer body ownership study male participants entered virtual reality simulation experienced various forms stimulation including armstroking physical sensations afterwards heart rate monitored questionnaire body transfer illusion used order treat experience phantom limb pain giving visual feedback missing limb mirror box gives visual feedback allow person using opportunity see missing hand manipulate hand attempt relieve pain discomfort virtual reality also used treat phantom limb pain similar way allowing user see missing limb within virtual world manipulate however choose integration touch stimulation via somatosensory system visual input essential creating body transfer illusion body motion perceives position space integration multimodal afferent signals motion body adds efferent signal information leads fluid perception body transfer information one form signal eg touch match signals another sense eg vision body still attempts integrate specifically rubber hand illusion associated activity multisensory areas notably ventral premotor cortex however remains demonstrated illusion simply reflect dominant role vision premotor activity reflect visual representation object near ketamine body transfer illusion ultimately enhanced participants vulnerable false sense limb ownership without use ketamine although precise nature ketamines impact speculative two features effects noteworthy first promotes overall increase subjective behavioral indices illusion second effect found even sensory asynchrony present manipulation would normally reduce experience illusion pattern may understood terms drugs impact balance would normally account illusions characteristic features since ketamine produces overall increase tendency illusion whereas sensitivity coherence visual tactile input preserved possibility ketamine enhances salience visual input sight rubber hand position compatible ones hand expense information arising temporal asynchrony sensory inputs would explain presence rubber hand enough enable illusion persist even attenuated form visuotactile inputs similar effect occurs administration dopamine noradrenaline releasing agent dextroamphetamine similarities include increased subjective reports embodiment rubber hand illusion dextroamphetamine enhancing effect also seen sensory asynchrony human bodily experience characterized immediate continuous experience body parts belong us often called selfattribution body ownership mineness unknown origin body representation innate constructed sensory related distinct
