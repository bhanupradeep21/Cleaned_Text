behavioral immune system phrase coined psychological scientist mark schaller refer suite psychological mechanisms allow individual organisms detect potential presence infectious parasites pathogens immediate environment engage behaviors prevent contact objects existence behavioral immune system documented across many animal species including humans theorized mechanisms comprise behavioral immune system evolved crude first line defense diseasecausing humans animals activating physiological immune response pathogens effective metabolically costly immune responses activated expense fitness enhancing inflammation infection also harmful body eg contribute diseases addition cultural adaptations avoid pathogens behavioral immune system acts set defense mechanisms protect pathogens infection occurs mechanisms behavioral immune system include sensory processes cues connoting presence parasitic infections perceived eg smell foul odor sight pox pustules well systems sensory cues trigger cascade aversive affective cognitive behavioral reactions eg arousal disgust automatic activation cognitions connote threat disease behavioral early current research behavioral immune system activation focused visual cues triggers elicit responses however recent work suggests sensory modalities may work disease studies show olfactory cues disease elicit disgust predict pathogen avoidance humans body odors diseased individuals rated less desirable perceived unhealthier intense less disgust body odors also influenced closeness source odor odors family members rated less disgusting body odors experimental studies showed presence aversive odors leads prophylactic behaviors willing condom lessdirect prophylactic behaviors like stricter punishment moral new body work linked olfactory acuity disgust behavioral immune system responses given olfactory cues pathogen threat often ambiguous overgeneralized better ability detect smells would lead better pathogen recent work suggests higher olfactory acuity may associated higher avoidance gustatory stimuli particularly spoiled foods elicit feels disgust motivate pathogen avoidance people disgust sensitivity predicted aversion novel foreign visual cues pathogen threat linked increases tactile sensitivity lead perceived people accents foreign especially among individuals higher disgust disgust sensitivity among individuals
