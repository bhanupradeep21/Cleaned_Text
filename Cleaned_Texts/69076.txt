hiccup scientific name singultus latin sob hiccup also spelled hiccough involuntary contraction myoclonic jerk diaphragm disability may repeat several times per minute hiccup involuntary action involving reflex arccitation needed triggered reflex causes strong contraction diaphragm followed quarter second later closure vocal cords results hic sound hiccups may occur individually may occur bouts rhythm hiccup time hiccups tends relatively constant bout hiccups generally resolves without intervention although many home remedies often used attempt shorten medical treatment occasionally necessary cases chronic hiccups affect people ages even observed utero become less frequent advancing age intractable hiccups lasting month common adults males females affected equally often men likely develop protracted intractable dogs may also get hiccup consists single series breathing diaphragm spasms variable spacing duration brief less one half second unexpected shoulder abdomen throat full body tremor hiccups may present audible chirp squeak hupp controlled quick inhaling gasp sigh sniff may also present brief distracting painful interruptions normal breathing sudden momentary pain throat chest abdomencitation needed hiccups may triggered number common human conditions rare cases sign serious medical problems myocardial leading hypothesis hiccups evolved facilitate greater milk consumption young coordination breathing swallowing suckling complicated process air inevitably enters stomach occupying space could otherwise optimally used calorierich milkcitation needed hypothesis suggests presence air bubble stomach stimulates sensory afferent limb reflex receptors stomach esophagus along underside diaphragm triggers active part hiccup efferent limb sharply contracting muscles breathing relaxing muscles esophagus closing vocal cords prevent air entering lungs creates suction chest pulling air stomach esophagus respiratory muscles relax air expelled mouth effectively burping animalcitation needed number characteristics hiccups support theory burping suckling infant may increase capacity milk bringing significant survival advantage strong tendency infants get hiccups although reflex persists throughout life decreases frequency age location sensory nerves trigger reflex suggests response condition stomach component reflex suppresses peristalsis esophagus airway actively blocked suggests esophagus involved additionally hiccups described mammals group animals share trait suckling youngcitation needed international respiratory research group composed members canada france japan proposed hiccup evolutionary remnant earlier amphibian amphibians tadpoles gulp air water across gills via rather simple motor reflex akin mammalian hiccuping motor pathways enable hiccuping form early fetal development motor pathways enable normal lung ventilation form thus hiccup evolutionarily antecedent modern lung respiration additionally group c straus et al points hiccups amphibian gulping inhibited elevated may stopped gabab receptor agonists illustrating possible shared physiology evolutionary heritage proposals may explain premature infants spend time hiccuping possibly gulping like amphibians lungs yet fully phylogenetic hypothesis may explain hiccups evolutionary remnant held amphibious hypothesis questioned complexity mammalian hiccup reflex compared amphibian breathing reflex fact explain reason glottic closure short contraction hiccup unlikely significant strengthening effect slowtwitch muscles respirationcitation needed fetal intrauterine hiccups two types physiological type occurs prior twentyeight weeks conception tends last five ten minutes hiccups part fetal development associated myelination phrenic nerve primarily controls thoracic diaphragmcitation needed phylogenetic burping hypotheses mutually exclusive phylogeny hypothesis could explain hiccup reflex might evolved burping hypothesis could explain would offer enough evolutionary advantage persist increase complexitycitation needed episodes hiccups usually last minutes prolonged attacks rare serious root causes prolonged hiccups episodes difficult diagnosefailed verification attacks cause significant morbidity even episode lasting minutes termed bout bout hours termed persistent protracted hiccups lasting longer month termed intractable many cases single hemidiaphragm usually left one affected although may hiccups normally waited fit usually pass quickly folk cures hiccups common varied hiccups treated medically severe persistent termed intractable numerous medical remedies exist particular treatment known especially effective generally lack highquality many drugs used baclofen chlorpromazine metoclopramide gabapentin various protonpump inhibitors hiccups secondary cause like gastroesophageal reflux disease esophageal webs dealt treating underlying disorder phrenic nerve blocked temporarily injection procaine permanently bilateral phrenicotomy forms surgical destruction even rather drastic treatment cure cases howevercitation needed haloperidol metoclopramide chlorpromazine used cases intractable hiccups effective treatment sedatives often requires dose renders person either unconscious highly lethargic hence medicating sedatives appropriate shortterm affected individual continue normal life activities effectcitation needed vagus nerve stimulator used intractable case hiccups sends rhythmic bursts electricity brain way vagus nerve passes neck food drug administration approved vagus nerve stimulator way control seizures patients one person persistent digital rectal massage coincided terminating intractable many superstitious folk remedies hiccups including headstanding drinking glass water upsidedown frightened someone breathing bag eating large spoonful peanut butter placing sugar infants rarely hiccup feeding position one trick works well drinking water slowly semirecumbent positioncitation needed also possible mentally meditate relax muscles causing hiccup thus stop hiccupcitation needed acupressure either actual function placebo effect may cure hiccups people example one technique relax chest shoulders find deepest points indentations directly protrusions collarbones index middle fingers inserted indents pressed firmly sixty seconds long deep breaths simple treatment involves increasing partial pressure inhibiting diaphragm activity holding ones breath rebreathing paper potential remedies suggested nhs choices include pulling knees chest leaning forward sipping icecold water swallowing granulated breathing exercise called suprasupramaximal inspiration ssmi shown stop persistent combines three principles hypercapnia diaphragm immobilization positive airway pressure first subject must exhale completely take deep breath must hold breath ten seconds ten seconds must take another small breath without exhaling hold breath five seconds without exhaling must take another small breath hold breath five seconds upon exhaling hiccups gone drinking straw ears plugged folk remedy scientific tool similar basis tested hiccups subjects results published journal american medical association device named fisst forced inspiratory suction swallow tool branded hiccaway study supports use fisst option stop transient hiccups participants reporting better results home remedies hiccaway stops hiccups forceful suction generated diaphragm contraction phrenic nerve activity followed swallowing water requires epiglottis word hiccup created imitation alternative
