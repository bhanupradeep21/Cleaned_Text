antiimmunoglobulin antibodies defined protein detects antibodies organism specifically antiimmunoglobulin antibodies created bcells antibodies bind immunoglobulins immunoglobulins two regions constant region variable region constant region involved effector function variable region involved recognizing binding antigens antiimmunoglobulin antibodies may bind either variable constant region antiimmunoglobulin antibodies type secondary antibody able detect primary antibodies multiple methods western blot immunohistochemistry immunofluorescence staining flow cytometry antiimmunoglobulin antibodies created recombinant dna technology production via recombinant dna technology allows highest level batchtobatch reproducibility method antibody engineering expand antibody compatibility multiple assay antiimmunoglobulin antibodies laboratorymade type clonal antibody clonal antibodies engineered laboratory mimic effects primary antibodies clonal antibodies either monoclonal polyclonal monoclonal antibodies clones one antibody therefore monoclonal antibodies bind one target polyclonal antibodies clones multiple antibodies immune cells bind various recombinant clonal antibodies
