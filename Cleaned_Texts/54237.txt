human ethology study human behavior ethology discipline generally thought subcategory biology though psychological theories developed based ethological ideas eg sociobiology evolutionary psychology attachment theory theories human universals gender differences incest avoidance mourning hierarchy pursuit possession bridging biological sciences social sciences creates understanding human ethology international society human ethology dedicated advancing study understanding human ethology ethology roots study evolution especially evolutions increasing popularity darwins detailed observations became distinct discipline zoologists konrad lorenz niko tinbergen karl von three scientists known major contributors human ethology also regarded fathers founders ethology konrad lorenz niko tinbergen rejected theories relied stimuli learning alone elaborated concepts well understood instinct promoted theory evolution placed within creatures innate abilities responses certain stimuli advanced thriving species konrad lorenz also indicated earlier works animal behavior major reference human behavior believed research findings animal behaviors lead findings human behaviors well lorenz devoted much book die angeborenen formen moglicher erfahrung human behavior designated one important factors ethology testing hypothesis derived animal behavioral studies human behavioral studies due lorenz promoting similarities studying animal human behavior human ethology derived study anima founders ethology niko tinbergen karl von frisch received nobel prize overarching career discoveries concerning organization elicitation individual social behavior patterns many developmental psychologists eager incorporate ethological principles theories way explaining observable phenomenon babies could necessarily explained learning concepts john bowlby mary ainsworth used ethology prominently explain aspects attachment important attachment concepts related evolution later years ethology played large role sociobiological theory ultimately evolutionary psychology relatively new field study evolutionary psychology combines ethology primatology anthropology fields study modern human behavior adaptive ancestral human behaviors applied human behavior majority cases topical behavior results motivational states intensity specific external stimulus organisms high inner motivational state stimulus called appetitive behavior important concepts zooethology eg territoriality hierarchy sensitive periods ontogenesis also useful discussing human behavior iren√§us eibleibesfeldts book human important concepts applied human behavior human ethology contributed two particular ways understanding ontogeny behavior humans resulted first application techniques precise observation description classification naturally occurring behavior secondly ethological approach study behavior especially development behavior terms evolution particular interest questions relating function particular kind behavior eg attachment behavior adaptive value description behavioral repertoire species recognition patterns behavioral development classification established behavioral patterns prerequisites comparison different species organisms single species ethological approach study interaction organism certain innate speciesspecific structures environment organism genetically programmed invariant behavior patterns morphological basis mainly neuronal structures common members species depending kind behavior may also common genus family whole order eg primates even whole class eg mammals structures retrace follow evolutionary process environment produced structures especially nervous systems brains generate adaptive behavior organisms high level organization processes ethologist especially interested genetically preprogrammed motor perceptual processes facilitate social interaction communication facial expression vocalization consider highly developed means communication language speech found humans alone question arises biological foundation speciesspecific behavior perceptual skill ethologist examines question primarily point view ontogenetic development main strength human ethology application established interpretive patterns new problems based theories concepts methods proved successful animal ethology looks human behavior new viewpoint essence evolutionary perspective since ethologists relatively unaffected long history humanities often refer facts interpretations neglected social sciences look back history relationship life sciences social sciences find two prevailing modes theoretical orientation one hand reductionism ie attempts reduce human action noncognitive behavior attempts separate human action human society animal world completely advent theory evolution century brought easy solution problem nature nurture since could still solved either continuous discontinuous manner human ethology much discipline significantly contributes obsolescence simple dichotomies human ethology increasing influence dialogue human sciences humanities shown example book human bridging gap sciences body study behavior using two general methods naturalistic observation laboratory experimentation ethologists insistence observing organisms natural environment differentiates ethology related disciplines evolutionary psychology sociobiology naturalistic observation ranks one main contributions naturalistic observation ethologists believe order study speciesspecific behaviors species must observed natural environment one understand function behavior seeing specifically fits natural environment fulfill specific need ethologists follow specific set steps studying organism steps fall line tinbergens aims methods states every study behavior must answer four questions considered legitimate diversity important concept ethology evolutionary theory genetically culturally genetic diversity serves way populations adapt changing environments variation likely individuals population possess variations alleles suited environment individuals likely survive produce offspring bearing allele population continue generations success individuals population genetics includes several hypotheses theories regarding genetic diversity neutral theory evolution proposes diversity result accumulation neutral substitutions diversifying selection hypothesis two subpopulations species live different environments select different alleles particular locus may occur instance species large range relative mobility individuals within cultural diversity also important cultural transmission standpoint humans animals pass cumulative cultural knowledge offspring chimpanzees learn use tools watching chimps around humans able pool cognitive resources create increasingly complex solutions problems complex ways interacting environments diversity cultures points idea humans shaped environments also interact environments shape well cultural diversity arises different human adaptations different environmental factors turn shapes environment turn shapes human behavior cycle results diverse cultural representations ultimately add survival human species approach important way build bridge biological social sciences creates better understanding human one example human diversity sexual orientation ethologists long noted species animals display homosexual behaviors although offspring directly created homosexual behaviors closer look reveals genes homosexuality persist homosexuality could decrease competition heterosexual mates homosexual family members could increase resources available children siblings without producing offspring compete resources gay uncle theory thus creating better chances siblings offspring survive related offspring share homosexual individuals genes although lesser extent direct offspring would including genes homosexuality causes small stable chance future generations gay well even gay family member produces direct descendants httpsenwikipediaorgwikihumanethology
