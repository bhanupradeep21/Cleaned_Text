petals modified leaves surround reproductive parts flowers often brightly colored unusually shaped attract pollinators petals flower collectively known corolla petals usually accompanied another set modified leaves called sepals collectively form calyx lie beneath corolla calyx corolla together make perianth nonreproductive portion flower petals sepals flower difficult distinguish collectively called tepals examples plants term tepal appropriate include genera aloe tulipa conversely genera rosa phaseolus welldistinguished sepals petals undifferentiated tepals resemble petals referred petaloid petaloid monocots orders monocots brightly colored tepals since include liliales alternative name lilioid monocots although petals usually conspicuous parts animalpollinated flowers windpollinated species grasses either small petals lack entirely apetalous collection petals flower referred corolla role corolla plant evolution studied extensively since charles darwin postulated

different species plants vary greatly color color pattern visible light ultraviolet patterns often function guides pollinators variously known nectar guides pollen guides floral guides genetics behind formation petals accordance abc model flower development sepals petals stamens carpels modified versions appears mechanisms form petals evolved times perhaps rather evolving repeatedly pollination important step sexual reproduction higher plants pollen produced male flower male organs hermaphroditic flowers pollen move thus requires wind animal pollinators disperse pollen stigma nearby flowers however pollinators rather selective determining flowers choose pollinate develops competition flowers result flowers must provide incentives appeal pollinators unless flower selfpollinates involved wind pollination petals play major role competing attract pollinators henceforth pollination dispersal could occur survival many species flowers could prolong petals various functions purposes depending type plant general petals operate protect parts flower attractrepel specific pollinators positioning flower petals located flower corolla eg buttercup shiny yellow flower petals contain guidelines amongst petals aiding pollinator towards nectar pollinators ability determine specific flowers wish using incentives flowers draw pollinators set mutual relation case pollinators remember always guard pollinate flowers unless incentives consistently met competition petals could produce different scents allure desirable repel undesirable flowers also mimic scents produced materials decaying meat attract pollinators various color traits used different petals could attract pollinators poor smelling abilities come certain parts day flowers change color petals signal mutual

stigmas parts flower one example flower pohutukawa metrosideros excelsa acts regulate color different way pohutukawa contains small petals also bright large red clusters another attractive mechanism flowers use scents highly attractive humans one example rose hand flowers produce smell rotting meat attractive insects flies darkness another factor flowers adapted nighttime conditions limit vision
