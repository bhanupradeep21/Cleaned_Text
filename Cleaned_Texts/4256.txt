infectious diseases national institute allergy infectious diseases national institutes taubenbergers laboratory studies number viruses including influenza viruses iavs pathogens cause yearly flu epidemics caused periodic pandemics outbreak killed estimated one million people research aims inform public health strategies several important aspects flu seasonal flu avian flu circulates among birds infected humans past swine flu circulates among pigs infected humans past pandemic flu arise numerous sources spread quickly humans little immunity taubenberger born germany third son army

civilian physicians handled tens thousands cases yearly understanding may keep representative sample case way collected tissue samples people surgical autopsy material mostly form dicesized pieces tissue fixed formalin embedded wax blocks paraffin afip also worked veterinary diseases winter half population bottlenosed dolphins along atlantic seaboard united states died mysterious disease samples taken washed dolphins veterinary pathologist afip suspected viral infection albert osterhaus managed isolate morbillivirus dolphins fell victim similar disease mediterranean samples first dieoff considered degraded isolate viruses nevertheless taubenberger asked give try late kary mullis found way duplicate dna strands technique called polymerase chain reaction pcr using method molecular biologist amy krafft eventually managed isolate fragments morbillivirus rna team perfected techniques extract rna pcr highly degraded tissue set antisense rna strand case influenza morbilliviruses first copy back sense dna strand fearing government cutbacks taubenberger looked application pcr immense warehouse tissue samples afip eventually settled finding remains flu virus caused spanish flu warehouse stored wax blocks seventyseven soldiers died pandemic taubenbergers team searched samples victims succumbed initial viral infection subsequent bacterial pneumonia seven samples seemed promising genome flu virus includes base pairs decayed pieces small base pairs order make pcr work primers constructed ie short bit dna mirror sequences sequence two end points fragment bind fragment help polymerase bases added primers make copy millions copies gene segment labelled radioactive probe made separated thin gel running electric current across gel radioactive labels create black mark xray film put gel serum tests people witnessed spanish flu known virus belong subtype team looked available sequences influenza genes subtype find whether parts given gene virtually identical turned primers first aim clarify whether fragments flu virus left tissue samples laboratory work mostly done ann reid year find anything july amy krafft turned help got positive result case influenza pandemic success led reid test cases eventual positive signal tissue belonging army private named roscoe vaughan died september camp jackson south carolina pneumonia left lung right lung seems days behind progression disease virus still present side sequence matrix gene match known sequence exactly contaminant could ruled taubenbergers team isolated nine fragments viral rna five different genes decided send first publication nature editors rejected paper without even mailing experts peer review science sceptical first eventually published amounted percent haemagglutinin gene well small fragments four genes march summer team full sequence haemagglutinin point problem arose used half tissue available private roscoe vaughan one gene seemed probable ten genes virus could sequenced available material september tissue private called james downs succumbed influenza camp upton new york turned positive well march paper science also read johan hultin pathologist already tried isolate influenza virus victims buried alaskan permafrost called teller mission time unearthed bodies failed find live viruses never finished thesis pcr available realized time come try july offered taubenberger return brevig alaska received permission dig victims spanish flu time unearthed remains obese woman maybe thirty years old christened lucy fat protected lungs decay took turned lucys case fragments even smaller around base pairs compared case vaughan downs enough material sequence complete virus many times taubenberger reid managed generate complete haemagglutinin sequence confirm one got vaughan three cases vaughan downs lucy base pairs differed places best confirmation sequence haemagglutinin actually series papers team published complete genome influenza work funded veterans administration department defense completion genome numbered among breakthroughs year science elected paper year lancet sometime early taubenberger received manuscript novelist recently contacted dr stephen carter discovered taubenbergers work paper science wanted know whether taubenberger would interested reading first draft novel ambitious vaccine biotechnology company known immunological technologies resurrects spanish flu virus secrecy stateoftheart facility san diego california book taken almost three years research write carter looking someone critique scientific elements jeffery taubenberger seemed perfect candidate carters surprise taubenberger agreed read hefty manuscript despite workload scientific aspects story taubenberger responded strongly naval scenes set pacific taubenberger thought unresolved plot lines involving naval carrier task force played central role escalating international conflicts book later published ninth day creation carter relented added new section book involving battle scene us naval aircraft carrier advanced chinese nuclear attack submarine taubenberger agreed interviewed carter ongoing work sequencing strain research likely lead would strain ultimately reconstructed taubenberger reservations publishing gene sequences killer strain flu interview conducted placed online march interview dr jeffery taubenberger jeffery karl
