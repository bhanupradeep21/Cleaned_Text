heuristics ancient greek εὑρίσκω heurískō find discover process humans use mental shortcuts arrive decisions heuristics simple strategies humans even use quickly form judgments make decisions find solutions complex problems often involves focusing relevant aspects problem situation formulate heuristic processes used find answers solutions likely work correct always right judgments decisions based heuristics simply good enough satisfy pressing need situations uncertainty information sense differ answers given logic probability economist cognitive psychologist herbert simon introduced concept heuristics suggesting limitations rational decision making psychologists amos tversky daniel kahneman added field research cognitive bias work introduced specific heuristic models field expanded since argue pure laziness behind heuristics process others argue accurate decisions based every known factor consequence lessismore effect herbert simon formulated one first models heuristics known satisficing general research program posed question humans make decisions conditions rational choice theory met people decide simon also known father bounded rationality understood study match mismatch heuristics decision environments program later extended study ecological rationality early psychologists amos tversky daniel kahneman took different approach linking heuristics cognitive biases typical experimental setup consisted rule logic probability embedded verbal description judgement problem demonstrated peoples intuitive judgement deviated rule linda problem gives example deviation explained heuristic research called heuristicsandbiases program challenged idea human beings rational actors first gained worldwide attention science paper judgment uncertainty heuristics although originally proposed heuristics refined time research program changed field permanently setting research original ideas herbert simon taken gerd gigerenzer others according perspective study heuristics requires formal models allow predictions behavior made ex ante program three among others program shown heuristics lead fast frugal accurate decisions many realworld situations characterized two different research programs led two kinds models heuristics formal models informal ones formal models describe decision process terms algorithm allows mathematical proofs computer simulations contrast informal models verbal descriptions herbert simons satisficing heuristic used choose one alternative set alternatives situations uncertainty means total set alternatives consequences known knowable instance professional realestate entrepreneurs rely satisficing decide location invest develop new commercial areas believe get least x return within years take general satisficing defined alternative found aspiration level adapted satisficing reported across many domains instance heuristic car dealers use price used unlike satisficing amos tverskys eliminationbyaspect heuristic used alternatives simultaneously available decisionmaker gradually reduces number alternatives eliminating alternatives meet aspiration level specific attribute series selections people tend experience uncertainty exhibit inconsistency elimination aspects could used facing selections general process elimination aspects follows elimination aspects speculate choosing alternatives could help consumers maximize utility contrary holds selection result probabilistic process gradually eliminates simple example given amos tversky someone wants purchase new car first aspect take account might automatic transmission eliminate alternatives contain aspect alternatives feature eliminated another aspect given price limit process elimination continues occur alternatives elimination aspects well used early stage business angels decisionmaking process since facilitates fastdecisionmaking tool alternatives eliminated investors find critical defect potential another research also demonstrated elimination aspects widely used electricity contract logic behind two examples elimination aspects helps make decisions facing series complicated choices one may need make decision among alternatives limited intuitive computational facilities time however elimination aspects compensatory model could help make complex decisions since easier apply involves nonnumerical recognition heuristic exploits basic psychological capacity recognition order make inferences unknown quantities world two alternatives heuristic one two alternatives recognized infer recognized alternative higher value respect criterion example wimbledon tennis tournament andy roddick played tommy robredo one heard roddick robredo recognition heuristic leads prediction roddick win recognition heuristic exploits partial ignorance one heard player different strategy needed studies wimbledon shown recognition heuristic applied semiignorant amateur players predicted outcomes gentlemen single games well better seedings wimbledon experts heard players well atp recognition heuristic ecologically rational predicts well recognition validity substantially chance present case recognition players names highly correlated chances takethebest heuristic exploits basic psychological capacity retrieving cues memory order validity based cue values infers two alternatives higher value unlike recognition heuristic requires alternatives recognized thus applied recognition heuristic binary cues indicates higher criterion value heuristic defined search rule search cues order validity v stopping rule stop search finding first cue discriminates two alternatives ie one cue values decision rule infer alternative positive cue value higher criterion value validity vi cue defined proportion correct decisions ci vi ci ti ti number cases values two alternatives differ cue validity cue estimated samples observation takethebest remarkable properties comparison complex

tallying differentiates takethebest heuristic latter naturally discriminates based value applied aspect therefore lead opposing represent consider scenario prediction taking place whether team team b may successful upcoming season basketball team superior contributing aspects team success aspect team b greater team weighted objectively important others team success tallying heuristic would consider team successful due outperformance measures however takethebest would consider weighted value singular one team b superior determine team b would successful initial research tversky kahneman proposed three representativeness anchoring adjustment subsequent work identified many heuristics underlie judgment called judgment heuristics another type called evaluation heuristics used judge desirability possible psychology availability ease particular idea brought mind people estimate likely frequent event basis availability using availability infrequent event brought easily vividly mind heuristic overestimates likelihood example people overestimate likelihood dying dramatic event tornado terrorism dramatic violent deaths usually highly publicised therefore higher hand common mundane events hard bring mind likelihoods tend underestimated include deaths suicides strokes diabetes heuristic one reasons people easily swayed single vivid story large body statistical may also play role appeal lotteries someone buying ticket wellpublicised jubilant winners available millions people people judge whether english words begin k availability heuristic gives quick way answer question words begin come readily mind subjects give correct answer without counting large numbers words however heuristic also produce errors people asked whether english words k first position k third position use process easy think words begin k kangaroo kitchen kept harder think words k third letter lake acknowledge although objectively three times common leads people incorrect conclusion k common start another experiment subjects heard names many celebrities roughly equal numbers male female subjects asked whether list names included men women men list famous great majority subjects incorrectly thought vice versa women tversky kahnemans interpretation results judgments proportion based availability higher names betterknown one experiment occurred us presidential election participants asked imagine gerald ford winning others jimmy carter victory group subsequently viewed allocated candidate significantly likely win researchers found similar effect students imagined good bad season college football effect imagination subjective likelihood replicated several concepts availability affected recently frequently brought mind one study subjects given partial sentences complete words selected activate concept either hostility kindness process known priming interpret behavior man described short ambiguous story interpretation biased towards emotion primed priming greater effect greater interval initial task judgment decreased tversky kahneman offered availability heuristic explanation illusory correlations people wrongly judge two events associated explained people judge correlation basis ease imagining recalling two events representativeness heuristic seen people use categories example deciding whether person criminal individual thing high representativeness category similar prototype category people categorise things basis representativeness using representativeness heuristic representative meant two different senses prototype used comparison representative category representativeness also relation prototype thing effective problems heuristic involves attending particular characteristics individual ignoring common categories population called base rates thus people overestimate likelihood something rare property underestimate likelihood common property called base rate fallacy representativeness explains several ways human judgments break laws representativeness heuristic also explanation people judge cause effect make judgements basis similarity also said using representativeness heuristic lead bias incorrectly finding causal relationships things resemble one another missing cause effect different examples include belief emotionally relevant events ought emotionally relevant causes magical associative experiment used psychological profile tom w fictional graduate one group subjects rate toms similarity typical student nine academic areas including law engineering library science another group rate likely tom specialised area ratings likelihood governed probability resemble base rates ie proportion students nine areas separately estimated third group people based judgments probability would say tom likely study humanities library science many humanities students additional information profile vague unreliable instead ratings likelihood matched ratings similarity almost perfectly study similar one subjects judged likelihood fictional woman taking different careers suggests rather estimating probability using base rates subjects substituted accessible attribute people rely representativeness fall error breaks fundamental law tversky kahneman gave subjects short character sketch woman called linda describing years old single outspoken bright majored philosophy student deeply concerned issues discrimination social justice also participated antinuclear demonstrations people reading description ranked likelihood different statements linda amongst others included linda bank teller linda bank teller active feminist movement people showed strong tendency rate latter specific statement likely even though conjunction form linda x never probable general statement linda x explanation terms heuristics judgment distorted readers character sketch representative sort person might active feminist someone works bank similar exercise concerned bill described intelligent unimaginative great majority people reading character sketch rated bill accountant plays jazz hobby likely bill plays jazz without success tversky kahneman used described series increasingly desperate manipulations get subjects recognise logical error one variation subjects choose logical explanation linda bank teller likely deliberately illogical argument said linda feminist bank teller likely resembles active feminist resembles bank teller sixtyfive percent subjects found illogical argument researchers also carried variations study exploring possibility people misunderstood question eliminate shown individuals high crt scores significantly less likely subject conjunction error disappears question posed terms frequencies everyone versions study recognised people fitting outline description conjunction statement x apply people general statement tversky kahneman asked subjects consider problem random variation imagining simplicity exactly half babies born hospital male ratio exactly half every time period days girls born others boys question likelihood deviating exactly half depend whether many births per day wellestablished consequence sampling theory proportions vary much daytoday typical number births per day small however peoples answers problem reflect fact typically reply number births hospital makes difference likelihood male babies one day explanation terms heuristic people consider representative figure previously given average richard e nisbett colleagues suggest representativeness explains dilution effect irrelevant information weakens effect stereotype subjects one study asked whether paul susan likely assertive given information first names rated paul assertive apparently basing judgment gender stereotype another group told pauls susans mothers commute work bank show stereotype effect rated paul susan equally assertive explanation additional information paul susan made less representative men women general subjects expectations men women weaker means unrelated nondiagnostic information certain issue make relative information less powerful issue people understand representativeness explains systematic errors people make judging probability random events example sequence coin tosses comes heads h tails people reliably tend judge clearly patterned sequence hhhttt less likely less patterned sequence hthtth sequences exactly probability people tend see clearly patterned sequences less representative randomness less likely result random tversky kahneman argued effect underlies gamblers fallacy tendency expect outcomes even short run like expecting roulette wheel come black last several throws came emphasised even experts statistics susceptible illusion survey professional psychologists found respondents expected samples overly representative population drawn result psychologists systematically overestimated statistical power tests underestimated sample size needed meaningful test anchoring adjustment heuristic used many situations people estimate according tversky kahnemans original description involves starting readily available shifting either reach answer seems tversky kahnemans experiments people shift far enough away anchor hence anchor contaminates estimate even clearly irrelevant one experiment subjects watched number selected spinning wheel fortune say whether given quantity larger smaller number instance might asked percentage african countries members united nations larger smaller tried guess true percentage answers correlated well arbitrary number insufficient adjustment anchor explanation effect alternative theory people form estimates evidence selectively brought mind anchoring effect demonstrated wide variety experiments laboratories real remains subjects offered money incentive accurate explicitly told base judgment effect stronger people make judgments subjects experiments lack introspective awareness heuristic denying anchor affected even anchor value obviously random extreme still contaminate one experiment asked subjects estimate year albert einsteins first visit united states anchors contaminated answers much sensible anchor experiments asked subjects average temperature san francisco less degrees whether fewer top ten albums beatles deliberately absurd anchors still affected estimates true anchoring results particularly strong bias estimates stated form confidence interval example people predict value stock market index particular day defining upper lower bound confident true value fall range reliable finding people anchor upper lower bounds close best leads overconfidence effect one muchreplicated finding people certain number particular range wrong thirty forty percent anchoring also causes particular difficulty many numbers combined composite judgment tversky kahneman demonstrated asking group people rapidly estimate product x x x x x x x another group estimate product reverse order x x x x x x x groups underestimated answer wide margin latter groups average estimate significantly explanation terms anchoring people multiply first terms product anchor less abstract task estimate probability aircraft crash given numerous possible faults likelihood one million common finding studies tasks people anchor small component probabilities underestimate corresponding effect happens people estimate probability multiple events happening sequence accumulator bet horse racing kind judgment anchoring individual probabilities results overestimation combined peoples valuation goods quantities buy respond anchoring effects one experiment people wrote last two digits social security numbers asked consider whether would pay number dollars items whose value know wine chocolate computer equipment entered auction bid items highest twodigit numbers submitted bids many times higher lowest stack soup cans supermarket labelled limit per customer label influenced customers buy another experiment real estate agents appraised value houses basis tour extensive documentation different agents shown different listing prices affected valuations one house appraised value ranged anchoring adjustment also shown affect grades given students one experiment teachers given bundles student essays graded returned also given fictional list students previous grades mean grades affected grades teachers awarded one study showed anchoring affected sentences fictional rape subjects trial judges average fifteen years experience read documents including witness testimony expert statements relevant penal code final pleas prosecution defence two conditions experiment differed one respect prosecutor demanded sentence one condition months eightmonth difference average sentences handed two similar mock trial subjects took role jurors civil case either asked award damages range million million range million million although facts case time jurors given higher range decided award three times higher happened even though subjects explicitly warned treat requests assessments also influenced stimuli provided one review researchers found stimulus perceived important carry weight situation people likely attribute stimulus heavier affect context feeling fear pleasure surprise shorter duration mood occurring rapidly involuntarily response stimulus reading words lung cancer might generate affect dread words mothers love create affect affection comfort people use affect gut responses judge benefits risks using affect affect heuristic used explain messages framed activate emotions persuasive framed purely factual decision makers whether organisational national level come across dilemma whether continue operation withdraw escalation commitment heuristic demonstrates people often tend lock losing courses action hopes investing resources operation turn around furthermore escalation commitment expected occur situations decision maker claim credit operational success losses operational failure directed absorbed others larger cognitive determinates influence escalation commitment include selfjustification problem framing sunk costs goal substitution selfefficacy accountability illusion general flow events causes implementation escalation commitment heuristic follows aside relevant decision makers firms organisations escalation commitment also applicable decisions made national leaders example decisions relating investment wars warbased scenario costs predominately borne soldiers taxpayers additionally decision makers war scenarios often directly immediately bear costs decisions level soldiers taxpayers hence making decision keep investing easier reflects escalation commitment heuristic inevitably creates cyclical process reinvestment potential cause longterm issues economically socially politically local global scales competing theories human judgment differ whether use heuristics irrational cognitive laziness approach argues heuristics inevitable shortcuts given limitations human brain according natural assessments approach complex calculations already done rapidly automatically brain judgments make use processes rather calculating scratch led theory called attribute substitution says people often handle complicated question answering different related question without aware third approach argues heuristics perform well complicated decisionmaking procedures quickly less information perspective emphasises fast frugal nature effortreduction framework proposed anuj k shah daniel oppenheimer states people use variety techniques reduce effort making daniel kahneman shane frederick proposed process called attribute substitution happens without conscious awareness according theory somebody makes judgment target attribute computationally complex rather easily calculated heuristic attribute effect difficult problem dealt answering rather simpler problem without person aware explains individuals unaware biases biases persist even subject made aware also explains human judgments often fail show regression toward substitution thought taking place automatic intuitive judgment system rather selfaware reflective system hence someone tries answer difficult question may actually answer related different question without realizing substitution taken psychologist stanley smith stevens proposed strength stimulus eg brightness light severity crime encoded brain cells way independent modality kahneman frederick built idea arguing target attribute heuristic attribute could different people accustomed thinking hard often content trust plausible judgment comes mind daniel kahneman american economic review december p kahneman frederick propose three conditions attribute kahneman gives example americans offered insurance death terrorist attack trip europe another group offered insurance would cover death kind trip even though death kind includes death terrorist attack former group willing pay latter kahneman suggests attribute fear substituted calculation total risks fear terrorism subjects stronger general fear dying foreign trip gerd gigerenzer colleagues argued heuristics used make judgments accurate rather biased according heuristics fast frugal alternatives complicated procedures giving answers warren thorngate social psychologist implemented ten simple decision rules heuristics computer program determined often heuristic selected alternatives highestthroughlowest expected value series randomlygenerated decision situations found simulated heuristics selected alternatives highest expected value almost never selected alternatives lowest expected psychologist benoît monin reports series experiments subjects looking photographs faces judge whether seen faces repeatedly found attractive faces likely mistakenly labeled monin interprets result terms attribute substitution heuristic attribute case warm glow positive feeling towards someone might either due familiar attractive interpretation criticised variance familiarity accounted attractiveness legal scholar cass sunstein argued attribute substitution pervasive people reason moral political legal given difficult novel problem areas people search familiar related problem prototypical case apply solution solution harder problem according sunstein opinions trusted political religious authorities serve heuristic attributes people asked opinions matter another source heuristic attributes emotion peoples moral opinions sensitive subjects like sexuality human cloning may driven reactions disgust rather reasoned sunstein challenged providing enough evidence attribute substitution rather processes work example persuasion plays role heuristic processing explained heuristicsystematic explains often two ways able process information persuasive messages one heuristically systematically heuristic make quick short judgement decision making hand systematic processing involves analytical inquisitive cognitive thinking individuals looks prior knowledge example model could used watching advertisement specific medication one without prior knowledge would see person proper pharmaceutical attire assume know talking therefore person automatically credibility likely trust content messages deliver another also field work already prior knowledge medication persuaded ad systematic way thinking also formally demonstrated experiment conducted chaiken maheswaran addition examples fluency heuristic ties perfectly topic persuasion described easily make automatic byproduct retrieval example would friend asking good books many could come mind name first book recalled memory since first thought therefore value better book one could suggest effort heuristic almost identical fluency one distinction would objects take longer produce seen value one may conclude glass vase valuable drawing merely may take longer vase two varieties heuristics confirms may influenced easily mental shortcuts may come
