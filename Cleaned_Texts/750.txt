spermatogenesis process haploid spermatozoa develop germ cells seminiferous tubules testis process starts mitotic division stem cells located close basement membrane cells called spermatogonial stem cells mitotic division produces two types cells type cells replenish stem cells type b cells differentiate primary spermatocytes primary spermatocyte divides meiotically meiosis two secondary spermatocytes secondary spermatocyte divides two equal haploid spermatids meiosis ii spermatids transformed spermatozoa sperm process spermiogenesis develop mature spermatozoa also known sperm thus primary spermatocyte gives rise two cells secondary spermatocytes two secondary spermatocytes subdivision produce four spermatozoa four haploid spermatozoa mature male gametes many sexually reproducing organisms thus spermatogenesis male version gametogenesis female equivalent oogenesis mammals occurs seminiferous tubules male testes stepwise fashion spermatogenesis highly dependent upon optimal conditions process occur correctly essential sexual reproduction dna methylation histone modification implicated regulation starts puberty usually continues uninterrupted death although slight decrease discerned quantity produced sperm increase age see male infertility spermatogenesis starts bottom part seminiferous tubes progressively cells go deeper tubes moving along mature spermatozoa reaches lumen mature spermatozoa deposited division happens asynchronically tube cut transversally one could observe different maturation states group cells different maturation states generated time called spermatogenic spermatogenesis produces mature male gametes commonly called sperm specifically known spermatozoa able fertilize counterpart female gamete oocyte conception produce singlecelled individual known zygote cornerstone sexual reproduction involves two gametes contributing half normal set chromosomes haploid result chromosomally normal diploid zygote preserve number chromosomes offspring differs species one gamete must half usual number chromosomes present body cells otherwise offspring twice normal number chromosomes serious abnormalities may result humans chromosomal abnormalities arising incorrect spermatogenesis results congenital defects abnormal birth defects syndrome klinefelter syndrome cases spontaneous abortion developing foetus spermatogenesis takes place within several structures male reproductive system initial stages occur within testes progress epididymis developing gametes mature stored ejaculation seminiferous tubules testes starting point

spermatids secondary spermatocytes secondary spermatocytes produced earlier rapidly enter meiosis ii divide produce haploid spermatids brevity stage means secondary spermatocytes rarely seen histological studies spermiogenesis spermatids begin form tail growing microtubules one centrioles turns basal body microtubules form axoneme later centriole modified process centrosome anterior part tail called midpiece thickens mitochondria arranged around axoneme ensure energy supply spermatid dna also undergoes packaging becoming highly condensed dna packaged firstly specific nuclear basic proteins subsequently replaced protamines spermatid elongation resultant tightly packed chromatin transcriptionally inactive golgi apparatus surrounds condensed nucleus becoming acrosome maturation
