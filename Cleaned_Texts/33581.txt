vaccination symptoms later confirmed compatible narcolepsy consumer reports describing similar symptoms also received organizations consultation external experts assessed possible relationship vaccination reported reactions mpa thl contact eu member states enquire whether similar reports countriescitation needed thl recommended pandemrix vaccinations discontinued pending investigation cases recently vaccinated children developed narcolepsy late early thl later raised figure expected average annual occurrence cases sweden mpa discovered confirmed cases another suspected cases additionally mpa says aware individual case reports france norway august european medicines agency announced agencys committee medicinal products human use would launching review pandemrix light limited number

clear connection pandemrix vaccination campaign narcolepsy epidemic finland probability developing narcolepsy determined nine times higher received pandemrix vaccination didnt total cases narcolepsy found finland ninety percent received pandemrix vaccination authorities believe number cases may still end march mpa press release stated results swedish registry based cohort study indicate increased risk narcolepsy children adolescents age vaccinated pandemrix compared children age study found increased risk adults vaccinated pandemrix cautioning increase risk children still uncertain magnitude recommends vaccinatedcitation needed study stanford university school medicine examined incidence narcolepsy relation upper airway infection vaccine pandemrix chinese patients principal conclusion increased incidence narcolepsy seen following wave upper airway infections influenza found correlation vaccination narcolepsy according authors new finding association infection vaccination important suggests limiting vaccination fear narcolepsy could actually increase overall since narcolepsy believed autoimmune authors suspect upper airway infections trigger immune response leads ultimately narcolepsy susceptible individuals pandemrix contains two adjuvants designed provoke stronger immune response vaccine used china howevercitation needed new scientist reported part surface protein
