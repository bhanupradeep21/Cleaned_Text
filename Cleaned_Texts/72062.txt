fact fragment hollow structure indeed godefroit colleagues find hadrosaurine diagnostic characters aralosaurus contrary skull aralosaurus presents several features maxilla parietal squamosal especially nasal indicates inclusion among lambeosaurinae notably posterior fragment nasal clearly articulated rest skull rises front orbits forming participating hollow crestlike structure structure broken base possible deduce size shape however rostral view nasal clearly hollow deeply excavated rostrally broad groove communicates directly ventral side posterior part bone therefore clear aralosaurus nasal crest surrounded part respiratory system extension nasal cavity inside hollow crest typically lambeosaurine feature thus confirming inclusion aralosaurus among aralosaurus also
