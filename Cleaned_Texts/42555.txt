estrogen receptor beta erβ also known nuclear receptor subfamily group member one two main types estrogen nuclear receptor activated sex hormone humans erβ encoded erβ member family estrogen receptors superfamily nuclear receptor transcription factors gene product contains nterminal dna binding domain cterminal ligand binding domain localized nucleus cytoplasm mitochondria upon binding estriol related ligands encoded protein forms homodimers heterodimers estrogen receptor α interact specific dna sequences activate transcription isoforms dominantly inhibit activity estrogen receptor family members several alternatively spliced transcript variants gene described fulllength nature variants fully erβ may inhibit cell proliferation opposes actions erα reproductive erβ may also important role adaptive function lung erβ potent tumor suppressor plays crucial role many cancer types prostate cancer ovarian erβ knockout mice show normal mammary gland development puberty able lactate

epithelium although expression declines cancer erβ expressed subtypes breast controversy regarding erβ protein expression hindered study erβ highly sensitive monoclonal antibodies produced wellvalidated address erβ function related various cardiovascular targets including atpbinding cassette transporter apolipoprotein polymorphism may affect erβ function lead altered responses postmenopausal women receiving hormone replacement abnormalities gene expression associated erβ also linked autism spectrum mutations erβ shown influence cardiomyocytes cells comprise largest part heart lead increased risk cardiovascular disease cvd disparity prevalence cvd pre postmenopausal women difference attributed estrogen levels many types erβ receptors exist order help regulate gene expression subsequent health body binding naturally occurring estrogen specifically improves cardiac metabolism heart utilizes lot energy form atp properly pump blood maintain physiological requirements order live helps increasing myocardial atp levels respiratory addition alter myocardial signaling pathways stimulate myocyte regeneration aid inhibiting myocyte cell death erβ signaling pathway plays role vasodilation arterial dilation contributes individual healthy heart rate decrease blood pressure regulation increase endothelial function arterial perfusion important myocyte health thus alterations signaling pathways due erβ mutation could lead myocyte cell death physiological stress erα profound role regeneration myocyte cell death erβ still help increasing endothelial progenitor cell activation subsequent cardiac genetic variation erβ sex age dependent erβ polymorphism lead accelerated brain aging cognitive impairment development ad pathology similar cvd postmenopausal women increased risk developing alzheimers disease ad due loss estrogen affects proper aging hippocampus neural survival regeneration amyloid metabolism erβ mrna highly expressed hippocampal formation area brain associated memory expression contributes increased neuronal survival helps protect neurodegenerative diseases ad pathology ad also associated accumulation amyloid beta peptide aβ proper concentration aβ brain important healthy functioning much lead cognitive impairment thus erβ helps control aβ levels maintaining protein derived βamyloid precursor protein erβ helps upregulating insulindegrading enzyme ide leads βamyloid degradation accumulation levels begin rise however ad lack erβ causes decrease degradation increase plaque erβ also plays role regulating apoe risk factor ad redistributes lipids across cells apoe expression hippocampus specifically regulated affecting learning memory individuals afflicted ad thus estrogen therapy via erβtargeted approach
