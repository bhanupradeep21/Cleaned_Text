foreign body aspiration occurs foreign body enters airway cause difficulty breathing objects may reach respiratory tract digestive tract mouth nose object enters respiratory tract termed aspiration foreign body become lodged trachea respiratory tract regardless type object aspiration lifethreatening situation requires timely recognition action minimize risk advances made management condition leading significantly improved clinical outcomes still deaths resulting foreign body aspiration approximately one child dies every five days due choking food united states highlighting need improvements education signs symptoms foreign body aspiration vary based site obstruction size foreign body severity foreign bodies become lodged upper airway become lodged signs foreign body aspiration usually abrupt onset involve coughing choking andor wheezing however symptoms slower onset foreign body cause large degree obstruction said aspiration also asymptomatic rare classically patients present acute onset cases obstruction classified partial complete signs partial obstruction include choking drooling stridor patient maintains ability signs complete obstruction include choking inability speak absence bilateral breath sounds among signs respiratory distress fever may present case possible object may chemically irritating foreign bodies larynx often present stridor objects larynx present foreign bodies vocal cords often present difficulty pain swallowing excessive foreign bodies vocal cords often present pain difficulty speaking increased respiratory rate may sign foreign body aspiration child verbalize report swallowed foreign foreign body cause large degree obstruction patients may present chronic cough asymmetrical breath sounds exam recurrent pneumonia specific lung aspiration occurred weeks even months ago object may lead obstructive pneumonia even lung abscess therefore important consider chronic foreign body aspiration patients whose histories include unexplained recurrent pneumonia lung abscess without adults right lower lobe lung common site recurrent pneumonia foreign body due fact anatomy right main bronchus wider steeper left main bronchus allowing objects enter easily left unlike adults slight propensity towards objects lodging right bronchus likely due bilateral bronchial angles symmetric years age aortic knob fully develops displaces left main signs symptoms foreign body aspiration adults may also mimic lung disorders asthma copd lung cases foreign body aspiration children ages months years due tendency children place small objects mouth nose children age usually lack molars grind food small pieces proper small round objects including nuts hard candy popcorn kernels beans berries common causes foreign body latex balloons also serious choking hazard children result death latex balloon conform shape trachea blocking airway making difficult expel heimlich addition foreign body able absorb water bean seed corn among things may swell time leading severe adults foreign body aspiration prevalent populations impaired swallowing mechanisms following neurological disorders alcohol use advanced age leading senility common decade life loss inadequate airway protection may also attributed poor dentition seizure general anesthesia sedative drug important aspect assessment clinician accurate history provided event unfortunately always available physical examination clinician include minimum general assessment addition cardiac pulmonary exams auscultation breath sounds may give additional information regarding object location degree airway presence drooling dysphagia drooling always noted alongside classic signs airway obstruction indicate involvement esophagus impact radiography common form imaging used initial assessment foreign body presentation patients receive chest xray determine location foreign lateral neck chest bilateral decubitus endexpiratory chest xrays obtained patients suspected aspirated foreign however presence normal findings chest radiography rule foreign body aspiration objects fact cases normal findings visibility object depends many factors objects material size anatomic location surrounding structures well patients body xray beams show object objects composition blocks rays traveling making radiopaque appearing lighter white image also requires stuck behind something blocks beams objects radiopaque include items made metals except aluminum bones except fish bones glass material block xray beams considered radiolucent appear dark prevents includes material plastics fish bones wood aluminum diagnostic imaging modalities magnetic resonance imaging computed tomography ventilation perfusion scans play limited role diagnosis foreign body signs xray commonly seen object indicative foreign body aspiration include visualization foreign body hyperinflation affected xray findings seen foreign body aspiration include obstructive emphysema atelectasis xray used visualize location identity foreign body rigid bronchoscopy general anesthesia goldstandard diagnosis since foreign body visualized removed rigid bronchoscopy indicated two three following criteria met report foreign body aspiration patient witness abnormal lung exam findings abnormal chest xray see also choking treatment basic life support advanced cardiovascular life support treatment foreign body aspiration determined age patient severity obstruction airway airway obstruction partial complete partial obstruction patient usually clear foreign body complete obstruction acute intervention required remove foreign foreign body aspiration suspected finger sweeping mouth recommended due increased risk displacing foreign object choking children less year age child placed face rescuers back blows delivered heel hand patient turned faceup chest thrusts rescuer alternate five back blows followed five chest thrusts object heimlich maneuver used choking patients older year age dislodge foreign patient becomes unresponsive physical intervention cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr event basic measures remove foreign body adequate ventilation restored need treatment trained personnel becomes laryngoscopy performed unresponsive patients noninvasive airway clearance techniques laryngoscopy involves placing device mouth visualize back foreign body seen removed endotracheal tube placed order prevent airway compromise resulting inflammation foreign body visualized intubation tracheotomy needle cricothyrotomy done restore airway patients become unresponsive due airway noninvasive measures dislodge foreign body patient maintain adequate ventilation rigid bronchoscopy general anesthesia supplemental oxygen cardiac monitoring pulse oximeter applied efforts made keep patient calm avoid agitating patient prevent airway flexible rather rigid bronchoscopy might used diagnosis object location unclear flexible bronchoscope used rigid bronchoscope typically standby readily available preferred approach rigid bronchoscopy allows good airway control ready bleeding management better visualization ability manipulate aspirated object variety flexible bronchoscopy may used extraction distal access needed operator experienced potential advantages include avoidance general anesthesia well ability reach subsegmental bronchi smaller diameter respiratory tract main main disadvantage using flexible scope risk dislodging object causing airway bronchoscopy successful removing foreign body approximately cases complication rate foreign body removed patients receive nebulized betaadrenergic medication chest physiotherapy protect steroidal antiinflammatories antibiotics routinely administered except certain include situations foreign body difficult impossible extract documented respiratory tract infection swelling within airway occurs removal glucocorticoids may administered foreign body surrounded inflamed tissue extraction difficult cases extraction may delayed short course glucocorticoids inflammation may reduced subsequent patients remain observation hospital successful extraction practice result dislodgement foreign antibiotics appropriate infection developed delay fact removal object may improve infection control removing infectious source well using cultures taken bronchoscopy guide antibiotic airway edema swelling occur patient may stridor cases glucocorticoids aerosolized epinephrine helium oxygen therapy may considered part management patients clinically stable need supplemental oxygen extraction may discharged hospital day routine imaging followup chest xray needed unless symptoms persist worsen patient imaging abnormalities previously verify return children discharged within hours many complications develop foreign body remains airway also complications may occur removal object depending timeline cardiac arrest death possible complications sudden complete obstruction occurs immediate medical care common complication foreign body aspiration pulmonary infection pneumonia lung difficult overcome elderly population lead even complications patients may develop inflammation airway walls foreign body remaining airway secretions retained behind obstruction creates ideal environment subsequent bacterial hyperinflation airway distal obstruction also occur foreign body episodes recurrent pneumonia lung field prompt evaluation possible foreign body whether foreign body removed complications chemical bronchitis mucosal reactions development granulation tissue complications also arise interventions used remove foreign body rigid bronchoscopy gold standard removal foreign body however intervention potential common complication rigid bronchoscopy damage patients less common complications include cuts mouth esophagus perforation bronchial tree damage vocal cords pneumothorax atelectasis stricture many factors consider determining decrease likelihood aspiration especially extremely young elderly major considerations children developmental level terms swallowing protecting airway via mechanisms coughing gag also certain object characteristics size shape material
