substituting tetrazole ring place native hydroxyl group position rapamycin isolated purified natural product fermentation site modification found tolerant position introduce novel structural changes without impairing biologic activity compound extremely lipophilic high octanolwater partition coefficient therefore limited water solubility properties highly advantageous designing drugloaded stent

counteract restenosis restenosis typically described clinical trials binary approach otherwise known binary restenosis binary stenosis binary restenosis defined stenosis vessel diameter diameter stenosis loss acute luminal gain also known late loss following acute gain lumen diameter term binary means patients placed groups stenosis stenosis occlusion blocking blood flow vessel considered stenosis previously restenosis thought arise due development neointimal thickening result smooth muscle however thought blood vessels dilated segment shrinking explains stenting increases luminal area effective decreasing occurrence vessel restenosis typically detected angiography also detected duplex ultrasound imaging techniques major advancement restenosis prevention use stents stent restenosis
