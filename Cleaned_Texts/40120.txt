xingxiulong meaning xingxiu bridge dragon genus bipedal sauropodiform early jurassic china contains single species x chengi described wang et al three specimens two adults immature individual collectively constitute mostly complete skeleton adults genus measured metres ft long metres ft ft tall phylogenetic analysis suggests xingxiulong closely related contemporary jingshanosaurus although alternative position outside sauropodiformes massospondylidae also plausible despite close relationship xingxiulong prominently differs jingshanosaurus basal sauropodomorphs number sauropodlike traits include sacrum containing four vertebrae pubis exceptionally long top portion femur first fifth metatarsals foot scapula wide robust probably represent adaptations supporting high body weight
