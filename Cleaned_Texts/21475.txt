intrauterine growth restriction iugr fetal growth restriction refers poor growth fetus womb pregnancy iugr defined clinical features malnutrition evidence reduced growth regardless infants birth weight causes iugr broad may involve maternal fetal placental least million neonatal deaths occur worldwide every year associated low birth weight lbw caused intrauterine growth restriction iugr preterm delivery genetic demonstrating undernutrition already leading health problem birth intrauterine growth restriction result baby small gestational age sga commonly defined weight percentile

ponderal index subcutaneous fat deposition body proportion pseudo iugr occurs due uneventful intrauterine course rectified proper postnatal care nutrition babies also called small gestational

methods currently recommended fetus growth restriction additional structural abnormalities evaluated genetic addition evaluating fetal growth velocity fetus primarily monitored ultrasonography every additional monitoring technique doppler velocimetry doppler velocimetry useful monitoring blood flow uterine umbilical arteries may indicate signs uteroplacental method may also detect blood vessels specifically ductus venosus middle cerebral arteries developing properly may adapt well monitoring via doppler velocimetry shown decrease risk morbidity mortality parturition among iugr standard fetal surveillance via nonstress tests andor biophysical profile scoring also bed rest found improve outcomes typically currently lack evidence supporting dietary supplemental changes may prevent development optimal timing delivery fetus iugr unknown however timing delivery currently based cause parameters collected umbilical artery doppler include pulsatility index resistance index

premature infants exhibit iugr premature infants iugr likely adverse neonatal outcomes including respiratory distress syndrome intraventricular hemorrhage necrotizing enterocolitis association
