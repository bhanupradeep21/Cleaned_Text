fecundity defined two ways human demography potential reproduction recorded population opposed sole organism population biology considered similar natural capability produce measured number gametes eggs seed set asexual propagules superfecundity refers organisms ability store another organisms sperm copulation fertilize eggs store period time essentially making appear though fertilization occurred without sperm ie parthenogenesiscitation needed human demography considers human fecundity culturally differing rates population biology studies organisms term fecundity population biology often used describe rate offspring production one time step often annual sense fecundity may include birth rates survival young time step levels fecundity vary geographically generally consistent feature culture fecundation another term fertilization obstetrics gynecology fecundability probability pregnant single menstrual cycle fecundity probability achieving live birth within single ecology fecundity measure reproductive capacity individual population typically restricted reproductive individuals equally applied sexual asexual reproduction purpose fecundity measure many new individuals added fecundity may defined differently different ecological studies explain specific data study examined example studies use apparent fecundity describe data looks particular moment time rather species entire life span studies definitions changed better quantify fecundity organism question need particularly true modular organisms modular organization differs typical unitary organism fecundity best defined count parity organization fecundity two distinct types semelparity iteroparity semelparity occurs organism reproduces lifetime death part reproductive strategy species produce many offspring one reproductive event giving potential advantage comes fecundity producing offspring iteroparity species reproduces multiple times lifetime species strategy protect unpredictable survivability offspring first litter offspring dies reproduce replace dead offspring also allows organism care offspring alive multitude factors potentially affect rates fecundity example ontogeny population density latitude ontogeny fecundity iteroparous organisms often increases age decline older ages several hypotheses proposed explain relationship species declining growth rates maturity suggestion organisms growth rate decreases resources allocated reproduction possible explanations exist pattern organisms grow maturity explanations include increased competence older individuals less fit individuals already died since life expectancy decreases age older individuals may allocate resources reproduction expense semelparous species age frequently poor predictor fecundity cases size likely better population density often observed negatively affect fecundity making fecundity densitydependent reasoning behind observation area overcrowded fewer resources available individual thus may insufficient energy reproduce high numbers offspring survival low occasionally high density stimulate production offspring particularly plant species plants food lure pollinators spread plants pollen allow many different hypotheses explain relationship latitude fecundity one claimed fecundity increases predictably increasing latitude reginald morean proposed hypothesis explanation higher mortality seasonal environmentscitation needed different hypothesis david lack attributed positive relationship change daylight hours found changing latitudes differing daylight hours turn change hours parent collect food also accounts drop fecundity poles due extreme amounts day lengths exhaust fecundity intensity due seasonality hypothesis proposed phillip ashmole suggests latitude affects fecundity due seasonality increasing increasing latitudes theory relies mortality concept proposed moreau focuses seasonality affects mortality turn population densities thus places higher mortality food availability leading higher fecundity another hypothesis claims seasonality affects fecundity due varying lengths breeding seasons idea suggests shorter breeding seasons select larger clutch size compensate reduced reproduction frequency thus increasing species fecundity significant component fitness fecundity selection builds idea idea claims genetic selection traits increase organisms fecundity turn advantageous organisms fecundity schedule fecundity schedules data tables display patterns birth amongst individuals different ages population typically found life tables columns fx mx

infecundity term meaning inability conceive several years exposure risk pregnancy usage prevalent medicine especially reproductive medicine demographics common use laypeople infecundity would synonymous infertility demographic medical use fertility thus antonym infertility may refer quantity rates offspring produced rather physiological limitations additionally social trends societal norms may influence fecundity though influence tends temporary indeed considered impossible cease reproduction based social factors fecundity tends rise brief decline fecundity also shown increase ungulates relation warmer weathercitation needed sexual evolutionary biology especially sexual selection fecundity contrasted reproductivity httpsenwikipediaorgwikifecundity
