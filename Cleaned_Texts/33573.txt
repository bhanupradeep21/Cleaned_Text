pacemaker crosstalk results pacemakergenerated electrical event one chamber sensed lead another chamber resulting inappropriate inhibition pacing artifact second crosstalk occur dual chamber biventricular pacemaker happens less often recent models dual chamber pacemakers due addition ventricular blanking period coincides atrial stimulus helps prevent ventricular channel oversensing atrial output newer dual chamber pacemakers also use bipolar leads smaller pacing spike steroid eluting leads lower pacing thresholds crosstalk common unipolar systems since require larger pacing spike crosstalk sometimes referred crosstalk inhibition farfield sensing selfinhibition cases crosstalk occur pulse generator circuit though common causes include atrial lead dislodgement ventricle ventricular lead dislodgement atrium high atrial output current high ventricular sensitivity short ventricular blanking general treatment crosstalk includes decreasing atrial pacing output decreasing atrial pulse width decreasing ventricular sensitivity increasing ventricular blanking period activating ventricular safety pacing new atrial lead implant insulation failure mandates unipolar httpsenwikipediaorgwikipacemakercrosstalk
