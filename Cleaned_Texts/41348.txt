among hominins especially came bipedalism humans able many things began walk feet changes included ability use hands create tools carry things hands ability travel longer distances faster speed ability hunt food according researchers humans able bipedalists due darwins principle natural selection darwin believed larger brains humans made upright gait necessary hypothesis mechanism evolved first major theory attempting directly explanation origins bipedalism savannah hypothesis dart theory hypothesized hominins became bipedalists due environment savanna tall grass dry climate later proven incorrect due fossil records showed hominins still climbing trees era anthropologist owen lovejoy suggested bipedalism result sexual dimorphism efforts help collecting food male provisioning hypothesis introduced lowered birth rates early hominids increased pressure males provide females offspring females groomed cared children family group males ranged seek food returned bipadally full arms males could better provide females model likely mate produce anthropologist yohannes haileselassie expert australopithecus anamensis discusses evidence australopithecus one first hominins evolve obligate bipedalists remains subfamily important field research presents possible information regarding primates adapted tree life terrestrial life huge adaptation encouraged many evolutionary changes
