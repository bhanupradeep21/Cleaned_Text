pteranodontoidea pteranodontoids greek meaning toothless wings extinct clade ornithocheiroid pterosaurs early late cretaceous early valanginian late maastrichtian stages asia africa europe north america south named alexander wilhelm armin kellner kellner defined clade nodebased taxon consisting last common ancestor anhanguera pteranodon descendants clade ornithocheiroidea sometimes considered senior synonym pteranodontoidea however depends brian andres analyses converts ornithocheiroidea using definition kellner avoid despite meaning groups name pteranodontoids toothless earlier genera istiodactylids anhanguerids teeth used catch prey several conclusions led idea later evolved toothless pteranodontids pteranodontoids also diverse group pterosaurs throughout cretaceous period therefore successful flyers mostly replaced larger azhdarchids end late cretaceous however resulted resource terrain competitions even pteranodontoids still managed thrive genera alcione barbaridactylus simurghia lived cretaceouspaleogene extinction event pteranodontoids similar similar diet modernday soaring birds albatross mainly consisted fish genera group however fed mainly carrion seen earlier genera istiodactylus also known proportionally large wingspans largest recorded pteranodontoid reached meters ft belongs genus several fossil remains found chalk formation england chalk pit known wide variety fossils belonging different animals british paleontologist james scott bowerbank named described specimens found new species pterodactylus p giganteus due much larger p giganteus nowadays considered belong genus called bowerbank unearthed specimens chalk pit p giganteus assigned specimens yet another newly named species pterodactylus known p cuvieri honor german naturalist zoologist georges later year british paleontologist sir richard owen also unearthed several fossil specimens chalk formation assigned pterodactylus compressirostris owen later unearthed many fossil specimens different fossil site called cambridge greensand assigned specimens new species called pterodactylus simus naming new species british paleontologist harry govier seeley created new separate genus called ornithocheirus ancient greek ὄρνις meaning bird χεῖρ meaning hand due notion time pterosaurs direct ancestors birds seeley also reassigned pterodactylus cuvieri new species called ornithocheirus species considered belong genus back however controversies naming species genera pterosaurs started paleontologists harry seeley richard owen fighting reassignings different species well genera owen therefore created two new genera coloborhynchus meaning maimed beak criorhynchus meaning ram beak reference unique convex keeled crests top underside snout owen created type species coloborhynchus c clavirostris sunk three species assigned previously ornithocheirus criorhynchus consisted entirely former ornithocheirus later however seeley disagreed owens conclusions therefore assigned species named ornithocheirus simus type species naming different pterosaur species well genus ornithocheirus england resulted research places united states american paleontologist othniel charles marsh led expedition smoky hill chalk deposits western kansas marsh unearthed first ever specimens pterosaur north america specimens ypm ypm belong genus pteranodon consisted partial wing remains tooth fish xiphactinus marsh believed belonged assigned specimens new species called pterodactylus oweni meaning owens wing honor sir richard owen realized name chosen already used different european pterosaur species described harry seeley renamed discovery pterodactylus occidentalis meaning western wing finger reference location american paleontologist edward drinker cope also unearthed several remains large north american pterosaur based remains cope named two new species ornithochirus umbrosus ornithochirus harpyia attempt assign large european genus ornithocheirus missed e describing paper naming species copes paper naming published five days publication marshs paper led dispute two paleontologists fought whose names priority published literature obviously species marsh described first skull specimen pteranodon unearthed american paleontologist samuel wendell williston smoky hill river located wallace county logan county kansas usa later year another skull specimen found though time bit smaller soon enough marsh recognized major difference described specimens lacked teeth bony crests skulls described specimens found distinguished previously known genera order pterosauria entire absence teeth marsh coined name pteranodon meaning wing without tooth pointed unique characteristics identified warranted new generic name marsh also reclassified previously named north american species pterodactylus pteranodon considered smaller skull belong reassigned pteranodon occidentalis based specimens smaller individuals later uncovered marsh also named several additional species pteranodon comptus pteranodon nanus based distinct smaller fragmentary skeletons created another separate species called pteranodon gracilis based wing bone previously mistook pelvic bone marsh soon realized mistake therefore reassigned specimen found separate genus named nyctosaurus species p nanus soon recognized nyctosaurus specimen well due synapomorphies seen later samuel williston become first scientist critically evaluate pteranodon species classified cope marsh agreed marshs reassignings classifications several exceptions still made williston revised earlier conclusion stated three species pteranodon instead seven also considered p comptus p nanus specimens nyctosaurus divided species small p velox medium p occidentalis large species p ingens based primarily shape upper arm bones also followed first conclusion p longiceps synonym either p velox p occidentalis based however christopher bennett concluded p longiceps another species called p sternbergi would valid pteranodon species ones either considered nomina dubia peculiar discovery made seeley isle wight island coast southern england seeley thought fossil remains belonged birdlike creature named ornithodesmus seeley also reported another specimen found site seeley named new species latidens based discovery specific name translates wide tooth presumably assigned new species ornithodesmus due synapomorphies sacra conclusion entirely english paleontologist reginald walter hooley reviewed latidens detail based specimens found placed genus ornithodesmus within newly created family later british paleontologists stafford c howse andrew c milner concluded holotype sacrum specimen species cluniculus didnt belong pterosaur instead maniraptoran theropod dinosaur pointed detailed attempts made compare sacrum cluniculus pterosaurs species latidens effect treated type species genus ornithodesmus conclusion definite species pterosaur latidens thus required new generic howse milner david martill reassigned latidens new genus called istiodactylus resulting new combination known istiodactylus latidens generic name istiodactylus means sail finger reference proportionally large originally defined alexander kellner pteranodontoidea sometimes considered synonym clade ornithocheiroidea according several studies name ornithocheiroidea originally defined apomorphybased taxon christopher bennett however kellner redefined ornithocheiroidea represent node anhanguera pteranodon quetzalcoatlus dsungaripterus thus making ornithocheiroidea inclusive later year david unwin suggested different definition node contains pteranodon longiceps istiodactylus latidens resulting considered pteranodontoidea junior synonym brian andres analyses converts ornithocheiroidea using definition kellner avoid andres timothy myers presented phylogenetic analysis placed pteranodontoidea within group pteranodontia sister taxon family however kellner colleagues revisited classification concluded pteranodontoidea sister taxon tapejaroidea would inclusive group containing lanceodontia archaeopterodactyloidea haopterus gracilis azhdarchoidea nyctosauridae

anhangueria pteranodontoids like pterosaurs considered skilled fliers well adept moving ground evidence footprints shows pterosaurs sprawl limbs large degree modern reptiles rather held limbs relatively erect walking like dinosaurs pteranodontoid footprints known likely also walked among pterosaurs pteranodontoids unusually uneven limb proportions forelimbs much longer hind limbs would
