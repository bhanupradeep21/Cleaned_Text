stanley lloyd miller march may american chemist made important experiments concerning origin life demonstrating wide range vital organic compounds synthesized fairly simple chemical processes inorganic substances performed experiment showed complex organic molecules could synthesised inorganic precursors experiment widely reported provided evidence idea chemical evolution early earth caused natural synthesis organic compounds inanimate inorganic stanley miller born oakland california second child brother donald nathan edith miller descendants jewish immigrants belarus latvia father attorney office oakland deputy district attorney mother school teacher education natural environment family fact oakland high school nicknamed chem whiz followed brother university california berkeley study chemistry mainly felt donald would able help topic completed bsc june financial problems father died leaving family money shortage help berkeley faculty uc berkeley assistantships offered teaching assistantship university chicago february could provide basic funds graduate work miller enrolled university chicago phd program september searched frantically thesis topic meeting various professors preferred theoretical problems experiments tended laborious initially convinced work theoretical physicist edward teller synthesis elements conforming custom university graduate student obliged attend seminars attended chemistry seminar nobel laureate harold urey gave lecture origin solar system organic synthesis could possible reducing environment primitive earths atmosphere miller immensely inspired year fruitless work teller prospect teller leaving chicago work hydrogen bomb miller approached urey september fresh research project urey immediately enthusiastic millers interest prebiotic synthesis successful work done even suggested working thallium meteorites persistence miller persuaded urey experiment electric discharges gases experiments found evidence production amino acids reaction vessel always afraid specks fly excrement might source amino acids discovered reaction tube chided classmates case result demonstration many organic chemical compounds could produced purely inorganic processes miller eventually earned doctorate degree longlasting reputation spectroscopic observations stars well known complex organic compounds formed gases blown carbon rich stars result chemical reactions fundamental issue association prebiotic organic compounds origin life remained completing doctorate miller transferred california institute technology f b jewett fellow worked mechanism involved synthesis amino hydroxycarboxylic acids joined department biochemistry college physicians surgeons columbia university new york worked next five years new university california san diego established became first assistant professor department chemistry associate professor full professor supervised phd students including jeffrey l miller experiment described technical paper may issue transformed concept scientific ideas concerning origin life respectable empirical study become classic textbook definition scientific basis origin life specifically first definitive experimental evidence oparin haldanes primordial soup theory urey miller designed simulate oceanatmospheric condition primitive earth using continuous stream steam mixture methane ammonia hydrogen gaseous mixture exposed electrical discharge induced chemical reaction week reaction miller detected formation amino acids glycine α βalanine using paper chromatography also detected aspartic acid gammaamino butyric acid confident since amino acids basic structural functional constituents cellular life experiment showed possibility natural organic synthesis origin life miller showed results urey suggested immediate publication urey refused coauthor lest miller receive little credit manuscript miller sole author submitted magazine science february waiting several weeks urey inquired wrote chairman editorial board february lack action reviewing manuscript month passed still decision march infuriated urey demanded manuscript returned submitted journal american chemical society march editor science apparently annoyed ureys insinuation wrote directly miller manuscript published miller withdrew manuscript journal american chemical miller continued research death knowledge earths early atmosphere progressed techniques chemical analyses improved continued refine details methods succeeded synthesizing varieties amino acids also produced wide variety inorganic organic compounds essential cellular construction support number independent researchers also confirmed range chemical recent revelation unlike original millers experimental hypothesis strongly reducing condition primitive atmosphere could quite neutral containing gases different millers last works published posthumously still succeeded synthesizing array organic compounds using miller collaborators repeated experiment newly developed automatic chemical analysers ionexchange chromatography gas chromatographymass spectrometry synthesized amino acids including known occur naturally organisms included primary alphaamino acids found murchison meteorite fell australia subsequent electric discharge experiment actually produced variety amino acids millers death several boxes containing vials dried residues found among laboratory materials university note indicated original experiments produced using three different apparatuses one included hydrogen sulphide gaseous mixture first time result never published students reanalysed samples using sensitive techniques highperformance liquid chromatography liquid flight mass spectrometry result showed synthesis amino acids amines revealing original miller experiment produced many compounds actually reported unreported samples analysed amino acids amines including sulfurous compounds miller suffered series strokes beginning november increasingly inhibited physical activity living nursing home national city south san diego died may nearby paradise hospital survived brother donald family devoted partner maria miller remembered work concerning origin life considered pioneer topics exobiology natural occurrence clathrate hydrates general mechanisms action anaesthesia elected us national academy sciences
