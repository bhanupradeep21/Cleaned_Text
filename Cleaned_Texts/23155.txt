vertiginous epilepsy infrequently first symptom seizure characterized feeling vertigo occurs sensation rotation movement lasts seconds full seizure activity specific causes disease speculative several methods diagnosis important patients recall episodes times diagnosed vertiginous seizures left selfmanage symptoms able use antiepileptic medication dampen severity symptomscitation needed vertiginous epilepsy also referred epileptic vertigo vestibular epilepsy vestibular seizures vestibulogenic seizures different cases vertiginous epilepsy preferred signs vertiginous epilepsy often occur without change subject consciousness still aware experiencing often described sudden onset feeling like one turning one direction typically lasting several although subjects aware episode often remember specific details due disorientation discomfort andor partial cognitive sensation rotational movement visual auditory planes also known vertiginous aura symptom precede seizure may constitute seizure auras portion seizure occur consciousness lost memory retained afterwards auras focused different regions brain thus affect different functions symptoms may accompany vertiginous epilepsy include many people tend mistake dizziness vertigo although sound similar dizziness considered symptom vertiginous epilepsy dizziness sensation imbalance floating impending loss consciousness andor different vertigo characterized illusion rotational movement caused conflict signals sent brain balance positionsensing systems body although specific cause identified always induce vertiginous epilepsy number supported hypotheses seizures come common traumatic injury head causes include tumor cancers brain stroke loss blood flow brain infection less tested hypothesis believe may play larger role determining affected disease genetic mutation predisposes subject vertiginous hypothesis supported occurrences vertiginous epilepsy family history vertiginous epilepsies included category partial epilepsy abnormal electrical activity brain current research presumed likely cause produce vertigo epilepsies occurring lateral temporal abnormal electrical activities either originate within temporal lobe may propagate epilepsy neighboring region brain epilepsies parietal occipital lobes commonly propagate temporal lobe inducing vertiginous electrical propagation across brain explains many different symptoms may associated vertiginous seizure strength electrical signal direction propagation brain also determine associated symptoms noticeablecitation needed important factor diagnosing patient vertiginous epilepsy subject detailed description however due associated symptoms syndrome subject may difficulty remembering specifics experience makes difficult physician confirm diagnosis absolute certainty questionnaire may used help patients especially children describe symptoms clinicians may also consult family members assistance diagnosis relying observations help understand addition description event neurological physical hematologic examinations completed assist diagnosis proper diagnosis otological exam examination ear also completed rule disorders inner ear could also responsible manifestations may include audiological assessment vestibular function diagnosis historytaking essential determining possible causes vertiginous epilepsy well tracking progress disorder means used diagnosis vertiginous epilepsy include eeg measures electrical activity brain allowing physician identify unusual patterns eegs good identifying abnormal brain activity helpful localizing seizure originates spread quickly across mris used look masses lesions temporal lobe brain indicating possible tumors cancer cause using pet scan physician looking detect abnormal blood flow glucose metabolism brain visible seizures indicate region real way prevent vertiginous episodes means managing disease head trauma major cause vertiginous epilepsy protecting head injury easy way avoid possible onset seizures recent advances science also possible individual receive genetic screening tells subject predisposed developing condition aid preventing range ways manage vertiginous epilepsy depending severity seizures simple partial seizures medical treatment always comfort patient someone ailed disease may able lead relatively normal life vertiginous seizures however seizures become much handle antiepileptic medication administered first line several different types medication market deter epileptic episodes support show one medication effective fact research shown simple partial seizures usually respond well medication leaving patient selfmanage third option treatment used extreme cases seizure symptoms disrupt daily life surgery wherein surgeon remove epileptic vertiginous epilepsy onset happen ages although typically symptoms begin occurring adolescence young research studies shown inclination disease sexescitation needed caloric reflex testing developed used testing
