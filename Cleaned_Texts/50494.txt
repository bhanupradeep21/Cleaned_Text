new zealand africa medical device since product absorbed bloodstream acts adsorbent gastrointestinal tract fits relevant definition according classification european commission medical device enterosgel produced modern hightech factory jeseník czech republic exported countries world except russia cis countries region supplies production russia factory situated city dankov enterosgel pmsph methylsilicic acid hydrogel polymeric gelatinous organosilicon compound gel dispersed water particle size microns preparation suspension taken orally electron microscopic studies shown gelforming matrix globular structure consists ensemble fused globules globules bound together siloxane bonds form pores pores spaces globules filled water pore size presence methyl groups surface ensures hydrophobic enterosgel particles pmsph tend form continuous network suspension reduce interaction hydrophobic water particles viewed twodimensional sheets rather threedimensional solid particles aqueous suspensions polymethylsiloxane polyhydrate characterized high physical chemical characteristics enterosgel define absorptive protective properties absorbs toxic substances produced gastrointestinal tract well toxic substances entering gastrointestinal tract environment eg ethyl also prevents reabsorption toxic substances metabolites excreted intestinal lumen blood well getting intestine bile vitro experiment reduced production staphylococcal enterotoxin inhibited growth staphylococcus reduced malonic dialdehyde formation increased integral antiradical activity toxic liver damage due adsorption gastrointestinal tract helps reduce blood sugar glycated hemoglobin levels eliminate lipid distress syndrome including diabetic dyslipidemia improves energy processes liver tissues experimental enterosgel pmsph firmly binds excretes pathogenic highly viscous pmsph particles cover mucosal areas protect damaging effects bacterial toxins various active chemical compounds eg deconjugated bile salts damage mucosa gastrointestinal tract enterosgel pronounced ability absorb lipopolysaccharide molecules large molecules lipopolysaccharide coprecipitated gel excreted daily dose pmsph enterosgel paste binds mg lipopolysaccharide lps extremely high biological activity found outer wall gramnegative bacteria released bacterium destroyed also known endotoxin prefix endo means inside inside bacterium distal section intestine main reservoir gramnegative microflora lipopolysaccharides normally small amount endotoxin enters bloodstream intestinal wall works barrier limits inflow endotoxin bloodstream endotoxin entering bloodstream undergoes detoxification liver however small amount endotoxin bypasses liver enters systemic bloodstream maintaining physiological concentration endotoxin blood physiological endotoxinemia process endotoxin entering bloodstream intensified various lesions intestinal mucosa dysbacteriosis accompanied translocation bacteria products life activity small result antibioticinduced death gramnegative microflora release large amounts particularly emphasized various stressful situations severe seizures burns trauma etc cause damage mucous membrane gastrointestinal tract damage occurs due redistribution energy structural resources body ie transfer systems involved adaptation stress factor systems providing increase concentration endotoxin blood exceeding physiological norm leads pathological condition known endotoxin aggression endotoxin aggression universal factor pathogenesis human diseases development caused excess endotoxin entering general bloodstream lack endotoxinbinding systems tabolin v а yakovlev excess endotoxin causes endothelial microcirculatory vessels intestinal mucosa leads development mucosal ischemia turn causes damage mucosa weakening intestinal barrier reduction endotoxin back physiological levels blood prevents damage vascular wall restores impaired blood supply intestinal mucosa eliminates mucosal ischemia latter turn contributes regeneration restoration barrier function intestinal mucosa positive effect using enterosgel pmsph primarily aimed preservingrestoring intestinal barrier restoring physiological level endotoxin breaking vicious circle caused damage mucous membrane inhibits development endotoxin aggression left result intestinal barrier insufficiency increase concentration lps mucosal bloodstream leads impaired microcirculation ischemia mucosa damage development intestinal barrier insufficiency endotoxin aggression develops right use enterosgel pmsph reverses course events level lps reduced microcirculation processes intestinal mucosa restored intestinal mucosa restored function intestinal barrier restored details notes figure result insufficiency intestinal barrier concentration lps blood flow mucous membrane increases leads disruption microcirculation ischemia mucous membrane damage development intestinal barrier insufficiency endotoxin aggression develops figure use enterosgel pms ph reverses course events level lps decreases microcirculation processes intestinal mucosa restored intestinal mucosa functions intestinal barrier pmsph absorbed gastrointestinal tract excreted unchanged form within hours binds removes endogenous exogenous toxic substances various nature including bacteria bacterial toxins antigens food allergens drugs poisons salts heavy metals alcohol lumen gastrointestinal tract also sorbs metabolic products metabolism including excess bilirubin urea cholesterol lipid complexes well metabolites responsible development endogenous indications enterosgel pmsph used adults children treatment prevention acute chronic intoxications various etiology eg alcohol mushroom including viral bacterial ones efficacy safety drug registered indications continuously monitored part routine pharmacovigilance according eurasian union european union gvp results randomized clinical trials including doubleblind placebocontrolled trials russia cis europe etc evaluated relieve ibsd randomized double blinded placebo controlled study published gut journal study confirmed safety efficacy treatment irritable bowel syndrome diarrhea enterosgel effective relieving abdominal pain diarrhoea bloating enterosgel included clinical guidelines state nonstate medical organizations healthcare professionals cis example study croatia used concomitant therapy women receiving radiotherapy chemotherapy pelvic cancer results showed effect reduction intoxication symptoms nausea vomiting successfully used hyperbilirubinemia viral including hemolytic disease also chronic renal insufficiency proved treatment allergic diseases atopic indicated used treat gastroenterological thus recommended treatment chronic including diarrhea noninfectious including treatment irritable bowel syndrome acute chronic infectious inflammatory diseases used gynecology since approved use pregnant women children
