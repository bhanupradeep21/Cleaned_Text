idea ritual reenacts myth applies mythical theories many anthropologists supported opposite position myth religious doctrine result ritual known primacy ritual hypothesis view asserted first time bible scholar william robertson scholar meletinsky notes smith introduced concept lectures religion semites smith draws distinction ancient modern religion modern religion doctrine central ancient religion ritual whole smith argues ancients tended conservative regard rituals making sure pass faithfully contrast myths justified rituals could change fact according smith many myths come us arose original nonmythic reason ritual somehow example smith gives worship adonis worshipers mourned adoniss mythical death ritual coincided annual withering vegetation according smith ritual mourning originally nonmythical explanation annual withering plants worshippers lament natural sympathy modern man touched melancholy falling autumn worshipers forgot original nonmythical reason mourning ritual created myth adonis dying rising god vegetation account essay ritual view myth mythic stanley edgar hyman makes argument similar smiths fiji physical peculiarities island one small patch

myth older least independent eb tylor believes hyman argues people use myth etiological purposes myth already place short myths didnt originate explanations natural phenomena hyman argues myth originated ritual performance thus ritual came myth myth depends ritual existence gains independent status etiological story famous anthropologist sir james george frazer claimed myth emerges ritual natural process religious evolution many ideas inspired robertson golden bough frazer famously argues man progresses belief magic rituals based magic belief religion argument follows man starts reflexive belief natural law thinks influence nature correctly applying law magic man depends strength meet difficulties dangers beset every side believes certain established order nature surely count manipulate however natural law man work sees pretended natural law false man gives idea knowable natural law throws humbly mercy certain great invisible beings behind veil nature ascribes farreaching powers arrogated words man loses belief magic justifies formerly magical rituals saying reenact myths honor mythical beings according frazer myth changes custom remains constant men continue fathers though reasons fathers acted long forgotten history religion long attempt reconcile old custom new reason find sound theory absurd classicist jane ellen harrison biblical scholar h hooke regarded myth intimately connected ritual however smith vigorously deny myths main purpose justify ritual giving account first arose eg justifying adonis worshipers ritual mourning attributing adoniss mythical instead scholars think myth largely narrative description corresponding ritual according harrison primary meaning myth spoken correlative acted rite thing harrison hooke gave explanation ancients would feel need describe ritual narrative form suggest spoken word like acted ritual considered magical potency spoken word efficacy like frazer harrison believed myths could arise initial reason ritual forgotten became diluted example cited rituals center annual renewal vegetation rituals often involve participant undergoes staged death resurrection harrison argues ritual although performed annually exclusively performed people initiate roles fullstanding members society early point god simply projection euphoria produced later however euphoria became personified distinct god god later became god vegetation initiates symbolically died reborn fully fledged members society god vegetation turn crops literally died time people forgot rituals initiatory function remembered status commemoration adonis students mythology think ritual emerged myth myth emerged ritual allow myths rituals greater degree freedom one another although myths rituals often appear together scholars think every myth corresponding ritual vice versa classicist walter burkert believes myths rituals originally myths rituals come together argues reinforce myth tells gods established ritual reinforces ritual giving divine status gods ritual based mythical event makes story event mere myth myth becomes important narrates event whose imitation considered furthermore burkert argues myth ritual together serve socializing example burkert gives example hunting rituals hunting burkert argues took sacred ritualistic aura ceased necessary survival hunting lost basic function emergence agriculture ten thousand years ago hunting ritual become important could given performing ritual hunting together ancient society bonded together group also provided way members vent anxieties aggressiveness like william smith anthropologist bronisław malinowski argued essay myth primitive psychology myths function fictitious accounts origin rituals thereby providing justification rituals myth gives rituals hoary past thereby sanctions however malinowski also points many cultural practices besides ritual related myths malinowski myth ritual therefore words myths outgrowths ritual rituals outgrowths myth like malinowski religious scholar mircea eliade thinks one important function myth provide explanation ritual eliade notes many societies rituals considered important precisely established mythical gods eliade approvingly quotes malinowskis claim myth narrative resurrection primeval eliade adds myth relates gesta deeds supernatural beings becomes exemplary model significant human traditional man sees mythical figures models imitated therefore societies claim many rituals established mythical figures thereby making rituals seem important however also like malinowski eliade notes societies use myths sanction many kinds activities rituals myth ritual eliade goes beyond malinowski giving explanation myth confer importance upon ritual according eliade ritually reenacted myth acts time machine carrying one back time myth thereby bringing one closer eliade myth ritual coextensive return mythical age achieved simply retelling myth without ritual reenactment according eliade traditional man sees myths rituals vehicles eternal return mythical age see eternal return eliade imitating exemplary acts god mythic hero simply recounting adventures man archaic society detaches profane time magically reenters great time sacred recital myths enactment rituals serve common purpose two different means remain sacred time general people httpsenwikipediaorgwikimythandritual
