attack generation oxidative dna see eg exposure males certain lifestyle environmental occupational hazards may increase risk aneuploid particular risk aneuploidy increased tobacco occupational exposure perfluorinated increased aneuploidy spermatozoa often occurs association increased dna damage dna fragmentation increased situ dna susceptibility denaturation features similar seen apoptosis somatic cells characterize abnormal spermatozoa cases male glycoprotein molecules surface ejaculated sperm cells recognized human female immune systems interpreted signal cell rejected female immune system might otherwise attack sperm reproductive tract specific glycoproteins coating sperm cells also utilized cancerous bacterial cells parasitic worms hivinfected white blood cells thereby avoiding immune response host bloodtestis barrier maintained tight junctions sertoli cells seminiferous tubules prevents communication forming spermatozoa testis blood vessels immune cells circulating within within interstitial space prevents eliciting immune response bloodtestis barrier also important preventing toxic substances disrupting spermatogenesiscitation needed fertilization relies spermatozoa sexually reproductive animals species fruit fly produce largest known spermatozoon found drosophila melanogaster produces sperm relative drosophila bifurca produces largest known spermatozoon

use sperm research spawn large numbers sperm sea making wellsuited model organisms spermatozoa marsupials usually longer placental gametophytes bryophytes ferns gymnosperms produce motile sperm cells contrary pollen grains employed gymnosperms angiosperms renders sexual reproduction absence water impossible since water necessary medium sperm egg meet algae lower plant sperm cells often multiflagellated see image thus morphologically different animal spermatozoacitation needed algae fungi produce nonmotile sperm cells called spermatia higher plants algae fungi fertilization involves
