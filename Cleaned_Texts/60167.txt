limbs may diplegia legs consists paralysis legs levels severity mild diplegia means person usually walk might walk little differently usually play run limited extent moderate diplegia means person usually walk slight bend knees usually cant run use handrails go steps people severe diplegia usually need crutches walker wheelchair able get children diplegia legs delayed growth leg muscles causes muscles short causes joints become stiff range motion decrease child grows majority children diplegia growth development problem children diplegia eventually able walk normally later generally attend regular schools become independently functioning adults common cause diplegia legs cerebral palsy paralysis legs may also caused trauma injury genetics usually occurs within diplegia usually diagnosed age years yet symptoms signs earlier stages typical enable diagnosis made contractures parents suspecting diplegia take child doctor potentially get earlier diagnosiscitation needed broken age categories different ages require different forms treatment may include therapy bracing walkers wheelchairs surgery currently treatments children concentrated primarily independent walking instead independenceoriented therapeutic approach would way child still focus walking time taught things using best method walking could include using walker wheelchair get around things easier focusing

reaching toy sitting starting vocalize sounds finger feeding parents want children excel fast wide upper lower range development time premature babies hard diagnose cerebral palsy diplegia early common symptom child diplegia stiff lower extremities become apparent six month mark means severe diplegia age child moving legs recommended exercise especially gentle stretching age characteristics diplegia become noticeable mainly unlike children age child diplegia walking age three important child specialized school environment child participate physical therapy learn social skills parents force child sit crawl walk certain way age period let child whats comfortable allow therapist correct problem want help child walk push toys recommended walking aids regular exams done make sure childs legs growing normally problems age range child diplegia makes significant physical improvement motor function time period child makes major improvements motor function regular school focus cognitive issues therapy child using walking aid mobility move around children bad thing child walking yet usually caused problem balance muscle coordination spasticity leg alignment reasons looked closely problem addressed time child reaches age rate physical improvement leveled areas balance coordination good idea refocus child attention away additional physical improvement toward intellectual learning time period child lean away physical therapy outdoor social exercises sports adaptive pe usually age child reached maximum walking ability usually decrease little child hits puberty gains height weight walking becomes harder changing period significant problems walking addressed surgery time period child development major issue separating family parents learn cope child growing give freedom independence teenagers need make decisions learn one way parents compromise let child make smaller decisions feel important parents also understand child may regress walking increase height weight going back therapy puberty recommended teenager adjust increase height weight regress sachs peterson first referenced term diplegia along word paraplegia cerebral palsy classification word
