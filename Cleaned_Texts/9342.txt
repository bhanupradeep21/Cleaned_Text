split finding upon auscultation heart caused closure aortic valve closure pulmonary valve synchronized inspiration second heart sound caused closure aortic pulmonic valves causes vibration valve leaflets adjacent structures aortic valve closes slightly pulmonic difference accentuated inspiration splits two distinct components physiological splitting expiration pulmonic valve closes nearly time aortic splitting heard exercise increases intensity aortic pulmonic components whereas deep inspiration increases intensity pulmonic component inspiration chest wall expands causes intrathoracic pressure become negative think vacuum increased negative pressure allows lungs fill air expand also induces increase venous blood return body right atrium via superior inferior venae cavae right ventricle increasing pressure gradient blood pulled vacuum body towards right side heart simultaneously reduction blood volume returning lungs left atrium blood wants stay lungs vacuum surrounding lungs pvr lower lung expansion since increase blood volume right ventricle inspiration pulmonary valve component stays open longer ventricular systole due increase ventricular emptying time whereas aortic valve component closes slightly earlier due reduction left ventricular volume ventricular emptying time thus component delayed relative component delay versus heard slight broadening even splitting second heart sound though usually heard pulmonic area chest soft heard areascitation needed expiration chest wall collapses decreases negative intrathoracic pressure compared inspiration therefore longer increase blood return right ventricle versus left ventricle right ventricle volume longer increased allows pulmonary valve close earlier overlaps closing aortic valve split longer heardcitation needed physiologically normal hear splitting second heart tone younger people inspiration pulmonary area ie ics intercostal space left edge sternum according harrisons principles internal medicine normally blood pressure falls inspiration equal less mmhg due increase blood flow right ventricle displacement interventricular septum left decreasing left ventricular filling cardiac pressure right ventricle tries open pulmonary valve pressure pulmonary artery tries close pulmonary valve remember higher pressure win hence closure pulmonary valve delayed since pressure right ventricle increased inspiration opposing pressure pulmonary artery keeping open longer expiration change evident thus appears inspirationcitation needed different types split associated medical conditions pulmonary valve closes aortic valve known paradoxically split physical exam paradoxical splitting appreciated increased splitting expiration relative inspiration versus normal splitting inspiration increase splitting seen conditions delay left ventricular emptying eg aortic stenosis left bundle branch block
