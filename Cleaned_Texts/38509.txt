changes dental morphology jaw major elements hominid evolution changes driven types processing food eaten evolution jaw thought facilitated encephalization speech formation uniquely human chin today humans possess permanent teeth dental formula breaks two pairs incisors one pair canines two pairs premolars three pairs molars modern day humans incisors generally spatulate single root canines also single rooted single cusped premolars bicuspid molars upper molars three roots lower molars two general patterns dental morphological evolution throughout human evolution include reduction facial prognathism presence cusp pattern formation parabolic palate loss diastema human teeth made dentin covered enamel areas enamel composed hydroxyapatite calcium phosphate various types human teeth perform different functions incisors used cut food canines used tear food premolars molars used crush grind according theory evolution humans evolved common ancestor chimpanzees researchers hypothesize earliest hominid ancestor would similar dental morphology chimpanzees today thus comparisons chimpanzees homo sapiens could used identify major differences major characterizing features pan troglodytes dental morphology include presence peripherally located cusps thin enamel strong facial sahelanthropus tchadensis thought one earliest species belonging human lineage fossils date back million years fossils remain five pieces jaw teeth small cranium skeletal pieces show dental features include ushaped palate canines smaller chimpanzee species thought lived million years ago fossil remains provided important information regarding dental morphology orrorin smaller teeth relative body size enamel upper canines contain mesial groove differs australopithecus canines general apelike much like modern humans orrorin postcanines smaller dated live around million years ago fossils show ardipithecus canine teeth reduced much like later hominids jaw ardipithecus much teeth ardipithecus ramidus particular showed species probably omnivore upper canines less sharp chimpanzee possibly due smaller canines chimpanzees particularly sharp often shaped use wear lower addition less sexual dimorphism size canines feature seen humans heavily contrasted size canines used infer behaviours ardipithecus ramidus great contrast social patterns chimpanzees smaller upper canine teeth suggest species aggressive especially terms relationship males hominid species lived million years ago compared modern apes afarensis africanus much smaller molars canines still larger humans smaller molars attributed consuming jaws afarensis africanus much lack shearing crests blunt teeth also cited evidence species could chew buds flowers still able consume studies australopithecine diets dental microwear showed largely frugivorous archaeological evidence meat shift dietary capacities gave australopithecines advantage survive several different megadont hominids normal show greatest reduction canines premolars abnormally determined lived million years ago true name paranthropus robustus massive jaw teeth homo species addition species thicker enamel hominid species time also evidence muscle markings jaws robustus would diet based hard tough chew foods times nutritional stress research show general diet broad paranthropus boisei hominid species dated lived million years ago evidence fossils shows morphological traits designed chewing hard tough foods commonly referred nutcracker man back molars double area molars modern humans possess premolars first second molars found four times larger teeth found interpreted researchers evidence hominids chewing predominantly back addition p boisei possesses thickest enamel hominid specimens despite large back teeth incisors canines smaller species species dated lived million years ago little known dental morphology however conjunction dental evolution expected homo habilis would display smaller teeth hominids furthermore would reduction facial prognathism hominid species evidence remains date million years ago years ago dental arcade smaller australopithecine species following trend prognathism reduced within species earlier homo erectus species exhibited larger teeth homo sapiens today teeth smaller early homo incisors also begin show shovelshaped appearance attributed change towards huntergatherer reduction molar size linked eating softer foods including cooked foods well hominid species lived million years ago continuing pattern hominid dental morphological evolution ergaster less prognathic face smaller dental arcade mandibular symphysis also shown grown general dentition similar homo erectus hominid species dating years ago analysis h heidelbergensis skeletons led researchers find jaw species featured new traits form taurodont molars reduced molar large buccal cusp general compared humans h heidelbergensis shows larger jaw smaller although direct ancestor homo sapiens neanderthals considered close relatives living years ago neanderthals named valley discovered aside dentition neanderthals robust general analysis specimens face neanderthals showed prognathism resulting retromolar space posterior third neanderthals also possessed larger molars canine teeth general characterizing feature dental morphology humans lack facial prognathism parabolashaped mandible maxilla molars size front teeth humans also small crowns relation body mass tend show reduction cusp root reduction dental arcade accompanied molars moving posteriorly axial inclination molar evolution mandible also hypothesized provide necessary physiology required however changes also linked development obstructive sleep furthermore evolution maxillomandibular system linked encephalization jaw changed muscles become weaker pressure cranial sutures lowered encephalization addition overall changes mandible maxilla led ability humans speak additionally evolution reduction jaw left little room third molar wisdom tooth form result many individuals choose remove surgery one defining features among homo sapiens presence chin protruding chin absent archaic hominids well neanderthals research shown conflicting views function chin many claim provides resistance forces cause bending mandible others claim outright purpose formation merely emerged point shortening
