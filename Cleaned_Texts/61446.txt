micropropagation tissue culture practice rapidly multiplying plant stock material produce many progeny plants using modern plant tissue culture micropropagation used multiply wide variety plants genetically modified bred conventional plant breeding methods also used provide sufficient number plantlets planting seedless plants plants respond well vegetative reproduction micropropagation cheaper means propagating eg cornell university botanist frederick campion steward discovered pioneered micropropagation plant tissue culture late early short steps micropropagation divided four stages micropropagation begins selection plant material propagated plant tissues removed intact plant sterile condition clean stock materials free viruses fungi important production healthiest plants plant material chosen culture collection explants begins dependent type tissue used including stem tips anthers petals pollen plant tissues explant material surface sterilized usually multiple courses bleach alcohol washes finally rinsed sterilized water small portion plant tissue sometimes single cell placed growth medium typically containing macro micro nutrients water sucrose energy source one plant growth regulators plant hormones usually medium thickened gelling agent agar create gel supports explant growth plants easily grown simple media others require complicated media successful growth plant tissue grows differentiates new tissues depending medium example media containing cytokinin used create branched shoots plant buds multiplication taking tissue samples produced first stage increasing number following successful introduction growth plant tissue establishment stage followed multiplication repeated cycles process single explant sample may increased one hundreds thousands plants depending type tissue grown multiplication involve different methods media plant material grown callus tissue placed blender cut smaller pieces recultured type culture medium grow callus tissue tissue grown small plants called plantlets hormones often added cause plantlets produce many small offshoots formation multiple shoots shoots transferred rooting medium high auxincytokinin ratio development roots plantlets used hardening stage involves treating plantletsshoots produced encourage root growth hardening performed vitro sterile test tube environment hardening refers preparation plants natural growth environment stage plantlets grown ideal conditions designed encourage rapid growth due controlled nature maturation plantlets often fully functional dermal coverings causes highly susceptible disease inefficient use water energy vitro conditions high humidity plants grown conditions often form working cuticle stomata keep plant drying taken culture plantlets need time adjust natural environmental conditions hardening typically involves slowly weaning plantlets highhumidity low light warm environment would considered normal growth environment species question final stage plant micropropagation plantlets removed plant media transferred soil commonly potting compost continued growth conventional methods stage often combined pretransplant stage many methods plant micro propagation meristem culture meristem subtending leaf primordia placed suitable growing media induced form new meristem meristems divided grown multiplied produce plantlets meristems taken proliferation medium put regeneration medium elongated rooted plantlet produced weeks transferred soil disease free plant produced method experimental result also suggest technique successfully utilized rapid multiplication various plant species eg callus mass undifferentiated parenchymatous cells living plant tissue placed artificial growing medium conditions favorable callus formed growth callus varies homogenous levels auxin cytokinin manipulated endogenous supply growth regulators culture medium callus growth organogenesis embryogenesis referred three different stages embryo culture embryo excised placed culture medium proper nutrient aseptic condition obtain quick optimum growth plantlets transferred soil particularly important production interspecific intergeneric hybrids overcome embryo protoplast culture plant cell isolated help wall degrading enzymes growth suitable culture medium controlled condition regeneration plantlets suitable conditions protoplast develops cell wall followed increase cell division differentiation grows new plant protoplast first cultured liquid medium c light intensity lux dark undergoing substantial cell division transferred solid medium congenial morphogenesis many horticultural crops respond well protoplast culture micropropagation number advantages traditional plant propagation techniques micropropagation always perfect means multiplying plants conditions limits use include major limitation use micropropagation many plants cost production many plants use seeds normally disease free produced good numbers readily produce plants see orthodox seed good numbers lower cost reason many plant breeders utilize micropropagation cost prohibitive breeders use produce stock plants used seed multiplication mechanisation process could reduce labour costs proven difficult achieve despite active attempts develop technological solutions micropropagation facilitates growth storage maintenance large number plants small spaces makes costeffective process micropropagation used germplasm storage protection endangered species httpsenwikipediaorgwikimicropropagation
