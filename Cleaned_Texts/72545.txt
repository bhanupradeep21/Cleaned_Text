evolutionary biology punctuated equilibrium also called punctuated equilibria theory proposes species appears fossil record population become stable showing little evolutionary change geological state little morphological change called stasis significant evolutionary change occurs theory proposes generally restricted rare geologically rapid events branching speciation called cladogenesis cladogenesis process species splits two distinct species rather one species gradually transforming another punctuated equilibrium commonly contrasted phyletic gradualism idea evolution generally occurs uniformly steady gradual transformation whole lineages paleontologists niles eldredge stephen jay gould published landmark paper developing theory called punctuated paper built upon ernst mayrs model geographic lerners theories developmental genetic empirical eldredge gould proposed degree gradualism commonly attributed charles virtually nonexistent fossil record stasis dominates history fossil species punctuated equilibrium originated logical consequence ernst mayrs concept genetic revolutions allopatric especially peripatric speciation applied fossil record although sudden

puzzling although punctuated equilibrium generally applies sexually reproducing biologists applied model nonsexual species like stabilized conventional gene flow time went biologists like gould moved away wedding punctuated equilibrium allopatric speciation particularly evidence accumulated support modes gould example particularly attracted douglas futuymas work importance reproductive isolating many hypotheses proposed explain putative causes stasis gould initially attracted michael lerners theories developmental genetic homeostasis however hypothesis rejected evidence accumulated plausible mechanisms suggested include habitat stabilizing stensethmaynard smith stability constraints imposed nature subdivided normalizing clade evidence stasis also corroborated genetics sibling species species morphologically indistinguishable whose proteins diverged sufficiently suggest separated millions fossil evidence reproductively isolated extant species sympatric olive shells amalda sp also

claiming species typically undergo evolutionary change speciation complete claiming change one generation next lineages change change generations accumulate instead time species wobbles phenotypic

confusion arisen proponents punctuated equilibrium actually argued mechanisms advocated fast punctuations taxonomic scale theory applied revolutionary claims intended punctuated equilibrium related ideas like saltationism quantum evolution mass punctuational nature punctuated equilibrium engendered perhaps confusion eldredge goulds theory goulds sympathetic treatment richard controversial

record portray contemporary evolutionary biology advancing often quoted remark gould stated although exist debate long punctuations last supporters punctuated equilibrium generally place figure quantum evolution controversial hypothesis advanced columbia university paleontologist george gaylord simpson regarded gould greatest biologically astute paleontologist twentieth simpsons conjecture according geological record rare occasions evolution would proceed rapidly form entirely new families orders classes hypothesis differs punctuated equilibrium several respects first punctuated equilibrium modest scope addressing evolution specifically species simpsons idea principally concerned evolution higher taxonomic second eldredge gould relied upon different mechanism simpson relied upon synergistic interaction genetic drift shift adaptive fitness eldredge gould relied upon ordinary speciation particularly ernst mayrs concept allopatric speciation lastly perhaps significantly quantum evolution took position issue stasis although simpson acknowledged existence stasis called bradytelic mode considered along rapid evolution unimportant larger scope major features evolution simpson stated evolutionary change nearly universal rule state motion figuratively normal evolving populations state rest bradytely exception seems restraint force must required maintain despite differences two models earlier eminent commentators sewall wright well simpson argued punctuated equilibrium little quantum evolution punctuated equilibrium often portrayed oppose concept gradualism actually form even though evolutionary change appears instantaneous geological sedimentary layers change still occurring incrementally great change one generation next end gould later commented paleontological colleagues missed insight studied evolutionary theory either know allopatric speciation considered translation geological time evolutionary colleagues also failed grasp implications primarily think geological richard dawkins dedicates chapter blind watchmaker correcting view wide confusion regarding rates change first point argue phyletic sense evolution proceeds single uniform speed called constant speedism caricature really second argument follows first caricature constant speedism dismissed left one logical alternative dawkins terms variable speedism variable speedism may also distinguished one two ways discrete variable speedism continuously variable speedism eldredge gould proposing evolution jumps stability relative rapidity described discrete variable speedists respect genuinely assert evolution generally proceeds bursts continuously variable speedists hand advance evolutionary rates fluctuate continuously fast slow stop intermediates see particular reason emphasize certain speeds others particular stasis extreme case ultraslow evolution punctuationist something special richard dawkins regards apparent gaps represented fossil record documenting migratory events rather evolutionary events according dawkins evolution certainly occurred probably gradually however punctuational equilibrium model may still inferred observation stasis examples rapid episodic speciation events documented fossil dawkins also emphasizes punctuated equilibrium oversold partly due eldredge goulds later dawkins contends hypothesis deserve particularly large
