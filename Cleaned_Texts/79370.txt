occupational asthma new onset asthma recurrence previously quiescent asthma directly caused exposure agent workplace occupational lung disease type workrelated asthma agents induce occupational asthma grouped sensitizers sensitizerinduced occupational asthma immunologic form asthma occurs due inhalation specific substances ie highmolecularweight proteins plants animal origins lowmolecularweight agents include chemicals metals wood dusts occurs latency period several weeks irritantinduced occupational asthma nonimmunologic form asthma results single multiple high dose exposure irritant products usually develops early exposure however also develop insidiously months massive exposure complex mixture alkaline dust combustion products shown world trade center disaster unlike sensitizerinduced occupational asthma subjects irritantinduced occupational asthma develop workrelated asthma symptoms reexposure low concentrations irritant initiated reactive airways dysfunction syndrome rads severe form irritant induced asthma respiratory symptoms usually develop minutes hours single accidental inhalation high concentration irritant gas aerosol vapor another type workrelated asthma workexacerbated asthma wea asthma worsened workplace conditions caused wea present fifth patients asthma wide variety conditions work including irritant chemicals dusts secondhand smoke common allergens may present work well exposures emotional stress worksite temperature physical exertion exacerbate asthma symptoms occupational asthma workexacerbated asthma present individual number diseases symptoms mimic occupational asthma asthma due nonoccupational causes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd irritable larynx syndrome hyperventilation syndrome hypersensitivity pneumonitis bronchiolitis obliterans like types asthma characterized airway inflammation reversible airways obstruction bronchospasm caused something workplace symptoms include shortness breath tightness chest coughing sputum production wheezing patients may also develop upper airway symptoms itchy eyes tearing sneezing nasal congestion symptoms may develop many years sensitizer induced asthma may occur single exposure highconcentration agent case rads present workplace substances identified asthmagenic allergenic agents flour diisocyanates latex persulfate salts aldehydes animals wood dusts metals enzymes usually account majority cases however distribution causal agents may vary widely across geographic areas depending pattern industrial example france industries affected

environment various diagnostic tests used aid diagnoses work related spirometer device used measure timed expired inspired volumes used help diagnose asthma peak expiratory flow rate pefr hand held device measures fast person exhale reliable test occupational serial pefr measured see difference ability exhale work compared controlled environment nonspecific bronchial hyperreactivity test used support diagnose occupational asthma involves measuring forced expiratory volume second patient exposure methacholine mannitol presence airway responsiveness ie significant drop seen patients occupational specific inhalation challenges test consist exposing subjects suspected occupational agent laboratory andor workplace assess asthma symptoms well reduction tests skin prick test serum immunologic testing measurement sputum eosinophils also useful establishing diagnosis occupational several forms preventive measures suggested prevent development occupational asthma also detect risk disease early allow intervention improve include comprehensive programs education training medical examinations use medications reduction exposures elimination review effectiveness prevention measurements indicated removal reduction exposure may improve asthma symptoms compared uninterrupted removal exposure may improve lung function compared continued exposure removal exposure may improve symptoms lung function reduction exposure among patients exposed low molecular weight agents isocyanates diisocyanates plicatic acid metals anhydrides two studies reported increased job loss associated removal exposure four studies reported decrease income removal exposure authors suggested benefit better improvement air quality weighed potential higher risk job asthma symptoms airway hyperresponsiveness persist several years removal offending thus early restriction exposure trigger advisable completely stopping exposure effective treatment reducing exposure always medications used
