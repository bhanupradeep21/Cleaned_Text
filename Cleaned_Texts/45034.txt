bivalve shell part body exoskeleton shell bivalve mollusk life shell class mollusks composed two hinged parts valves bivalves common essentially aquatic locales including saltwater brackish water freshwater shells bivalves commonly wash beaches often separate valves along edges lakes rivers streams bivalves definition possess two shells valves right valve left valve joined ligament two valves usually articulate one another using structures known teeth situated along hinge line many bivalve shells two valves symmetrical along hinge truly symmetrical animal said equivalved valves vary size shape inequivalved symmetrical fronttoback valves said equilateral otherwise considered inequilateral exoskeleton serves muscle attachment also protection predators mechanical damage shell several layers typically made calcium carbonate precipitated organic matrix secreted part molluscan body known mantle shells bivalves equal sides connected hinge bivalve shells collected professional amateur conchologists sometimes harvested commercial sale international shell trade use glue chalk varnish occasionally detriment local ecology bivalve shell composed two calcareous valves mantle thin membrane surrounding body secretes shell valves ligament hinge teeth mantle lobes secrete valves mantle crest creates parts mantle attached shell numerous small mantle retractor muscles arranged narrow line along length interior shell position line often quite clearly visible inside valve bivalve shell shiny line pallial line runs along small distance outer edge valve usually joining anterior adductor muscle scar posterior adductor muscle scar adductor muscles allow bivalve close shell tightly bivalves mantle edges fuse form siphons take expel water suspension feeding species live buried sediment usually long siphons bivalve needs close shell siphons retract pocketlike space mantle feature internal anatomy bivalve clearly indicated interior shell surface pallial sinus indentation pallial line addition water flows incurrent siphon ventrally exit body excurrent dorsally body valves shell made either calcite eg oysters calcite aragonite usually aragonite forming inner layer case pteriida layer form nacre mother pearl outermost layer shell known periostracum composed horny organic substance sometimes forms yellowish brownish skin outside shell periostracum may start peel shell shell allowed dry long shell added increases size two increments added open edge shell gradual thickening throughout animals life two shell valves held together animals dorsum ligament composed tensilium resilium life ligament opens shell like bent eraser door hinge adductor muscle muscles close shell like person pulling door closed handle bivalve dies adductor muscles relax resilium pushes valves open groups bivalves active swimmers like scallops many bivalves live buried soft sediments infaunal actively move around using muscular foot bivalves blue mussels attach hard substrates using byssus groups bivalves oysters thorny oysters jewel boxes kittens paws jingle shells etc cement lower valve hard substrate using shell material cement fixes permanently place many species cemented bivalves example jewel boxes lower valve deeply cupped upper valve tends rather flat groups cemented bivalves lower cemented valve left valve others right valve oldest point bivalve shell called beak raised area around known umbo plural hinge area dorsum back shell lower curved margin ventral side anterior front shell byssus foot located animal structures posterior back shell siphon located scallops example siphons without able view organs however determining anterior posterior rather difficult animals siphon pallial sinus siphon present left right valves point towards animals valves called sinopalliate shells without pallial sinus termed animals mentioned scallops well groups often byssal notch present anterior end right valve anterior auricles wings valves either larger equal posterior ones valves may also distinctive comb ctinoleum within byssal notch right valve valve neither notch comb sinus auricles size likely left valve animals whose valves umbo seems point point often towards anterior part valve though exceptions rule also bivalves two adductor muscle scars different sizes posterior scar larger two visible condition referred anisomyarian scars equal size termed isomyarian valve one muscle scar termed monomyarian furthermore animals distinct external ligament ligament usually posterior side umbo valves using one guidelines strongly suggest anterior posterior orientation given bivalve shell therefore whether particular shell belongs right side left age bivalve molluscs estimated several ways noahs ark clam arca noae used compare methods annual growth rings exterior valves counted one per year give satisfactory result sometimes spurts growth occur may create extra ring cause confusion early rings may get worn away near umbones narrow rings near margin may difficult interpret fully grown individuals similar annual pallial line scars interior valves easily seen dark colored shells may overgrown obscured deposition hard material another
