dug presentday argentina megatherium giant prehistoric ground sloth named pterosaur pterodactylus described discover name aquatic reptile mosasaurus one first people suggest earth dominated reptiles rather mammals prehistoric times cuvier also remembered strongly opposing theories evolution time darwins theory mainly proposed jeanbaptiste de lamarck geoffroy sainthilaire cuvier believed evidence evolution rather evidence cyclical creations destructions life forms global extinction events deluges cuvier geoffroy engaged famous debate said exemplify two major deviations biological thinking time

cuvier grand master protestant faculties theology french cuvier critical theories evolution particular proposed contemporaries lamarck geoffroy sainthilaire involved gradual transmutation one form another repeatedly emphasized extensive experience fossil material indicated one fossil form rule gradually change succeeding distinct fossil form deeprooted source opposition gradual transformation species goal creating accurate taxonomy based principles comparative project would become impossible species mutable clear boundaries according university california museum paleontology cuvier believe organic evolution change organisms anatomy would rendered unable survive studied mummified cats ibises geoffroy brought back napoleons invasion egypt showed different living counterparts cuvier used support claim life forms evolve also observed napoleons expedition egypt retrieved animals mummified thousands years previously seemed different modern certainly cuvier wrote one detect greater difference creatures see human mummies skeletons presentday lamarck dismissed conclusion arguing evolution happened much slowly observed thousand years cuvier however turn criticized lamarck naturalists conveniently introduced hundreds thousands years stroke pen uphold theory instead argued one may judge long time would produce multiplying lesser time produces since lesser time produced organic changes neither argued would much longer moreover commitment principle correlation parts caused doubt mechanism could ever gradually modify part animal isolation parts way lamarck proposed without rendering animal unable éloge de de lamarck praise de cuvier wrote lamarcks theory evolution rested two arbitrary suppositions one seminal vapor organizes embryo efforts desires may engender organs system established foundations may amuse imagination poet metaphysician may derive entirely new series systems moment bear examination anyone dissected hand viscus even instead said typical form makes abrupt appearance fossil record persists unchanged time extinction cuvier attempted explain paleontological phenomenon envisioned would readdressed century later punctuated equilibrium harmonize bible attributed different time periods aware intervals major catastrophes last found cuviers claim new fossil forms appear abruptly geological record continue without alteration overlying strata used later critics evolution support abruptness seemed consistent special divine creation although cuviers finding different types made paleontological debuts different geological strata clearly lack change consistent supposed sacred immutability species idea extinction cuvier great proponent obviously many writers unjustly accused cuvier obstinately maintaining fossil human beings could never found essay theory earth say human bones yet found among fossil remains made clear exactly meant assert human bones hitherto found among extraneous fossils must understood speak fossils petrifactions properly petrified bones time mineralize turn stone typically far older bones found date cuviers point human bones found knew relatively recent age petrified found superficial dogmatic claim however new evidence came light included later edition appendix describing skeleton freely admitted instance fossil human harshness criticism strength reputation however continued discourage naturalists speculating gradual transmutation species charles darwin published origin species two decades cuviers early tenure national museum paris cuvier published studies fossil bones argued belonged large extinct quadrupeds first two publications identifying mammoth mastodon fossils belonging extinct species rather modern elephants study identified megatherium giant extinct species primary evidence identifications mammoths mastodons separate extinct species structure jaws primary evidence megatherium fossil belonged massive sloth came comparison skull extant sloth cuvier wrote paleontological method form tooth leads form condyle scapula nails equation curve implies properties taking property separately basis special equation able return original equation associated

comparison fossil specimens anatomy extant species necessary context vast knowledge animal anatomy access unparallelled natural history collections reality however prevent rise popular legend cuvier could reconstruct entire bodily structures extinct animals given fragments time cuvier presented paper living fossil elephants still widely believed species animal ever become extinct authorities buffon claimed fossils found europe animals woolly rhinoceros mammoth remains animals still living tropics ie rhinoceros elephants shifted europe asia earth became cooler thereafter cuvier performed pioneering research study elephant fossils excavated around paris bones studied however remarkably different bones elephants currently thriving india africa discovery led cuvier denounce idea fossils came currently living idea bones belonged elephants living hiding somewhere earth seemed ridiculous cuvier would nearly impossible miss due enormous size megatherium provided another compelling datapoint argument ultimately repeated identification fossils belonging species unknown man combined mineralogical evidence stratigraphical studies paris drove cuvier proposition abrupt changes earth underwent long period time caused species go cuviers theory extinction met opposition notable natural scientists like darwin charles lyell unlike cuvier didnt believe extinction sudden process believed like earth animals collectively undergo gradual change species differed widely cuviers theory seemed propose animal extinction catastrophic however cuviers theory extinction still justified case mass extinctions occurred last million years approximately half living species went completely extinct within short geological span two million years due part volcanic eruptions asteroids rapid fluctuations sea level time new species rose others fell precipitating arrival human beings cuviers early work demonstrated conclusively extinction indeed credible natural global cuviers thinking extinctions influenced extensive readings greek latin literature gathered every ancient report known day relating discoveries petrified bones remarkable size mediterranean influence cuviers theory extinction collection specimens new world many obtained native americans also maintained archive native american observations legends interpretations immense fossilized skeletal remains sent informants friends americas impressed native american accounts identified enormous bones teeth tusks animals deep past destroyed cuvier came believe animal fossils examined remains species become extinct near end paper living fossil elephants said contrary many natural scientists beliefs time cuvier believed animal extinction product anthropogenic causes instead proposed humans around long enough indirectly maintain fossilized records ancient earth also attempted verify water catastrophe analyzing records various cultural backgrounds though found many accounts water catastrophe unclear believe event occurred brink human history nonetheless led cuvier become active proponent geological school thought called catastrophism maintained many geological features earth history life could explained catastrophic events caused extinction many species animals course career cuvier came believe single catastrophe several resulting succession different faunas wrote ideas many times particular discussed great detail preliminary discourse introduction collection papers recherches sur les ossements fossiles de quadrupèdes researches quadruped fossil bones quadruped fossils published cuviers explanation catastrophic event derived two different sources including jeanandré deluc déodat de dolomieu former proposed continents existing ten millennia ago collapsed allowing ocean floors rise higher continental plates become continents exist today latter proposed massive tsunami hit globe leading mass extinction whatever case believed deluge happened quite recently human history fact believed earths existence limited extended many natural scientists like lamarck believed much evidence used support catastrophist theories taken fossil records strongly suggested fossils found evidence worlds first reptiles followed chronologically mammals humans cuvier didnt wish delve much causation extinction introduction new animal species rather focused sequential aspects animal history earth way chronological dating earth history somewhat reflected lamarcks transformationist theories cuvier also worked alongside alexandre brongniart analyzing parisian rock cycle using stratigraphical methods able extrapolate key information regarding earth history studying rocks rocks contained remnants mollusks bones mammals shells findings cuvier brongniart concluded many environmental changes occurred quick catastrophes though earth often placid extended periods time sudden disturbances preliminary discourse became well known unauthorized translations made english german italian case english entirely accurately cuvier would publish revised version name discours sur les révolutions de la surface du globe discourse upheavals surface cuviers death catastrophic school geological thought lost ground uniformitarianism championed charles lyell others claimed geological features earth best explained currently observable forces erosion volcanism acting gradually extended period time increasing interest topic mass extinction starting late twentieth century however led resurgence interest among historians science scholars aspect cuviers cuvier collaborated several years alexandre brongniart instructor paris mining school produce monograph geology region around paris published preliminary version final version published monograph identified characteristic fossils different rock layers used analyze geological column ordered layers sedimentary rock paris basin concluded layers laid extended period clearly faunal succession area submerged sea water times times fresh water along william smiths work period geological map england also used characteristic fossils principle faunal succession correlate layers sedimentary rock monograph helped establish scientific discipline stratigraphy major development history paleontology history working drawing cuvier first correctly identify print fossil found bavaria small flying named pterodactyle later latinized pterodactylus first known member diverse order pterosaurs cuvier identified fossil found maastricht giant marine lizard first known mosasaur cuvier speculated correctly time reptiles rather mammals dominant speculation confirmed two decades following death series spectacular finds mostly english geologists fossil collectors mary anning william conybeare william buckland gideon mantell found described first ichthyosaurs plesiosaurs dinosaurs paper fossil remains animal found plaster quarries near paris cuvier states known principle correlation parts idea referred cuviers principle correlation parts states organs animals body deeply interdependent species existence relies way organs interact example species whose digestive tract best suited digesting flesh whose body best suited foraging plants survive thus species functional significance body part must correlated others else species sustain cuvier believed power principle came part ability aid reconstruction fossils cases fossils quadrupeds found complete assembled skeletons rather scattered pieces needed put together anatomists make matters worse deposits often contained fossilized remains several species animals mixed together anatomists reassembling skeletons ran risk combining remains different species producing imaginary composite species however examining functional purpose bone applying principle correlation parts cuvier believed problem could avoided principles ability aid reconstruction fossils also helpful cuviers work providing evidence favor extinction strongest evidence cuvier could provide favor extinction would prove fossilized remains animal belonged species longer existed applying cuviers principle correlation parts would easier verify fossilized skeleton authentically reconstructed thus validating observations drawn comparing skeletons existing species addition helping anatomists reconstruct fossilized remains cuvier believed principle held enormous predictive power well example discovered fossil resembled marsupial gypsum quarries montmartre correctly predicted fossil would contain bones commonly found marsupials pelvis cuvier hoped principles anatomy would provide lawbased framework would elevate natural history truly scientific level occupied physics chemistry thanks laws established isaac newton antoine lavoisier respectively expressed confidence introduction le règne animal day anatomy would expressed laws simple mathematical predictive newtons laws physics viewed principle important step predictive capabilities principles demonstrated prediction existence marsupial pelvic bones gypsum quarries montmartre demonstrated goals reach principle correlation parts also cuviers way understanding function nonevolutionary context without invoking divine paper fossil remains animal found plaster quarries near paris cuvier emphasizes predictive power principle today comparative anatomy reached point perfection inspecting single bone one often determine class sometimes even genus animal belonged bone belonged head limbs number direction shape bones compose part animals body always necessary relation parts way infer whole one vice versa though cuvier believed principles major contribution rational mathematical way reconstruct fossils make predictions reality difficult cuvier use principle functional significance many body parts still unknown time relating body parts body parts using cuviers principle impossible though cuvier able make accurate predictions fossil finds practice accuracy predictions came application principle rather vast knowledge comparative anatomy however despite cuviers exaggerations power principle basic concept central comparative anatomy paris museum cuvier furthered studies anatomical classification animals believed classification based organs collectively function concept called functional integration cuvier reinforced idea subordinating less vital body parts critical organ systems part anatomical classification included ideas book animal kingdom anatomical studies cuvier believed function played bigger role form field taxonomy scientific beliefs rested idea principles correlation parts conditions existence former principle accounts connection organ function practical use organism survive latter principle emphasizes animals physiological function relation surrounding environment findings published scientific readings including leçons danatomie comparée lessons comparative anatomy animal kingdom ultimately cuvier developed four embranchements branches classified animals based taxonomical anatomical studies later performed groundbreaking work classifying animals vertebrate invertebrate groups subdividing category instance proposed invertebrates could segmented three individual categories including mollusca radiata articulata also articulated species move across categories theory called transmutation reasoned organisms acquire change physical traits time still retain optimal survival result often conflicted geoffroy sainthilaire jeanbaptiste lamarcks theories transmutation cuvier published first independent work tableau élémentaire de lhistoire naturelle des animaux abridgment course lectures école du pantheon may regarded foundation first statement natural classification animal cuvier categorized snails cockles cuttlefish one category called molluscs mollusca embranchment though noted three animals outwardly different terms shell shape diet saw noticeable pattern pertaining overall physical appearance cuvier began intensive studies molluscs time normandy first time ever seen sea papers socalled mollusca began appearing early however memoirs branch published annales du museum subsequently collected mémoires pour servir à lhistoire et à lanatomie des mollusques published one volume paris cuviers researches fish begun finally culminated publication histoire naturelle des poissons contained descriptions species fishes joint production achille valenciennes cuviers work project extended years palaeontology cuvier published long list memoirs partly relating bones extinct
