diurnality form plant animal behavior characterized activity daytime period sleeping inactivity night common adjective used daytime activity diurnal timing activity animal depends variety environmental factors temperature ability gather food sight risk predation time year diurnality cycle activity within period cyclic activities called circadian rhythms endogenous cycles dependent external cues environmental factors except zeitgeber animals active twilight crepuscular active night nocturnal animals active sporadic times night day cathemeral plants open flowers daytime described diurnal bloom nighttime nocturnal timing flower opening often related time preferred pollinators foraging example sunflowers open day attract bees whereas nightblooming cereus opens night attract large sphinx moths many types animals classified diurnal meaning active day time inactive periods rest night commonly classified diurnal animals include mammals birds primates diurnal including scientifically classifying diurnality within animals challenge apart obvious increased activity levels day time initially animals diurnal adaptations allowed animals become nocturnal helped contribute success many especially evolutionary movement nocturnality allowed better avoid predators gain resources less competition come adaptations mammals live today vision one greatly affected senses switching back forth diurnality nocturnality seen using biological physiological analysis rod nuclei primate includes losing two four cone opsins assists colour vision making many mammals early primates converted back diurnality better vision included trichromatic colour vision became advantageous making diurnality colour vision adaptive traits simiiformes includes studies using chromatin distribution analysis rod nuclei different simian eyes found transitions diurnality nocturnality occurred several times within primate lineages switching diurnality common still today diurnality seems reappearing many lineages animals including small rodent mammals like nile grass rat golden mantle squirrel specifically geckos thought naturally nocturnal shown many transitions diurnality species geckos showing diurnal many diurnal species recorded comparative analysis studies using newer lineages gecko species done study evolution diurnality transitions counted gecko lineages shows significance strong environmental influences like climate change predation risk competition resources contributing using example geckos thought species like mediodactylus amictopholis live higher altitudes switched diurnality help gain heat day therefore conserve energy especially colder seasonal temperatures light one defining environmental factors determines animals activity photoperiod light dark cycle determined geographical location day time associated much ambient light night time associated little ambient light one strongest influences suprachiasmatic nucleus scn part hypothalamus brain controls circadian rhythm animals determines whether animal diurnal scn uses visual information like light start cascade hormones released work many physiological behavioural light produce powerful masking effects animals circadian rhythm meaning mask influence internal clock changing activity patterns animal either temporarily long term exposed enough light long period masking referred either positive masking negative masking either increasing diurnal animals activity decreasing nocturnal animals activity depicted exposing different types rodents photoperiods diurnal nile grass rat nocturnal mouse exposed photoperiod light intensity increased activity occurred within grass rat positive masking decreased activity within mouse negative even small amounts environmental light change shown effect activity mammals observational study done activity nocturnal owl monkeys gran chaco south america showed increased amounts moonlight night increased activity levels night led decrease daytime meaning species ambient moonlight negatively correlated diurnal also connected foraging behaviours monkeys nights little moonlight affected monkeys ability forage efficiently forced active day find diurnality shown evolutionary trait many animal species diurnality mostly reappearing many lineages environmental factors like ambient temperature food availability predation risk influence whether animal evolve diurnal effects strong enough mask circadian rhythm changing activity patterns becoming three factors often involve one another animals need able find balance survive thrive ambient temperature shown affect even convert nocturnal animals diurnality way conserve metabolic nocturnal animals often energetically challenged due active nighttime ambient temperatures lower day lose lot energy form body according circadian thermosenergetics cte hypothesis animals expending energy taking food sleep active light cycle meaning active shown studies done small nocturnal mice laboratory setting placed combination enough cold hunger stress converted diurnality temporal niche switching another similar study involved energetically challenging small mammals showed diurnality beneficial animal sheltered location rest reducing heat studies concluded nocturnal mammals change activity patterns diurnal energetically stressed due heat loss limited food availability predation also limited meaning risks predation less risk freezing starving many plants diurnal nocturnal depending time period effective pollinators ie insects visit plant angiosperm plants visited various insects flower adapts phenology effective pollinators thus effectiveness relative diurnal nocturnal species insects affects diurnal nocturnal nature plants pollinate causing instances
