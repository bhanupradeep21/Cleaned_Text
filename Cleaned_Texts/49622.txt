bird anatomy physiological structure birds bodies shows many unique adaptations mostly aiding flight birds light skeletal system light powerful musculature along circulatory respiratory systems capable high metabolic rates oxygen supply permit bird fly development beak led evolution specially adapted digestive system birds many bones hollow pneumatized crisscrossing struts trusses structural strength number hollow bones varies among species though large gliding soaring birds tend respiratory air sacs often form air pockets within semihollow bones birds bones diving birds often less hollow nondiving species penguins puffins without pneumatized bones flightless birds ostriches emus pneumatized case emu pneumatized cervical bird skeleton highly adapted flight extremely lightweight strong enough withstand stresses taking flying landing one key adaptation fusing bones single ossifications pygostyle birds usually smaller number bones terrestrial vertebrates birds also lack teeth even

known rhamphotheca species two holes known nares lead respiratory system due high metabolic rate required flight birds high oxygen demand highly effective respiratory system helps meet demand although birds lungs fairly rigid structures expand contract mammals reptiles many amphibians instead structures act bellows ventilate lungs air sacs distributed throughout much birds airsacs move air unidirectionally parabronchi rigid primary mechanism unidirectional flows bird lungs flow irreversibility high reynolds number manifested asymmetric junctions loopforming although bird lungs smaller mammals comparable size air sacs account total body volume whereas mammals alveoli act bellows constitute total body walls air sacs good blood supply play direct role gas exchange birds lack diaphragm therefore use intercostal abdominal muscles expand contract entire thoracoabdominal cavities thus rhythmically changing volumes air sacs unison illustration right active phase respiration birds exhalation requiring contraction muscles relaxation muscles causes inhalation three distinct sets organs perform respiration anterior air sacs interclavicular cervicals anterior thoracics lungs posterior air sacs posterior thoracics abdominals typically nine air sacs within however number range seven twelve depending species bird passerines possess seven air sacs clavicular air sacs may interconnect fused anterior thoracic sacs inhalation environmental air initially enters bird nostrils heated humidified filtered nasal passages upper parts air enters lower trachea continues beyond syrinx point trachea branches two primary bronchi going two lungs primary bronchi enter lungs become intrapulmonary bronchi give set parallel branches called ventrobronchi little equivalent set ends intrapulmonary bronchi discharge air posterior air sacs caudal end bird pair dorsoventrobronchi connected large number parallel microscopic air capillaries parabronchi gas exchange bird inhales tracheal air flows intrapulmonary bronchi posterior air sacs well dorsobronchi ventrobronchi whose openings intrapulmonary bronchi previously believed tightly closed however recent studies shown aerodynamics bronchial architecture directs inhaled air away openings ventrobronchi continuation intrapulmonary bronchus towards dorsobronchi posterior air dorsobronchi air flows parabronchi therefore gas exchanger ventrobronchi air escape expanding anterior air sacs inhalation posterior anterior air sacs posterior air sacs filling fresh inhaled air anterior air sacs fill spent oxygenpoor air passed lungs exhalation intrapulmonary bronchi believed tightly constricted region ventrobronchi branch region dorsobronchi branch believed intricate aerodynamic features contracting posterior air sacs therefore empty dorsobronchi fresh air posterior air sacs flows parabronchi direction occurred inhalation ventrobronchi air passages connecting ventrobronchi anterior air sacs intrapulmonary bronchi open exhalation thus allowing oxygenpoor air two organs escape via trachea oxygenated air therefore flows constantly entire breathing cycle single direction blood flow bird lung right angles flow air parabronchi forming crosscurrent flow exchange system see illustration partial pressure oxygen parabronchi declines along lengths diffuses blood blood capillaries leaving exchanger near entrance airflow take capillaries leaving near exit end parabronchi contents capillaries mix final partial pressure oxygen mixed pulmonary venous blood higher exhaled nevertheless less half inhaled thus achieving roughly systemic arterial blood partial pressure oxygen mammals bellowstype trachea area dead space oxygenpoor air contains end exhalation first air reenter posterior air sacs lungs comparison mammalian respiratory tract dead space volume bird average times greater mammals birds long necks inevitably long tracheae must therefore take deeper breaths mammals make allowances greater dead space volumes birds eg whooper swan cygnus cygnus white spoonbill platalea leucorodia whooping crane grus americana helmeted curassow pauxi pauxi trachea cranes coiled back forth within body drastically increasing dead space purpose extraordinary feature unknown air passes unidirectionally lungs exhalation inspiration causing except oxygenpoor dead space air left trachea exhalation breathed beginning inhalation little mixing new oxygenrich air spent oxygenpoor air occurs mammalian lungs changing oxygenrich oxygenpoor moves unidirectionally parabronchi avian lungs alveoli mammalian lungs instead contain millions narrow passages known parabronchi connecting dorsobronchi ventrobronchi either ends lungs air flows anteriorly caudal cranial parallel parabronchi parabronchi honeycombed walls cells honeycomb deadend air vesicles called atria project radially parabronchi atria site gas exchange simple blood flow around parabronchi atria forms crosscurrent gas exchanger see

bulky portions roughage undigested food eg feathers fur bone fragments seed husks via cloaca regurgitate food three general ways birds drink using gravity sucking using tongue fluid also obtained food birds unable swallow sucking pumping action peristalsis esophagus humans drink repeatedly raising heads filling mouths allow liquid flow gravity method usually described sipping tipping notable exception family pigeons doves columbidae fact according konrad lorenz one recognizes order single behavioral characteristic namely drinking water pumped peristalsis esophagus occurs without exception

like sunbirds nectariniidae hummingbirds trochilidae drink using protrusible grooved troughlike tongues parrots psittacidae lap many seabirds glands near eyes allow drink seawater excess salt eliminated nostrils many desert birds get water need entirely food elimination nitrogenous wastes uric acid reduces physiological demand uric acid toxic thus need diluted much male birds two testes
