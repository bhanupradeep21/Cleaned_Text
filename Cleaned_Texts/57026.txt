communication theory field article robert craig attempting unify academic field communication craig argues communication theorists become unified dialogue charting calls dialogical dialectical tension similarities differences understanding communication demonstrating elements create tension within craig mapped similarities differences seven suggested traditions communication theory showed traditions understand communication well traditions understanding creates tension article received multiple become foundation many communication theory translated several different communication theory field created two main dialogues craig theorists myers argued craig misrepresented theoretical assumptions theory theory distinguish good bad craig responded myers misunderstood basic argument article also misrepresented case russill proposed pragmatism eighth tradition communication craig responded expanding idea placing russills proposition conversation seven communication theory field recognized multiple associations influence upon field communication awards include best article award international communication well golden anniversary monograph award national communication work since translated theory presented communication theory field become basis book theorizing communication craig coedited heidi well adopted several communication theory textbooks new framework understanding field communication sparked third debate within field international relations theory communication theory field expanded conversation regarding disciplinary identity field time communication theory textbooks little agreement present field theories include article since become foundational framework four different textbooks introduce field article craig proposes vision communication theory takes huge step toward unifying rather disparate field addressing move toward unifying vision craig focused communication theory practical discipline shows various traditions communication theory engaged dialogue practice deliberative process theorists would engage dialog practical implications communication end craig proposes seven different traditions communication theory outlines one would engage others craig argues study communication communication theory become rich flourishing field communication theory identifiable field study yet exist field communication theory become fragmented separate domains simply ignore inability engage dialog one another causes theorists view communication isolated viewpoints denies richness available engaging different craig argues communication theorists engaging study practical different traditions able common ground dialog form albeit taking different perspective process forming dialog theorists different viewpoints communication communication theory fully engage ongoing practical discourse metadiscourse communication communication discipline began single discipline many different disciplines independently researching interdisciplinary beginning separated theorists different conceptions communication rather unifying common topic craig argues solution incoherence field communication unified theory communication create dialogue theorists engages differences one another create new understandings achieve dialog craig proposes calls dialogicaldialectical coherence common awareness certain complementaries tensions among different types communication craig believes different theories develop total isolation one another therefore dialogicaldialectical coherence provide set background assumptions different theories engage productive craig argues metatheory second level theory deals first level theories second level metamodel communication theory would help understand differences first level communication thesis place craig proposes seven suggested traditions communication emerged way understanding proposed seven traditions communication theory placed two separate first show traditions different interpretation communication defines traditions vocabulary communication problems next show argumentation traditions would look craig outlines specifics craig concluded open invitation explore differences theories might shed light key issues show new traditions could created engaging communication theory communication problems craig proposes several future traditions

exchange spiritual tradition theorizing communication nonmaterial mystical plane myers computermediated communication scholar loyola university new orleans criticizes craigs ideas pox compromises reply craig myers makes two main arguments craigs article myers argues craig misrepresents metamodel lack critical truth within craigs construction problematic field communication metamodel misrepresented unjustly arguing separation first second level constitutive models hiding paradox within statement privileges constitutive model rather another theoretical next myers argues craig fails draw way discern truth within using case study regarding rise fall technological determinism among computermediated communication myers argues metamodel needs provide mechanism reduce misrepresentation mistake evaluating myers frames craigs ideas collective discourse without evaluative criteria good theory bad theory mad hatters tea party allow participate party discourse able inform participants time craig responded almost jamesian myers criticisms founded actual inconsistencies within craigs rather founded difference myers craigs respective notions truth proper role empirical truth criterion adjudicating among regard myers first claim separation first level theories second level metatheory paradoxical therefore inaccurate misguided distinction craig admits paradox inherent within separation first order theories metatheory slippage logical levels inherent feature bug communication forget theory among things communication craig cites gregory bateson pointing theory logical types forbids mixing different levels avoid paradox practical communication necessarily exactly actual communication fraught paradox logicians ideal would us try resolve paradoxes actual practice dont way actually occurring communication people employ different means dealing paradox resolving paradox possible craig argues myers unable prove inconsistency misrepresentation came using constitutive model rather trying subvert every theory constitutional model craig used constitutive model theory truth logical necessity constitutive model pragmatically accomplish goal project opening space competing theories communication constitutional model able maintain theoretical second argument metamodel lacks empirical truth criteria craig argues myers miss point metamodel claiming evaluate truth myers case study fails back metamodel distinguish falseness however contrary myers claim metamodel allow theorists engaged discussion judge validity theories basis empirical evidence ordinary reasonable metamodel deny universally established absolute truth field communication craig points myers correct metamodel illequipped judge theories valid invalid also doesnt good job closing antarctic ozone hole solve problems case study myers presents debate technological determinism realm computer mediated craig points debate occurred social scientific type research shared commitment empirical research spite already possessing shared truth criteria researchers failed prevent errors myers hopes would avoided holding onto form absolute case study would good critique empirical truth supports critique constitutive metamodel less relying upon case study myers sabotages argument establishing absolute truth criteria demonstrating would gain little
