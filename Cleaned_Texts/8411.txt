reserpine drug used treatment high blood pressure usually combination thiazide diuretic large clinical trials shown combined treatment reserpine plus thiazide diuretic reduces mortality people hypertension although use reserpine solo drug declined since first approved fda combined use reserpine thiazide diuretic vasodilator still recommended patients achieve adequate lowering blood pressure firstline drug treatment reserpinehydrochlorothiazide combo pill commonly prescribed combination antihypertensive pills available antihypertensive actions reserpine largely due antinoradrenergic effects result ability deplete catecholamines among monoamine neurotransmitters peripheral sympathetic nerve endings substances normally involved controlling heart rate force cardiac contraction peripheral vascular doses mg per day reserpine well common adverse effect nasal stuffiness reserpine also used relief psychotic review found persons schizophrenia reserpine chlorpromazine similar rates adverse effects reserpine less effective chlorpromazine improving persons global reserpine recommended alternative drug treating hypertension jnc cochrane review found reserpine effective firstline antihypertensive drugs lowering blood diuretic combination one drug treatments shown reduce mortality randomized controlled trials hypertension detection followup veterans administration cooperative study group antihypertensive systolic hypertension elderly moreover reserpine included secondary antihypertensive option patients achieve blood pressure lowering targets allhat previously used treat symptoms dyskinesia patients huntingtons alternative medications preferred daily dose reserpine antihypertensive treatment low mg use reserpine antipsychotic drug nearly completely abandoned recently made comeback adjunctive treatment combination antipsychotics refractory patients get dopamine blockade antipsychotic dopamine depletion reserpine doses kind adjunctive goal kept low resulting better tolerability originally doses mg mg daily used treat psychotic diseases doses excess mg daily often required use anticholinergic drug combat excessive cholinergic activity many parts body well parkinsonism adjunctive treatment doses typically kept mg twice day doses less mgday reserpine adverse effects common nasal reserpine cause nasal congestion nausea vomiting weight gain gastric intolerance gastric ulceration due increased cholinergic activity gastric tissue impaired mucosal quality stomach cramps diarrhea drug causes hypotension bradycardia may worsen asthma congested nose erectile dysfunction consequences central nervous system effects higher doses mg higher include drowsiness dizziness nightmares parkinsonism general weakness fatigue high dose studies rodents found reserpine cause fibroadenoma breast malignant tumors seminal vesicles among others early suggestions reserpine causes breast cancer women risk approximately doubled confirmed may also cause reserpine passes breast milk harmful breastfed infants therefore avoided breastfeeding may produce excessive decline blood pressure doses needed treatment anxiety depression reserpine irreversibly blocks hcoupled vesicular monoamine transporters mostly expressed neuroendocrine cells mostly expressed neurons thus blockade neuronal reserpine inhibits uptake reduces stores monoamine neurotransmitters norepinephrine dopamine serotonin histamine synaptic vesicles normally transports free intracellular norepinephrine serotonin dopamine presynaptic nerve terminal presynaptic vesicles subsequent release synaptic cleft exocytosis unprotected neurotransmitters metabolized mao well comt attached outer membrane mitochondria cytosol axon terminals consequently never excite postsynaptic cell thus reserpine increases removal monoamine neurotransmitters neurons decreasing size neurotransmitter pools thereby decreasing amplitude neurotransmitter may take body days weeks replenish
