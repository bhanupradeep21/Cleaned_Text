polyurethane polyester resin alberto cobos et al noted diagnostic characters miragaia longicollum based skeletal elements absent dacentrurus holotype found england layers age traits compared shared

transversely expanded upper end neck two rows triangular bony plates present lightly convex outer side notch upper front edge creating notable feature miragaia long neck composed least seventeen vertebrae according authors represents culmination trend towards longer necks seen stegosaurians thyreophora larger group belong originally seem nine neck vertebrae also number shown basal stegosaurian huayangosaurus later forms like stegosaurus hesperosaurus twelve thirteen remarkably miragaia neck vertebrae sauropods different group dinosaurs famous long necks contrasts traditional view stegosaurians low browsers short necks chinese sauropods euhelopus mamenchisaurus omeisaurus many neck vertebrae miragaia sauropods late jurassic possessing twelve fifteen mateus colleagues suggested long neck either allowed miragaia browse level herbivores exploiting neck arose due sexual selection possible food gathering function neck makes sexual selection less plausible explanation entirely convincing though contemporary iberian sauropods lusotitan dinheirosaurus turiasaurus large might competed mediumheight browser niche partitioning still problematic iberia stegosaurian remains referred dacentrurus stegosaurus would possessed feeding envelope feeding height stratification overlapping sauropods great neck length achieved combination three processes incorporation back vertebrae neck addition new vertebrae lengthening individual neck vertebrae authors considered whether mechanisms might paralleled stegosaurians long neck miragaia appears resulted mostly back vertebrae becoming incorporated neck based vertebral counts stegosaurians group total number prescral vertebrae back neck combined hardly increased clear transformation dorsal vertebrae back becoming cervicalised cervical vertebrae neck whereas huayangosaurus still possessed sixteen back vertebrae number reduced thirteen hesperosaurus currently count number dorsal vertebrae possible evidence miragaia new vertebrae contributed neck instead distribution existing vertebrae back neck probably changed four extra vertebrae becoming cervicals evidence increasing vertebral length miragaia stegosaurus compared basal species equivocal could due postmortem distortion mechanism seen minor factor neck authors also discussed possible underlying genetic mechanisms changes pointed contrast mammals almost always seven neck vertebrae due much four hoxgenes ensuring strict partitioning neck back extant dinosaurs chicken single hoxgene regulates process seemingly leading greater
