task allocation partitioning way tasks chosen assigned subdivided coordinated within colony social insects task allocation partitioning gives rise division labor often observed social insect colonies whereby individuals specialize different tasks within colony eg foragers nurses communication closely related ability allocate tasks among individuals within group entry focuses exclusively social insects information human task allocation partitioning see division labour task analysis workflow social living provides multitude advantages practitioners including predation risk reduction environmental buffering food procurement possible mating advantages advanced form sociality eusociality characterized overlapping generations cooperative care young reproductive division labor includes sterility nearsterility overwhelming majority colony members exceptions practitioners eusociality insects orders hymenoptera ants bees wasps isoptera termites thysanoptera thrips hemiptera
