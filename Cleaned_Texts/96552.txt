philosophical aspects abortion debate logical arguments made either support opposition abortion philosophical arguments abortion debate deontological rightsbased view almost abortion illegal generally rests claims existence moral right life human beings human organisms begins near conceptionfertilization induced abortion deliberate unjust killing embryo violation right life law prohibit unjust violations right life view abortion circumstances legal generally rests claims women right control happens bodies abortion exercise right law criminalize exercises right control ones body lifesupport functions although sides likely see rightsbased considerations paramount popular arguments appeal consequentialist utilitarian considerations example antiabortion groups see list sometimes claim existence postabortion syndrome link abortion breast cancer alleged medical psychological risks abortion side prochoice groups see list say criminalizing abortion lead deaths many women backalley abortions unwanted children negative social impact conversely abortion lowers crime rate reproductive rights necessary achieve full equal participation women society workforce consequentialist arguments sides tend vigorously disputed though widely discussed philosophical literature contemporary philosophical literature contains two kinds arguments concerning morality abortion one family arguments see following three sections relates moral status embryo right life words embryo person moral sense affirmative answer would support claim central antiabortion argument negative answer would support claim central prochoice argument another family arguments see section thomson relates bodily question whether womans bodily rights justify abortion even embryo right life negative answer would support claim central antiabortion argument affirmative answer would support claim central prochoice argument since zygote genetically identical embryo fully formed fetus baby questioning beginning personhood could lead instance sorites paradox also known paradox mary anne warren article arguing permissibility holds moral opposition abortion based following argument warren however thinks human used different senses human used moral sense mean person fullfledged member moral community human means biological human embryo biologically human organism animal uncontroversial warren holds follow embryo person persons rights right help make distinction person biological human warren notes respect lives highly intelligent aliens even biological humans thinks cluster properties characterize person something five definitely person whether biologically human none perhaps one person whether biologically human fetus one consciousness becomes susceptible timing disputed hence writers apply similar criteria concluding embryo lacks right life lacks rationality certain higher psychological capacities including others conclude personhood based brain birth concept essence reversal brain death used modern definition medical death proposal presence brain waves would enough grant personhood even features lacking based whether brain activity brain stem cerebral cortex relevant personhood two concepts brain birth writers disagree precisely features confer right agree features must certain developed psychological physiological features embryo lacks warrens arguments face two main objections comatose patient objection claims patients reversible coma satisfy warrens conscious communicate would lack right life one response although reversibly comatose lack conscious mental states retain unconscious dispositional mental states since appropriate neurological configurations preserved may allow satisfy warrens criteria comatose also still possess brain activity brain waves objection apply brain birth theories finally postnatal humans unable feel pain due genetic disorders thus satisfy warrens infanticide objection points infants indeed one year age since around begin outstrip abilities nonhuman animals one warrens hence would accounted nonpersons view thus view would permit abortion infanticide warren agrees infants nonpersons killing strictly murder denies infanticide generally warren claims human born longer conflict womans rights since human given adoption killing human would wrong person would go desires people willing adopt infant pay keep infant alive although clarification critics beef cattle chickens livestock raised indeed even supporters would pay keep alive however response supports might livestock plants infants morally persons infant life designated human thus warrens argument suggest inherent value life human beings persons lives potential becoming person nonetheless warren grants argument entails infanticide would morally acceptable circumstances desert island philosopher peter singer similarly concludes infanticide particularly severely disabled infants justifiable certain jeff mcmahan grants limited circumstances may permissible kill one infant save lives several opponents may see concessions reductio ad absurdum writers views supporters may see merely examples unpleasant acts justified unusual cases since brain waves appear lower brain brain stem weeks gestation higher brain cerebral cortex weeks gestation whole brain higher brain brain birth personhood concepts based presence brain waves permit opponents warrens view believe matters morally one actually exhibiting complex mental qualities sort identifies rather one oneself selfdirected genetic propensity natural capacity develop qualities words crucial one kind entity substance right conditions actively develops point exhibiting warrens qualities point life even actually exhibit developed yet embryo infant lost severe alzheimers human beings natural indeed view essentially right life could possibly fail right since modern embryology shows embryo begins exist conception natural capacity complex mental qualities therefore right life begins conception grounding right life essential natural capacities rather accidental developed capacities said several developed capacities continuum admitting greater lesser example rational selfconscious developed capacities view must arbitrarily select particular degree development cutoff point right natural capacities view nonarbitrary whose capacities developed would right life developed capacities natural capacities view entails equal right life continuum developed capacities makes exact point personhood ensues vague human beings around point say one two years age shadowy indeterminate moral indeterminacy natural capacities defenders warrenstyle arguments grant problems yet fully reply natural capacities view fares better argued example human beings vary significantly natural cognitive capacities naturally intelligent others one imagine series spectrum species gradually diminishing natural capacities example series humans amoebae slightest differences natural capacities successive species therefore problems arbitrariness inequality apply equally natural capacities words continuum developed natural capacities natural capacities view inevitably face problems well critics reject natural capacities view basis takes mere species membership genetic potential basis respect essence charge entails anencephalic infants irreversibly comatose full right moreover marquiss argument see

abortions seriously immoral moral category killing innocent adult human consequence argument abortion wrong cases killing child adult sort future embryo would wrong example involuntary euthanasia patients future filled intense physical pain morally acceptable aborting embryos whose future filled intense physical pain also morally acceptable would example invoke fact embryos future would

deprives victim valuable future since futures appear contain much value much longer future middle class persons future much less gratuitous pain suffering someone extreme killings would turn much wrong others strongly counterintuitive people believe killings equally wrong things equal marquiss argument must mistaken writers concluded wrongness killing arises harm causes victim since varies
