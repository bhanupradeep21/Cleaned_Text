corallivore animal feeds coral corallivores important group reef organism influence coral abundance distribution community structure corallivores feed coral using variety unique adaptations strategies animals known corallivores include certain mollusks annelids fish crustaceans flatworms echinoderms first recorded evidence corallivory presented charles darwin voyage hms beagle found coral stomach two scarus parrotfish visiting cocos keeling islands charles darwin told englishman living islands large shoals parrotfish subsisted entirely darwin dissected several parrotfish found pieces coral finely ground calcareous material led darwin correctly theorize species parrotfish consume coral contribute sediment environment passing finely ground particles coral first descriptions organisms actively consuming coral written jacques cousteau published national trip red sea aboard rv calypso cousteau swam pair green humphead parrotfish watched take regular bites leaving white scars coral around like darwin cousteau also noticed sediment particles produced parrotfishs waste settled cousteau noted leisurely speed parrotfish consumed coral remarked appeared unhurried like sea cows browsing stone term corallivore comes latin word corallum coral vora eat approximately onethird known corallivores obligate corallivores remaining threefourths facultative obligate corallivory defined diet least obligate corallivores present tropical oceans except facultative corallivores defined organisms regularly consume coral without comprising large percentage thought facultative corallivores damselfish eat coral promote algal growth many facultative corallivores also graze algae competes coral space resources grazing coral may provide better conditions algal aggressive grazing may keep algal community state accelerated growth effectively preventing transition slower growing organisms display different strategies consuming coral majority corallivores feed stony coral however species feed soft known obligate soft coral feeder soft coral estimated small percentage diet soft coral common genera coral consumed acropora pocillopora montipora described coral genera known consumed mucus feeders feed exclusively coral coral regularly slough mucus surrounding water thought mucus feeding causes harm however shown disrupt microbial communities living many mucus feeders shown preference towards damaged corals typically produce mucus undamaged browsers eat coral tissue without damaging corals calcium carbonate majority corallivore species scrapers consume live coral tissue small portions corals calcium carbonate excavators consume live coral tissue large portions corals calcium carbonate excavators broken spot biters focused biters spot biters take bites scattered colonys surface focused biters bite repeatedly one time focused biting thought display territoriality parrotfish later determined kinds corallivores excavators thought biggest impact coral reef communities due large amount coral skeleton additionally studies suggest damage excavating takes significantly longer heal types bioeroders consume dead coral bioeroders thought help reshape coral reef landscapes eroding dead corallivory relatively rare nature less known fish species four families crustaceans four families gastropods echinoderm genera identified corallivores present tropical reef regions

butterflyfish species corallivores making corallivory common feeding corallivorous fish come different species obligate butterflyfish wide range adaptations facilitate coral consumption butterflyfish long mouth use like forceps pluck individual coral polyps use teeth scrape coral butterflyfish consume coral longer intestines fish consume coral suggesting corallivores need time process complex molecules golden pufferfish distributed widely across tropical oceans however considered particularly significant corallivore specifically tropical eastern golden pufferfish uses beaklike dental plate feed tips branching corals estimated pace grams oz calcium carbonate per square meter sq ft live coral per despite large amount coral consumed studies suggest golden pufferfish little influence coral abundance parrotfish family fish contain several corallivorous species reefdwelling parrotfish teeth lower upper jaw evolved edge cutting edge allows parrotfish scrape feed coral tissue cutting edge teeth parrotfish resembles beak basis organisms common addition cutting edge adaptation parrotfish also welldeveloped crossed joints connect dentary articular bones lower jaw presents mechanical
