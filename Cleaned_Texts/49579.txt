prominently megarachne occur suggested three four genera constitute mycteroptidae mycterops woodwardopterus megarachne might represent different ontogenetic stages different developmental stages animal life based morphology size interpretation correct sparse mucrones megarachne might age megarachne significantly larger woodwardopterus smallest genus mycterops even densely packed ornaments carapace tergite might thus youngest ontogenetic stage mycterops megarachne woodwardopterus represent animal name taking priority would mycterops named first cladogram adapted lamsdell colleagues
