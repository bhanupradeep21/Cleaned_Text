treating person spinal cord injury repairing damage created injury ultimate goal using variety treatments greater improvements achieved therefore treatment limited one method furthermore increasing activity increase hisher chances rehabilitation process following spinal cord injury typically begins acute care setting occupational therapy plays important role management recent studies emphasize importance early occupational therapy started immediately client stable process includes teaching coping skills physical physical therapists occupational therapists social workers psychologists health care professionals typically work team coordination physiatrist decide goals patient develop plan discharge appropriate patients condition first step focus support prevention interventions aim give individual sense control situation patient likely feels little patient becomes stable may move rehabilitation facility remain acute care setting patient begins take active role rehabilitation stage works team develop reasonable functional acute phase physical occupational therapists focus patients respiratory status prevention indirect complications pressure sores maintaining range motion keeping available musculature depending neurological level impairment nli muscles responsible expanding thorax facilitate inhalation may affected nli affects ventilatory muscles emphasis placed muscles intact function example intercostal muscles receive innervation damaged emphasis need placed unaffected muscles innervated higher levels cns sci patients reduced total lung capacity tidal pertinent physical therapists teach sci patients accessory breathing techniques eg apical breathing glossopharyngeal breathing etc typically taught healthy individuals physical therapists assist immobilized patients effective cough techniques secretion clearance stretching thoracic wall suggest abdominal support belts necessary amount time patient immobilized may depend level spinal cord injury physical therapists work patient prevent complications may arise due immobilization complications arise immobilization include muscle atrophy osteoporosis especially lower limbs increasing risk fractures femur passive weight bearing paralyzed lower extremities appears ineffective stressing bones muscular contractions initiated functional electrical stimulation fes yielded positive results intensity frequency duration stress bones appear important determinants improved bone generally frequency effective three weekly exercise sessions studies duration suggest several months one years fes improvement locomotor function one primary goals people spinal cord injury sci treatments may focus specific goals restore walking locomotion optimal level individual effective way restore locomotion complete repair techniques yet developed regeneration treadmill training groundtraining functional electrical stimulation used improve walking locomotor activity activities work neurons central pattern generator cpg generate rhythmic movements body still functioning inactivity neurons cpg degenerate therefore activities important keeping neurons active regeneration activities systematic review found insufficient evidence conclude locomotor training strategy improves walking function people spinal cord suggests type training used goals routines biggest applying spinal cord stimulation transcutaneous epidurally weight supported walking shown improve locomotor english nhs serious shortage specialist beds identified review december additional beds required patients waited average days bed specialist ward meant patients inappropriately occupying beds major trauma centres suggested nhs englands specialised commissioning division would unable fund recommendations according spinal injuries association referrals specialist spinal cord injury centres admitted many patients referred though rehabilitation interventions performed acute phase recent literature suggests total hours spent rehabilitation first year spinal cord injury occur discharge inpatient participants study received total physical therapy hours total occupational therapy hours suggests inpatient rehabilitation lengths stay reduced postdischarge therapy may replace inpatient treatment whether patients placed inpatient rehabilitation discharged occupational therapists attempt maximize functional independence stage depending level spinal cord injury whatever sparing patient optimized bed mobility transfers wheelchair mobility skills performing activities daily living adls interventions occupational therapists help patient major problem spinal cord injury patients restricted range motion massage therapy used aid range motion rehabilitation literature shown participants spinal cord injuries massage therapy added rehabilitation significant improvement observed physical therapist functional living activities limb range motion could due decrease hreflex amplitudes measured emg critical comfort spinal cord injury patients reducing cramps adls difficult individual spinal cord injury however rehabilitation process individuals sci may able live independently community without fulltime attendant care depending level interventions focus support education individual includes evaluation limb function determine patient capable independently teaching patient selfcare independence daily activities like eating bowel bladder management mobility goal obtaining competency selfcare tasks contributes significantly individuals sense reduces burden caregivers quality life issues sexual health function spinal cord injury also assistive devices wheelchairs substantial effect quality life patient careful selection teaching patient transfer different positions wheelchair bed important part therapy devices sliding transfer boards grab bars assist individuals able transfer independently wheelchair drivers seat using sliding transfer board may able return driving adapted vehicle complete independence driving also requires ability load unload ones wheelchair addition acquiring skills wheelchair transfers individuals spinal cord injury greatly benefit exercise reconditioning majority cases spinal cord injury leaves lower limbs either entirely paralyzed insufficient strength endurance motor control support safe effective physical training therefore exercise training employs use arm crank ergometry wheelchair ergometry one study subjects traumatic spinal cord injury participated progressive exercise training program involved arm ergometry resistance training subjects exercise group experienced significant increases strength almost muscle groups compared control group exercisers also reported less stress fewer depressive symptoms greater satisfaction physical functioning less pain better quality physical therapists able provide variety exercise interventions including passive range motion exercises upper body wheeling arm crank ergometry functional electrical stimulation electrically stimulated resistance exercises improve arterial function living physical therapists improve quality life individuals spinal cord injury developing exercise programs tailored meet individual patient needs adapted physical activity equipment also used allow sport participation example sitskiis used individuals spinal cord injury crosscountry downhill skiing patients living environment also modified improve independence example ramps lifts added patients home part rehabilitation involves investigating options returning previous interests well developing new community participation important aspect maintaining quality body weight supported treadmill training another intervention physiotherapists may assist body weight supported treadmill training researched attempt prevent bone loss lower extremities individuals spinal cord injury research shown early weightbearing acute spinal cord injury standing treadmill walking times weekly weeks resulted loss moderate loss trabecular bone compared immobilized subjects lost trabecular bone gait training body weight support among patients incomplete spinal cord injuries also recently shown effective conventional physiotherapy improving spatialtemporal kinematic gait combination body weight supported treadmill training bwstt roboticassisted bwstt implemented training programs benefits include assist reproducing leg movements optimizing gait pattern speed step length amplitude training sessions prolonged walking speed adjusted increasing motor outcome provides consistency movement manual interventionscues trainer may variable although trainer analyze gait pattern outcome measures training supervise important note patient must active participant robotic movements try move type training would implemented beginning rehabilitation progressed independent locomotion improvements made however roboticassisted bwstt expensive often affordable physiotherapy alternative development nonmotorized exoskeletons currently investigated patients incomplete development exoskeleton locomotor device would provide inexpensive alternative robotic devices exoskeleton
