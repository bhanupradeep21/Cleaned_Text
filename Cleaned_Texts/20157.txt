female lays clutch eggs asteroid enters atmosphere asteroid hits earth mexico causing big explosion sending debris shooting air explosion heats air temperature near site hundreds degrees hundreds alamosaurus burned alive moments later burning debris come raining sky crushing many alamosaurus afterwards magnitude earthquake cripples rest herd blast wave arrives finishes last alamosaurus eggs destroyed survive buried soil mongolia herd charonosaurus reside watering hole females lay eggs saurornithoides steals egg one nests soon confronted enraged mother second sauronithoides appears however forces charonosaurus flee two predators chase prey eventually manage bring impact caused searing hot ejecta cloud begin engulfing planet approaches pacific northwest earthquake mexico arrives

quetzalcoatlus wings males wings eventually lose ability keep air falls death mate eventually land avoid fate pair triceratops make mountains engulfed ejecta cloud scorches alive intense heat ejecta cloud ignites fires around world including pacific northwest causes firestorm form reaches speeds large dinosaurs including feeding tyrannosaurus group triceratops ankylosaurus forced flee whilst smaller animals hide underground female quetzalcoatlus mourning mate also forced fly away firestorm consumes forest mongolia fortyfive minutes since impact ejecta cloud rolls east increasing temperature around mongolia several degrees every second reaches causing three charonosaurus pair saurornithoides use cave shelter temperatures return normal five hours pair saurornithoides run outside feast corpse nearby charonosaurus two surviving charonosaurus travel watering hole third stays close however dramatic shift temperature causes gargantuan sandstorm saurornithoides survive hiding behind prey third charonosaurus remains cave two charonosaurus however get caught storm quickly suffocate storm eventually passes last charonosaurus heads watering hole surviving saurornithoides making way find charonosaurus taking drink desperately hungry yet weak ordeal one recklessly attacks charonosaurus quick struggle hadrosaur collapses top killing remaining saurornithoides resorts cannibalising corpse companion four days since impact food short supply across entire planet pacific northwest four triceratops head towards island untouched fire storm search food cause island forms huge megatsunami also causes water recede form bridge ocean three triceratops cross land bridge island remaining female quetzalcoatlus lands eats stranded fish wave builds races towards shore attempts take caught foot wave drowns wave drowning three triceratops well ten days passed since impact dinosaurs remain mongolia charonosaurus stays close watering hole collapses dies inhaling gas rose holes basin saurornithoides runs dead charonosaurus killed toxic gas back pacific northwest small number dinosaurs patrol grey wasteland starving ankylosaurus finds small bush almost faces triceratops tyrannosaurus arrives attacking triceratops first tyrannosaurus loses eye preys right horn manages break left horn kills lunging biting neck tyrannosaurus turns attention ankylosaurus struck leg flips onto back bites throat heads back dead triceratops trips ankylosaurus neck impaled triceratopss remaining right horn back mexico alamosaurus egg sheltered safely ground
