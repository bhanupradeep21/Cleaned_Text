filariasis parasitic disease caused infection roundworms filarioidea spread bloodfeeding insects black flies mosquitoes belong group diseases called helminthiases parasites exist wild subtropical parts southern asia africa south pacific parts south america one acquire temperate areas like europe united eight known filarial worms humans definitive host divided three groups according part body affect adult worms usually stay one tissue release early larval forms known microfilariae persons blood circulating microfilariae taken blood meal insect vector vector develop infective larvae spread another person individuals infected filarial worms may described either microfilaraemic amicrofilaraemic depending whether microfilariae found peripheral blood filariasis diagnosed microfilaraemic cases primarily direct observation microfilariae peripheral blood occult filariasis diagnosed amicrofilaraemic cases based clinical observations cases finding circulating antigen blood spectacular symptom lymphatic filariasis elephantiasis edema thickening skin underlying first disease discovered transmitted mosquito elephantiasis results parasites lodge lymphatic systemcitation needed elephantiasis affects mainly lower extremities ears mucous membranes amputation stumps affected less frequently however different species filarial worms tend affect different parts body wuchereria bancrofti affect legs arms vulva breasts scrotum causing hydrocele formation brugia timori rarely affects genitalscitation needed develop chronic stages elephantiasis usually free microfilariae amicrofilaraemic often adverse immunological reactions microfilariae well adult subcutaneous worms present rashes urticarial papules arthritis well hyper hypopigmentation macules onchocerca volvulus manifests eyes causing river blindness onchocerciasis one leading causes blindness worldcitation needed serous cavity filariasis presents symptoms similar subcutaneous filariasis addition abdominal pain worms also deeptissue dwellerscitation needed human filarial nematode worms complicated life cycles primarily consists five stages male female worms mate female gives birth live microfilariae thousands microfilariae taken vector insect intermediate host blood meal intermediate host microfilariae molt develop thirdstage infective larvae upon taking another blood meal vector insect culex pipiens injects infectious larvae dermis layer skin one year larvae molt two stages maturing adult wormscitation needed filariasis usually diagnosed identifying microfilariae giemsa stained thin thick blood film smears using gold standard known finger prick test finger prick test draws blood capillaries finger tip larger veins used blood extraction strict windows time day must observed blood must drawn appropriate times reflect feeding activities vector insects examples w bancrofti whose vector mosquito night preferred time blood collection loa loas vector deer fly daytime collection method diagnosis relevant microfilariae use blood transport lungs skin filarial worms streptocerca volvulus produce microfilariae use blood reside skin worms diagnosis relies upon skin snips carried timecitation needed various concentration methods applied membrane filter knotts concentration method sedimentation techniquecitation needed polymerase chain reaction pcr antigenic assays detect circulating filarial antigens also available making diagnosis latter particularly useful amicrofilaraemic cases spot tests far sensitive allow test done anytime rather late hourscitation needed lymph node aspirate chylous fluid may also yield microfilariae medical imaging ct mri may reveal filarial dance sign chylous fluid xray tests show calcified adult worms lymphatics dec provocation test performed obtain satisfying numbers parasites daytime samples xenodiagnosis obsolete eosinophilia nonspecific primary signcitation needed recommended treatment people outside united states albendazole combined combination diethylcarbamazine albendazole also side effects drugs include nausea vomiting treatments microfilaricides effect adult worms drugs critical treatment individual proper hygiene also good evidence albendazole alone addition albendazole diethylcarbamazine ivermectin makes minimal difference clearing microfilaria adult worms blood diethylcarbamazinemedicated salt effective controlling lymphatic filariasis maintaining coverage community six different trials made use known drug maximum capacity absence new drugs study india shown formulation albendazole better antifilarial efficacy albendazole source needed common antibiotic doxycycline suggested treating filarial parasites symbiotic bacteria genus wolbachia live inside worm seem play major role reproduction development disease drug shown signs inhibiting reproduction bacteria inducing clinical trials june liverpool school tropical medicine reported eightweek course almost eliminated source

humans offer prospects elimination means vermicidal treatment human link chain infection broken notionally disease could wiped season practice simple complications multiple species overlap certain
