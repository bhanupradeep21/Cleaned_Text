eusociality evolved repeatedly different orders animals notably termites hymenoptera wasps bees ants true sociality animals sterile individuals work reproductive success others found termites ambrosia beetles galldwelling aphids thrips marine spongedwelling shrimp synalpheus regalis naked molerats heterocephalus glaber many genera insect order fact eusociality evolved often hymenoptera remains rare throughout rest animal kingdom made evolution topic debate among evolutionary biologists eusocial organisms first appear behave stark contrast simple interpretations darwinian evolution passing ones genes next generation fitness central idea evolutionary biology current theories propose evolution eusociality occurred either due kin selection proposed w competing theory multilevel selection proposed eo wilson single trait model sufficient explain evolution eusociality likely pathway eusociality involved combination preconditions ecological factors genetic influences eusociality characterized four main criteria overlapping generations cooperative brood care philopatry reproductive overlapping generations means multiple generations live together older offspring may help parents raise siblings cooperative brood care individuals parents assist raising offspring means food gathering protection philopatry individuals remain living birthplace final category reproductive altruism divergent social orders altruism occurs individual performs behavior benefits recipient way individuals reproductive altruism one extreme forms altruism members group give breeding opportunities order participate reproductive success individuals giving reproductive success form sterile caste workers within group species practice reproductive altruism produce one queens breeding females larger rest remainder society composed breeding males sterile male female workers charles darwin considered evolution eusociality major problem theory natural selection origin species described existence sterile worker castes social insects one special difficulty first appeared insuperable actually fatal whole theory next paragraph book darwin describes solution trait sterility carried individuals without expression individuals express sterility help reproductive relatives sterile trait persist darwin right track except sterility characteristic shared among eusocial animals sterile workers many eusocial species actually physiologically sterile male workers still produce sperm female workers sometimes lay eggs species become new queen old one dies observed hymenoptera termites insight led inclusive fitness kin selection becoming important theories century help explain eusociality inclusive fitness described combination ones reproductive success reproductive success others share similar animals may increase inclusive fitness kin selection kin selection individuals help close relatives reproduction process seemingly relatives propagate individuals genes kin selection follows hamiltons rule suggests benefit behavior recipient taking account genetic relatedness recipient altruist outweighs costs behavior altruist altruists genetic advantage perform altruistic william hamilton proposed eusociality arose social hymenoptera kin selection interesting genetic sex determination trait haplodiploidy males produced parthenogenesis come unfertilized eggs thus one set chromosomes females produced fertilized eggs sisters singlymated mother share average genes whereas mothers always share genes offspring thus sisters propagate genes helping mothers raise sisters leave nest raise though hamiltons argument appears work well hymenoptera excludes diploid eusocial organisms intersibling relatedness parentoffspring relatedness even haplodiploid systems average relatedness sisters falls rapidly queen mates multiple males mates even lower moreover males share sisters genes cases equal sex ratios females related siblings average better raising however despite shortcomings haplodiploidy hypothesis still considered importance example many bees femalebiased sex ratios andor invest less kill males analysis shown hymenoptera ancestral female monogamous eight independent cases eusociality indicates high relatedness sisters favored evolution eusociality initial stages several occasions helps explain abundance eusocial genera within order hymenoptera including three separate origins within halictid bees monogamy hypothesis formulated jacobus boomsma currently leading hypothesis concerning initial evolution eusociality hymenoptera uses hamiltons kin selection approach way applies haploid diploid organisms queen lifetimestrictly monogamous words mates one individual entire life progeny equally related siblings offspring cases average sisters brothers thus natural selection favor cooperation situation efficient raise siblings offspring could start paving path towards eusociality higher efficiency becomes especially pronounced group living many monogamous animals individuals death prompts partner look new mate would affect relatedness hinder evolution eusociality workers would much related offspring siblings however many hymenoptera form lifetime monogamy queen mates single male dies colony founding seems ancestral state hymenopteran lineages evolved termites also mating system reproductive female queen commits single male life king pattern seems ancestral lastly strict monogamy facilitated eusociality spongedwelling species philopatry predominates emigrants nest intense inbreeding occur case eusocial species inbreeding mimic even surpass effects haplodiploidy siblings may actually share greater genes like haplodiploidy kin selection individuals propagate genes promotion siblings rather example need dispersal aggregation multiclonal groups may helped drive evolution eusociality termites two additional hypotheses proposed first chromosomal linkage hypothesis much termite genome sexlinked makes sisters related somewhat brothers somewhat brothersister relatedness less termite workers might bias cooperative brood care towards sex hypothesis also mimics effects haplodiploidy proposes males would help raise queens male offspring females would care queens female symbiont hypothesis termites quite different others molt termites lose lining hindgut subsequent bacteria protozoa colonize guts cellulose digestion depend interactions termites gut recolonized thus forcing become social could precursor precondition eusociality evolved although symbiont hypothesis serves precondition termites evolve eusocial societies scientists found two crucial preconditions evolution eusociality across species include altricial offspring require large amounts parental care reach maturity low reproductive success rates solitary pairs attempt preconditions led two lifestyle characteristics observed eusocial species nest building extensive parental care ecological factors also probably precursor example spongedwelling shrimp depend upon sponges feeding current food termites depend upon dead decaying wood naked mole rats depend upon tubers resources patchy distributions throughout environments animals means high cost dispersing individual may find another source starves resources must defended group survive requirements make necessity high social order survival genetic constraints may influenced evolution eusociality genome structure order hymenoptera found highest recombination rates groups animalia eusocial genus apis honeybees highest recombination rate higher genes determining worker behavior division labor found regions apis genome highest rates recombination molecular mechanisms likely important evolution eusociality high recombination rates associated creation novel genes upon natural selection could important eusocial genera biased gene conversion rates also higher eusocial could increase genotypic diversity could allow workers meet demands changing social structure another hypothesis lower overall genetic diversity eusociality levels increase throughout family apidaeis due decreased exposure parasites eusociality appears maintained manipulation sterile workers mechanisms include hormonal control pheromones restricting food young order control size consumption eggs laid females queen behavioral dominance naked mole rats behavioral dominance occurs form queen facing worker headtohead shoving throughout tunnels naked mole rats burrow quite nowak et al outlines path eusociality could evolve means multilevel group selection five nowaks paper however received major criticisms erroneously separating inclusive fitness theory standard natural selection authors replied arguing nowak et al misrepresent years empirical literature
