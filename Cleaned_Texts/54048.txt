patients urgently inflammation associated uveitis must identified treated ensure little damage eye possible secondly elevated intraocular pressure associated glaucoma must treated steroid treatment may discouraged associated side topical corticosteroid eyedrops firstline treatment uveitis represent approved topical treatment active noninfectious anterior effective treatment short term available corticosteroids also administered via periocular injection intravitreal ivt injection severe cases treatment may administered systemically via oral intravenous corticosteroids treatments including systemic immunosuppressive agents require close monitoring may considered corticosteroids ineffective concerns regarding side effects immunosuppressive agents include tcell inhibitors cyclosporine tacrolimus antimetabolites azathioprine methotrexate mycophenolate mofetil leflunomide alkylating agents cyclophosphamides chlorambucil biological drugs adalimumab uveitis patients treated local steroids acute phase may also need longterm treatment lowerdose steroids preventive measure flareups precaution employed order minimize use topical corticosteroids due severe ocular side effects despite significant advances therapeutics prevalence blindness secondary uveitis reduced us past steroid treatment uveitis lead uveitic corticosteroids increase fluid pressure inside eye increasing
