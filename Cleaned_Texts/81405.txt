gastrointestinal bleeding gi bleed also called gastrointestinal hemorrhage gib forms bleeding gastrointestinal tract mouth significant blood loss short time symptoms may include vomiting red blood vomiting black blood bloody stool black small amounts bleeding long time may cause irondeficiency anemia resulting feeling tired heartrelated chest symptoms may include abdominal pain shortness breath pale skin passing sometimes small amounts bleeding symptoms may bleeding typically divided two main types upper gastrointestinal bleeding lower gastrointestinal causes upper gi bleeds include peptic ulcer disease esophageal varices due liver cirrhosis cancer among causes lower gi bleeds include hemorrhoids cancer inflammatory bowel disease among small amounts bleeding may detected fecal occult blood endoscopy lower upper gastrointestinal tract may locate area medical imaging may useful cases initial treatment focuses resuscitation may include intravenous fluids blood often blood transfusions recommended unless hemoglobin less treatment proton pump inhibitors octreotide antibiotics may considered certain measures effective esophageal balloon may attempted presumed esophageal endoscopy esophagus stomach duodenum endoscopy large bowel generally recommended within hours may allow treatment well upper gi bleed common lower gi upper gi bleed occurs per adults per lower gi
