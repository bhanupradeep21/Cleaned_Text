avoided prolong qt interval sotalol amiodarone drugs promote abnormal heart lists medications associated prolongation qt interval found drugs reduce blood levels potassium diuretics like furosemide bendroflumethiazide also avoided worsen tendency periodic paralysis conversely potassiumcontaining supplements increase blood potassium levels may strenuous competitive sport discouraged may increase risk arrhythmias although gentle exercise forms long qt syndrome predispose affected dangerous heart rhythm disturbances risk arrhythmias reduced taking beta blockers propranolol block effects adrenaline antiarrhythmic drugs flecainide verapamil may also highest risk recurrent arrhythmias already cardiac arrest may benefit implantable cardioverter defibrillator small device implanted skin detect dangerous arrhythmias automatically treat small electric periodic paralysis may improved taking carbonic anhydrase inhibitors syndrome rare approximately cases described medical condition
