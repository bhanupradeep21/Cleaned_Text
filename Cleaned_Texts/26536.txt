tetanus toxin tent extremely potent neurotoxin produced vegetative cell clostridium anaerobic conditions causing tetanus known function clostridia soil environment normally encountered also called spasmogenic toxin tentoxilysin tetanospasmin tetanus neurotoxin toxin measured approximately making second related botulinum toxin deadliest toxin world however tests conducted solely mice may react toxin differently humans animals c tetani also produces exotoxin tetanolysin hemolysin causes destruction tetanus toxin spreads tissue spaces lymphatic vascular systems enters nervous system

provoke immune response naturally acquired tetanus infections thus usually provide immunity subsequent infections immunization impermanent must repeated periodically instead uses less deadly toxoid derived toxin tetanus vaccine combination vaccines dtp little written researched tentanospasmin evolved animals toxin highly specific muscular neurons higher animals carried plasmid implies host bacterium acquired plasmid horizontal gene transfer another source organism case plasmid based toxins shigatoxin although tentanospasmin classified extremely potent neurotoxin evolutionary origins may indicate may served entirely different function early animal life routinely carried anaerobic organisms early life earth typically capable aerobic anaerobic respiration way example human dna still contains genes necessary anaerobic respiration one example lens cells human eye still operate anaerobic mode lower animals even mammals capable anaerobic respiration hibernation phases spasms typically caused toxin mimic cardiac rhythms skeletal muscles reptiles exposed toxin would provide evolutionary advantage hibernating reptile keeping blood moving slowly around organism hibernation mode organism switched anaerobic respiration theory supported fact tetanus bacteria uses pump dump strategy secreting toxin inside plasmid membrane exocysing plasmid vacuole target tissue toxin immediately released typically would imply tetani evolved symbiote early primitive reptiles provide means pumping blood around hibernation cycles since molecule complex highly specialized would confer survival advantage exist evolutionary pressure outside model even remotely explain substance potent highly specialized would exist higher mammals host bacteria common component intestinal gut flora
