aquariums electrical usage water expensive keep along lights many aquariums especially live plants new aquarists also pay close attention electrical setup aquarium taking care set power connections

less attention several nutrient cycles important aquarium dissolved oxygen enters system surface waterair interface similarly carbon dioxide escapes system air phosphate cycle important although often overlooked nutrient cycle sulfur iron micronutrients also cycle system entering food exiting waste appropriate handling nitrogen cycle along supplying adequately balanced food supply considered biological loading enough keep nutrient cycles approximate equilibrium aquarium must maintained regularly ensure fish kept healthy daily maintenance consists checking fish signs stress also aquarists must make sure water good quality cloudy foamy temperature water appropriate particular species fish live aquarium typical weekly maintenance includes changing around water cleaning gravel substrate aquarium one however manage avoid entirely keeping somewhat selfsufficient good habit remove water replaced vacuuming gravel suitable implements eliminate uneaten foods residues settle many areas tap water considered safe fish live contains chemicals harm tap water areas must treated suitable water conditioner product removes chlorine chloramine neutralizes heavy metals present water conditions

raising brine organisms saltwater usually alkaline ph alkalinity acidicity fresh water varies hardness measures overall dissolved mineral content hard soft water may preferred hard water usually alkaline soft water usually neutral dissolved organic content dissolved gases content also important factors home aquarists typically use tap water supplied local water supply network fill tanks straight tap water used localities pipe chlorinated water past possible condition water simply letting water stand day two allows chlorine time however chloramine used often leave water readily water

contrast public aquaria large water needs often locate near natural water source river lake ocean reduce level treatment hobbyists use algae scrubber filter water naturallycitation needed water temperature determines two basic aquarium classifications tropical versus cold water fish plant species tolerate limited temperature range tropical aquaria average temperature much common temperate coldwater aquaria fish better suited cooler environment temperature consistency important range organisms accustomed sudden changes temperatures cause shock lead water temperature regulated thermostat heater cooler water movement also important simulating natural ecosystem aquarists may prefer anything still water swift currents depending aquariums inhabitants water movement controlled via aeration air pumps powerheads careful design internal water flow location filtration system points inflow outflow primary concern aquarist management waste produced aquariums inhabitants fish invertebrates fungi bacteria excrete nitrogen waste form ammonia converts ammonium water must either pass nitrogen cycle removed passing ammonia also produced decomposition plant animal matter including fecal matter detritus nitrogen waste products become toxic fish aquarium inhabitants high needed wild vast amount water surrounding fish dilutes ammonia waste materials fish put aquarium waste quickly reach toxic concentrations enclosed environment unless tank cycled remove wellbalanced tank contains organisms able metabolize waste products aquarium residents recreating portion nitrogen cycle bacteria known nitrifiers genus nitrosomonas metabolize nitrogen waste nitrifying bacteria capture ammonia water metabolize produce nitritecitation needed nitrite toxic fish high concentrations another type bacteria genus nitrospira converts nitrite nitrate less toxic substance nitrobacter bacteria previously believed fill role biologically could theoretically fill niche nitrospira recently found nitrobacter present detectable levels established aquaria nitrospira plentifulcitation needed however commercial products sold kits jump start nitrogen cycle often still contain nitrobactercitation needed aquatic plants also eliminate nitrogen waste metabolizing ammonia nitrate plants metabolize nitrogen compounds remove nitrogen water using build biomass decays slowly ammoniadriven plankton

sufficient bacteria populations adequately denitrify waste problem often addressed two filtration solutions activated carbon filters absorb nitrogen compounds toxins biological filters provide medium designed enhance bacterial colonization activated carbon substances ammonia absorbing resins stop working pores fill components replaced regularly new aquaria often problems associated nitrogen cycle due insufficient beneficial therefore fresh water matured stocking fish three basic approaches fishless cycle silent cycle slow growth fishless cycle small amounts ammonia added unpopulated tank feed bacteria process ammonia nitrite nitrate levels tested monitor progress silent cycle basically nothing densely stocking aquarium fastgrowing aquatic plants relying consume nitrogen allowing necessary bacterial populations time develop according anecdotal reports plants consume nitrogenous waste efficiently ammonia nitrite level spikes seen traditional cycling methods greatly reduced disappear slow

nitrite spikes whether intended permanent residents traded later desired occupants largest bacterial populations found filter high water flow plentiful surface available growth effective efficient filtration vital sometimes vigorous cleaning filter enough seriously disturb biological balance aquarium therefore recommended rinse mechanical filters outside bucket aquarium water dislodge organic

limiting factors include oxygen availability filtration processing aquarists rules thumb estimate number fish kept aquarium examples small freshwater fish larger freshwater fishes marine fishes need much generous allowances experienced aquarists warn applying rules strictly consider important issues growth rate activity level social behaviour filtration capacity total biomass plant life better apply overall mass size fish per gallon water simply length fish different sizes produce quite differing amounts waste establishing maximum capacity often matter slowly adding fish monitoring water quality time following trial error approach one variable differences fish smaller fish consume oxygen per gram body weight larger fish labyrinth fish breathe atmospheric oxygen need much surface area however fish territorial appreciate crowding barbs also require surface area tetras comparable oxygen exchange surface important constraint thus surface area aquarium matters aquarists claim deeper aquarium holds fish shallower aquarium surface area capacity improved surface movement water circulation aeration improves oxygen exchange also waste decomposition waste density another variable decomposition solution consumes oxygen oxygen dissolves less readily warmer water doubleedged sword since warmer temperatures make fish active consume addition bioloadchemical considerations aquarists also consider mutual compatibility fish instance predatory fish usually kept small passive species territorial fish often unsuitable tankmates shoaling species furthermore fish tend fare better given
