cancer since many people diagnosed showing mutations gene study supported idea genomic sequencing could useful tool help detect gene mutations early proactive letting high risks breast cancer know ahead since king working collaboration scientists around world identify genetic causes hearing loss deafness localized first nonsyndromic deafnessrelated gene costa rica successfully cloned gene king continues work scientists karen avraham tel aviv university israel moien kanaan bethlehem university palestine modeling international scientific cooperation conjunction conducting scientific research hereditary deafness common among palestinian israeli communities providing good study populations understand genetics understand working together transcends politics possible beautiful useful science together even countries conflict genetic etiology hearing loss extremely heterogeneous high degree complexity among middle eastern populations presenting different level challenge genetic analysis kings collaboration scientists israel palestine resolved complex web different genes varying modes transmission common phenotype among many kindreds communities region king recent years developed deep interest studying genetic factors influencing schizophrenia collaboration scientists including judith l rapoport jonathan sebat deborah l levy discovered evidence suggests schizophrenia may linked presence genetic mutations called copy number variations cnvs pathways involved neural development percentage variations may occur spontaneously result copying errors king also worked human genome

working abuelas de plaza de mayo grandmothers plaza de mayo argentina used dental genetics identify missing persons ultimately identifying children helping return biological families born women prison persecuted political dissidents later disappeared argentine military dictatorship eightyear dirty war children often illegally adopted military families without mothers family beginning las abuelas grandmothers gathered protest disappearance grandchildren seek return every thursday marched central plaza buenos aires plaza de mayo demand return grandchildren began gathering data trying identify many missing children estimated time king joined project dictatorship replaced democratic government required proof kinship remove children families return biological families kings technique using
