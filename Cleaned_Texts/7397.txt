septum sides possessing elongated cshaped crescent lumen encompassed inside bony cartilaginous capsule opens base nasal vomeronasal receptor neurons possess axons travel vno accessory olfactory bulb aob also known vomeronasal bulb sensory receptors located medial concave surface crescent lumen lateral convex surface lumen covered nonsensory ciliated cells basal cells also found dorsal ventral

split two pairs separated nasal septum medial concave area lumen lined pseudo stratified epithelium three main cell types receptor cells supporting cells basal cells supporting cells located superficially membrane basal cells found basement membrane near nonsensory epithelium receptor neurons possess apical microvilli sensory receptors localized gproteincoupled receptors often referred pheromone receptors since vomeronasal receptors tied detecting pheromones three gproteincoupled receptors identified vno found distinct regions fprs fprs seven transmembrane receptors closely related odorant receptors expressed main olfactory vomeronasal organs sensory neurons act different signaling pathway main olfactory systems sensory neurons activation receptors stimulates phospholipase turn opens ion channel upon stimulation activated pheromones production shown increase vno membranes many animals adenylyl cyclase cyclic adenosine monophosphate camp major signaling transduction molecules main olfactory system remain unaltered trend shown many animals hamster pig rat garter snake upon introduction vaginal seminal secretions environment activated distinct ligands pheromones many vomeronasal neurons activated chemicals urine active compounds sulfated detecting types amounts different sulfated steroids conveys information urine donors physiological state may therefore serve honest signal recent studies proved new family formyl peptide receptor like proteins vno membranes mice points close phylogenetic relation signaling mechanisms used olfaction vomeronasal sensory neurons extremely sensitive fire action potentials currents low pa many patchclamp recordings confirmed sensitivity vomeronasal neurons sensitivity tied fact resting potential vomeronasal neurons relatively close firing threshold neurons vomeronasal sensory neurons also show remarkably slow adaptation firing rate increases increasing current pa main olfactory sensory neurons fire single burst action potentials show much quicker adaptation rate activating neurons receptors cause field potentials weak fluctuating responses seen anterior accessory olfactory bulb aob activation neurons contain receptors however promote distinct oscillations posterior mammals sensory neurons vomeronasal organ detect nonvolatile chemical cues requires direct physical contact source odor notably scents act

ultimately hypothalamus since hypothalamus major neuroendocrine center affecting aspects reproductive physiology behavior well functions body temperature may explain scents influence aggressive mating behavior example many vertebrates nerve signals brain pass sensory information hypothalamus seasonal changes availability mate turn hypothalamus regulates release reproductive hormones required
