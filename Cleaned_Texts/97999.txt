term psychedelic coined psychiatrist humphrey osmond written correspondence author aldous huxley presented new york academy sciences osmond derived greek words ψυχή psychḗ soul mind δηλείν dēleín manifest thus meaning mind manifesting implication psychedelics develop unused potentials human term trip first coined us army scientists experimenting despite several attempts made starting centuries define common phenomenological structures effects produced classic psychedelics universally accepted taxonomy yet prominent element psychedelic experiences visual psychedelic visual alteration often includes spontaneous formation complex flowing geometric visual patterning visual eyes open visual alteration overlaid onto objects spaces physical environment eyes closed visual alteration seen inner world behind visual effects increase complexity higher dosages also eyes visual alteration normally constitute hallucinations person undergoing experience still distinguish real imagined visual phenomena though cases true hallucinations rarely psychedelic experiences include complex hallucinations objects animals people even whole visual alterations also include effects afterimages shifting
