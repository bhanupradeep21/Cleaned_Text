biology cline measurable gradient single characteristic biological trait species across geographical clines usually genetic eg allele frequency blood type phenotypic eg body size skin pigmentation character show either smooth continuous gradation character abrupt changes trait one geographic region cline spatial gradient single specific trait rather collection single population therefore many clines traits least additionally julian huxley recognised multiple independent clines may act concordance example observed australia birds generally become smaller towards north country found contrast intensity plumage colouration follows different geographical trajectory vibrant humidity highest becoming less vibrant arid centre huxley described notion clines auxiliary taxonomic principle meaning clinal variation species awarded taxonomic recognition way subspecies species term cline coined huxley greek κλίνειν klinein meaning lean term ecotype sometimes used interchangeably fact differ ecotype refers population differs populations number characters rather single character varies amongst populations clines often cited result two opposing drivers selection gene flow also known selection causes adaptation local environment resulting different genotypes phenotypes favoured different environments diversifying force countered gene flow homogenising effect populations prevents speciation causing genetic admixture blurring distinct genetic clines generally thought arise one two conditions primary differentiation also known primary contact primary intergradation secondary contact also known secondary introgression secondary clines produced way generated spatial heterogeneity environmental conditions mechanism selection acting upon organisms therefore external species ranges frequently span environmental gradients eg humidity rainfall temperature day length according natural selection different environments favour different genotypes way previously genetically phenotypically uniform populations spread novel environments evolve uniquely adapted local environment process potentially creating gradient genotypic phenotypic trait clines characters maintained selection alone much gene flow occurred populations would tend swamp effects local adaptation however species usually tend limited dispersal range eg isolation distance model restricted gene flow serve type barrier encourages geographic however degree migration often required maintain cline without speciation likely eventually occur local adaptation cause reproductive isolation classic example role environmental gradients creating clines peppered moth biston betularia uk century industrial sector gained traction coal emissions blackened vegetation across northwest england parts northern wales result lighter morphs moth visible predators blackened tree trunks therefore heavily predated relative darker morphs consequently frequency cryptic melanic morph peppered moth increased drastically northern england cline morph colour dominance lighter morphs west england suffer heavily pollution higher frequency melanic forms north slowly degrading since limitations sooty emissions introduced clines generated mechanism arisen joining two formerly isolated populations differentiated allopatry creating intermediate zone secondary contact scenario may occur example climatic conditions change allowing ranges populations expand time effect gene flow tend eventually swamp regional differences cause one large homogenous population stable cline maintained two populations join must usually selective pressure maintaining degree differentiation two mechanism selection maintaining clines scenario often intrinsic means fitness individuals independent external environment selection instead dependent genome individual intrinsic endogenous selection give rise clines characters variety mechanisms one way may act heterozygote disadvantage intermediate genotypes lower relative fitness either homozygote genotypes disadvantage one allele tend become fixed given population populations consist largely either aa homozygous dominant aa homozygous recessive cline heterozygotes created respective populations come contact shaped opposing forces selection gene flow even selection heterozygotes great degree gene flow two populations steep cline may able instrinsic selection independent external environment clines generated selection hybrids fixed given geographical area move around geographic hybrid zones hybrids disadvantage relative parental lines nonetheless maintained selection counteracted gene flow known tension another way selection generate clines frequencydependent selection characters could maintained frequencydependent selective pressures include warning signals aposematism example aposematic signals heliconius butterflies sometimes display steep clines populations maintained positive frequency heterozygosity mutations recombination produce patterns deviate wellestablished signals mark prey unpalatable individuals predated heavily relative counterparts normal markings ie selected creating populations dominated particular pattern warning signal heterozygote disadvantage populations join narrow cline intermediate individuals could produced maintained gene flow counteracting secondary contact could lead cline steep gradient heterozygote disadvantage frequencydependent selection exists intermediates heavily selected alternatively steep clines could exist populations recently established secondary contact character original allopatric populations large degree differentiation genetic admixture population increases time however steepness cline likely decrease difference character eroded however character original allopatric populations differentiated begin cline populations need display steep primary differentiation secondary contact therefore give rise similar identical clinal patterns eg gently sloping clines distinguishing two processes responsible generating cline difficult often however circumstances cline geographic variable humidity may tightly linked change one corresponding closely change cases may tentatively concluded cline generated primary differentiation therefore moulded environmental selective selection therefore clearly play key role creating clines theoretically feasible might generated genetic drift alone unlikely largescale clines genotype phenotype frequency produced solely drift however across smaller geographical scales smaller populations drift could produce temporary fact drift weak force upholding cline however means clines produced way often random ie uncorrelated environmental variables subject breakdown reversal clines therefore unstable sometimes called transient steepness gradient cline reflects extent differentiation character across geographic example steep cline could indicate large variation colour plumage adjacent bird populations previously outlined steep clines may result two previously allopatric populations large degree difference trait recently established gene flow strong selection hybrids however may also reflect sudden environmental change boundary examples rapidly changing environmental boundaries like include abrupt changes heavy metal content soils consequent narrow clines produced populations agrostis either adapted soils high metal content adapted normal conversely shallow cline indicates little geographical variation character trait across given geographical distance may arisen weak differential environmental selective pressure two populations established secondary contact long time ago gene flow eroded large character differentiation populations gradient cline related another commonly referred property clinal width cline steep slope said small narrow width shallower clines larger according huxley clines classified two categories continuous clines discontinuous stepped types clines characterise way genetic phenotypic trait transforms one end geographical range species continuous clines populations species able interbreed gene flow throughout entire range species way clines biologically clear subgroups geographically contiguous distribution continuous continuous clines subdivided smooth stepped clines unlike continuous clines discontinuous clines populations species allopatric meaning little gene flow amongst populations genetic phenotypic trait question always shows steeper gradient groups within groups continuous clines discontinuous clines follow principles continuous clines displaying either originally assumed geographic isolation necessary precursor speciation allopatric possibility clines may precursor speciation therefore ignored assumed evidence fact contiguous populations gene flow strong force homogenisation selection weak force differentiation speciation take however existence particular types clines ring species populations differentiate allopatry terminal ends cline nonetheless interbreed cast doubt whether complete geographical isolation populations absolute requirement speciation clines exist populations connected degree gene flow generation new species previously clinal population termed parapatric speciation extrinsic intrinsic selection serve generate varying degrees reproductive isolation thereby instigate process speciation example environmental selection acting populations favouring particular allele frequencies large genetic differences populations may accumulate would reflected clinal structure presence numerous steep clines local genetic differences great enough may lead unfavourable combinations genotypes therefore hybrids decreased fitness relative parental lines hybrid disadvantage great enough natural selection select prezygotic traits homozygous parental lines reduce likelihood disadvantageous hybridisation words natural selection favour traits promote assortative mating parental known reinforcement plays important role parapatric sympatric clines portrayed graphically maps using lines show transition character state one end geographic range character states however additionally represented using isophenes defined ernst mayr lines equal expression clinally varying words areas maps demonstrate biological phenomenon character connected something resembles contour line mapping clines therefore follow character gradation one extreme isophenes transect clinal lines right angle although term cline first officially coined huxley gradients geographic variations character states species observed centuries indeed gradations considered ubiquitous labelled ecological rules one commonly cited example gradient morphology glogers rule named constantin gloger observed environmental factors pigmentation avian plumage tend covary birds found arid areas near equator tend much darker less arid areas closer poles since rule extended include many animals including flies butterflies ecogeographical rules include bergmanns rule coined carl bergmann states homeotherms closer equator tend smaller northerly southerly one proposed reasons cline larger animals relatively smaller surface area volume ratio therefore improved heat conservancy important advantage cold role environment imposing selective pressure producing cline heavily implicated due fact bergmanns rule observed across many independent lineages species continents example house sparrow introduced early eastern united states evolved northsouth gradient size soon introduction gradient reflects gradient already existed house sparrows native range ring distinct type cline geographical distribution question circular shape two ends cline overlap one another giving two adjacent populations rarely interbreed due cumulative effect many changes phenotype along cline populations elsewhere along cline interbreed geographically adjacent populations standard cline case larus gulls habitats end populations even overlap introduces questions constitutes species nowhere along cline line drawn populations unable interbreed humans clines frequency blood types allowed scientists infer past population migrations example type b blood group reaches highest frequency asia become less frequent west possible infer asian populations migrated towards europe around years ago causing genetic admixture isolation distance model contrast cline blood type shows reverse pattern reaching highest frequency europe declining frequency towards
