terrestrial environments hibernation seasonal response movement ancestor birds mammals onto land introduced seasonal pressures would eventually become true clades animals undergo winter dormancy prominent seasons longer dormant period tends average hibernation endothermic animals likely evolved multiple times least debated whether evolved least cases hibernation likely evolved simultaneously endothermy earliest suggested instance hibernation thrinaxodon ancestor mammals lived roughly million years evolution endothermy allowed animals greater levels activity better incubation embryos among
