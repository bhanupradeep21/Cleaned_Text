sir andrew fielding huxley om frs honfreng november may english physiologist born prominent huxley family leaving westminster school central london went trinity college cambridge scholarship joined alan lloyd hodgkin study nerve impulses eventual discovery basis propagation nerve impulses called action potential earned nobel prize physiology medicine made discovery giant axon atlantic squid soon outbreak second world war huxley recruited british antiaircraft command later transferred admiralty war resumed research university cambridge developed interference microscopy would suitable studying muscle fibres joined german physiologist rolf niedergerke together discovered mechanism muscle contraction popularly called sliding filament theory foundation modern understanding muscle mechanics became head department physiology university college london elected fellow royal society president royal society awarded copley medal collective contributions understanding nerve impulses muscle contraction conferred knight bachelor queen appointed order merit fellow trinity college cambridge death huxley born hampstead london england november youngest son writer editor leonard huxley leonard huxleys second wife rosalind bruce hence halfbrother writer aldous huxley fellow biologist julian huxley grandson biologist h huxley andrew brother david given lathe parents andrew soon became proficient designing making assembling mechanical objects kinds wooden candle sticks working internal combustion engine used practical skills throughout career building much specialized equipment needed research also early teens formed lifelong interest educated university college school westminster school central london kings scholar graduated scholarship trinity college cambridge read natural sciences intended become engineer switched physiology taking subject fulfill entered cambridge huxley graduated bachelors degree alan lloyd hodgkin returned us take fellowship trinity college huxley became one postgraduate students hodgkin interested transmission electrical signals along nerve fibres beginning cambridge made preliminary measurements frog sciatic nerves suggesting accepted view nerve simple elongated battery flawed hodgkin invited huxley join researching problem work experimentally challenging one major problem small size neurons made extremely difficult study using techniques time overcame working marine biological association laboratory plymouth using giant axon longfin inshore squid doryteuthis formerly loligo pealeii largest neurons experiments still extremely challenging nerve impulses last fraction millisecond time needed measure changing electrical potential different points along nerve using equipment largely construction design including one earliest applications technique electrophysiology known voltage clamp able record ionic currents jointly published short paper nature reporting work done plymouth announcing achievement recording action potentials inside nerve world war ii broke research abandoned huxley recruited british antiaircraft command worked radar control antiaircraft guns later transferred admiralty work naval gunnery worked team led patrick blackett hodgkin meanwhile working development radar air ministry problem concerning new type gun sight contacted huxley advice huxley sketches borrowed lathe produced necessary parts huxley elected research fellowship trinity college cambridge war ended able take resume collaboration hodgkin understanding nerves transmit signals continuing work plymouth within six years able solve problem using equipment built solution nerve impulses action potentials travel core fiber rather along outer membrane fiber cascading waves sodium ions diffusing inward rising pulse potassium ions diffusing falling edge pulse published theory action potentials transmitted joint paper also describe one earliest computational biochemistry model forms basis models used neurobiology following four completed work action potentials huxley teaching physiology cambridge became interested another difficult unsolved problem muscle contract make progress understanding function muscle new ways observing network filaments behave contraction needed prior war working preliminary design interference microscopy time believed original though turned tried years abandoned however able make interference microscopy work apply problem muscle contraction great effect able view muscle contraction greater precision conventional microscopes distinguish types fiber easily assistance rolf niedergerke began find features muscle movement around time hugh huxley jean hanson came similar observation authored pairs papers simultaneously published may issue thus four people introduced called sliding filament theory muscle huxley synthesized findings work colleagues detailed description muscle structure muscle contraction occurs generates force published team provided proof theory remained basis modern understanding muscle huxley worked woods hole massachusetts lalor scholar gave herter lectures johns hopkins medical school jesup lectures columbia university lectured neurophysiology kiev university part exchange scheme british russian professors editor journal physiology also journal molecular biology elected fellow royal society served council royal society huxley held college university posts cambridge became head department physiology university college london addition administrative teaching duties continued work actively muscle contraction also made theoretical contributions work department animal jointly awarded nobel prize physiology medicine part discoveries concerning ionic mechanisms nerve appointed royal society research professorship held department physiology university college london huxley elected president royal society post held presidential address chose defend darwinian explanation evolution ancestor h huxley whereas h huxley defying bishops day sir andrew countering new theories periods accelerated change defended societys decision elect margaret thatcher fellow ground support science even fellows signed letter protest elected master trinity succeeding longtime collaborator sir alan hodgkin appointment broke tradition office master trinity alternates scientist arts man master fond reminding interviewers trinity college nobel prize winners whole france maintained death position fellow trinity college cambridge teaching physiology natural sciences also fellow imperial college london experimental work hodgkin huxley developed set differential equations provided mathematical explanation nerve action potential work provided foundation current work voltagesensitive membrane channels responsible functioning animal nervous systems quite separately developed mathematical equations operation myosin crossbridges generate sliding forces actin myosin filaments cause contraction skeletal muscles equations presented entirely new paradigm understanding muscle contraction extended provide understanding almost movements produced cells level bacteria together swiss physiologist robert stämpfli evidenced existence saltatory conduction myelinated nerve fibres huxley alan hodgkin john eccles jointly nobel prize physiology medicine discoveries concerning ionic mechanisms involved excitation inhibition peripheral central portions nerve cell membrane huxley hodgkin prize experimental mathematical work process nerve action potentials electrical impulses enable activity organism coordinated central nervous eccles made important discoveries synaptic transmission huxley elected fellow royal society frs awarded copley medal recognition outstanding studies mechanisms nerve impulse activation muscular huxley
