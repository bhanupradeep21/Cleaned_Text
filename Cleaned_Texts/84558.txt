also cornerstone ancient greece homeric greece citizens relied reciprocity form transaction formal system government homers iliad illustrates several instances reciprocal transactions form gift giving example book vi iliad glaucus diomedes exchange armor discover grandfathers however times direct reciprocity possible specifically times great need citizen nothing give repayment thus deferred reciprocity also prevalent greek culture time deferred reciprocity refers giving person gifts favors understanding repay favor another time initial giver great need form reciprocity used extensively travelers particularly odysseus often rely kindness human strangers mythological creatures secure resources along journey classical greek polis largescale projects construction temples building warships financing choruses carried gifts individual donors rome wealthy elite linked dependents cycle reciprocal gift examples suggest reciprocity enjoyed cultural prestige among ancient aristocracies richard leakey roger lewin attribute nature humans reciprocity claim humans survived ancestors learned share goods services honored network thus idea humans indebted repay gifts favors unique aspect human culture cultural anthropologists support idea call web indebtedness reciprocity viewed adaptive mechanism enhance within approach reciprocity creates interdependent environment labor divided humans may efficient example one member group cares children another member hunts food group member provided service received one return member devote time attention allotted task whole group benefits meant individuals could give away resources without actually giving away rule reciprocity sophisticated systems aid trade possible bringing immense benefits societies utilized given benefits reciprocity societal level surprising norm persisted dictates present cognition behavior reciprocity strong determining factor human behavior powerful method gaining ones compliance request rule reciprocity power trigger feelings indebtedness even faced uninvited irrespective liking person executed dennis regan tested strength two aspects reciprocity study participants believed art appreciation experiment partner joe really regans assistant experiment joe would disappear bring back soft drink participant phase experiment joe would ask participant buy raffle tickets participants liked joe likely buy raffle tickets however joe given soda thus indebted reciprocate made difference whether participants liked joe rule reciprocity overpowered thus individuals might even like power greatly increase chances favor simply providing us small gift favor prior request furthermore obliged receive gifts favors reduces ability choose wish phillip kunz demonstrated automatic nature reciprocity experiment using christmas cards experiment kunz sent holiday cards pictures family brief note group complete strangers expected reaction holiday cards came pouring back people never met heard expressed desire get know majority individuals responded never inquired kunzs identity merely responding initial gesture reciprocal action politics another area power reciprocity evident politicians often claim autonomy feelings obligation associated gifts favors influence everyone else also susceptible election us congress representatives received money special interest groups seven times likely vote favor group contributed money fehr g√§chter showed acting within reciprocal frameworks individuals likely deviate purely selfinterested behavior acting social contexts magnanimity often repaid disproportionate amounts kindness cooperation treachery disproportionate amounts hostility vengeance significantly surpass amounts determined predicted conventional economic models rational selfinterest moreover reciprocal tendencies frequently observed situations wherein transaction costs associated specific reciprocal actions high present future material rewards expected whether selfinterested reciprocal action dominates aggregate outcome particularly dependent context markets marketlike scenarios characterized competitiveness incomplete contracts reciprocity tends win positive reciprocity occurs action committed one individual positive effect someone else returned action approximately equal positive example someone takes care another persons dog person received favor return action another favor small gift however reciprocated action approximately equal first action terms positive value otherwise result uncomfortable social someone takes care another persons dog person returns favor buying individual car reciprocated gift inappropriate equal initial gesture individuals expect actions reciprocated actions approximately equal one example positive reciprocity waitresses smile broadly receive tips waitresses present minimal also free samples merely opportunities taste product rather invitations engage rule reciprocity many people find difficult accept free sample walk away instead buy product even find negative reciprocity occurs action negative effect someone returned action approximately equal negative example individual commits violent act person expected person would return similar act violence however reaction initial negative action approximately equal negative value violates norm reciprocity prescribed retaliatory aspects ie aspects trying get back cause harm known negative reciprocity definition negative reciprocity distinct way negative reciprocity defined domains cultural anthropology negative reciprocity refers attempt get something often referred bartering haggling see reciprocity cultural anthropology information according reciprocity harmful behavior also tends reciprocated harmful metaanalysis analyzed negative workplace behaviors range bullying harassment counterproductive work behavior separating different categories according severity describing amount harm minor moderate severe activity describing harm comes withdrawal positive behaviors passive balanced active target whether behavior reciprocated displaced another analysis found negative behaviors tend reciprocated kind behavior strongest relationship found reciprocity using matched level severity activity however negative workplace behaviors escalate severity activity also showed strong positive moreover frequency negative workplace behaviors increases reciprocated person also increasing frequency negative weakest effect found deescalation activity severity means people tended respond greater amount reciprocity negative workplace category severity deescalation took place party engaging severe behaviors like violence harassment party b engages moderately severe behavior could result wanting cross line ethical norms legal repercussions consequence many articles analyzed include target negative behaviors information category however found two cases deescalation reciprocated negative behavior directed instigator instead also one case escalation reciprocated behavior targeting news article summarizing research studies suggests negative reciprocity might exist order restore build cooperative stated strategy balance goal especially involves relatively proportional response harm trust reciprocity takes consideration three different factors individual risk preferences whether person tendency accept risks trust decisions social preferences whether individual shows prosocial tendencies betrayal aversion lastly beliefs trustworthiness includes social priors like implicit racial attitudes reputation individual based previous coordinated metaanalysis fmri studies concluded trust reciprocity might cause aversive feeling beginning series interactions stranger uncertainty decision outcome means individuals sure person reciprocate however interpersonal trust grows people confident willing cooperate interpersonal trust builds learning mechanism takes information previous interactions individual cooperated learning mechanism helps individual label person trustworthy metaanalysis also found reciprocity trust feedback learning show activity different areas brain suggests part different cognitive theme reciprocity trust also discussed science magazines like greater good magazine writers mention people likely cooperative others act cooperatively towards reputation reciprocity previously documented automatic requires less cognitive control selfserving researchers series experiments around topic wanted investigate whether automatic reciprocity existed motivation fair reciprocal whether result wanting look like fair test used twoplayer activity called trust game investment participants given determined amount chipsmoney sender supposed decide amount moneychips none want transfer trustee whether want keep moneychips experimenter triples case doubles amount transferred sender gives trustee trustee decides whether transfer none series experiments added condition trustees informed chips worth twice much sender chips gives option appear fair another option genuinely also divided groups manipulating participant cognitive researchers replicated finding showing people tend turn reciprocal behavior lack cognitive control due ego also showed participants limited cognitive control used extra information positively reciprocate lesser extent people without cognitive control manipulation however even reduced cognitive control chose benefit exchange outward perception behavior would look fair reciprocal showing main goal appear fair behave fair news article summarized research study supports findings researchers found people tend take time make generous choice make selfish topic reciprocity nonhuman primates field lot research contradictions opposite findings however recent metaanalysis researchers concluded primates cognitive social prerequisites needed use evaluated previous findings found positive negative added reciprocity could misrepresented research studies also includes helps relatives researchers also identified many negative findings come articles researchers measure primate understanding task studies primates show understanding authors also state previous researchers saw studies show reciprocity failure prove reciprocity instead looking situations reciprocity involved versus situations different species also take different time periods reciprocate action might short specific behaviors also seem less likely example less likely nonhuman primate reciprocate food overall researchers concluded nonhuman primate reciprocity common seems negative findings thrown used better comprehension use news sources also support findings suggesting primates use reciprocity food sharing domains like chimpanzees likely chimpanzee also helped past also supports connection trust reciprocity nonhuman subtle ways initiating reciprocity rule merely something nice someone may expect something return one form subtle form reciprocity idea reciprocal concessions requester lowers hisher initial request making respondent likely agree second request rule reciprocity obligated concede someone made concession individual starts requesting something large refuse feel obligated consent smaller request even though might interested either things offering robert cialdini illustrates example phenomenon telling story boy asks buy fivedollar circus tickets cialdini refuses asks buy one dollar chocolate bars cialdini feels obligated return favor consents buying chocolate rule reciprocity operates reciprocal concessions two ways first individual pressured reciprocate one concession another nature rule second individual initially concedes expect person concede return person free make concession first place social pressure return concession individual runs risk giving something getting nothing return mutual concession procedure promote compromise group individuals refocus efforts toward achieving common goal reciprocal concessions promote compromise group initial incompatible desires individuals set aside benefit social door face technique otherwise known rejectionthenretreat technique involves making outrageous request someone almost certainly turn make smaller request favor interest along done skillfully second request seen concession compliance second request however one must proceed caution using technique first request big seen unreasonable door face technique proves useless concession made perceived door face technique confused foot door technique individuals getting person agree large request first getting agree moderate
