animal testing involves invertebrates especially drosophila melanogaster fruit fly caenorhabditis elegans nematode animals offer scientists many advantages vertebrates including short life cycle simple anatomy ease large numbers individuals may studied invertebrates often thousands flies nematodes housed single room exception cephalopods european union invertebrate species protected animal research legislation therefore total number invertebrates used remains research invertebrates foundation current understanding genetics animal development c elegans especially valuable precise lineage organisms somatic cells known giving complete picture organism goes single cell fertilized egg adult genome nematode also fully sequenced one genes easily inactivated rna interference feeding worms antisense major success work c elegans discovery particular cells programmed die development leading discovery programmed cell death active process genetic simple nervous system nematode allows effects genetics development nerves studied however lack adaptive immune system simplicity organs prevent c elegans used medical research vaccine fly melanogaster widely used animal genetic studies comes simplicity breeding housing flies allows large numbers used experiments molecular biology relatively simple organisms huge variety mutant genetically modified flies fly genetics vital study development cell cycle behavior neuroscience similarities basic biochemistry animals allows flies used simple systems investigate genetics conditions heart disease neurodegenerative however like nematodes melanogaster widely used applied medical research fly immune system differs greatly found diseases flies different diseases uses invertebrates include studies social behavior general practical httpsenwikipediaorgwikianimaltestingoninvertebrates
