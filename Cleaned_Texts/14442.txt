variant angina also known prinzmetal angina vasospastic angina angina inversa coronary vessel spasm coronary artery syndrome typically consisting angina cardiac chest pain variant angina differs stable angina commonly occurs individuals rest even asleep whereas stable angina generally triggered exertion intense exercise variant angina caused vasospasm narrowing coronary arteries due contraction hearts smooth muscle tissue vessel comparison stable angina caused permanent occlusion vessels atherosclerosis buildup fatty plaque hardening contrast angina secondary atherosclerosis people variant angina generally younger fewer risk factors coronary artery disease exception smoking common significant risk factor types angina affected people usually repeated episodes unexplained eg absence exertion occurring sleep early morning hours chest pain tightness throat chest pressure lightheadedness excessive sweating andor reduced exercise tolerance unlike atherosclerosisrelated

variant angina affected individuals smoke tobacco products smoke cessation significantly reduces incidence patientreported variant angina also avoid trigger known trigger attacks emotional distress hyperventilation unnecessary exposure cold early morning exertion avoid recreational therapeutic drugs listed signs symptoms risk factors sections well blockers beta receptors propranolol may theoretically worsen vasospasm inhibiting adrenergic receptors vasodilation effect mediated receptors naturally occurring stimulator ie epinephrine addition aspirin used caution low doses since high
