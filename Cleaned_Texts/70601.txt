antiviral drugs class medication used treating viral antivirals target specific viruses broadspectrum antiviral effective wide range antiviral drugs class antimicrobials larger group also includes antibiotic also termed antibacterial antifungal antiparasitic antiviral drugs based monoclonal antivirals considered relatively harmless host therefore used treat infections distinguished virucides medication deactivate destroy virus particles either inside outside body natural virucides produced plants eucalyptus australian tea antiviral drugs available designed help deal hiv herpes viruses hepatitis b c viruses influenza b viruses use hosts cells replicate makes difficult find targets drug would interfere virus without also harming host organisms cells moreover major difficulty developing vaccines antiviral drugs due viral emergence antivirals product greatly expanded knowledge genetic molecular function organisms allowing biomedical researchers understand structure function viruses major advances techniques finding new drugs pressure placed medical profession deal human immunodeficiency virus hiv cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aidscitation needed first

consistently implemented treatment facilities time antivirals treat viral infection vaccines preemptive first line defense pathogens vaccination involves introduction ie via injection small amount typically inactivated attenuated antigenic material stimulate individuals immune system immune system responds developing white blood cells specifically combat introduced pathogen resulting adaptive vaccination population results herd immunity greatly improved population health significant reductions viral infection vaccination policy united states consists public private vaccination requirements instance public schools require students receive vaccinations termed vaccination schedule viruses bacteria diphtheria pertussis tetanus dtap measles mumps rubella mmr varicella chickenpox hepatitis b rotavirus polio private institutions might require annual influenza vaccination centers disease control prevention estimated routine immunization newborns prevents deaths million cases disease year saving despite successes united states exists plenty stigma surrounding vaccines cause people incompletely vaccinated gaps vaccination result unnecessary infection death two major reasons incomplete vaccination although american academy pediatrics endorses universal note physicians respect parents refusal vaccinate children sufficient advising provided child face significant risk infection parents also cite religious reasons avoid public school vaccination mandates reduces herd immunity increases risk viral vaccines boosts bodys immune system better attack viruses complete particle stage outside organisms cells traditional approaches vaccine development include attenuated live weakened inactivated killed version virus attenuated pathogens rare cases revert pathogenic form inactivated vaccines possibility introducing disease given hand immune response may always occur may short lived requiring several doses recently subunit vaccines devised containing antigenic parts
