mother clinical instructor psychiatry behavioral brother tom hogenesch political science urban studies professor cal state hogenesch originally received ba history university southern california followed bs biology inspired study chronobiology joseph takahashi fall learning drosophila clock hogenesch completed phd neuroscience northwestern universitys chicago campus studying transcription factors basic helixloophelix bhlh pas protein hogenesh mentored chris bradfield professor oncology director molecular environmental toxicology graduate program university continued research functional genomics postdoctoral researcher dr steve kay genomics institute novartis research march hogenesch neuroscience graduate student northwestern university laboratory christopher bradfield discovered five transcription factors basic helixloophelixpas bhlhpas domain superfamily thesis transcription factors initially named hogenesch later characterization better known arntl revealed role partner bhlhpas transcription factor clock essential function mammalian circadian clock clock two well recognized bhlhpas domain transcription later work revealed clock gene without circadian clock fails function functions positive element circadian clock forms heterodimer clock initiate transcription target genes contain ebox sequences period cryptochrome mice complex suppressed buildup percry receiving phd hogenesch followed phd mentor christopher bradfield university wisconsinmadison continued lab postdoctoral associate time hogenesch focused following phd later became postdoctoral associate steve kay peter g schultz kay employed university california san diego scripps research institute schultz employed scripps research institute founder director genomics institute novartis research foundation gnf la jolla hogenesch started work human transcriptome mrna characterization transcriptomes humans mice rats would later continue director genomics hogenesch became program manager genomics gnf remained time accomplished compilation complete human transcriptome also mrna characterization human mouse rat highly cited works together cited times influential field genome hogenesch brought together work human mouse transcriptomes gene atlas made available tool genome addition characterizing transciptomes present various organisms hogenesch also spent time throughout career determining genes regulated circadian schedule working colleagues determined mrna shows extensive circadian regulation mammals genes regulated according circadian transcription circadianly regulated mrna shows regular peaks morning implications regulation drug hogenesch left california become professor director genome technology scripps research institutes location west palm beach fl continued work hogenesch contributed study published used new rnai genetic screening techniques discover noncoding rna ncrna known nron nron repressor protein nfat one first well characterized examples ncrnas involved transcription hogenesch moved perelman school medicine university pennsylvania continues study mammalian circadian clocks genome function one current research directions includes incorporating research noncoding rna sirna hairpin rna isolated combining forward genetics genomic used technique mirna examine signalling cell course career hogenesch made numerous contributions understanding core clock mechanisms discovered key proteins arntl early career also team discovered rora important regulator rora currently investigation possible connection autism may relate function circadian hogenesch also contributed identification hundreds genes modulate circadian rhythms humans using genome wide rnai recently discovered new clock gene chrono using novel computer based machine learning techniques prioritize clock gene hogenesch also contributed field mentored scientists like satchin collaborated scientists variety papers cover range topics including creb signaling nfÎºb signaling trp channels melanopsin signaling cell type specific splicing noncoding rna function rnaseq methods mapping hogenesh pushed chronobiology community create wikipedia pages genes project called gene wiki result creation pages genes involved circadian clock arntl well pages chronobiologists like ingeborg also instrumental creating gene atlas project uses database run hogenesch called circa database lists time activity genes different open source database allows biologists pharmaceutical researchers determine peak time different genes mrna used target drug treatments october hogeneschs discovery many proteins targeted drugs experience circadian fluctuations made strides towards chronotherapy research focused timing drug administration goal optimizing
