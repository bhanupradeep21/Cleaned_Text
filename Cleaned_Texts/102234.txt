group thought evolved either common basilosauridlike ancestor independently twice within fossil remains mostly teeth genus scaldicetus reassigned raptorials including z varolai scaldicetus considered

large temporal fossae probably supporting strong temporal masseter muscles strongest muscles skull jaw meaning adaptation allowed shut jaws harder zygomatic bone cheekbone projects outward anteriorly indicating beak featured abrupt narrowing may allowed clamp prey head probably took total body size compared modern sperm whale takes around one fourth one third total body size like sperm whales

multiauthor study led emanuele peri reconstructed bite force zygophyseter using finite element analysis skull model calculated anterior bite force bite force front end jaws newtons lbf posterior bite

model suggests zygophyseter employed gripandshear feeding strategy animal would grasp prey front teeth cut using back teeth strategy somewhat unique absent modern marine macropredators sharks orcas instead use gripandtear method dismembers prey holding shaking previously present basilosaurids however likely feeding strategy evolved independently zygophyseter related macroraptorial sperm whales
