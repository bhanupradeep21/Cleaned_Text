affect psychology refers underlying experience feeling emotion attachment psychology affect refers experience feeling emotion encompasses wide range emotional states positive eg happiness joy excitement negative eg sadness anger fear disgust affect fundamental aspect human experience plays central role many psychological theories studies understood combination three components emotion mood enduring less intense emotional states necessarily tied specific event affectivity individuals overall disposition temperament characterized generally positive negative affect psychology term affect often used interchangeably several related terms concepts though term may slightly different nuances terms encompass emotion feeling mood emotional state sentiment affective state emotional response affective reactivity disposition researchers psychologists may employ specific terms based focus context work modern conception affect developed century wilhelm word comes german gefühl meaning number

level amygdala functionally integrated within larger neural systems cognitive scope measured tasks involving attention perception categorization memory studies use flanker attention task figure whether cognitive scope broadened narrowed example using letters h n participants need identify quickly possible middle letter letters eg hhhhh middle letter different flanking letters eg broadened cognitive scope would indicated reaction times differed greatly letters compared middle letter studies use navon attention task measure difference cognitive scope large letter composed smaller letters cases smaller ls fs make shape letter h vice broadened cognitive scope would suggested faster reaction name larger letter whereas narrowed cognitive scope would suggested faster reaction name smaller letters within larger sourcemonitoring paradigm also used measure much contextual information perceived instance participants tasked watch screen serially displays words memorized seconds also remember whether word appeared left right half words also encased colored box participants know would eventually asked color box word appeared motivation intensity refers strength urge move toward away particular anger fear affective states induced via film clips resulted selective attention flanker task compared controls indicated reaction times different even flanking letters different middle target anger fear high motivational intensity propulsion act would high face angry fearful stimulus like screaming person coiled snake affects high motivational intensity thus narrow cognitive scope enable people focus target seeing sad picture participants faster identify larger letter navon attention task suggesting global broadened cognitive sadness thought sometimes low motivational intensity seeing disgusting picture participants faster identify component letters indicative localized narrower cognitive disgust high motivational intensity affects high motivational intensity narrow ones cognitive scope enabling people focus central whereas affects low motivational intensity broadened cognitive scope allowing faster global changes cognitive scope associated different affective states evolutionarily adaptive high motivational intensity affects elicited stimuli require movement action focused phenomenon known goaldirected example early times seeing lion fearful stimulus probably elicited negative highly motivational affective state fear human propelled run away case goal would avoid getting killed moving beyond negative affective states researchers wanted test whether

attentional scope detection navon letters navon task included neutral affect comparison condition typically neutral states cause broadened attention neutral predicted broad attentional scope could cause faster detection global large letters whereas narrow attentional scope could cause faster detection local small letters evidence proved appetitive stimuli produced narrowed attentional scope experimenters increased narrowed attentional scope appetitive stimuli telling participants would allowed consume desserts shown pictures results revealed hypothesis correct broad attentional scope led
