life onward improve child grows older entail impairments continue throughout life learning disabilities diagnosed children young beginning school learning disabilities found age young children communication disorders may speak may limited vocabulary children communication disorders difficulty understanding simple directions unable name children communication disorders able speak time enter school however continue problems schoolaged children often problems understanding formulating teens may difficulty understanding expressing abstract scientific study causes developmental disorders involves many different theories major differences theories involves whether environment disrupts normal development abnormalities predetermined products human evolutionary history become disorders modern environments see evolutionary normal development occurs combination contributions environment genetics theories vary part factor play normal development thus affecting abnormalities one theory supports environmental causes developmental disorders involves stress early childhood researcher child psychiatrist bruce perry md phd theorizes developmental disorders caused early childhood works compares developmental disorders traumatized children adults posttraumatic stress disorder linking extreme environmental stress cause developmental stress theories suggest even small stresses accumulate result emotional behavioral social disorders tested genes families children rare developmental difficulties uk ireland order identify difficulties genetic cause found new developmental disorders caused spontaneous genetic mutations found either parent fault gene estimated one children born spontaneous genetic mutations associated rare developmental first diagnosed case asd published american psychiatrist leo kanner wide range cases severity asd hard detect first signs asd diagnosis asd made accurately child years old diagnosis asd commonly confirmed child somewhat older age diagnosis range months years mean age years old average case asd tested three different diagnostic centers confirmed early diagnosis disorder diminish familial stress speed referral special educational programs influence family occurrence asd one child increase risk next child asd timescitation needed cause asd still uncertain known child asd pervasive problem brain wired genes related neurotransmitter receptors serotonin gammaaminobutyric acid gaba cns structural control hox genes found potential target genes get affected autism spectrum disorder disorder many parts brain structural changes observed cortex controls higher functions sensation muscle movements memory structural defects seen cerebellum affect motor communication sometimes left lobe brain affected causes neuropsychological symptoms distribution white matter nerve fibers link diverse parts brain abnormal corpus callosum band nerve fibers connects left right hemispheres brain also gets affected asd study also found people agcc agenesis corpus callosum condition corpus callosum partially completely absent scores higher autism screening asd childs brain grows rapid rate almost fully grown age recent fmri studies also found altered connectivity within social brain areas due asd may related social impairments encountered symptoms wide range severity symptoms asd broadly following predominantly seen unresponsiveness conversations lesser emotional sharing inability initiate conversations inability interpret body language avoidance eyecontact difficulty maintaining relationshipscitation needed patterns seen form repeated movements hand phrases used talking rigid adherence schedules inflexibility adapt even minor change made routine also one behavioral symptoms asd could also display sensory patterns extreme aversion certain odors indifference pain temperaturecitation needed also different symptoms different ages based developmental milestones children months asd show lack eye contact seem deaf lack social smile like touched held unusual sensory behavior show lack imitation children months asd show lack gestures prefer alone point objects indicate interest easily frustrated challenges lack functional play finally children ages months asd show lack symbolic play unusual interest certain objects moving specific treatment autism spectrum disorders several types therapy effective easing symptoms autism applied behavior analysis aba speechlanguage therapy occupational therapy sensory integration therapycitation needed applied behavioral analysis aba considered effective therapy autism spectrum disorders american academy aba focuses teaching adaptive behaviors like social skills play skills communication diminishing problematic behaviors like done creating specialized plan uses behavioral therapy techniques positive negative reinforcement encourage discourage certain behaviors occupational therapy helps autistic children adults learn everyday skills help daily tasks personal hygiene movement skills integrated home school work environments therapists oftentimes help patients learn adapt environment skill type therapy could help autistic people become engaged occupational therapist create plan based patients needs desires work achieve set goalscitation needed speechlanguage therapy help autism need develop improve communication skills according organization autism speaks speechlanguage therapy designed coordinate mechanics speech meaning social use speech people lowfunctioning autism may able communicate spoken words speechlanguage pathologists slp may teach someone communicate effectively others work starting develop speech slp create plan focuses child needs sensory integration therapy helps people autism adapt different kinds sensory stimuli many children autism oversensitive certain stimuli lights sounds causing overreact others may react certain stimuli someone speaking many types therapy activities involve form play using swings toys trampolines help engage patients sensory therapists create plan focuses type stimulation person needs integration withcitation needed attention deficit hyperactivity disorder neurodevelopmental disorder occurs early childhood adhd affects children school going agecitation needed adhd characterised significant levels hyperactivity inattentiveness impulsiveness three subtypes adhd predominantly inattentive predominantly hyperactive combined presents hyperactive inattentive adhd twice common boys girls seen hyperactiveimpulsive type common boys inattentive type affects sexes symptoms adhd include inattentiveness impulsiveness hyperactivity many behaviors associated adhd include poor control actions resulting disruptive behavior academic problems another area affected disorders social arena person disorder many children disorder exhibit poor interpersonal relationships struggle fit socially behavioral study children show history symptoms temper tantrums mood swings sleep disturbances treatment adhd often includes combination psychological behavioural pharmaceutical educational advice interventionscitation needed sessions counselling cognitive behavioral therapy cbt making environmental changes noise visual stimulation behavioral management techniques followed observed behavioral therapy alone less effective therapy stimulant drugs alone medications commonly used treatment adhd primarily stimulants methylphenidate lisdexamphetamine nonstimulants atomoxetine could cause side effects headache stomach pain depression sleep disturbancescitation needed ssri antidepressants may unhelpful could worsen symptoms however adhd often misdiagnosed depression particularly hyperactivity present
