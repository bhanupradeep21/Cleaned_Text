sexual coercion among animals use violence threats harassment tactics help forcefully behavior compared sexual assault including rape among nature males females usually differ reproductive fitness males generally prefer maximize number offspring therefore number mates females hand tend care offspring fewer generally males available mate given time making females limited leads males evolve aggressive mating behaviors help acquire sexual coercion observed many species including mammals birds insects sexual coercion help increase male fitness often costly sexual coercion observed consequences intersexual coevolution speciation sexual harassment technique used males many species force females submit observed numerous species including mammals birds insects aggression harassment documented males guppies poecilia bottlenose dolphins tursiops aduncus botos inia geoffrensis dusky dolphins lagenorhynchus obscurus hectors dolphins cephalorhynchus hectori grizzly bears polar bears also seen chinook salmon oncorhynchus redspotted newts notophthalmus viridescens seedeating true bugs neacoryphus furthermore prevalent spider wild barbary macaques macaca sylvanus many basically major primate taxa aggression used dominant males herding females keeping away hamadryas baboons males often bite females necks threaten wild chimpanzees charge females shake branches hit slap kick pound drag bite orangutans among forceful mammals bornean orangutans pongo pygmaeus exhibited aggression almost percent copulations including females possible explanation aggressive behaviors primates way males train females afraid likely surrender future sexual males may also use indirect techniques mate females intimidation female water striders gerridae genitalia exposed females water strider species gerris gracilicornis evolved shield genitals result males physically coerce females mating difficult unless female exposes genitalia therefore males intimidate females mating attracting predators tap waters surface create ripples catch attention predatory fish best interest female mate quickly possible avoid eaten predators typical mating positions water striders females bottom closer predators risk predation much higher females succumb copulation get males cease signaling another indirect form sexual coercion occurs redsided garter snakes thamnophis sirtalis parietalis males court females line bodies females produce caudocephalic waves series muscle contractions travel bodies tail head exact reason behavior unknown studies show relates stress females nonrespiratory air sacs containing anoxic air waving pushes air lungs resulting stress causes cloaca open aids male inserting hemipenis stronger frequent caudocephalic waves closer males cloaca females likely male mate males certain species evolved mating behaviors forcefully attempt mate inseminate females often employing grasping techniques male grasping devices exist increase duration copulation restrict females mating males ways form mate guarding males evolved different types modifications aid grasping others grab females attempt force copulation one type grasping modification spiky male genitalia seed beetles coleoptera bruchidae males possess sclerotized spines genitalia spines used copulation help overcome female resistance penetrate copulatory duct addition aiding penetration spines promote passage seminal fluids act anchor keep female fleeing furthermore spiny genitals injure females make less likely sepsidae fly males modifications forelegs help grasp onto female wing bases modifications include cuticular outgrowths indentations bristles males use secure onto females jumping males grab struggle ensues akin rodeo males try hold females violently shake another type modification found male diving beetles family dytiscidae equipped suction cup structures front legs use grab passing females attach dorsal surfaces get females submit males shake females violently keep submerged underwater diving beetles go long without atmospheric oxygen unable get air female diving beetles submit males advances order avoid drowning lose energy resist males attach copulation male waterfowl developed another modification male birds external genitalia male waterfowl aves anatidae phallus length centimetres birds mate males balancing top females touching cloacas cloacal kiss makes forceful insemination difficult phallus male waterfowl evolved everts bodies clockwise coil aids inseminating females without another technique locklike mechanism found drosophila montana dogs wolves pigs towards end copulation females struggle try dislodge males whose genital organs take much longer deflate females locking commonly known canids tie allows males copulate long need finished dogs male knot penis gets engorged blood ties female locking together copulation act complete male dogs evolved mechanism mating order prevent males penetration whilst use tie enables likely inseminate female produce healthy litter pups breaking tie physically harmful females males many species simply grab females force mating coercive mating common water striders gerridae species female genitalia often exposed easily accessible without courtship behavior males initiate forcefully trying mount females carrying males backs energetically costly females try resist throw males males fight back even harder use forelegs tightly grasp females thorax keep males forcefully insert genitalia female vulvar newt species notophthalmus viridescens males carry courtship behavior called amplexus consists males capturing females want mate using hind limbs grasp females pectoral male guppies poecilia reticulata observed forcefully copulate females trying insert gonopodium male sex organ females genital pores whether sometimes male guppies also try forcefully mate skiffia bilineata goodeid females resemble guppy females tend share habitat even guppy females available possible explanation deeper genital cavity bilineata stimulates males mating guppy males species able immobilize females force copulation pigs boars males grab females maneuver pelvis lift vaginal opening facilitate copulation stimulation following intromission causes female immobilized male freely continue copulation without worrying female immobilization female also occurs muscovy ducks grasping andor grappling mating situations also documented calopteryx haemorrhoidalis haemorrhoidalis fallow deer dama wild orangutans smuts wild water voles semiaquatic rats arvicola feral mallard anas hamadryas many coho salmon oncorhynchus others mammal species mostly nonhuman primatescitation needed common males commit infanticide mate females happens often species live groups old new world monkeys apes prosimians hamadryas usually single breeding male group outside male aggressively takes kills young offspring males kill infants assert strength position mate sometimes multiple males invade troop gang females killing offspring subsequently mating occurs spider monkeys redbacked squirrel monkeys chimpanzees red newt species notophthalmus viridescens males rub hormonal secretions onto skin females courting hormones shown make female receptive mating male male deposits secretions detaches female releases spermatophore containing spermatozoa females decision either accept pick reject running away hormones make likely accept another form coercion male mate guarding used keep females mating males often involves guarding allows males ensure paternity classic example occurs diving beetles family dytiscidae copulation males continue guard females six hours hold underwater occasionally tilting guarding also occurs water striders males complete sperm transfer often remain top females guarding duration varies lasting several minutes several weeks purpose long guarding periods males see females lay eggs assured offspring behavior also occurs hamadryas baboons papio hamadryas leader males practice intensive mate drosophila montana studies shown following mate guarding chances female mating inseminated another male greatly diminished shows mate guarding tactic males species use bodily fluids seminal fluid ejaculate aid coercion females seminal fluid males drosophila melanogaster may contain chemicals increase amount time takes females remate decrease length successive matings keep remating less female mates males copulation male likely ensure paternity chemicals may also serve increase females reproductive success cost decreased longevity immune many species seminal fluid used sort mating plug males species transfer sperm beginning copulation use rest copulation transfer substances help build mating plugs plugs effective ensuring female mate males males paternity major direct cost sexual coercion physical male seed beetles coleoptera bruchidae sclerotized spines genitalia penetrate female leave melanized scars females physically injured one mating female mates scarring forms copulatory guppies males gonopodium cause damage forcefully inserted causing cloacal damage fowl females physically injured forceful copulations also semen transferred males contain pathogens fecal matter lead disease decrease female elephant seals physical injury happens often fact mating leads every female elephant seals getting species females andor offspring injured even killed include lions rodents farm cats crabeater seals sea bottlenosed dolphins tursiops redsided garter snakes thamnophis sirtalis newts n another cost excess energy time expenditure comes mating example female water striders marine snails genus littorina carry males backs mate first great loss second male female much greater risk predation furthermore time spent mating interferes time could spent addition sexual coercion lower body condition immunity ways physical damage harassment lead stress result weight loss decreased immune function energy stores less feeding seen redspotted furthermore females constantly moving around avoid violent males able form female social ties example gr√©vys zebraequus also happens species herding males sometimes permit females join family different groups like hamadryad indirect costs affect females future one cost happens sexual coercion allow females choose males want mate usually males higher quality compatible andor good genes increase offsprings survival fitness coercion decreases choice lead offspring lower genetic quality studies rose bitterling rhodeus ocellatus shown offspring females mate choice higher survival rates offspring females another ultimate cost comes males commit infanticide obtain mating access loss offspring leads decrease fitness response sexual coercion costs females face one counteradaptations evolution anatomical females species water striders developed morphological shields protect genitalia males want forcefully gerridae females also evolved abdominal spines altered shapes abdomens make less accessible waterfowl males family aves anatidae evolved phallus aid coercion phallus everts male body time mate counterclockwise coil response females developed vaginal structures called dead end sacs clockwise coils protect forceful waterfowl females evolved convoluted vaginal morphologies make harder males insert without females another female tactic counter coercion try avoid males may cause harm females often change habitats get away aggressive males seen wild trinidadian guppies poecilia female bottlenose dolphins behave similar ways moving shallow waters many species practice mate avoidance calopteryx haemorrhoidalis species damselfly often try hide large groups males avoid females marine intertidal periwinkle species genus littorina another way avoid males males usually recognize female snails cues mucous trails however females try mask sex altering damselflies females also try mask gender mimicking male colors make less attractive effective female strategy employment protection alliances females wild trinidadian guppies poecilia reticulate associate protective males come also occurs hamadryas savanna olive baboons males females form friendships female gets male northern elephant seals females give loud cries mounted undesirable subordinate males attract dominant males help similar phenomenon occurs elephants bighorn sheep fallow deer females stay close dominant males females also form alliances females protection aggressive researchers observed alliances many femalebonded species including old world monkeys macaques olive baboons patas rhesus monkeys gray langurs new world monkeys capuchin prosimians ringtailed lemur african vervet monkeys related females often form groups gang females high rank create networks female alliances together fight away persistent resisting males fighting back important tactics species use counter male coercion many females try vigorously shake males dislodge flee seen female sepsid diving sepsids also try bend abdomen way males copulate females especially likely fight back protecting offspring seen mountain gorillas red howlers grey langur females males often female resistance rarely found effective male mammals birds usually larger females sheer size strength difference makes however observed species squirrel monkeys patas monkeys vervets captive chimpanzees females gang males aggressive even try protect female distress females even observed kill immigrant males wild red colobus sometimes females choose struggle simply acquiesce forceful matings happen decide cost resisting would greater cost use submission avoid harassment aggression could end death often seen primate species chimpanzees hamadryas possible benefits sexual coercion species hypothesized possible proximate benefit females sometimes male mates female becomes mate would defend protect seen many primate possible benefit sexual coercion would come long run good genes males overcome females resistance must possess good genes would increase survival mating success male offspring hypothesis females use sexual coercion process assess quality sexual coercion often leads intersexual coevolutionary arms race consists females evolving adaptations male advances males evolving counteradaptations males persist violent behavior favors evolution female resistance defend organisms males genitalia harmful females certain insects females tend evolve thicker less sensitive copulatory also may evolve shield genital openings prevent females species water striders evolved protection forceful insemination abdominal spines downwardbent abdomens make harder males mate response however males counter evolved also changing shape abdomens would facilitate forceful male waterfowl aves anatidae evolution phallus forcefully copulate females led counteradaptations females form vaginal structures called dead end sacs clockwise coils structures make harder males achieve intromission clockwise coils significant male phallus everts body counterclockwise spiral therefore clockwise vaginal structure would impede forceful copulation studies shown longer males phallus elaborate corresponding vaginal speciation observed possible consequence sexual coercion diving beetle species family dytiscidae intersexual arms race occurs males females males evolved suction cup structures forelegs help grasp females females counterevolved setose dorsal furrows impede forceful copulation continuous evolution forward reverse directions led recent speciation japonicus kishii females kishii lost dorsal furrows japonicus sexual coercion lead sexual dimorphisms males females significant morphological differences example species larger males successful forcefully matinginsemination leading higher redsided garter snakes thamnophis sirtalis parietalis shown heavierbodied males better courters size gave advantage smaller bodied helps lead evolution sexual dimorphism males larger species males smaller females higher fitness many sexspecific morphological adaptations example dytiscidae diving beetles females setose dorsal furrows males males suction cups forelegs females sexual dimorphisms caused sexual coercion
