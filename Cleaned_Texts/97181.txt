posterior skull roof braincase preserved similarly saltasaurus rapetosaurus unlike nemegtosaurus supratemporal fenestra bordered frontal bone contrasting latter genera diamantinasaurus low supraoccipital cranial foramen subsequently less times height basal tuberae foramen traits however shared saltasaurus multiple traits found throughout derived titanosaurs including downward angling skull prong shaped lateral braincase processes undisturbed pituitary fossa centrally located opening internal carotid typical titanosauriformes cervical dorsal vertebrae diamantinasaurus opisthocoelous camellate many small internal chambers axis vertebra genus short potential characteristic saltasauridae contrasting saltasaurus rapetosaurus however prezygapophyses diamantinasaurus extend front centrum certain known middle dorsals postspinal lamina ridge posterior surface spine extends spine like basal sauropods europasaurus euhelopus dorsal vertebrae notch top posterior centrum

sternal original description plain unfeatured contrasting huabeisaurus lirainosaurus opisthocoelicaudia proximal surface ft humerus prominently curved derived titanosaurs opisthocoelicaudia saltasaurus lateral corner also squared placing within somphospondyli like somphospondylans unlike euhelopus rapetosaurus diamantinasaurus middleshifted deltopectoral crest ridges muscle attachment less developed opisthocoelicaudia magyarosaurus differing derived titanosaurs condyles articulate forearm pronounced diamantinasaurus ulna comparing derived titanosaurs level robustness well

presumed poropat et al related genuine absence life opisthocoelicaudia alamosaurus manus diamantinasaurus comparatively displays plesiomorphic features including middle metacarpal longest cm mc iii compared next longest cm mc ii presence thumb claw presence multiple phalanges phalangeal formula however manus diamantinasaurus completely cylindrical vertical like titanosaurs presence large numbers phalanges diamantinasaurus used poropat et al suggest titanosaurs actually ossified phalanges contrasting earlier studies following logic suggested opisthocoelicaudia epachthosaurus preserve single phalanx fourth finger absence others due lost fossilization preceding digits instead absence complete absence preserved phalanges alamosaurus rapetosaurus neuquensaurus saltasaurus potentially due disarticulation instead absence left ilium left right pubes left right ischia entire right leg lacking foot preserved diamantinasaurus although bones highly fragmented poorly preserved ilium outside well preserved size fragility mean internal side seen anatomical features top edge ilium broken revealing numerous small internal camerae present titanosaurs alamosaurus epachthosaurus lirainosaurus saltasaurus sonidosaurus shared derived titanosaurs anterior process ilium flares side rotates vertical ilium body becomes horizontal shelf diamantinasaurus also displays derived sauropod traits rounded ilium reduced articular surface ischium protuberance ischiatic articulation shared opisthocoelicaudia among titanosauriformes pubis advanced sauropods flattened bone lacking anterior hook diplodocoids potentially autapomorphic grooves surrounding obturator foramen articulation ischium takes pubic length macronarians contrasting alamosaurus opisthocoelicaudia reduced entire ischium length pubis titanosaurs also expands medially entire floor pelvis closed unlike titanosaurs ischium diamantinasaurus displays constriction width flange projecting internally diamantinasaurus also lacks notable muscle scar flexor tibialis internus side distal ischium diagnostic taxon amongst femur ft long roughly twice wide long derived sauropods although slightly crushed crushing prevent preservation linea intermuscularis cranialis ridge also present saltasaurus neuquensaurus bonatitan rocasaurus alamosaurus typical sauropod head femur slightly greater trochanter mild trochanteric shelf moderate lateral bulge present femur shifted medially like macronarians except opisthocoelicaudia saltasaurus rapetosaurus condyles articulation tibia fibula extend high onto posterior surface femur unlike neuquensaurus opisthocoelicaudia extend onto anterior surface depression subdivides fibular condyle bears slight ridge also found magyarosaurus titanosaurs although prominence unique diamantinasaurus fibular condyle larger tibial extends farther giving femur bevelled appearance potentially diagnostic saltasauridae also found rapetosaurus nontitanosaur tibia length femur normal neosauropods wider long proximal surface diamantinasaurus bears multiple fossae ridges tibia observed sauropods making suite diagnostic traits many titanosaurs distal end tibia flared double midshaft width although thin flange along midshaft may diagnostic diamantinasaurus originally reconstructed missing part shaft fibula cm long intermediately robust although close gracile bone poorly preserved still displays diagnostic widening fibular muscle scar diagnostic medial ridge surrounding grooves many titanosauriforms astragalus diamantinasaurus less times wide long proximal surface divided
