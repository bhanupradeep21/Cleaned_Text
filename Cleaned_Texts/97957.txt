hearing loss craniofacial syndromes common occurrence many multianomaly disorders involve structural malformations outer middle ear making significant hearing loss highly likely individuals treacher collins syndrome often cleft palate hearing loss addition disabilities hearing loss often secondary absent small unusually formed ears microtia commonly results malformations middle ear researchers found patients treacher collins syndrome symmetric external ear canal abnormalities symmetrically dysmorphic absent ossicles middle ear space inner ear structure largely normal patients show moderate hearing impairment greater type loss generally conductive hearing loss patients treacher collins syndrome exhibit hearing losses similar patients malformed missing ossicles pron et al persons pierre robin sequence prs greater risk hearing impairment persons cleft lip andor palate without prs one study showed average hearing loss prs compared cleft individuals without prs handzic et al similarly prs individuals typically exhibit conductive bilateral hearing losses greater degree cleft individuals without prs middle ear effusion generally apparent middle ear inner ear malformations accordingly management ear tubes myringotomy tubes often effective may restore normal levels hearing handzic et al hearing loss typical patients stickler syndrome sensorineural hearing loss indicating source deficit lies inner ear vestibulocochlear nerve processing centers brain szymkobennett et al found overall hearing loss type stickler syndrome generally mild significantly progressive hearing loss common higher frequencies hz szymkobennett et al mildly progressive sensorineural loss significant losses associated types ii iii stickler syndrome present patients stickler syndrome however patients also susceptible conductive losses similar nonsyndromic cleft patients petersonfalzone et al patients apert syndrome high occurrence middle ear disease otitis media conductive hearing loss pertersonfazone et al conductive hearing loss frequently seen population due almost constant middle ear disease gould et al furthermore inner ear anomalies described apert syndrome dilatation vestibule dysplastic semicircular canals cochlear malformations zhou g et al otol neurotol patients crouzon syndrome sometimes exhibit malformations external ear andor middle ear malalignment pinna petersonfalzone et al literature suggested persons crouzon syndrome typically conductive hearing loss caused middle ear effusion fluid middle ear perforation ossicular fixation ossicles intratympanic bony masses tympanic membrane ossicular anomalies closure oval window patients sensorineural hearing loss also reported less likely occur conductive hearing loss along middle ear disease commonly seen patients pfeiffer syndrome although reports mixed hearing loss well hearing loss typically caused stenosis atresia auditory canal middle ear hypoplasia ossicular hypoplasia vallinonapoli conductive hearing loss reported many eec syndrome association cleft palate pertersonfalzone syndrome ears may low set posteriorly rotated minor anomalies may presence conductive hearing loss mixed hearing loss

hemifacial microsomia also called oculoauriculovertebral spectrum often ear malformations malformations form preauricular ear pits complete absence auricle stenosis atresia external auditory canal ossicular malformations middle ear deformities incomplete pneumatization temporal bone rahbar et al found individuals syndrome ear malformation type addition ear malformations conductive hearing loss present typically ranging mild severe also reported cases cochlear involvement sensorineural hearing loss rahbar et al found patients hemifacial microsomia conductive hearing loss sensorineural hearing loss correlation severity dysmorphic features degree hearing loss meaning individuals mild malformations severely impaired hearing individuals nager syndrome typically malformations auricle external auditory canal middle ear including ossicles malformations found individuals nager syndrome inner ear malformations however typically seen population middle ear disease common among individuals nager syndrome chronic otitis media eustachian tube deformity result conductive hearing loss reason early detection treatment middle ear disease crucial population sensorineural hearing
