sanguinaria canadensis perennial herbaceous flowering plant native eastern north species genus sanguinaria included poppy family papaveraceae closely related eomecon eastern asia sanguinaria canadensis sometimes known canada bloodwort redroot red puccoon black plants variable leaf flower shape separated different subspecies due variable shapes indicating highly variable species bloodroot juice red products made sanguinaria extracts black salve escharotic cause permanent disfiguring applied skin extract sanguinarine may cause massive scab dead flesh killed cells called eschar although laboratory studies indicating sanguinaria may potential cancer therapy clinical studies lacking use discouraged due significant bloodroot grows cm tall one large basal leaf cm across five seven leaves

bloom much longer normal forms double flowers made stamens changed petallike parts making pollination doubleflowered cultivar canadensis f multiplex plena gained royal horticultural societys award garden sanguinaria root rich isoquinoline alkaloids mainly sanguinarine sanguinarine benzophenanthridine alkaloid see phenanthridine unlike alkaloids red color aqueous solutions present greatest concentration rhizomes second greatest roots lesser amounts found leaves related compounds plant berberine protopine among minor bloodroot produces benzylisoquinoline alkaloids primarily toxin sanguinarine alkaloids transported stored rhizome sanguinarine kills animal cells blocking action nakatpase transmembrane proteins result applying bloodroot skin may destroy tissue lead formation necrotic tissue called eschar bloodroot extracts thus considered escharotic although applying escharotic agents including bloodroot skin sometimes promoted pseudoscientific home treatment skin cancer attempts severely salves notably black salve derived bloodroot remove tumors microscopic tumor deposits may remain visible tumor tissue burned away case reports shown instances tumor recurred andor

supplement companies treatment cure us food drug administration listed products among fake cancer cures consumers oral use products containing bloodroot strongly associated development oral premalignant lesion may develop oral cancer although one review disputed viadent dental product containing bloodroot withdrawn north american market due concerns potential cause commercial uses
