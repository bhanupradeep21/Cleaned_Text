massachusetts lived worcester foundation experimental biology march chang arrived recently founded worcester foundation experimental biology shrewsbury massachusetts outside worcester fellowship granted gregory pincus learn technique vitro fertilisation apparent worked well together chang would eventually spend rest career foundation researching mammalian fertilisation funds became increasingly available research reproduction foundation attracted number talented scientists chang guided advised scientists may would go become leaders field reproduction foundation changs work contributed development oral contraceptive making one cofounders combined oral contraceptive one changs notable achievements research testing effectiveness certain orally administered steroids control mammalian fertility led coinvention first birth control pill gregory pincus chang arguably remembered endeavor birth control pill came tremendous influence human society sexual revolution however controlling fertility primary concentration work changs interest lay sperm eggs fertilisation process ability control fertility eggs necessity work initiated study orally administered contraceptives mammals enable better conduct research fertilisation indeed throughout span career five years spent researching testing effectiveness orally administered contraceptives work mainly oral mode administration contraceptive steroids rather effectiveness steroids already previously changs body work mammalian fertilisation large appears nearly publications one major discoveries effect lowering temperature sperm chang found temperature lower membrane structure function sperm would disintegrate thus destroying fertilising capacity sperm phenomenon commonly known cold shock yet another changs major discoveries observation relationship number available sperm effective fertilisation ova sperm believed fertilisation egg dependent large number available sperm fertilisation process chang found actually physiological structure individual sperm affected actual fertilisation egg large number sperm necessary posited purpose large number sperm fertilisation process allow greater genetic recombination strongest sperm would reach site fertilisation female reproductive tract process capacitation maturation period sperm required order able fertilise ova also one changs major discoveries observation would lead find capacitated sperm would lose capacitation exposed seminal plasma blood serum recapacitation could achieved sperm placed back uterus fallopian research experimentation changs work vitro fertilisation arguably greatest achievement gregory pincus claimed achieved successful mammal birth result vitro fertilisation rabbit eggs nobody including chang could repeat feat time doubts cast authenticity claim finally chang vitro fertilised black rabbits eggs black rabbits sperm transferred white rabbit able produce litter young black rabbits sort evidence attesting feasibility vitro fertilisation many scientists searching years followed chang associates conducted research determine specific conditions successful vitro fertilisation well perform technique mammals hamsters mice rats basis changs findings first vitro fertilisation human eggs performed leading birth worlds first test tube baby httpsenwikipediaorgwikiminchuehchang
