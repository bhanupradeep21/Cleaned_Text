topbar hive singlestory frameless beehive comb hangs removable bars bars form continuous roof comb whereas frames current hives allow space bees move boxes hives frames use honey chambers summer use management principles similar regular topbar hives sometimes also referred topbar hives topbar hives rectangular shape typically twice wide multistory framed hives commonly found englishspeaking countries topbar hives usually include one box allow beekeeping methods interfere little colony conventional advice often recommends inspecting colony week warmer months heavy work full supers beekeepers fully inspect topbar hives one comb needs lifted single opinion leader national standard horizontal hives many different designs accept various standard frame sizes although two wellknown styles long topbar hives named kenyan tanzanian kenyan hive actually developed canada socalled tanzanian hive topbar hive developed tanzania design topbar hives origins work done tredwell tub shaped topbar hive trialled rhodesia penelope long topbar hives began appear first referred grecian hives also known anástomo wicker similar long topbar hives also developed early authors david hive similar kenyan topbar hive except comb cut bars harvest time reused extraction also william bielby designed topbar hive featured catenary curved although guidebooks use africa often give precise dimensions kenyan hive encourage beekeepers keep equipment uniform thus interchangeable sizes one main selling points ktbh among proponents english speaking countries fact made practically size shape long top bars appropriate width angle sloped sides commonly recommended degrees width top bars sum comb thickness one measure beespace helps ensure bees build exactly one comb per top bar topbar hive plans freely available internet show hives roughly meter long cm cm wide high english speaking countries topbar hive usually mounted set legs lift hive height comfortable beekeepers african countries height hive often also determined type animal hive meant protected top bars topbar hive bars honey bees attach hang wax comb array hexagonal six sided cells beekeeper make top bars plain wood top bars usually inches inches mm wide depending local conditions type bee housed combs handled individually depth bar length bar whatever beekeeper wants usually depth top bar hive less deeper weight comb filled honey tends cause fall bar bottom hive bees lose access winter cluster hanging combs thus increasing likelihood starving important give bees clear starting point build comb top bar tbh beekeepers fashion top bars vshaped bottom guide comb building alternatively use table saw cut two closely spaced slots along long axis new top bar either type guide wax line grooves gives bees place hold hooked feet allows substantial drape bees form beginning comb building entrance top hives entrances small slot number holes inch diameter thereabouts closely mimics honey bees prefer nest brood nest established nearest entrance entrance narrow end hive honey storage deep hive beyond brood nest combs typically inspections begin either beginning brood nest front end honey storage rear entrance placed center long wall brood nest center honey storage either side possible safely remove bar middle occupied combs due possible side attachments means inspection begin either side honey storage fewer brood nest reached entrance placed high hive allow escape winter heat see alternative perspective bees able keep top bar hive cool enough three holes inch diameter lining fan cool air hive exhaust warm air essentially airconditioning hive possible small entrance slot inch result combs falling bars heat also resulted much traffic back entrance suggested bees kenyan hive much less tendency adhere comb sides hive adhered comb freed side leaving beespace bees tend rejoin comb significant problem either hive important either type end access free space without comb available adhered comb may freed initial costs equipment requirements typically much less hive designs scrap wood often used build good hive top bars easy make scrap timber horizontal hives require beekeeper lift super boxes usual checks manipulation done lifting one comb time minimal bending areas large land animals ratels bears present threat beehives singlebox hives may suspended reach elsewhere commonly raised level allows beekeeper inspect manipulate comfort since seasonal storage honey collection boxes supers needed centrifugal extractor commonly used equipment budget storage space requirements greatly reduced time money may need spent wiring foundation frames top bar hive also rapidly converted two even three mini hives called nucleus hive placing beetight dividers within hive allowing access independent entrances may avoid need purchase store nucleus hives disadvantages include usually unsupported combs spun honey extractors usually possible expand hive additional honey storage space required horizontal hives easily lifted carried one person recommended new recycled empty bars placed side brood chamber spring buildup easier bees make new comb move honey stores make room new brood also ensure maintenance well built honey barrier brood higher grade stores prevent buildup old comb brood chamber may advantageous add new bars entrance side brood chamber past pollen stores cause collection older honey reused comb may removed used produce somewhat lesser quality honey additional flavors propolis used strengthen protect brood comb honey may especially appropriate making mead root beer additional flavors predominate progressive removal brood comb appears noted consistent control afb use follower boards selectively control amount interior space available bees helpful particularly young hives dealing newly captured swarms recent introduction sliding follower boards enclose colony within hive body enabled flexible management top bar hives facilitated quicker inspections minimal disturbance bees follower boards adjustable solid panels effectively reduce size interior space within hive box accessible bees natural queen exclusion occurs frequently topbar hives brood nest separated honey section least full bar honey comb centimetres honey may case multistorey framed hive honey gathered brood nest becomes newly created comb however commercial topbar beekeepers found artificial queen excluders sometimes necessary keep queen laying eggs honey section topbar hive inspected lifting bars comb individually beekeepers start inspection one bars completed several sessions others start either front hive wall divider rear combs way beekeeper see cut side attachments moving first comb side attachments cut conventional hive tool using speciallymade tool long enough reach bottom hive narrow leg bottom efficient one bar separated side walls time use smoke commonly recommended inspection combs carried far less disturbance bees case multistorey hives since small amount hive exposed one time hives incorporate viewing glass window side hive allows observation without opening hive since theory combs get attached sloping sides topbars rest freely hive walls without spacers means topbars slid easily along length hive inspection without altering sequence combs noninspected bars need lifted way gain access bars part natural beekeeping concept beekeepers recommend opening brood area popular method harvesting honey topbar hive cutting comb topbar crushing comb straining honey results honey higher pollen content honey extracted flinging without crushing comb topbar hive comb extracted flinging motion eg hobbyist commercial rotary extractor problematic foundation used comb break easily rotary movement b topbar hives combs may use irregular nonstandard sizes fit commercially available extractors c comb uniformly flat may difficult uncap cells required rotary extraction rotary extractors cages mesh prevent loose pieces comb falling drum honey also harvested topbar comb cut comb owing fact crushing straining common method honey harvesting type hive beeswax often byproduct topbar hive beekeeping topbar hives popular beekeepers believe natural form beekeeping building usually require precise measurements modern multistory although modern long topbar hives originated middle twentieth century initially use

small enough portable allow beekeeping methods involve periodic merging splitting colonies bee hives conform general description topbar hives existed many centuries earliest known possible mention bee
