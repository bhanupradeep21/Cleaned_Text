neuropathology study disease nervous system tissue usually form either small surgical biopsies wholebody autopsies neuropathologists usually work department anatomic pathology work closely clinical disciplines neurology neurosurgery often depend neuropathology diagnosis neuropathology also relates forensic pathology brain disease brain injury related cause death neuropathology confused neuropathy refers disorders nerves usually peripheral nervous system rather tissues neuropathology branches specializations nervous system well tissues come together one field study work neuropathologist consists largely examining autopsy biopsy tissue brain spinal cord aid diagnosis tissues also observed eyes muscles surfaces organs tumors biopsy usually requested mass detected radiologic imaging imaging turn driven presenting signs symptoms patient ct scans also used discover issues patient autopsies principal work neuropathologist help postmortem diagnosis various forms dementia conditions affect central nervous system tissue samples researched within lab diagnosis well forensic investigations biopsies also consist skin epidermal nerve fiber density testing enfd recently developed neuropathology test punch skin biopsy taken identify small fiber neuropathies analyzing nerve fibers skin pathology test becoming available select labs well many universities replaces traditional sural nerve biopsy test less invasive used identify painful small fiber neuropathies neuropathologists work hospital labs clinics universities government depending situation often work patients medical professionals officials behind scene research using information given neurologists physicians neuropathologists may also research coroners morgue offices forensic projects ultimate goal neuropathologists find medical issue formulate timeline cure patients tissue many englishspeaking countries neuropathology considered subfield anatomical pathology contrast number independent university chairs neuropathology even institutes neuropathology germanspeaking countries due different historical background physician specializes neuropathology usually completing fellowship residency anatomical general pathology called neuropathologist daytoday clinical practice neuropathologist consultant physicians disease nervous system suspected diagnosis made less invasive methods biopsy nervous tissue taken sent neuropathologist examines using microscope certain molecular methods make definitive diagnosis many neuropathologists europe background clinical neurosciences neurology psychiatry well pathology neuropathologists physicians doctor medicine md doctor osteopathic medicine degree must finish either years anatomical pathology residency followed years neuropathology fellowship certified american board anatomical neuropathology less specialized neuropathology training countries also quite common neuropathologists phd related field neuropathologists must strong communication abilities must analyze results able explain results patients physicians paper verbally neuropathologists medically qualified practitioners registered general medical council uk postgraduate qualification neuropathology obtained training examination overseen royal college pathologists uk neuropathologist training anatomic pathology followed training relation diagnosis diseases nervous system muscle training european commonwealth countries similar canada neuropathologists complete royal college physicians surgeons canada neuropathology residency including year clinical medicine year anatomical pathology quite common neuropathologists phds related field addition examining central nervous system tissue neuropathologist usually assigned task examining muscle peripheral nerve biopsies muscle biopsies taken aid diagnosis muscle diseases polymyositis mitochondrial myopathy etc peripheral nerve assessed help work patients suspected peripheral neuropathies secondary conditions vasculitis amyloidosis neuropathology heavily researchoriented field santiago ramon cajal considered one founders modern neuroanatomy alois alzheimer person alzheimers disease named considered important early contributor field many neuropathologists around world made important clinical research contributions toward understanding diseases specifically affect brain degenerative diseases multiple sclerosis stroke brain tumors trauma neuromuscular diseases majority members international society neuropathology neuropathologists practicing within united
