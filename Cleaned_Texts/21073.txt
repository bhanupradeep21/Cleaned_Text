trigeminal neuralgia tn tgn also called fothergill disease tic douloureux trifacial neuralgia longterm pain disorder affects trigeminal nerve responsible sensation face motor functions biting chewing form neuropathic two main types typical atypical trigeminal typical form results episodes severe sudden shocklike pain one side face lasts seconds groups episodes occur atypical form results constant burning pain less episodes may triggered touch forms may occur regarded one painful disorders known medicine often results depression exact cause unknown believed involve loss myelin trigeminal might occur due compression blood vessel nerve exits brain stem multiple sclerosis stroke less common causes include tumor arteriovenous type nerve diagnosis typically based symptoms ruling possible causes postherpetic treatment includes medication anticonvulsant carbamazepine oxcarbazepine usually initial treatment effective side effects frequently experienced necessitate drug withdrawal many options include lamotrigine baclofen gabapentin amitriptyline opioids usually effective typical improve become resistant measures number types surgery may estimated trigeminal neuralgia affects around people around world female overrepresentation around ratio women usually begins people years old occur condition first described detail john disorder characterized episodes severe facial pain along trigeminal nerve divisions trigeminal nerve paired cranial nerve three major branches ophthalmic nerve maxillary nerve mandibular nerve one two three branches nerve may affected trigeminal neuralgia commonly involves middle branch maxillary nerve lower branch mandibular nerve trigeminal individual attack usually lasts seconds several minutes hours repeat hours short intervals attacks instances attacks experienced daily episodes intense pain may occur paroxysmally describe pain sensation people often describe trigger area face sensitive touching even air currents trigger episode however many people pain generated spontaneously without apparent stimulation affects lifestyle triggered common activities eating talking shaving brushing teeth wind chewing talking aggravate condition many patients attacks said affected feel like stabbing electric shocks burning sharp pressing crushing exploding shooting pain becomes pain also tends occur cycles remissions lasting months even years pain attacks known worsen frequency severity time people pain may migrate branches time people remains bilateral occurring sides trigeminal neuralgia rare except trigeminal neuralgia caused multiple sclerosis ms normally indicates problems trigeminal nerves since one nerve serves left side face serves right side occasional reports bilateral trigeminal neuralgia reflect successive episodes unilateral one side pain switching side face rather pain occurring simultaneously rapid spreading pain bilateral involvement simultaneous participation major nerve trunks painful tic convulsif nerves

also responsible motor function muscles mastication muscles involved chewing facial several theories exist explain possible causes pain syndrome believed nerve compressed opening inside outside skull leading research indicates enlarged lengthened blood vessel commonly superior cerebellar artery compressing throbbing microvasculature trigeminal nerve near connection compression injure nerves protective myelin sheath cause erratic hyperactive functioning nerve lead pain attacks slightest stimulation area served nerve well hinder nerves ability shut pain signals stimulation ends type injury may rarely caused aneurysm outpouching blood vessel avm arteriovenous tumor arachnoid cyst meningioma cerebellopontine traumatic event car shortterm peripheral compression often persistent compression results local demyelination loss axon potential continuity chronic nerve entrapment results demyelination primarily progressive axonal degeneration therefore widely accepted trigeminal neuralgia associated demyelination axons gasserian ganglion dorsal root suggested compression may related aberrant branch superior cerebellar artery lies trigeminal causes besides aneurysm multiple sclerosis cerebellopontine angle tumor include posterior fossa tumor expanding lesion even brainstem diseases trigeminal neuralgia found people multiple sclerosis according data seven theorized due damage
