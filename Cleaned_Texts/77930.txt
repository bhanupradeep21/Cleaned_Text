nerve net consists interconnected neurons lacking brain form cephalization organisms bilateral body symmetry normally associated condensation neurons advanced forms central nervous system organisms radial symmetry associated nerve nets found members ctenophora cnidaria echinodermata phyla found marine environments xenacoelomorpha phylum bilaterally symmetrical animals members subphylum xenoturbellida also possess nerve nerve nets provide animals ability sense objects use sensory neurons within nerve net also exists several phyla like chordates annelids flatworms always alongside longitudinal nerves andor nerve net simplest form nervous system found multicellular organisms unlike central nervous systems neurons typically grouped together neurons found nerve nets spread apart
