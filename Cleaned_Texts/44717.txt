environmental sex determination establishment sex nongenetic cue nutrient availability experienced within discrete period environmental factors often influence sex determination development sexual maturation include light intensity photoperiod temperature nutrient availability pheromones emitted surrounding plants animals contrast genotypic sex determination establishes sex fertilization genetic factors sex chromosomes true environmental sex determination sex determined fixed switched environmental sex determination different forms sequential hermaphroditism sex determined flexibly fertilization throughout organism environmental sex determination similar certain formsvague sexual selection oftentimes different opposing selective pressures males females costs reproduction sexual selection common throughout tree life known birds often resulting sexual dimorphism size appearance differences sexes environmental sex determination selective pressures evolutionary time selected flexibility sex determination optimize fitness heterogenous environment different costs sex males certain environmental conditions differentially affect sex would beneficial become one sex especially pertinent sessile organisms move different environment plants example female sexual function often energetically expensive fertilized must use significant stored energy produce fruits seeds sporophytes whereas males must produce sperm spermcontaining structure antheridium seedless plants pollen seed plants lacking genetic information coding separate sexes sex chromosomes individuals exhibit environmental sex determination contain genetic information coding sexes general exposed certain environmental cues epigenetic changes cause developing individuals become either male female environmental cues often trigger development males females include temperature nutrient food case animals water availability photoperiod competitive stress pheromones conspecific specific mechanisms cues vary species amphipod crustacean gammarus duebeni produces males early mating season females later response length daylight photoperiod male fitness improves female fitness increased size environmental sex determination adaptive system permitting males experience longer growing season branchiopod crustacean daphnia magna parthenogenetically produces male progeny response combination three environmental factors namely reduced photoperiod autumn shortage food raised population bonellia viridis marine worm locationdependent sex determination sex depends larvae sex amniote vertebrates mammals birds determined however reptiles temperaturedependent sex determination sex permanently determined thermal conditions experienced middle third embryonic sex crocodilians sphenodontians exclusively determined temperature contrast squamates lizards snakes turtles exhibit genotypic sex determination temperaturedependent sex determination although temperature dependence much common turtles fern species exceptions namely salvineales homosporous lack sex chromosomes lacking genetic information coding separate sexes every fern spore capacity become male female hermaphroditic gametophyte depending many fern species including ceratopteris richardii environmental sex determination linked breeding fern gametophytes exhibit wide variety breed systems divided outcrossing inbreeding promote outcrossing female gametophytes release chemical pheromone known antheridiogen controls sex nearby developing antheridiogen secreted females promotes development nearby asexual gametophytes males adaptive inducing maleness increases probability outcrossing males provide sperm females rather females becoming hermaphroditic bisexual selffertilizing however fertilization occurs female gametophyte still become hermaphroditic selffertilize conditions conducive growth ultimately resulting inbreeding depression additionally similar crocodilians homosporous fern gametophyte sex determined abiotic environment accordance sizeadvantage model stressful environments crowding nutrient stress gametophytes smaller develop males favorable growing conditions gametophytes larger develop moss gametophytes either asexual female male hermaphroditic like ferns unlike homosporous ferns moss gametophytes either monoicous dioicous similar monoecious dioecious vascular plants studied dioicous species exhibiting genetic sex determination via uv sex chromosome sex determination system monoicous moss species splachnum ampullaceum exhibit environmental sex determination early development low light low ph low nutrient availability promoting male presence auxin widespread plant hormone gibberellins compounds similar antheridiogen ferns female male individuals invest sexual structures antheridia environmental sex determination moss fundamentally different spatial segregation sexes occurrence environmentally mediated sex ratios moss patches observed sexually static moss species spatial segregation sexes mosses caused differential survival rates sexes result competitive advantage female leads female dominated populations maintained asexual reproduction minimal sexual reproduction contrast environmental sex determination dynamic development females males different environmental conditions many angiosperms exhibit sequential hermaphroditism meaning switch sexes continually throughout life based current conditions resource availability optimize fitness flowering sequential hermaphroditism environmental sex determination mutually exclusive example catasetum viridiflavum epiphyte plant grows another plant orchidaceae family exhibits sequential hermaphroditism younger smaller individuals male inflorescences older larger individuals female inflorescences sex expression also strongly influenced light intensity individuals high light often female individuals low light often male regardless higher light individuals produce ethylene common plant hormone promotes formation female flowers httpsenwikipediaorgwikienvironmentalsexdetermination
