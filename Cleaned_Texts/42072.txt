unionopterus genus eurypterid extinct group aquatic arthropods commonly known sea scorpions fossils registered early carboniferous period genus contains one species u anastasiae recovered deposits tournaisian vis√©an stages kazakhstan known one single specimen presumed lost described publication russian language poor illustrations unionopterus affinities extremely poorly known unionopterus described discovery known specimen karaganda formation kazakhstan time part soviet union one first discoveries eurypterids soviet union carboniferous eurypterids general probably swimming organism well eurypterids although good relatives numerous factors made unionopterus problematic genus eurypterid researchers placed family adelophthalmidae even speculated species adelophthalmus dumonti actually belongs unionopterus confirmed many authors chosen completely ignore genus phylogenetic studies making unionopterus enigmatic eurypterid unionopterus small eurypterid length body estimated cm

specimen almost completely preserved prosoma head trapezoid somewhat narrow anteriorly close eurypterus surrounded wide marginal border lateral eyes small millimetres inches long reniform beanshaped close prosoma resembling nanahughmilleria ocelli simple eyelike sensory organs occupied subcentral almost central position immediately behind eyes also known metastoma large plate part abdomen

specimen collected russian geologist leonty leontiyevich halfin sent ukrainian paleontologist boris isidorovich chernyshev described also described carbonarius due temporal rank lower carboniferous one first finds period chernyshev considered genus worthwhile knowledge eurypterida evolution placing family pterygotidae gave specific epithet anastasiae honour wife helped study unionopterus

paleontologists odd erik tetlie jason dunlop suggested belgian species adelophthalmus dumonti could actually represent species unionopterus due similarities trapezoidal shape prosoma width marginal however contested tetlie peter van roy year later following reanalysis specimen dumonti showed carapace fact parabolic approximately ushaped shape narrow marginal rim unlike shown original description chernyshev classified unionopterus member family pterygotidae mainly due great similarities hughmilleria genus thought separate clade prosoma opisthosoma shape position eyes aerodynamic body epimera gradual narrowing body shape swimming leg among victor p tollerton jr would classify family later authors consider classification phylogenetic classification unionopterus clear due poor illustrations given chernyshev probable loss known specimen unionopterus several factors help inclusion genus adelophthalmidae possession spines appendage epimeras metasoma trapezoidal shape prosoma different adelophthalmids addition affinities within adelophthalmidae unionopterus also uncertain seems share characteristics adelophthalmus also basal primitive nanahughmilleria pittsfordipterus also suggested
