neomycin aminoglycoside antibiotic displays bactericidal activity gramnegative aerobic bacilli anaerobic bacilli resistance yet arisen generally effective grampositive bacilli anaerobic gramnegative bacilli neomycin comes oral topical formulations including creams ointments eyedrops neomycin belongs aminoglycoside class antibiotics contain two amino sugars connected glycosidic bonds neomycin

microbiologist selman waksman student hubert lechevalier rutgers university produced naturally bacterium streptomyces synthesis requires specific nutrient conditions either stationary submerged aerobic conditions compound isolated purified neomycin typically applied topical preparation neosporin neomycinpolymyxin bbacitracin antibiotic also administered orally case usually combined antibiotics neomycin absorbed gastrointestinal tract used preventive measure hepatic encephalopathy hypercholesterolemia killing bacteria intestinal tract neomycin keeps ammonia levels low prevents hepatic encephalopathy especially gastrointestinal surgerycitation needed waksman lechevalier originally noted neomycin active streptomycinresistant bacteria well mycobacterium tuberculosis causative agent neomycin also used treat small intestinal bacterial overgrowth neomycin administered via injection extremely nephrotoxic damaging kidney function even compared aminoglycosides exception neomycin included small quantities preservative vaccines typically Î¼g per similar aminoglycosides neomycin excellent activity gramnegative bacteria partially effective grampositive bacteria relatively toxic humans allergic reactions noted common adverse reaction see physicians sometimes recommend using antibiotic ointments without neomycin following represents minimum inhibitory concentration mic
