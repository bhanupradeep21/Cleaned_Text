embryonic diapausea delayed implantation mammals reproductive strategy used number animal species across different biological classes types mammals takes place process occurs blastocyst stage embryonic characterized dramatic reduction complete cessation mitotic activity arresting often phase placental embryonic diapause blastocyst immediately implant uterus sexual reproduction resulted zygote rather remains nondividing state dormancy conditions allow attachment uterine wall proceed result normal gestation period extended speciesspecific diapause provides survival advantage offspring birth emergence young timed coincide hospitable conditions regardless mating occurs length gestation gain survival rates progeny confers evolutionary advantage organisms undergo embryonic diapause able synchronize birth offspring favorable conditions reproductive success irrespective mating took many different factors induce embryonic diapause time year temperature lactation supply embryonic diapause relatively widespread phenomenon outside mammals known occurrence reproductive cycles many insects nematodes fish nonmammalian observed approximately mammalian less two percent species include certain rodents bears armadillos mustelids eg weasels badgers marsupials eg kangaroos groups one species undergoes embryonic diapause roe deer order experimental induction embryonic discontinuous development within species spontaneously undergo embryonic diapause nature achieved reversible developmental arrest successfully demonstrated may evidence evolutionary significance phenomenon latent capacity diapause potentially present much wider segment species known occur multicellular organisms conception begin small number cells grow develop cells divide organisms capable embryonic diapause nonideal reproductive conditions cessation cellular division prevents embryo growing maturing delaying maturation embryo conditions ideal enough promote survival offspring cases mother regulation cell cycle relates embryonic diapause linked dacapo gene fruit fly responsible inhibiting formation cyclin complexes necessary dna synthesis also evidence pointing upregulation b

placental model embryonic much molecular regulation involved activating dormant blastocysts characterized little widely applicable characterization available regarding entry diapause conditions enable blastocyst remain dormant embryo exits diapause arrest resumes regular development adverse effects specifically within placental embryonic diapause cessation led intentional failure blastocyst implant uterine wall essential component developmental progression hormones relating failed implantation also contribute embryonic two distinct forms embryonic diapause characterized different conditions onset facultative diapause occurs response certain environmental metabolic stressors drastic changes temperature feeding obligate diapause occurs regularly reproductive cycle affected species often associated seasonal changes facultative diapause regulated several factors including maternal environment ovarian competency pituitary gland metabolic stress regards many regulators form diapause placental mammals facultative diapause often result fertilization shortly following birth previous litter consequential pups suckling lactation promotes prolactin released turn reduces progesterone secretion corpus luteum pregnant female corpus luteum temporary endocrine organ formed leftover cells ovarian follicle ovary released mature ovum main function corpus luteum secrete progesterone pregnancy order maintain uterine environment needed prolactin acting corpus luteum causes progesterone level optimal concentration therefore induces embryonic facultative diapause species undergoes facultative diapause tends specific developmental stage genetically determined process initiated form diapause well studied rodents identified many species including nonmammals clear well mechanisms studied onset maintenance release facultative diapause rodent model apply species obligate adj necessity diapause aka seasonal delayed implantation mechanism ensuring birth offspring timed optimal environmental conditions ensure maximal proposed mechanism separate conception parturition birth occur favourable time obligate diapause activated deactivated changes number daylight hours within day photoperiod hence occurs within specific obligate diapause occurs variety species different groups significant variations diapause length western spotted skunks spilogale gracilis diapause around days american minks neogale vison diapause around fourteen similarly facultative diapause series hormonal changes arrest blastocyst development prior implantation preventing continued growth embryo however obligate diapause blastocyst shall enter dormant state every reproductive season means every blastocyst mother produces shall enter period close regulation obligate diapause essential survival mother offspring premature diapause result forgone growth breeding opportunities late diapause result death due adverse prior vernal equinoxb photoperiod less hours increases production melatonin pineal gland due inhibitory relationship melatonin prolactin increase melatonin decreases prolactin secretion pituitary gland decrease prolactin consequently decreases progesterone production corpus luteum preventing development blastocyst induces embryonic vernal equinox photoperiod greater hours decreases production melatonin pineal gland therefore increases prolactin progesterone production pituitary
