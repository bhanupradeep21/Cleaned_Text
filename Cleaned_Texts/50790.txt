exploration process exploring activity expectation discovery organised exploration largely human activity exploratory activity common organisms capable directed locomotion ability learn described amongst others social insects foraging behaviour feedback returning individuals affects activity members exploration defined definitions implication novelty unfamiliarity expectation discovery exploration whereas survey implies directed examination necessarily discovery previously unknown unexpected information activities mutually exclusive often occur simultaneously variable extent field investigation region may explored different times different explorers different motivations may make similar different discoveries intrinsic exploration involves activity directed towards specific goal activity extrinsic exploration meaning appetitive needed directed towards specific goal curiosity quality related inquisitive thinking activities exploration investigation learning evident observation humans curiosity found strong motivation exploration potential external rewards uncertain unclear intrinsic drive likely motivate exploration sufficiently achieve results factors suggested underlie curiosity include gain information utility information perceived progress exploratory behavior movements people animals becoming familiar new environments even obvious biological advantage lack exploratory behaviour may considered indication fearfulness travelling expectation discovery often motivated combinion aspects inspective diversive exploration three major subdivisions class exploration based technology involved geographical exploration sometimes considered default meaning general term exploration practice discovering lands regions planet earth remote relatively inaccessible origin surface earth covered water relatively comprehensively explored access generally relatively straightforward underwater subterranean areas far less known even surface much still discovered detail remote inaccessible wilderness areas two major eras geographical exploration occurred human history first covering human history saw people moving africa settling new lands developing distinct cultures relative early explorers settled europe asia years ago crossed ice age land bridge siberia alaska moved southwards settle part cultures ignorant others second period exploration occurring last years saw increased crosscultural exchange trade exploration marked new era cultural intermingling recently early writings exploration date back millennium bc ancient egypt one earliest impactful thinkers exploration ptolemy century ad century century ad exploration done chinese arab explorers followed age discovery european scholars rediscovered works early latin greek geographers age discovery partly driven land routes outside europe becoming desire conquest century also saw exploration driven nobler motives including scientific discovery expansion knowledge broader knowledge worlds geography meant people able make world maps depicting land known first modern atlas theatrum orbis terrarum published abraham ortelius included world map depicted earths underwater exploration exploration underwater environment either direct observation explorer remote observation measurement direction investigators systematic targeted exploration simultaneous survey recording data followed data processing interpretation publication effective method increase understanding ocean underwater regions effectively managed conserved regulated resources discovered accessed used less ocean mapped detail even less visually observed total diversity life distribution populations similarly incompletely space exploration use astronomy space technology explore outer exploration space currently carried mainly astronomers telescopes physical exploration conducted uncrewed robotic space probes human spaceflight space exploration like classical form astronomy one main sources space science observation objects space known astronomy predates reliable recorded history development large relatively efficient rockets midtwentieth century allowed physical extraterrestrial exploration become reality common rationales exploring space include advancing scientific research national prestige uniting different nations ensuring future survival humanity
