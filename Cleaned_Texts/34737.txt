vitro spermatogenesis process creating male gametes spermatozoa outside body culture system process could useful fertility preservation infertility treatment may develop understanding spermatogenesis cellular molecular level spermatogenesis highly complex process artificially rebuilding vitro include creating similar microenvironment testis well supporting endocrine paracrine signalling ensuring survival somatic germ cells spermatogonial stem cells sscs mature different methods culturing used process isolated cell cultures fragment cultures cell cultures include either monocultures one cell population cultured coculturing systems several cell lines must least two cultured cells initially isolated culture enzymatically digesting testis tissue separate different cell types process isolating cells lead cell main advantage monoculture effect different influences one specific cell population cells investigatedcitation needed coculture allows interactions cell populations observed experimented seen advantage monoculture isolated cell culture specifically coculture testis tissue useful technique examining influences specific factors hormones different feeder cells progression spermatogenesis vitrocitation needed example factors temperature feeder cell influence role testosterone folliclestimulating hormone fsh investigated using isolated cell culture studies concluded different factors influence culture germ cells eg media growth factors hormones temperature example culturing immortalized mouse germ cells temperatures cells proliferate rapidly highest temperature least rapidly lowest varying levels differentiation highest temperature differentiation detected seen early spermatids appearing isolated cell culture technique successfully used vitro production sperm using mouse animal investigations appropriate feeder cells concluded variety cells could encourage development germ cells sertoli cells leydig cells peritubular myoid cells essential sertoli cells leydig peritubular myoid cells contribute microenvironment encourage stem cells remain pluripotent self renew fragment cultures testis removed fragments tissue cultured supplemental media containing different growth factors induce spermatogenesis form functional development culture technique taken place mainly use animal models eg mice rat testis tissue advantage using method maintains natural spatial arrangement seminiferous tubules however hypoxia recurring problem cultures low oxygen supply hinders development maturation spermatids significantly adult immature testis challenges type culture include maintaining structure seminiferous tubules makes difficult longerterm cell cultures tissue structures flatten making hard work resolve issues cultures used mature spermatozoa capable fertilization isolated vitro culture immature mouse testis cultures use sponge models scaffolds resemble elements extracellular matrix achieve natural spatial structure seminiferous tubules better represent tissues interaction different cell types ex vivo experiment different components extracellular matrix collagen agar calcium alginate commonly used form gel scaffold provide oxygen propagate cultures testicular cell cultures imbedded porous spongescaffold allowed colonise structure survive several weeks allow spermatogonia differentiate mature spermatozoa addition shaking cultures seeding process allows increased oxygen supply helps overcome issue hypoxia improves lifespan contrast monocultures cultures able establish vitro conditions somewhat resemble testicular microenvironment allow accurate study testicular physiology associations vitro development sperm ability recapitulate spermatogenesis vitro provides unique opportunity study biological process oftentimes cheaper faster method research vivo work observation often easier vitro targeted cells mostly isolated immobile another significant advantage vitro research ease environmental factors changed monitored also techniques practical feasible vivo vitro work without challenges example one loses natural structure provided vivo tissue thus cell connections could important function rodent spermatogenesis identical human counterpart especially due high evolution rate male reproductive tract techniques solid starting point future human various categories infertile men may benefit advances techniques especially lack viable gamete production men benefit example sperm extraction techniques currently little options producing genetic notably males undergone chemoradiotherapy prepubertally may benefit vitro people option cryopreserve viable sperm procedure thus ability generate genetically descended sperm later life invaluable possible methods could applied groups induction spermatogenesis testis samples taken prepubertally samples availableviable new methods manipulate stem cell differentiation could produce sscs scratch using adult stem cell alternative method graft preserved tissue back onto adult cancer survivors however comes operational risks well risk reintroducing malignant even using method however vitro spermatogenesis advances would allow sample expansion observation better ensure quality quantity graft healthy preserved sscs without cellular environment support vitro spermatogenesis could used following transplant sscs healthy donor another group could helped vitro spermatogenesis form genetic impediment sperm production viable ssc development obvious target also varying levels spermatogenic arrest previously underdeveloped germ
