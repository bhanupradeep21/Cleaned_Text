audiometry latin audÄ«re hear metria measure branch audiology science measuring hearing acuity variations sound intensity pitch tonal purity involving thresholds differing typically audiometric tests determine subjects hearing levels help audiometer may also measure ability discriminate different sound intensities recognize pitch distinguish speech background noise acoustic reflex otoacoustic emissions may also measured results audiometric tests used diagnose hearing loss diseases ear often make use basic requirements field able produce repeating sound way attenuate amplitude way transmit sound subject means record interpret subjects responses test many years desultory use various devices capable producing sounds controlled intensity first types clocklike giving airborne sound tubes
