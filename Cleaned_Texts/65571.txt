dental radiographs commonly known xrays radiographs used diagnose hidden dental structures malignant benign masses bone loss cavities radiographic image formed controlled burst xray radiation penetrates oral structures different levels depending varying anatomical densities striking film sensor teeth appear lighter less radiation penetrates reach film dental caries infections changes bone density periodontal ligament appear darker xrays readily penetrate less dense structures dental restorations fillings crowns may appear lighter darker depending density material dosage xray radiation received dental patient typically small around msv full mouth equivalent days worth background environmental radiation exposure similar dose received crosscountry airplane flight concentrated one short burst aimed small area incidental exposure reduced use lead shield lead apron sometimes lead thyroid collar technician exposure reduced stepping room behind adequate shielding material xray source activated photographic film exposed xray radiation needs developed traditionally using process film exposed series chemicals dark room films sensitive normal light timeconsuming process incorrect exposures mistakes development process necessitate retakes exposing patient additional radiation digital xrays replace film electronic sensor address issues becoming widely used dentistry technology evolves may require less radiation processed much quickly conventional radiographic films often instantly viewable computer however digital sensors extremely costly historically poor

general dental practice royal college surgeons england publication selection criteria dental radiographycitation needed holds given current evidence full mouth series discouraged due large numbers radiographs involved many necessary patients treatment alternative approach using bitewing screening selected periapical views suggested method minimising radiation dose patient maximizing diagnostic yield contrary advice emphasises conducting radiographs patients interest recent evidence suggests used frequently dentists paid feeforservice accurate positioning utmost importance produce diagnostic radiographs avoid retakes hence minimizing radiation exposure requirements ideal positioning however anatomy oral cavity makes challenging satisfy ideal positioning requirements two different techniques hence developed utilised undertaking intraoral radiograph paralleling technique bisected angle technique generally accepted paralleling technique offers advantages disadvantages gives reflective image compared bisecting angle used periapical bitewing radiographs image receptor placed holder positioned parallel long axis tooth imaged xray tube head aimed right angles vertically horizontally tooth image receptor positioning potential satisfy four five requirements tooth image receptor contact whilst parallel separation long focustoskin distance required prevent technique advantageous teeth viewed exactly parallel central ray therefore minimal levels object use technique positioning duplicated use film holders makes recreation image possible allows future evidence use paralleling technique reduces radiation hazard thyroid gland compared use bisecting angle technique however may impossible patients due anatomy eg shallowflat bisecting angle technique older method periapical radiography useful alternative technique ideal receptor placement using paralleling technique achieved reasons anatomical obstacles eg tori shallow palate shallow floor mouth narrow arch

applying geometrical principle similar triangles length tooth image actual length tooth many inherent variables inevitably result image distortion reproducible views possible incorrect vertical tube
