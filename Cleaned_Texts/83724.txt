primate sociality area primatology aims study interactions three main elements primate social network social organisation social structure mating system intersection three structures describe socially complex behaviours relationships occurring among adult males females particular cohesion stability groups maintained confluence factors including kinship willingness cooperate frequency agonistic behaviour varying intensities dominance primate social organisation exists along spectrum networks ranging solitary neighbourhood systems multiindividual units complex multilevel societies composed hierarchicallyorganised social units evolution diverse primate social systems considered naturally selected antipredation increased resource detection cooperation social learning also considered cobenefits group living similar genetic traits behavioural characteristics similarly result natural selection processes opposition many animaldecision making strategies encourage individual fitness

among fact many solitary primates maintain social networks using vocal olfactory signals examples solitary primates orangutans galagos lorises species lemurs tarsiers pairbonded systems pairliving primates small social units consisting one adult male one adult female immature offspring factors time space define type social system firstly pairbonds must demonstrate longterm affiliative partnership least one year one seasonal cycle secondly must also higher frequency association spatial proximity bondedpair individuals paternal care offspring relatively uncommon trait primate social however monogamous mating system often observed though assumed pairbonding generates equal variance offspring success pair thus paternal involvement offspring rearing much likelier observed primate

promotes cooperative breeding alloparenting nonbreeding individuals assist providing care offspring produced main breeding examples onefemalemultimale structured primate species many species tamarin marmoset onemalemultifemale groups usually characterised single resident male defends group often related adult females males outside tenure ship held form social organisation allows male exclusive access reproductive females breeding resident male often suffers challenges extragroup males perhaps belonging allmale bachelor groups whereby males may attempt takeovers goal gaining sole access reproductive takeover new resident male could lead infanticide infant killing behaviour interpreted strategic attempt bring females back estrous allows mating opportunities occur sooner new resident

savannah baboons papio cynocephalusi observed lactating females group would closely associate specific adult research conducted primate friendships three main benefits hypothesised close associations specific male tends discourage infanticide tends reduce incidence harassment female stimulates paternal investment care benefits friendships within multimalemultifemale group systems demonstrate

researchers hypothesize environmental social pressures allowed whole array interindividual individuals relationships promote inclusive group interindividual relationships thought influenced sexrelated variables occur females males members opposite sex factors influencing interfemale relationships primarily thought food competition group size dispersal three elements characterize degree competition among female group members instance female philopatric society often stable kinbased hierarchies develop conversely male philopatric species egalitarian societies females regularly transfer groups eliminating potential hierarchies coalitions leading female bonding sole mechanism resource defence intermale relationships tend characterized agonism competition access socioecological theory predicts fierce competition exists among male group members access females leading higher frequencies agonistic interactions common species primates demonstrate malemale relationships leading alliances affiliative behaviors inclusive group fitness prioritized individual finally intersexual relationships adult male adult female individuals also shaped number factors including sexual selection dispersal patterns dominance structures certainty paternity risk infanticide andor level sexual dimorphism present within affinity affiliation individuals often largely determined dispersal patterns characterizing primate social instance chimpanzees pan troglodytes patrilineal social systems males usually remain natal groups females emigrate neighboring groups conversely matrilineal societies bonobos pan paniscus females remain natal groups males disperse new groups dispersal patterns also likely affect structure organization social also affiliative behaviors encourage stronger

mitigated cooperation among subordinate individuals another form dominance structure related age example gorillas demonstrate agegraded dominance structure wherein eldest male member highestranking dominant male primate mating systems infer social element genetic element therefore mating system describe interactions resulting relationship mating pairs involved reproductive outcomes mating instance monogamy infers exclusive mating access thus greater paternity certainty observed mating systems primates include monogamy polyandry polygyny polygamy described monogamy monogamous mating system one adult male one adult female preferential partner longterm temporal element category mating system longer one year one seasonal cycle offspring resulting mating system belong additionally assumption member partnership relatively equal likelihood successfully though strict monogamy rare nature primate bonded pairs demonstrate monogamous partially monogamous mating monogamous pairbonded species observations extrapair copulations wherein male female member partner opposite sex socalled mate witnessed polyandry polyandrous mating system one reproductive adult female mates two different adult males mating system adult males mate exclusively adult polygyny polygynous mating system one adult male mates two adult common type mating system observed primate polygyny occur result spatial constraints solitary males able defend access nearby solitary females another pattern reflects scramble competition wherein adult males roam landscape search sexually receptive females moving shortly harempolygyny occurs single adult male defends access multiple females order gain exclusive mating finally groups males might form coalitions order successfully defend mating access polygamy polygamous mating system males females mate two partners mating system offspring paternity might remain httpsenwikipediaorgwikiprimatesociality
