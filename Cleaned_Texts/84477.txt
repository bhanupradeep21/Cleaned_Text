cold heat adaptations humans part broad adaptability homo sapiens adaptations humans physiological genetic cultural allow people live wide variety climates great deal research done developmental adjustment acclimatization cultural practices less research genetic adaptations colder hotter temperatures human body always works remain homeostasis one form homeostasis thermoregulation body temperature varies every individual average internal temperature sufficient stress extreme external temperature may cause injury death exceeds ability body thermoregulate hypothermia set core temperature drops hyperthermia set core body temperature rises humans adapted living climates hypothermia hyperthermia common primarily culture technology use clothing modern humans emerged africa approximately years ago period unstable climate leading variety new traits among modern humans spread europe outcompeted neanderthals researchers hypothesize suggests early modern humans evolutionarily fit live various supported variability selection hypothesis proposed richard potts says human adaptability came environmental change long bergmanns rule states endothermic animal subspecies living colder climates larger bodies subspecies living warmer individuals larger bodies better suited colder climates larger bodies produce heat due cells smaller surface area volume ratio compared smaller individuals reduces heat loss study frederick foster mark collard found bergmanns rule applied humans latitude temperature groups differ allens rule biological rule says limbs endotherms shorter cold climates longer hot climates limb length affects bodys surface area helps thermoregulation shorter limbs help conserve heat longer limbs help dissipate marshall newman argues observed eskimo shorter limbs people laterally origins heat cold adaptations explained climatic ambient air temperature affects much energy investment human body must make temperature requires least amount energy investment body controls temperature hypothalamus thermoreceptors skin send signals hypothalamus indicate vasodilation vasoconstriction occur human body two methods thermogenesis produces heat raise core body temperature first shivering occurs unclothed person ambient air temperature limited amount glycogen available second nonshivering occurs brown adipose population studies shown san tribe southern africa sandawe eastern africa reduced shivering thermogenesis cold poor coldinduced vasodilation fingers toes compared mechanism human body cool sweat sweating occurs ambient air temperature body fails return normal internal evaporation sweat helps cool blood beneath skin limited amount water available body cause humans adapted heat early africa climate selected traits helped stay cool also humans physiological mechanisms reduced rate metabolism modified sensitivity sweat glands provide adequate amount cooldown without individual becoming two types heat body adapted humid heat dry heat body adapted way humid heat characterized warmer temperatures high amount water vapor air humid heat dangerous moisture air prevents evaporation sweat regardless acclimatization humid heat poses far greater threat dry heat humans carry physical outdoor activities temperature ambient humidity greater combined high humidity theoretical limit human survival shade even unlimited water theoretically equivalent heat index dry heat characterized warmer temperatures little water vapor air desert conditions dry heat also dangerous sweat tend evaporate extremely quickly causing dehydration humid heat dry heat favor individuals less fat slightly lower body humans exposed certain climates extended periods time physiological changes occur help individual adapt hot cold climates helps body conserve inuit blood flowing extremities hotter temperature people living warmer climates study alacaluf indians shows resting metabolic rate percent higher white controls used sami increase metabolic rate sleeping unlike nonacclimated aboriginal australians undergo similar process body cools metabolic rate humans evolutionary predecessors central africa living similar tropical climates millions years means similar thermoregulatory study done bantus south africa showed bantus lower sweat rate acclimated nonacclimated white people similar study done aboriginal australians produced similar results aboriginals much lower sweat rate white social adaptations enabled early modern humans occupy environments temperatures drastically different africa potts culture enabled humans expand range areas would otherwise humans able occupy areas extreme cold clothing buildings manipulation fire furnaces enabled occupation cold historically many indigenous australians wore genital coverings studies shown warmth fires build enough keep body fighting heat loss inuit use wellinsulated houses designed transfer heat energy source living area means average indoor temperature coastal inuit humans inhabit hot climates dry humid done millions years selective use clothing technological inventions air conditioning allows humans thrive hot climates one example chaamba live
