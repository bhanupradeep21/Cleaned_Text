human microbiome aggregate microbiota reside within human tissues biofluids along corresponding anatomical sites including skin mammary glands seminal fluid uterus ovarian follicles lung saliva oral mucosa conjunctiva biliary tract gastrointestinal tract types human microbiota include bacteria archaea fungi protists viruses though microanimals also live human body typically excluded definition context genomics term human microbiome sometimes used refer collective genomes resident however term human metagenome humans colonized many microorganisms approximately order magnitude nonhuman cells human microorganisms colonize humans commensal meaning coexist without harming humans others mutualistic relationship human conversely nonpathogenic microorganisms harm human hosts via metabolites
