protein tyrosine kinase also known focal adhesion kinase fak protein humans encoded focal adhesionassociated protein kinase involved cellular adhesion cells stick surroundings spreading processes cells move shown fak blocked breast cancer cells became less metastatic due decreased gene encodes cytosolic protein tyrosine kinase found concentrated focal adhesions form among cells attaching extracellular matrix constituents encoded protein member fak subfamily protein tyrosine kinases included lacks significant sequence similarity kinases subfamilies also includes large ferm exception certain types blood cells cells express fak fak tyrosine kinase activity activated plays key important early step cell migration fak activity elicits intracellular signal transduction pathways promote turnover cell contacts extracellular matrix promoting cell migration fak required development loss fak resulting lethality seems paradox fak absolutely required cell migration may play roles cell including regulation tumor suppressor least four transcript variants encoding four different isoforms found gene fulllength natures two fak protein kd recruited participant focal adhesion dynamics cells role motility cell survival fak highly conserved nonreceptor tyrosine kinase originally identified substrate oncogene protein tyrosine kinase cytosolic kinase implicated diverse cellular roles including cell locomotion mitogen response cell survival fak typically located structures known focal adhesions multiprotein structures link extracellular matrix ecm cytoplasmic cytoskeleton additional components focal adhesions include actin filamin vinculin talin paxillin fak phosphorylated response integrin engagement growth factor stimulation action mitogenic integrin receptors
