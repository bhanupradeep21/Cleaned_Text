interplanetary contamination refers biological contamination planetary body space probe spacecraft either deliberate unintentional two types interplanetary contamination main focus microbial life potentially invasive species nonbiological forms contamination also considered including contamination sensitive deposits lunar polar ice deposits scientific case back contamination multicellular life thought unlikely ruled case forward contamination contamination multicellular life eg lichens unlikely occur robotic missions becomes consideration crewed missions current space missions governed outer space treaty cospar guidelines planetary protection forward contamination prevented primarily sterilizing spacecraft case samplereturn missions aim mission return extraterrestrial samples earth sterilization samples would make much less interest back contamination would prevented mainly containment breaking chain contact planet origin earth would also require quarantine procedures materials anyone comes contact solar system appears hostile life know extraterrestrial life ever discovered extraterrestrial life exists may vulnerable interplanetary contamination foreign microorganisms extremophiles may able survive space travel another planet foreign life could possibly introduced spacecraft earth possible believe poses scientific ethical concerns locations within solar system life might exist today include oceans liquid water beneath icy surface europa enceladus titan surface oceans liquid ethane methane may also liquid water surface ice multiple consequences forward backcontamination planet becomes contaminated earth life might difficult tell whether lifeforms discovered originated came furthermore organic chemicals produced introduced life would confuse sensitive searches biosignatures living ancient native life applies complex biosignatures life planets could common origin earth life since early solar system much exchange material planets could transferred life well might based nucleic acids rna dna majority species isolated well understood characterized cultured labs known dna fragments obtained contaminated planet might difficult distinguish dna extraterrestrial life dna life brought planet exploring species microorganisms earth yet well understood dna sequenced particularly applies unculturable archaea difficult study either depend presence microorganisms slow growing depend conditions yet understood typical habitats microorganisms introduced earth life could contaminate resources value future human missions invasive species could compete native life consume life however experience earth shows species moved one continent another may able compete native life adapted additionally evolutionary processes earth might developed biological pathways different extraterrestrial organisms may able outcompete also possible way around contamination introduced earths biosphere addition science research concerns also attempts raise ethical moral concerns regarding intentional unintentional interplanetary transport enceladus europa show best evidence current habitats mainly due possibility hosting liquid water organic compounds ample evidence suggest mars offered habitable conditions microbial therefore possible microbial life may existed mars although evidence thought many bacterial spores endospores earth transported mars may protected within martian rovers landers shallow surface sense mars may already interplanetarily contaminated certain lichens arctic permafrost able photosynthesize grow absence liquid water simply using humidity atmosphere also highly tolerant uv radiation using melanin specialized chemicals protect although numerous studies point resistance mars conditions separately none considered full range martian surface conditions including temperature pressure atmospheric composition radiation humidity oxidizing regolith others time laboratory simulations show whenever multiple lethal factors combined survival rates plummet studies suggested potential life survive using deliquescing salts similarly lichens use humidity atmosphere mixture salts right organisms may obtain liquid water times high atmospheric humidity salts capturing enough capable supporting life research published july shows irradiated simulated martian uv flux perchlorates become even lethal bacteria bactericide effect even dormant spores lost viability within addition two compounds martian surface iron oxides hydrogen peroxide act synergy irradiated perchlorates cause increase cell death compared cells exposed uv radiation seconds also found abraded silicates quartz basalt lead formation toxic reactive oxygen researchers concluded surface mars lethal vegetative cells renders much surface nearsurface regions research demonstrates presentday surface uninhabitable previously reinforces notion inspect least meters ground ensure levels radiation would relatively cassini spacecraft directly sampled plumes escaping enceladus measured data indicates geysers made primarily salt rich particles oceanlike composition thought originate subsurface ocean liquid saltwater rather moons icy data geyser flythroughs also indicate presence organic chemicals plumes heat scans enceladuss surface also indicate higher temperatures around fissures geysers originate temperatures reaching warmer surrounding surface europa much indirect evidence subsurface ocean models europa affected tidal heating require subsurface layer liquid water order accurately reproduce linear fracturing surface indeed observations galileo spacecraft europas magnetic field interacts jupiters field strengthens case liquid rather solid layer electrically conductive fluid deep within europa would explain observations hubble space telescope december appear show ice plume spouting europas would immensely strengthen case liquid subsurface ocean case enceladus vapour geysers would allow easy sampling liquid unfortunately appears little evidence geysering frequent event europa due lack water space near forward contamination prevented sterilizing space probes sent sensitive areas solar system
