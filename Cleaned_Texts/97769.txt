way diagnose either disorder recent studies use advanced technology like magnetic resonance imaging mri scans try understand biology mood psychotic disorders mris psychiatrists see specific structural differences brains people schizophrenia bipolar disorder differences include volume gray matter neuropathological size differences variations cortical thickness associated cognitive differences tests differences may sometimes seen throughout lifespan diseases often occur soon initial treating bipolar disorder schizophrenia several paths psychiatrists psychologists take similar others however conflicts regarding medical therapeutic treatments considering longterm affects relapse issues treating bipolar disorder schizophrenia appear result interaction evidence numerous family twin studies indicates shared genetic etiology schizophrenia bipolar researchers found combined heritability bipolar disorder schizophrenia approximately environmental factors accounting genetic contributions schizoaffective disorder appear entirely shared contributing schizophrenia bipolar disorder schizophrenia occur approximately population schizoaffective disorder estimated occur less schizophrenia caused combination genetic environmental research illustrates schizophrenia hereditary likely strike carry particular believed susceptible disorder affected something environment according research alteration concentrations specific chemicals brain may also contribute among population affected disorder recorded men susceptible women impacted disorder typically shows symptoms conclusive evidence triggers genetic environmental factors considered probable believed genetic factors contribute role development however everyone family history bipolar disorder develops according research people specific genes likely develop disorder stress example also precipitate onset bipolar patients schizophrenia abnormal brain activities include changes brain structure function abnormal levels neurotransmitters changes may associated abnormal social emotional exact patients schizophrenia lose volume grey matter hemispheres brain specifically left thalamus right caudate furthermore grey matter loss extends cerebrum parahippocampal gyrus hippocampus however gray matter increases temporal parietal lobes along anterior cerebellum region volume increases gray matter within right area contributes cognitive affective perceptual deficits seen mri studies found schizophrenia associated significantly smaller amygdala volume compared healthy includes withdrawal social interaction disorganized speech behavior abnormal motor behaviors disorganized speech include rambling incoherence abruptly switching people schizophrenia may also delusions hallucinations delusions false beliefs supported example believing followed watched possessing special abilities powers hallucinations perception seeing hearing feeling things unlike schizophrenia bipolar disorder little differences gray matter overall difference brain tissue volumes bipolar patients healthy control however research observed patients mood disorders abnormalities including cortical tissue subcortical regions brain left anterior lesions whether cortical subcortical predicts high level depression patients suffering mood disorders left cortical subcortical showed significant relationship severity depression location lesion regard frontal behavioral symptoms patients bipolar disorder include changes mood activity levels behavior bipolar disorder patients may delighted manic episode extremely sad depressive episode may also experience changes level may highly active manic episode extremely inactive depressive episode exhibit behavioral changes may engage behaviors would normally engage manic episode excessive

underresearched change treatments disorders include medication psychotherapy rehabilitation electroconvulsive therapy medication cornerstone treatment bipolar disorder schizophrenia antipsychotic medications commonly prescribed antipsychotics work helping regulate levels certain chemicals brain involved mood moreover moodstabilizers lithium primary medication treatment bipolar furthermore second generation antipsychotics dopamine antagonist serotonin antagonist medications may also used bipolar disorder often combination antidepressant medications typically increase serotonin availability antipsychotics usually second generation also first generation major class medications used treat common side effects antipsychotic medications include dry mouth weight gain drowsiness constipation antipsychotic medications also cause temporary worsening symptoms known psychotherapy treatment patients disorders guide patients thoughts use communication behavioral work means common
