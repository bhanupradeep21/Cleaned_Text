synaptic potential refers potential difference across postsynaptic membrane results action neurotransmitters neuronal words incoming signal neuron receives two forms synaptic potential excitatory inhibitory type potential produced depends postsynaptic receptor specifically changes conductance ion channels post synaptic membrane nature released neurotransmitter excitatory postsynaptic
