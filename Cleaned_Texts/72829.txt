many types sense loss occur due dysfunctional sensation process whether ineffective receptors nerve damage cerebral impairment unlike agnosia impairments due damages prior perception process degrees vision loss vary dramatically although released categorized three tiers normal vision low vision blindness two significant causes vision loss due sensory failures include media opacity optic nerve diseases although hypoxia retinal disease also lead blindness causes vision loss cause varying degrees damage total blindness negligible effect media opacity occurs presence opacities eye tissues fluid distorting andor blocking image prior contact photoreceptor cells vision loss often results despite correctly functioning retinal receptors optic nerve diseases optic neuritis retrobulbar neuritis lead dysfunction afferent nerve pathway signal correctly transmitted retinal photoreceptors partial total vision loss may affect every single area persons life though loss eyesight may occur naturally age trauma eye exposure hazardous conditions may also cause serious condition workers virtually field may risk sustaining eye injuries trauma exposure traumatic eye injury occurs eye sustains form trauma whether penetrating injury laceration nonpenetrating injury impact eye delicate complex organ even slight injury may temporary permanent effect eyesight similarly vision loss hearing loss vary full partial inability detect frequencies sound typically heard members species humans range approximately hz khz db although db correction often allowed primary causes hearing loss due impaired sensory system include longterm exposure environmental noise damage mechanoreceptors responsible receiving sound vibrations well multiple diseases cmv meningitis damage cochlea auditory nerve hearing loss may gradual sudden hearing loss may mild resulting minor difficulties conversation severe complete deafness speed hearing loss occurs may give clues cause hearing loss sudden may trauma problem blood circulation gradual onset suggestive causes aging tumor also associated neurological problems tinnitus vertigo may indicate problem nerves ear brain hearing loss may unilateral bilateral unilateral hearing loss often associated conductive causes trauma acoustic neuromas pain ear associated ear infections trauma obstruction canal anosmia inability perceive odor words lack functioning olfaction many patients may experience unilateral bilateral anosmia temporary loss smell caused blocked nose infection contrast permanent loss smell may caused death olfactory receptor neurons nose brain injury damage olfactory nerve damage brain areas process smell lack sense smell birth usually due genetic factors referred congenital anosmia diagnosis anosmia well degree impairment tested much efficiently effectively ever thanks smell testing kits made available well screening tests use materials clinics would readily many cases congenital anosmia remain unreported undiagnosed since disorder present birth individual may little understanding sense smell hence unaware somatosensory system complex sensory system made number different receptors including thermoreceptors nociceptors mechanoreceptors chemoreceptors also comprises essential processing centres sensory modalities proprioception touch temperature nociception sensory receptors cover skin epithelia skeletal muscles bones joints internal organs cardiovascular system touch also called tactile tactual perception considered one five traditional senses impression touch formed several modalities medicine colloquial term touch usually replaced somatic senses better reflect variety mechanisms involved insensitivity somatosensory stimuli heat cold touch pain commonly result general physical impairment associated paralysis damage spinal cord major nerve fiber may lead termination afferent efferent signals varying areas body causing loss touch loss motor coordination types somatosensory loss include hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy consists ineffective afferent neurons fully functioning efferent neurons essentially motor movement without sensory loss occur due minor nick lesion spinal cord creates problem within neurosystem lead loss smell taste touch sight hearing cases often leads issues touch sometimes people feel touch times light finger tap feels like someone punched medications therapiesexample needed help control symptoms sensory loss deprivation ageusia loss taste particularly inability detect sweetness sourness bitterness saltiness umami meaning pleasantsavory taste sometimes confused anosmia loss sense smell tongue indicate texture differentiate sweet sour bitter salty umami perceived sense taste actually derived smell true ageusia relatively rare compared hypogeusia partial loss taste dysgeusia distortion alteration taste tissue damage nerves support tongue cause ageusia especially damage lingual nerve glossopharyngeal nerve lingual nerve passes taste front twothirds tongue glossopharyngeal nerve passes taste back third tongue lingual nerve also damaged otologic surgery causing feeling metal taste taste loss vary true ageusia complete loss taste hypogeusia partial loss taste dysgeusia distortion alteration taste primary cause ageusia involves damage lingual nerve receives stimuli taste buds front twothirds tongue glossopharyngeal nerve acts similarly back third damage may due neurological disorders bell palsy multiple sclerosis well infectious diseases meningoencephalopathy causes include vitamin b deficiency well taste bud death due acidicspicy foods radiation andor tobacco dual sensory loss simultaneous loss two senses research shown noninstitutionalized older adults dual sensory impairment severely visually impaired older adults additionally suffered significant hearing vision hearing loss interfere interpretation comprehension speech people sensory loss often problems communicating personal situational environmental factors also become prohibitive barriers communication poor communication frequently results poor psychosocial functioning older adults sensory loss often find difficult adapt sensory loss becoming depressed anxious lethargic dissatisfied thus sensory loss inability communicate poor psychosocial functioning reduces quality life httpsenwikipediaorgwikisensoryloss
