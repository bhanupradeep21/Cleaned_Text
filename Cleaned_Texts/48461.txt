soap substitute natural synthetic cleaning product used place soap detergents typically reduce environmental impact health harms provide benefits traditionally soap made animal plant derived fats used humans cleaning purposes several thousand soap harmful human health like natural unnatural surfactant potential cause environmental harm forming surface film impedes diffusion oxygen water added aquatic environment faster many washing agents today laundry dish detergents body wash shampoos technically soap synthetic also often contain compounds found harmful human wildlife health well context soap substitutes refers cleansing products significantly reduce eliminate components potential cause human environmental harm throughout last years many changes made formulas cleansing agents purposes process developing effective substitute detergent formulations completely harmless humans environment ongoing article outlines problems concerns synthetic surfactant based cleaning products since popularization early century well issues addressed technologically legislatively petroleum derived synthetic detergents became popular united states world war due shortages animal plant derived fats worked better cleaning hard water water high concentration dissolved minerals traditional synthetic detergents commonly used traditional soap united many first synthetic detergents made compounds contained branched carbon chains persist environment far longer linear consequently led buildup foamy surfactants water treatment plants well formation large flotillas foam public pressure led us europe ban use alkyl benzene sulphonate abs branched chain surfactants sparked great interest development synthetic detergents biodegrade environmentally friendly byproducts interest led development linear carbon chain compounds commonly used today sodium lauryl sulfate sodium laureth sulfate sodium lauryl ether sulfate surfactants still derived petroleum nonrenewable resource shown cause mild moderate irritation skin biodegrade significantly faster led drastic reduction surfactant pollution environmental friendliness biodegradation byproducts surfactants commonly used today varies united states environmental protection agency epa monitors regulates claims made companies environmental friendliness potential toxicity biodegradation byproducts cleansing continued efforts develop surfactants milder humans pose less risk environment emerging substitute synthetic petroleum derived surfactants sds alkyl polyglycosides derived plant based substances palm oil wheat exposure apgs skin eyes considerably safer petroleum derived studies shown apg use even large quantities pose measurable environmental risk others report research needed confirm true environmental impact although use apg surfactants currently disadvantages relatively high cost production uncertainties potential environmental impact large scale use research development apg surfactants shows promising path creation naturally derived nontoxic environmentally friendly substitute petroleum derived surfactants inexpensive equally effective mass another environmental issue synthetic detergents addition phosphates cleaning products phosphates added detergent tripolyphosphate sodiumpotassium phosphates interact ions solution like calcium magnesium improve washing ability detergent especially washing hard phosphates also shown aid killing germs used however wastewater treatment processes generally remove small fraction phosphate water subsequently large quantities released large quantities phosphates accumulate waterways causes bloom algae subsequent lack oxygen water severely damages aquatic ecosystem process called eutrophication detergents contained phosphate weight increased believed peak use half phosphates released human activity newfound knowledge eutrophication scientific research along occurrence massive algal blooms waterways like lake erie led significant public concern increasing pollution lakes people believed phosphates detergents major led demand methods removal phosphate wastewater first processes designed remove phosphates municipal wastewater environmental purposes implemented time two main processes used phosphates removed wastewater either chemical precipitation biological investment research phosphate removal methods led development modern multiphase biological reactor removal phosphoruscontaining despite technological advances made phosphate removal processes designed use large water treatment facilities advanced monitoring capabilities expert operating technicians municipal wastewater treatment facilities united states tertiary treatment processes needed remove greater phosphate affluent even today remains lack technologies phosphate removal smaller water treatment facilities found nonurban early also significant public pressure united states government ban phosphates detergent cleansing products congressional hearings topic detergent manufacturers explored use compounds potential substitute phosphates nitriletriacetic acid nta gluconic acid citric acid ultimately effective detergent formulations using citric acid polyelectrolytes developed cases even sold comparable substitute phosphate containing detergent formulations either economically cleaning hearings result direct regulation phosphate content detergent federal government part many hearings led clean water act major soap manufactures resisted outright ban phosphates voluntarily agreed lower phosphate concentrations detergents although us federal government made legislation banning phosphates laundry detergent us states independently banned strictly limited soap detergent association today known american cleaning institute aci coalition representing major detergent manufactures voluntarily agreed ban phosphates consumer laundry notably ban include dish procter gamble detergent industry giant aci member remove phosphates brands laundry detergent tide ariel ace bounty many us states municipalities also enacted regulations use phosphates dishwashing time american cleaning institute announced voluntary ban use phosphates dish despite procter gamble sustainability reports report complete removal phosphates fairy dreft brand dish detergent changes enacted european union took different path united states banned use phosphates consumer laundry dish detergents like regulations enacted many us states laws apply use phosphates commercial although number exceptions laws bans allow phosphate use detergent entirely clear degree detergent manufacturers complied voluntary bans significant reduction phosphate use detergent today formulations zeolites polycarboxylates citric acid sodium bicarbonate among effective popular substitutes phosphates detergent cleaning along improved water treatment processes greatly contributed significant reduction amount phosphate detergent waterways efforts resulted overall reduction phosphate concentration us waterways ecosystems effected eutrophication lake erie show drastic also opponents eliminating phosphates widespread claims effective substitute phosphate developed many people report washing phosphate free dish detergents dishes left white film spots opponents bans phosphate dish detergents argue efforts focused developing effective method removal treatment process banning product useful unrivaled substitute additionally arguments phosphate primary cause eutrophication coastal waters therefore phosphorus regulated regions argument based upon reports nitrogen content coastal waters limited nitrogen required algal growth therefore reduction phosphate use would little effect amount algae grow coastal recent efforts increase environmental sustainability laundry dish detergents via addition enzymes break dirt grease adding enzymes significantly reduces amount detergent needed wash subsequently reduces amount surfactant put enzymes designed work lower temperatures also significantly reduce amount energy needed wash example using topload washer switching using hotwarm warmwarm cycle coldcold cycle uses times times less energy respectively technology already implemented companies like tide cold water clean laundry automatic dishwashing detergent poisonous formaldehyde intentionally added also found detergent cleansing per centers disease control prevention cdc exposure formaldehyde low levels inhalation increases one risk cancer epa classifies formaldehyde probable also recent concern potential environmental health risks associated antimicrobial agent called triclosan found many consumer products believed americans exposed research health environmental risks triclosan far complete studies shown dermally absorbed retained body also shown disrupt biological investigations chemical properties triclosan revealed potential accumulate persist fda banned marketing triclosan along several antimicrobial agents antibacterial detergent products manufactures demonstrate ingredients safe longterm daily use effective plain soap water preventing illness spread certain infections us triclosan still used toothpaste mouthwash hand sanitizer surgical european union banned triclosan personal hygiene even though fragrances scented cleaning products shown release volatile potentially harmful compounds air fragrance ingredients required listed artificial fragrances cause sensitivity allergies rashes chemicals known carcinogens endocrine still many compounds potentially damaging human environmental health found many detergent cleaning products product labeled green mean people concerned exposed harmful compounds detergent products best research decide product best using reliable source epa safer choice program provides consumers safety information products like dish laundry hand many small companies offer soaps claimed made traditional way natural fats contain harmful additives rocky mountain soap co dr squatch soap co also companies claim sell natural additive free laundry soaps many soaps still contain additive called borax shown cause irritation skin eyes lungs well reproductive kidney damage swallowed inhaled additionally one ensure soap natural contains potentially harmful additives making soap home many resources instructions making soap home
