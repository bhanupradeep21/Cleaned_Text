gender typing process child becomes aware gender thus behaves accordingly adopting values attributes members sex identify process important childs social personality development largely impacts childs understanding expected social behavior influences social judgments aware ones gender identity child start behave gender roles normally adopted samesex models therefore individual responses become internalized function according appropriate genderrole responses individuals receive social group mold identity becoming feminine masculine thus affect way view world facets process also result atypical development whether child develops shared traits crossgender identities androgyny decision begins identification gender models choose emulate behaviors adopt ultimately shape knowledge identity behave sigmund freud believed children go stages psychosexual development third year childs life genitals thought become active children develop greater understanding sex also develop either castration complex boys penis envy girls boys phallic stage height childhood sexuality oedipus complex occurs boy feels erotic love mother electra complex girls love directed towards father time progresses boy matures slowly able let go rival feelings towards father free love parents time boy learns emulate masculine attributes father subsequently identify girls development freud argued complicated generally males first object interest also mother figure first four years beyond girl remains attached mother however female child learns castration sparks disappointment blames mother lack penis girl gives masturbation turn shifts focus mother father abandoning masturbation girl longer active thus displaying passive nature father assists smoothly transitioning towards feminine path furthermore girls affection towards father also influence emulate mothers feminine qualities eventually adopt gendertyped cognitivedevelopmental theory also closely linked jean piaget analysis agerelated cognitive changes child goes lawrence kohlberg suggested cognition comes action behavior boy boylike things emphasizes importance childs understanding gender roles permanent placement child fully grasp concept genderspecific information become relevant idea gender consistency similar piagets concreteoperational stage represented three stages child able fully grasp gender stable understanding usually ages five seven motivation master orientation socialize allows seek samesexed models learn genderstereotypic schema cognitively organized network associations readily available help guide individuals perception gender schema theory acts guide standard consistent behavior given scenario labels girls weak boys strong classifies stereotypically acceptable actions gender groups therefore theory proposes idea child developed basic knowledge gender behaviors begin construct gender schemas acquired first basic understanding genderspecific roles words child learns contents society things related opposite sex incorporates gender schemas child learns apply appropriate attributes respectively right gender selectively using knowledge conceptualize actions hence categorizing perform various situations molding capabilities match schematic social learning theorists like albert bandura suggest adults provide models children imitate also actively involved influencing childs genderrole identification social learning theory proposes genderidentities genderrole preferences acquired two concepts many opportunities child learn develop understanding gender thus children progresses childhood adolescence already exposed many factors influence ideas attitudes normative social behaviors regarding gender roles social models parents siblings media become extremely important different stages childs development parents parents play vital part childs early life first group people child meets learns information surrounds child home becomes reinforcements desired behaviors male female studies shown immediate hours child born parents already engaged gender stereotypic expectations sons daughters examples painting room pink blue encouragement participate shared sextyped activities offering gender differentiated toys treating opposite sex child differently parentchild interactions long lasting influence child connects certain genderspecific furthermore various evidence suggest certain household differences affecting child raised influence similar different child opposite sex therefore feminine masculine child potentially become instance certain research demonstrates absence father figure boys generally feminine living father demonstrates significance fatherson modeling research reveals boyhood femininity strongly correlated parental reinforcement father mothers desire girl andor approval feminine siblings apart parents children also seek reinforcement older siblings therefore inconsistencies gender behaviors also result children emulating siblings opposite sex siblings influence often effective sibling age advanced child therefore increasing motivation child model brother sister impact older siblings power predictors younger siblings gender role attitudes sextyped personality qualities masculine leisure activities findings suggest girls develop less traditional attitudes boys thus relative stereotypically traditional development older male siblings conscientious towards masculine activities evidently modeled younger siblings feminine moreover older brothers tend stronger influence younger siblings sexual development evidence relationship older brother younger sister fact influence sister become feminine abiding stereotypical gendertyped development girls older biological studies show dizygotic twins opposite sex cotwin gender show sextyped behaviors samesex conversely also develop opposite direction children may try diverge siblings much possible making differences salient however may evident firstborns possibly due birth peers young age children already utilize knowledge different social categories form stereotypes understand men women interaction peer groups often shape peoples behavior fit normative expectations children often group together children samegender belonging group shares gender identity often endorse gender appropriate traits example fact girls expressive traits research also show children often engage play samesex peers exclude others different norm example children want join group allowed engage play samegender peer prior experience activity oppositegender peer prior desire engage play influence child behave like peers later life children starts move away parents role friendship becomes much influential media children learn different gender categories observing various forms media often look gender roles relate books television conversely sources media also stereotypically shape childs understanding gender acceptable behaviors studies examining effects gender stereotyping childrens literature describe often gender views affiliated stereotypes culturally individually constructed childrens literature male characters appear central well less emotional stronger female characters hand worked feelings expression dependent usually adopt roles domesticated moreover characteristics also seen television programing example primetime television shows women receive twice many comments appearance men similarly study investigating cartoon pokémon gender role expresses differences good bad characters jesse james villains story portrayed adopted counterstereotypical portrayal jesse seen aggressive james feminine subtly teaches children nontraditional nonstereotypical gender role behaviors bad furthermore children story difficulty recalling male pokémon revealing imbalance prominence given male depictions male female character roles potentially become unconsciously influential way child constructs gender views expected children develop gendertyped behavioural cues given children often use genderrelated information make judgments society often rewards shared traditional behaviours especially men thus progressed crossgender development lead unwanted criticisms punishment therefore children undergo atypical gender development due genetic environmental contributors drastically alter normal development persons sense selfworth selfesteem feelings acceptance child identifies opposite sex diagnosed gender dysphoria often termed gender identity disorder genetics vs environmental contributors development gender roles associated genetic social factors current biological research suggested testosterone differences affect sexual orientation gender identity personality example girls increased prenatal testosterone levels due congenital adrenal hyperplasia cah show maletyped behaviors average female may cause decrease empathy levels proven higher average women men increase physical aggression typically higher men furthermore multiple twin studies also shown homosexual traits displayed greater congruence monozygotic mz twins dizygotic dz twins displaying genetic studies reveal especially true girls gendertyped similarly studies summarized prevalence crossgender behavior highly heritable trait mz twins display crossgender behaviors dz atypical gender role development may heritable mean independent however environmental effects differ largely different genders society accepting male traits girls playing soccer female traits boys societys negativity typically forces males try stay within stereotypic norms said however male influence accounted environmental factors lead atypical development also stronger boys girls terms atypical gender dysphoria gender dysphoria gender identity disorder gid occurs child identifies opposite sex gid previously known transsexualism occurs person strong desire opposite sex feel uncomfortable body may lead crossdressing desire rid physical characteristic gid accompanied distress often referred dysphoria individual change sex strong rejection sextypical behaviors onset behaviors occur early two four years onset behaviors may occur early two years age children exhibit gid puberty experience become adult instead likely fall category gay lesbian however childs gid persists adulthood likely permanent medical intervention gender dysphoria children controversial topic disapprove diagnosing gid children yet reach however gid children included process revision instead addressing god children likely changed gender identity disorder children gender incongruence controversies gender fifth edition diagnostic statistical manual mental disorders debate around whether sexual gender identity includes gid qualifies mental disorder one notable discussions occurred annual apa meeting darryl b hill phd argued gid considered mental disorder explains due limited amount reliable valid evidence given role parents therapies whether gid meets conditions mental disorder among children furthermore researchers stated diagnosis give recognition individuals discomfort biological sex completely detached gender assignment leaves patients susceptible social changes acceptably feminine masculine lastly provide evidence nonconformity traditional gender behaviours varies cultures life stages genders ethnic androgyny recent studies shown androgynous people able enhance performance crosssituationally alter behaviors appropriately becoming masculine feminine given context according study persons activity preference games interests purely based gendertyped stereotypes making person significantly stereotyped androgynous people selfesteem test individuals given oppositesex activities gendertyped individuals generally felt uncomfortable leading decreased levels selfesteem however androgynous subjects feel discomfort pessimism therefore gender typing often lead specific genderrule stereotypes better facilitate decision making adhere certain benefits well limitations therefore parents foster nontraditional views sex role orientation tend encourage less discriminatory environment child freely engage choices affected gender limitations androgynous children found higher selfesteem higher drawbacks studies shown gender typing fact related genderrelated characteristics congruous persons biological sex rather holds different dimensions several studies also revealed perks androgynous individuals adaptability towards genderspecific situations well flexible attitudes sex roles therefore appear many benefits gendercongruent identity also result limitations gender typing often reinforces stereotypes tends attract negative rigid attitudes towards atypical gender characteristics activities reinforces idea
