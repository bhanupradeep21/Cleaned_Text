transcortical sensory aphasia tsa kind aphasia involves damage specific areas temporal lobe brain resulting symptoms poor auditory comprehension relatively intact repetition fluent speech semantic paraphasias tsa fluent aphasia similar wernickes aphasia receptive aphasia exception strong ability repeat words person may repeat questions rather answer ways tsa similar commonly known language disorder receptive aphasia however transcortical sensory aphasia differs receptive aphasia patients still intact repetition exhibit echolalia compulsive repetition transcortical sensory aphasia diagnosed brain imaging techniques functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri results often difficult interpret therefore clinicians rely language assessments observations determine patient presents characteristics tsa patients diagnosed tsa shown partial recovery speech comprehension beginning speech therapycitation needed speech therapy methods patients subtype aphasia based principles learning neuroplasticity clinical research tsa limited occurs infrequently patients aphasia difficult perform systematic studiescitation needed tsa confused transcortical motor aphasia tma characterized nonfluent speech output good comprehension repetition patients tma impaired writing skills difficulty speaking difficulty maintaining clear thought furthermore tma caused lesions cortical motor areas brain well lesions anterior portion basal ganglia seen patients expressive transcortical sensory aphasia caused lesions inferior left temporal lobe brain located near wernickes area usually due minor hemorrhage contusion temporal lobe infarcts left posterior cerebral artery one function arcuate fasciculus connection wernicke broca area tsa wernicke broca areas spared meaning lesions occur regions brain however since arcuate fasciculus wernickes area brocas area secluded rest brain tsa patients still intact repetition information arcuate fasciculus relayed broca area attach meaning words either spoken heardcitation needed transcortical sensory aphasia characterized fluent aphasia fluency determined direct qualitative observation patient speech determine length spoken phrases usually characterized normal rapid rate normal phrase length rhythm melody articulatory agility normal paragrammatic transcortical sensory aphasia disorder discrepancy phonological processing remains intact lexicalsemantic processing therefore patients repeat complicated phrases however lack comprehension propositional speech disconnect occurs since wernicke area damaged patients tsa therefore repetition spared comprehension affected patients intact repetition repeat simple complex phrases spoken others eg asked patient would like go walk would respond go walk although patients respond appropriately due extent tsa likely comprehend others ask addition problems comprehension transcortical sensory aphasia characterized based deficits naming impaired verbal comprehension result number causes failure speech sound discrimination word recognition auditory working memory syntactic structure building clinically examined patients tsa exhibit poor comprehension verbal based extent comprehension deficiency patients difficulty following simple commands eg close eyes depending extent affected brain area patients able follow simple commands may able comprehend difficult multistep commands eg point ceiling touch left ear right verbal commands require patient cross midline body typically taxing commands involve solely right left side increasing complexity verbal commands comprehension often tested varying grammatical structure command determine whether patient understands different grammatical variations sentence commands involving passive voice possessive eg snake killed mouse one still alive usually result comprehension problems understand simple questionscitation needed naming involves ability recall object patients tsa well patients aphasia subtypes exhibit poor clinical assessment naming involves observer first asking patient name high frequency objects clock door chair tsa patients name common objects ease generally difficulty naming uncommon objects specific parts objects lapel dial patients tsa typically exhibit paraphasia speech fluent often errorprone speech often unintelligible tend use wrong words eg tree instead train uses words senseless incorrect combinationscitation needed sensory aphasia typically diagnosed noninvasive evaluations neurologists neuropsychologists speech pathologists administer oral evaluations determine extent patient comprehension speech initial assessment determine cause linguistic deficiency aphasia diagnosis confirmed testing next address type aphasia severity boston diagnostic aphasia examination specializes determining severity sensory aphasia observation conversational behaviors several modalities perception response observed conjunction subject ability process sensory location brain lesion type aphasia inferred observed symptoms minnesota test differential diagnosis lengthy thorough assessment sensory aphasia pinpoints weaknesses auditory visual senses well reading comprehension differential diagnosis patient course treatment determined treatment planning porch index communicative ability used evaluate prognosis degree recoverycitation needed sensory aphasia diagnosed use imaging techniques differences cognition asymptomatic subjects affected patients observed via functional magnetic resonance imaging however results reveal temporal differences cognition control diagnosed subjects degree progression therapy also surveyed cognition tests monitored fmri many patients progress assessed time via repeated testing corresponding cerebral imaging fmricitation needed due advances modern neuroimaging scientists able gain better understanding language learned comprehended based new data world neuroscience improvements made coping disordercitation needed therapists developing multiple methods improving speech comprehension techniques utilize three general principles maximizing therapy occurrences ensuring behavioral communicative relevance allowing patients focus language tools still available repertoirecitation needed many following treatment techniques used improve auditory comprehension patients aphasia relatively new method language therapy involves coincidence learning coincidence learning focuses simultaneous learning two events stipulates events wired together brain strengthening learning processcitation needed therapists use coincidence learning find improve language correlations coincidences either damaged deleted severe cases aphasia transcortical sensory aphasiacitation needed technique important brain function recovery strengthens associated brain areas remain unaffected brain damage achieved intensive therapy hours order maximize time correlation careful analysis neuroimaging studies correlation developed motor function understanding action verbscitation needed example leg motor areas seen activated words kick leading scientists understand connection motor language processes brain yet another example using relationships related brain purpose rehabilitating speech huge importance aphasia therapy need start practicing soon possiblecitation needed greater recovery occurs patient attempts improve comprehension speaking soon aphasia occurscitation needed inverse relationship length time spent practicing level recoverycitation needed patient pushed limits verbal communication order practice build upon remaining language one effective therapy technique using known language games order encourage verbal one famous example known builders game builder helper must communicate order effectively work project helper must hand builder tools may need requires effective oral communication builder succeeds requesting tools assistant usually using single word utterances hammer nail thus helper hands tool builder game incorporates action language key therapy technique assistant would hand builder requested tool success game occurs builders requests specific ensure successful ultimately regardless therapy plan method improvement speech appear overnight requires significant time investment patient well dedicated speech therapist seeking ensure patient focusing correct speech tasks outside cliniccitation needed furthermore patient must collaborate friends family members free time order maximize efficacy httpsenwikipediaorgwikitranscorticalsensoryaphasia
