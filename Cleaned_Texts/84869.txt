automotive insurance consumers us states new jersey pennsylvania inadvertently ran reallife experiment providing evidence status quo bias early part tort law reform programs citizens offered two

therefore wholly explain status quo potential causes including regret transaction psychological status quo bias also rational route cognitive informational limitations decision outcomes rarely certain utility may bring errors costly others haselton nettle sticking worked past safe option long previous decisions good cognitive limitations status quo bias involve cognitive cost choice decisions susceptible postponement increased alternatives added choice set moreover mental effort needed maintain status quo alternatives would often lesser easier resulting superior choices benefit outweighed decisionmaking cognitive costs consequently maintenance current previous state affairs would regarded easier irrational maintenance status quo bias links confounds many cognitive biases assumption longevity goodness part status quo bias people treat existence prima facie case goodness aesthetic longevity increases status quo bias affects peoples preferences people report preferences likely rather unlikely receive people simply assume little reason deliberation goodness existing longevity corollary existence bias existence good longer existence better thinking resembles quasievolutionary notions survival fittest also augmentation principle attribution psychological inertia another reason used explain bias towards status quo another explanation fear regret making wrong decision ie choose partner think could someone better source needed mere exposure explanation status quo bias existing states encountered frequently nonexistent states perceived true evaluated preferably one way increase liking something repeated exposure loss aversion also leads greater regret action regret experienced decision changes status quo maintains together forces provide advantage status quo people motivated nothing maintain current previous change avoided decision makers stick done past changes status quo typically involve gains losses change good overall consequences gains outweigh losses tendency overemphasize avoidance losses thus favour retaining status quo resulting status quo bias even though choosing status quo may entail forfeiting certain positive consequences represented forfeited gains psychologically given less weight losses would incurred status quo loss aversion explanation status quo bias challenged david gal derek rucker argue evidence loss aversion ie tendency avoid losses pursue gains confounded tendency towards inertia tendency avoid intervention intervene course inertia sense related omission bias except need bias might perfectly rational behavior
