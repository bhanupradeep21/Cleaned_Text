public inquiry carried cause accident launched june colonel john rh robertson looked cause derailment report crash released june quite clearly showed accident caused entirely actions robert wilsdon grossly impaired ability drive safely drinking considerable quantity alcohol booking duty thoroughly critical wilsdons behaviour describing reprehensible disgraceful suspension considered warning sign wilsdons alcoholic tendencies agreed time evidence disprove wilsdons statements would better drink incident also showed wilsdons disregard occurred agreed manager time unwise waiting two months question wilsdon acted appropriately british rail staff came contact wilsdon june supervisor hither green depot staff ramsgate secondman stokes railway club staff ramsgate guard atterbury stationmaster arundell staff margate railman fleming signalman obee rainham intensively questioned gave evidence inquiry regarding state wilsdon agreed wilsdon appeared perfectly fit sober even late unscheduled stop rainham person aware wilsdon already drunk alcohol prior reaching ramsgate secondman stokes considered still fit sober enough drive train none staff criticised failing stop wilsdon duties belief drunk evidence wilsdons fatherinlaw brothers friends confirmed although wilsdon drink heavily could carry alcohol well amount alcohol drank enough make drunkenness visible although report believed wilsdons actions rainham reactions eltham well hall clearly showed beginning suffer effects drunkenness secondman stokes agreed wilsdon get extra drinks ramsgate severely criticised disgraceful behaviour drinking three pints prior taking train back margate agreed stokes young age weak character meant seemed unwilling stop wilsdon going get drink guard atterbury criticised whatsoever behaviour considered unfortunate splashes weak gain wilsdons attention evidence gained wilsdons activities june fairly thorough timeline wilsdons movements tracked confirmed made contact three moments uncertainty later found wilsdons movements day first serious moments fact uncertain occurred wilsdon brothers brothers declaring wilsdon drunk returning pub rainham contrast stokes claimed wilsdon mentioned drinking sherry met ramsgate although robertson could confirm stokes statements considered likely wilsdon drunk owing smell wilsdons breath rainham several hours later whilst explicitly accusing wilsdons brothers lying considered anybody tried hide evidence wilsdons drinking day disservice second uncertain moment occurred stokes stop margate seemingly left station via platform entrance stokes unable recall much occurred margate wilsdon died uncertain occurred period although pub close station considered enough time reach final uncertainty fact body autopsied wilsdons blood alcohol content legal limit driving road vehicle england time imbalance urine alcohol level made likely driver also drinking alcohol within hour death meaning possible drinking controls investigating theory morning accident cab searched three smashed glasses found cabs wreckage two beer bottles stationmaster arundell seen margate confirmed unopened third smashed bottle found later proven medicine bottle unlikely carried alcohol time accident theory wilsdon obtained bottle spirits point stored person drunk point leaving margate later disposed glass throwing window locomotive theory wilsdon either obtained bottle point whilst margate kept one person since left rainham work despite robertson felt severe issue drinking amongst drivers britains railways two accidents one another occurred explicitly due driver drunkenness sixty years prior accident believed combination railway staffs thoughts selfdiscipline drivers behaviour alcohol last recommendation robertson made regarding accident usage telephone sign duty within southern region whilst agreed fairly common occurrence southern region british rail adopted policy certain drivers could granted need book via telephone typically either living far depots whose duties commenced far depots procedure considered practical allowed remain use agreed method wilsdon used casually booked duty benefit gaining two additional hours pay booking instead around actually leave home work appropriate stopped prevented wherever possible issue however brought cannon street station rail crash driver instance believed high cannabis caused bufferstop collision although agreed signalling played part collision later agreed signals around eltham well hall would redesigned slow train round curve rather remain green would mean would less likely driver would caught surprise httpsenwikipediaorgwikielthamwellhallrailcrash
