aluminium triacetate formally named aluminium chemical compound composition standard conditions appears white watersoluble decomposes heating around triacetate hydrolyses mixture basic hydroxide acetate multiple species coexist chemical equilibrium particularly aqueous solutions acetate ion name aluminium acetate commonly used mixed system therapeutic applications antiitching astringent antiseptic overthecounter preparation like burows used treat ear burows solution preparations diluted modified amino acids make palatable use gargles conditions like aphthous ulcers veterinary medicine aluminium triacetates astringency property used treating mortellaro disease hoofed animals aluminium triacetate used mordant agent dyes like alone combination together aluminium aluminium
