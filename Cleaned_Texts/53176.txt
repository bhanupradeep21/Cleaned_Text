highaltitude pulmonary edema hape lifethreatening form noncardiogenic pulmonary edema occurs otherwise healthy people altitudes typically meters however cases also reported metres feet vulnerable subjects classically hape occurs persons normally living low altitude travel altitude meters reentry hape also entity described persons normally live high altitude develop pulmonary edema returning
