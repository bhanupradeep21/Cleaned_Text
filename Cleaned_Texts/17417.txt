interpersonal interaction adaptation theory iat often referred theory theories several theories developed provide frameworks explanations social interactions reviewing examining various communication theories previous empirical evidence pertaining interpersonal communication need address ways individuals adapt one another interactions became apparent importance observing sides dyadic interaction lead development interpersonal adaptation theory theory states individuals enter interactions expectations requirements desires combined establish interaction position interaction begins difference interaction position partys actual behavior determines whether individual adapt continue communication positively judee k burgoon lesa stern leesa dillman published book titled interpersonal adaptation dyadic interaction patterns described findings new theory drew results previous burgoon team examined fifteen previous models considered important conclusions previous empirical research reviewed theories based biological arousal affect approach avoidance compensation reciprocity communication cognitive social norms models conclusion consideration multitude theories models stated theories predict mix patterns rather committing single dominant pattern conflict patterns likely given set theories models derived include limited previous theories combined empirical evidence resulting burgoons colleagues studies birthed interpersonal adaptation previously stated individuals enter interactions combination expectations requirements desires individuals expectations refers anticipate party respond given interaction individuals requirements based biological basic needs lastly individuals desires driven personalized likes dislikes example wife airman comes husband hurt emotionally spending enough time deploys may expect behave defensively need get mad thus spending even less time want understand feelings wifes requirements expectations desires combination biological needs unconsciously presumed performed socially learned behaviors expectations typically based previously experienced social interactions social norms requirements need safety may prominently based biological need example according iat husband responds manner meets wifes requirements desires reciprocate posture mirror behavior interaction theory explains reason reciprocity occurs positive stable interaction preferred given example husband meets wifes expectations behaves unfavorably toward response behavior diverge deescalate situation use compensation common behavioral response occur interaction divergence wife may assume role fire extinguisher find frequently putting fires deescalating negative interactions another example interpersonal adaptation theory may observed international business exchange consider following example united states business meeting culture conducted direct forward opinionated way american business people engaged meetings agenda openly voice ideas opinions contrast japanese business culture formal polite conducted elevated level etiquette events two cultures engage business together japanese businessman may expect american businessman direct opinionated prefer politeness instead american displays tact decorum interaction positive expectation japanese businessman met crosscultural exchange interaction likely adapt convergence review past theories empirical evidence considerations investigations lead burgoon propose nine principles meant guide new interaction adaption model based foundation set proposed nine guiding principles recognized importance observing sides interaction dyadic model interaction adaptation theory created interaction adaptation model derived five key concepts first three five concepts govern behavior requirements expectations desires individuals engaging interaction begin combination three r e interrelated independent fourth concept interaction position product individuals requirements desires expectations burgoon colleagues presented first four concepts mathematical formula format understanding r e ip fifth concept actual behavior used comparison point interaction position understanding ip alternative explanation relationship interaction position actual behavior preferred stable interaction described one ip equal iat predicts point either interactant wants interaction continue stable ip equal one interactants much change ip change minimizes discrepancy gap ip changing ip interactant hopes partner acknowledge adjustment matching behavior thus changing burgoon et al describes follow leader entrainment principle strategic adaptation introduced ickes et al summation interpersonal adaptation theory explains dyadic interaction follows prior individual entering interaction another individual interaction predisposed certain expectations desires requirements interaction position communication begins difference interaction position partys actual behavior determines whether individual adapt continue communication positively httpsenwikipediaorgwikiinterpersonaladaptationtheory
