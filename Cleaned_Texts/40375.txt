infantile fibromatosis appear earlier life however rare cases may onset adulthood treatments available vary depending location main cases infantile fibromatosis reported desmoid fibromatosis main difference two subtypes infantile fibromatosis diffuse infantile fibromatosis spreads still little information regarding diffuse infantile subset fibromatosis much information based case studies severity infantile fibromatosis vary although infantile fibromatosis tumors benign tumors grow large masses damage organs early signs symptoms observed early stage infancy cases observed children two years age infantile fibromatosis categorized lesions firm nontender skin may purple red color appears ulcerated crusted according national organization rare disorders nord infantile myofibromatosis categorized different forms common form infantile myofibromatosis known solitary form mostly found males around head neck trunk areas lesions mostly seen surface skin also extend subcutaneous tissue andor muscle tissue second form infantile myofibromatosis called multicentric form without visceral involvement form commonly found females characterized multiple nodules occur skin subcutaneous tissue andor muscle severe form infantile myofibromatosis however known multicentric form visceral involvement many organs typically involved growth lesion widespread categorized multiple growths skin muscles even internal organs structures bones lung heart gi tract form lifethreatening complications majority cases infantile myofibromatosis im manifests spontaneously without known cause rarely multiple family members present disorder instances mutationsvariants pdgfrb genes identified familial cases im mutation pdgfrb gene discovered families mutations less common date one family im identified mutations caused errors dna replication either germline germline mutations occur sperm egg cells meaning mutation passed future generations somatic mutations occur fertilization time rapid cell division development somatic mutations passed offspring occur germ cells sperm everyone inherits two copies gene one either parent mutations one copy copies gene may result development disease disorder im may present either autosomal dominant recessive disorder autosomal mutations occurring x chromosomes autosomal dominant disorders mutation one gene needed disorder manifest autosomal recessive disorders need genes carry mutation im acts autosomal dominant disorder either germline somatic mutation one copy pdgfrb rare cases im manifests autosomal recessive disorder individuals inherited two mutated although exact mechanism diffuse infantile myofibromatosis known mutations autosomal inherited genes pdgfrb suspected play large role formation disorder genetic mutations passed either dominantly recessively generations thus rarely inherited disease however emphasizes importance genetic testing accurate diagnosis assess risk developing im myofibromatosis refers formation growth rare tumors various parts body including skin bones tumors form abnormal excessive cell growth division lead variety disorders diseases like myofibromatosis diagnosis diffuse infantile myofibromatosis requires microscopic tissue examination well physical examination tumor growth monitored using imaging software like ultrasound mri visualize tumor progression regression useful diagnosing recurrence tumor imaging software allows surgeons pinpoint location tumors extent lesions properly evaluate size order diagnose infantile myofibromatosis tissue sample must removed tumor identified infantile myofibromatosis opposed growths may look similar case study diagnosed diffuse infantile fibromatosis lesion tissue extracted infants thigh saltandpepper looks tissue swelling due

child diagnosed diffuse infantile fibromatosis recommended parents siblings tested well calculated risk conceiving another child disorder known preventable screening potential abnormalities birth help identify tumor formation monitor severity disorder known generational prenatal screening ultrasounds conducted families least one parent carrying pdgfrb variant collecting detailed family history conducting physical examinations ultrasounds genetic sequencing pdgfrb gene tumors also recommended following treatment diffuse infantile fibromatosis individualized depends type treatment appropriate type location size tumor currently guidelines treatment due rare disease treatment individuals disease decided casebycase basis sometimes infantile lesions untreated hopes spontaneous remission means lesion heals without interventions tumor may grow slowly even shrink time require intervention surgery direct treatment option remove tumor prevent organ damage tumor expands grows bigger size lead lifethreatening complications damage organs bones heart lungs cases involving vital organs progression towards vital organs surgery highly recommended avoid complications improve another treatment option chemotherapy recommended surgery viable treatment however study clinical utility vinblastine therapeutic drug monitoring treatment infantile myofibroma patients case series pharmacokinetic parameters vinblastine chemotherapy medication studied among four infants age ranging weeks first dose vinblastine study states chemotherapy dose adjustment infants extremely difficult mainly due lack agespecific pharmacokinetic data sets study needs performed order establish evidencebased dosing guidelines affected children surgery could performed reason progression rapid successfully treated combination methotrexate relatively good prognosis solitary multicentric myofibromatosis without visceral involvement due spontaneous regression tumors generally occurs within months multicentric myofibromatosis visceral involvement multiple organs affected resulting high rate mortality published cohorts children multicentric myofibromatosis visceral involvement reported mortality rates high rates mostly attributed cardiopulmonary gastrointestinal disorder affects less children united infantile fibromatosis found affect babies commonly age years however statistics diffused infantile fibromatosis unknown due rare nature much known history first discovery infantile myofibromatosis however speculated first identified williams schrum dr p stout official name infantile myofibromatosis given dr enzinger dr since case studies done various researchers unclear specific populations affected disorder misdiagnosed prenatal birth infantile myofibromatosis however reported affect males females known affect variety ethnicities geographical females likely multicentric forms disease affect multiple internal organs include several lesions skin muscle infantile myofibromatosis extremely rare disease majority published literature based small cohorts case need systematic reviews help physicians clinical decisionmaking treating tumor regression common characteristic im many physicians take wait see approach actively treating im chemotherapy method comes question im infiltrates organ systems becoming lifethreatening treatment chemotherapy shown effective promoting tumor regression comes risk toxicities treatment tyrosine kinase inhibitor tki may possibility individuals mutation results point mutation pdgfrb gene tkis imatinib pose less potential toxicities chemotherapy treatment still possibility stunted therefore systematic review focusing prevalence germline somatic mutation pdgfrb gene may helpful evaluating genetics play role disease severity response variable additionally lack knowledge predict tumor recurrence adolescence adulthood small number individuals shown tumor recurrence times hormonal changes puberty furthermore case reports suggested improvement imaging diagnosis especially considering mass sizes critical accurate mri detection tumors lack accuracy depth imaging led poor prognosis httpsenwikipediaorgwikidiffuseinfantilefibromatosis
