central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumor often abbreviated pnet supratentorial pnet one types embryonal central nervous system tumors medulloblastoma atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor considered embryonal tumor arises cells partially differentiated still undifferentiated cells usually neuroepithelial stem cells destined turn glia occur anywhere within spinal cord cerebrum multiple sites origins high probability metastasis cerebrospinal fluid pnet five subtypes tumors neuroblastoma ganglioneuroblastoma medulloepithelioma ependymoblastoma otherwise specified similar medulloblastoma regarding histology different regarding genetic factors tumor site rare disease occurring mostly among accounting childhood brain symptoms involve emotional visual motor speech magnetic resonance imaging mri computed tomography ct used diagnose even though universal treatment plan hasnt stablished yet common strategies involve chemotherapy radiotherapy individuals older
