male breast cancer mbc cancer males originates breasts males account less new breast cancers new cases diagnosed worldwide every incidence rates males vs females respectively per personyears

female breast cancer often rests small retrospective singlecenter consequently majority strategies evaluating treating mbc adopted used female breast however mbc appears features warrant clinical approaches differing female breast features male breast cancers differ females include variations presentations associations diseases associations nonmedical predisposing conditions expressions key

lymph node biopsy preferred broad dissection armpit lymph nodes detecting local lymph node based findings examinations tumor considered cancerous defined based clinical stage typically using tnm staging system ie scoring tumor size number armpit lymph nodes near primary tumor metastases metastases distant tissues b grade using nottingham system grades indicate tumor cells look progressively

hormonal therapy andor immunotherapy ie drugs activating suppressing individuals immune following lists medically important breast cancer features differ males due mens smaller breast sizes breast tumors may become palpable cause symptoms earlier females nonetheless males tend lack awareness breast cancer may gynecomastia masking breast tumors may delay seeking medical attention differences

survivors atomic bomb attacks japan increased rates developing breast cancer proportion increasing levels radiation exposure men history high alcohol consumption men occupations entailing longterm exposure high temperatures eg blast furnaces steel works rolling mills ie mills processing metals petrol emissions exhaust emissions studies increased risks developing breast high alcohol consumption also risk factor breast cancer studies reported lower rates breast cancer ie men employment history involving high levels physical activity higher rates breast cancer men employment history involving
