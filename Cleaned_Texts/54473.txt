rank theory evolutionary theory depression developed anthony stevens john price proposes depression promotes survival depression adaptive response losing status rank losing confidence ability regain adaptive function depression change behaviour promote survival someone defeated according rank theory depression naturally selected allow us accept subordinate role function depressive adaptation prevent loser suffering defeat conflict face defeat behavioural process swings action causes individual cease competing reduce ambitions process involuntary results loss energy depressed mood sleep disturbance poor appetite loss confidence typical characteristics depression outward symptoms depression facial expressions constant crying etc signal others loser fit compete also discourage others attempting restore losers acceptance lower rank would serve stabilise ancestral human community promoting survival individual individuals genes community affording protection human groups retaining access resources mates adaptive function accepting lower rank twofold first ensures loser truly yields attempt make comeback second loser reassures winner yielding truly taken place conflict ends damage loser social harmony rank theory depression initially known social competition based ethological theories signalling order avoid injury animals perform appeasement displays demonstrate subordination lack desire engage additionally rank theory attempts explain link low socioeconomic status depression psychosocial john price formulated rank theory noticing monkeys became uncommunicative following competitive loss eg relating food allies mates proposed humans similarly submit competitive situations induce submitting opponent losers allow new hierarchy form strengthening social depression therefore ritualistic behaviour fulfils adaptive loser able escape physical injury signalling longer adaptive strategy called involuntary defeat strategy clarify losers may demonstrate submissiveness victors using strategies linked depression although historically involuntary defeat strategy may also prevented loss material resources eg food shelter evolutionary psychologists argue explanation still applicable modern societies humans compete resources unlike evolutionary explanations depression rank theory able explain depression functioning substitute physical damage incapacitation prevents loser posing threat competitor challenged moreover rank theory aligns becks cognitive triad proposes depressed individuals suffer cognitive distortions result pessimistic beliefs rank theory explains pessimism arguing losers low expectations abilities less likely engage competition pessimistic explanation also accounts common symptoms eg apathy loss interest anhedonia arguing evolved form psychologists paul gilbert sought explain differences depressive states following competition major depression gilbert suggested depression resulting involuntary defeat strategy shortterm condition becomes serious due external events eg victor ignores attempt reconciliation internal events eg excessive rank theorists argue depression like vomiting become maladaptive defence mechanism designed shortterm overused see fig one factor may make ids develop major depression arrested flight individuals unable flee dangerous entrapment may intensify depressive symptoms making condition deescalation used loser overexaggerated may result symptoms social anxiety excessively low selfesteem another factor may explain certain individuals prone major depression degree childhood attachment security children insecure attachments instance due raised abusive household may experienced frequent triggering involuntary defence results overly sensitive ids requires significantly less stimulation engage submissive behaviours unlike securely attached children whose ids functions adaptively allowing accept defeat insecurely attached children back early lose confidence ability win competitions therefore may prone developing longterm rank theorists also suggested explanation account high depression rates competition social approval particularly salient teenage peer adolescents may emphasise social comparison rank theorists propose children insecure enter highly socially competitive dynamic adolescence feeling submissive craving dominant due fixating social rank adolescents sensitive social competition likely overuse ids resulting higher likelihood although intended become new school rank theorists proposed changes existing therapeutic interventions depression cognitive behavioral therapy psychodynamic treatment largest limitation evolutionary explanations depression include rank theory lack theories provide reasonably parsimonious grounded empirical research severely affects realworld application rank theory suggests depression functions inhibit aggression stimulate submissive behaviours one criticism rank theorys inability account higher levels anger found depressed individuals however rank theorists weakened argument arguing hostility depressed individuals redirected towards lowerranking individuals social hierarchy eg children objects eg another criticism rank theory may account depressed individuals socially powerful exert manipulation others despite supposedly engaging submissive combat criticism rank theorists suggested depressed individuals use manipulation supporters order switch support agonistic ie intended help individual win competition boasting nurturing ie accepting individual lost also backing individuals top hierarchies may suffer depression low end hierarchy exhibit depressive symptoms critics rank theory also argued mismatch rank mood weakens explanation however argument may oversimplify rank theory take account social comparison element rank theory suggests dissatisfaction ones rank may due comparison peers achieved higher social ranks moreover rank theorists argued stress low rank may also depend factors lowerrank individuals attempting usurp higherrank individuals bullying httpsenwikipediaorgwikiranktheoryofdepression
