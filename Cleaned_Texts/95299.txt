worker policing behavior seen colonies social hymenopterans ants bees wasps whereby worker females eat remove eggs laid workers rather laid queen worker policing ensures offspring queen predominate group certain species bees ants wasps workers queen may also act aggressively towards fertile workers worker policing suggested form coercion promote evolution altruistic behavior eusocial insect discuss proposed mechanisms recognition workerlaid eggs active reproductive workers include marker hydrocarbons surface queenlaid eggs cuticle hydrocarbons reproductive workers recognition rare cases workerlaid eggs carry mimicked queen hydrocarbons escape policing condition known anarchic forms policing require presence queen also occurs species ants establish dominance hierarchy reproductive female workers topranking individuals many social insect communities sex determined haplodiploidy haploid male drones develop unfertilized eggs diploid females develop fertilized eggs queens colony may mate one several drones many species ants bees wasps workers retain functional ovaries thus produce male offspring average queen shares half genes sons shares quarter genes sons fertile female workers therefore queens best interests sons raised sons workers contrast worker shares half genes sons quarter brothers furthermore workers colonies single oncemated queen related nephews three eighths higher related brothers results conflict queen worker females odds proportion male offspring contribute since side tries maximize reproductive queens favor production sons workers favor

eaten repeatedly attacked workers mechanism egg removal ensures queens sons experiments confirming role kin selection worker policing demonstrate effects multiple matings lead lower average relatedness workers queens social wasp dolichovespula saxonica mate singly multiply researchers study wasps observed strong positive correlation worker relatedness male production controlling absolute number eggs laid scientists conclude queens multiple matings favor mutual worker although early theories worker policing focused kin selection component evidence honey bees suggests altruism sometimes enforced fewer workers reproduce policing effectiveness rises policing effectiveness decreases increasing relatedness except colonies queen suggests worker policing social sanction imposed selfish mechanisms suggested egg discrimination worker policing include queen hydrocarbons fertile worker hydrocarbons nestmate recognition study carpenter ant camponotus floridanus found special surface hydrocarbon queenlaid eggs workers colony queens eggs refrained egglaying whereas groups queenlaid eggs showed worker reproduction thus hydrocarbon could act signal alert workers halt reproduction generally however authors concluded hydrocarbons fertility signal still unknown decision restrain reproduction occurs minimum threshold fertility queen needed reduce worker study cuticle hydrocarbons also applied reproductive workers colonies ponerine ant platythyrea punctata presence chcs new reproductive workers triggered aggressive behavior rest colony often new old reproductive workers specifically old reproductive workers rubbed marker hydrocarbon antennae new females identifying rivals targets contrast ant species worker policing ant formica fusca appears incorporate nestmate recognition addition queen hydrocarbons workers displayed higher levels aggression toward nonnest mates also removed queenlaid eggs thus queen hydrocarbons contributor discrimination worker policing evolved convergently several social insect species following cases examples one first examples worker policing discovered honey bee apis mellifera worker policing prevalent honey bee colonies worker reproduction minimal worker policing occurs via eggeating apis mellifera many hives activation ovaries fertile females diminished suggesting disincentives laying workers colonies dwarf honey bee apis florea also reported engage oophagy using microsatellite analysis researchers concluded mature drones nonqueen alleles colonies investigated thus even though workers activated ovaries capable laying eggs worker policing ensured functional sterility otherwise fertile higher percentage female workers bee species apis cerana reported activate ovaries apis mellifera apis florea queens removed workers activated ovaries subsequent days however policing workers continued eat workerlaid eggs suggesting mechanism policing species involve direct intervention observation apis species engage polyandry led researchers conclude worker policing plesiomorphic apis worker policing also occurs primitively eusocial bumblebees bombus colonies ponerine ant pachycondyla inversa workers eat eggs fertile female workers known gamergates display aggressive behavior towards egglaying colonies ant gnamptogenys menadensis workers sometimes mate lay eggs others remain virgins lay trophic eggs used food display policing workers immobilize female reproductive workers biting limbs reported victims die treatment attacking workers may also drag offending workers outside colony since workers lay male female eggs worker policing could favored cost community ant species aphaenogaster smythiesi japonica also display evidence policing researchers separated reunited workers colonies queens workers queencontaining colonies attacked workers activated ovaries queenless queenless ant streblognathus peetersi policing helps select gamergates workers immobilize gamergates lowered fertility enabling highranking workers take new ponerine ant harpegnathos saltator worker policing prevents number reproductive workers becoming excessive species gamergates lay eggs rarely carry tasks many would reduce colonys efficiency gamergate numbers rather stable infertile workers target newly ovipositing workers jumping holding efficiently inhibits laying eggs within weeks revert subordinate infertile workers however new ovipositing workers attain gamergates level ovarian activity infertile policing workers ignore signal used policing workers consists cuticle hydrocarbons transmitted direct contact rather pheromone detected olfaction similarly inhibition ovipositing workers achieved direct physical aggression policing workers pheromone produced queens tree wasp dolichovespula sylvestris also displays worker policing eggeating aggression reported wasp communities queen also engages policing similar behavior observed closely related species dolichovespula colonies paper wasp polistes chinensis antennalis workers lay quarter male eggs colony number eggs survived hatching however minimal compared number produced queen analysis microsatellite markers showed queens workers contributed policing worker queenlaid eggs even monogynous monandrous common wasp vespula vulgaris engages worker policing known significant number workers active ovaries however studies researchers suggested relatedness may key factor development worker policing rather hypothesized worker policing selected due conflict suppression test worker policing researchers examined removal workerlaid eggs vespula rufa wasp low paternity testing conditions worker policing efficient drones appeared workerlaid european hornet vespa crabro previously thought reproductive pheromone control queen thus explaining females reproduce even though capable experiments foster showed workers instead regulating sterility thus instead exhibiting worker policing worker capable reproducing colony whole efficient organized workers allow queen lay synoeca cyanea also engage worker policing times queen repopulation needed prevent females laying eggs aggressive behavior rarely female worker bees lay eggs escape worker policing process known anarchic syndrome female reproductive workers colonies activate ovaries even presence queen worker eggs allowed mimic queen hydrocarbons thus female workers maximize reproductive fitness expense colony anarchic syndrome example selection working opposite directions individual group temnothorax unifasciatus myrmicinid ant shown collective worker policing however queen removed rank order reproduction appears top ranking reproductives display aggression towards lowerorder female workers thus reductions egg laying created dominance hierarchies individuals act benefit colony instead opting increase fitness laying eggs reducing contributions type policy common dolichovespula norwegica wasps despite related workers sons workerlaid eggs consumed thelytokous ant platythyrea punctata colonies clonal therefore workers equally related genetically worker policing expected genetic conflict however one would expect severe effects condition colony reproductive workers left unchecked example time spent individual reproduction would predicted detract care queens offspring studies ants workers actually display worker policing evidenced increased aggression towards reproductive
