complementary levels analysis analysis one level alone computational level analysis identifies information processing system eg problems solve overcome similarly things algorithmicrepresentational level analysis identifies information processing system performs computations specifically representations used processes employed build manipulate representations physical level analysis identifies

unlimited number levels three primary ones levels analysis help understand one force political power affects another generally power concept collects analysis together example struggle power may cause

world war prevent wars future however system wide institution always mean harmony among nations seen world war ii cause world war ii seen failure systemic institution led new institutions united nations carry reformed legacy league global level factors much like systemic level factors however core difference global factors necessarily created states whereas systemic factors global factors outcome individuals interest groups states nonstate actors even natural conditions however traced actions one state even group states example internet shape policy formed social media forums idea
