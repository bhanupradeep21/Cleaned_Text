within skull may stretch tear small bridging veins much common epidural hemorrhages subdural hemorrhages generally result shearing injuries due various rotational linear claims occur cases shaken baby syndrome although scientific evidence also commonly seen elderly people alcohol use disorder evidence cerebral cerebral atrophy increases length bridging veins traverse two meningeal layers thus increasing likelihood shearing forces causing also common patients anticoagulants antiplatelet medications warfarin aspirin people medications subdural hematoma relatively minor traumatic event another cause reduction cerebrospinal fluid pressure reduce pressure subarachnoid space pulling arachnoid away dura mater leading rupture blood factors increasing risk subdural hematoma include young old age brain shrinks age subdural space enlarges veins traverse space must cover wider distance making vulnerable tears elderly also brittle veins making chronic subdural bleeds infants larger subdural spaces predisposed subdural bleeds young often claimed subdural hematoma common finding shaken baby syndrome although science support juveniles arachnoid cyst risk factor subdural risk factors include taking blood thinners anticoagulants longterm excessive alcohol consumption dementia cerebrospinal fluid acute subdural hematoma usually caused external trauma creates tension wall bridging vein passes arachnoid dural layers brains subdural space circumferential arrangement collagen surrounding vein makes susceptible tearingcitation needed intracerebral hemorrhage ruptured cortical vessels blood vessels surface brain also cause subdural hematoma cases blood usually accumulates two layers dura mater cause ischemic brain damage two mechanisms one pressure cortical blood

brain cell subdural hematomas grow continually larger result pressure place brain intracranial pressure rises blood squeezed dural venous sinuses raising dural venous pressure resulting bleeding ruptured bridging veins stop growing pressure hematoma equalizes intracranial pressure space expansion chronic subdural hematomas blood accumulates dural space result damage dural border resulting inflammation leads new membrane formation fibrosis produces fragile leaky blood vessels angiogenesis permitting leakage red blood cells white blood cells plasma hematoma cavity traumatic tearing arachnoid mater also causes leakage cerebrospinal fluid hematoma cavity increasing size hematoma time excessive fibrinolysis also causes continuous bleedingcitation needed proinflammatory mediators
