bobo doll experiment experiments collective name series experiments performed psychologist albert bandura test social learning theory studied childrens behaviour watching adult model act aggressively towards bobo doll notable variation experiment measured childrens behavior seeing adult model rewarded punished experience consequence physically abusing bobo social learning theory proposes people learn largely observation imitation modelling bobo doll experiment provides template understanding various aspects human behavioral demonstrates people learn rewarded punished also learn watching someone else rewarded punished studies practical implications providing evidence children influenced watching violent participants experiments consisted children stanford university nursery school ages months experiments third children exposed aggressive model another third exposed nonaggressive model rest participants formed control group experiment child exposed scenario individually avoid influenced distracted classmates first part experiment involved bringing child adult model playroom playroom child seated one corner filled appealing activities stickers stamps adult model sitting another corner toy set mallet inflatable bobo doll leaving room experimenter explained child toys adult corner adult play aggressive model scenario adult would begin play bobo doll start show aggressive behaviour towards doll examples aggressive behaviour include hitting punching bobo doll using toy mallet hit bobo doll face aggressive model would also verbally assault bobo doll yelling sock hit kick throw air pow minutes experimenter returned room dismissed adult model took child another playroom nonaggressive adult model simply played toys entire period situation model ignored bobo doll entirely child taken room following experiment stage performed child experimenter another room filled interesting toys trucks dolls spinning top child invited play minutes playtime child told longer allowed play toys reserved children done build frustration told could instead play toys experimental room aggressive nonaggressive toys child allowed play minutes experimental room experimenter evaluated childs play first measure recorded based physical aggression punching kicking sitting bobo doll hitting mallet tossing around room second measure recorded verbal aggression judges counted time children imitated aggressive adult model recorded results third measure number times mallet used display forms aggression hitting doll final measure included modes aggression shown child directly imitating role models bandura found children exposed aggressive model likely pursue physically aggressive behaviour exposed aggressive results concerning gender differences strongly satisfied banduras prediction samesex models influence children results also showed boys exhibited aggression exposed aggressive male models aggressive female models results girls show similar findings less drastic bandura also found children exposed aggressive model likely act verbally aggressive ways exposed aggressive model number imitative verbal aggressions exhibited boys much additionally results indicated boys girls observed nonaggressive model exhibited much less nonimitative aggression control group lastly evidence demonstrates males tend aggressive females instances aggression tallied males exhibited aggressive instances compared aggressive instances exhibited study albert bandura wanted vary original study seeing differences imitated aggressive behaviour witnessing filmed cartoon model compared live also wished see children watching aggressive behaviour filmed cartoon model would experience cathartic effect words would experience release aggressive emotions seeing model carrying aggressive experiment children girls boys stanford university nursery divided three groups first group watched live model become aggressive towards bobo doll second group watched movie version human model becoming aggressive toward bobo doll third group watched cartoon version cat becoming aggressive towards bobo doll child watched aggressive acts individually control group biases data original study used control group children view model exposed respective models three groups children placed individually room experimenter exposed mildly frustrating situation elicit aggression next children allowed play freely adjoining room full toys including bobo doll weapons models used researchers observed children noted interaction bobo study results show compared control group three groups showed similar increases aggressive behaviour bandura concluded children would imitate aggressive behaviour witness model regardless presented also found watching aggressive behaviour cause cathartic effect results study particular significance contributions controversial topic whether violent media influence children become aggressive study albert bandura wanted see childrens learned behaviour would influenced vicarious reinforcement act imitating behaviour observed another person witnessing person reinforced said experiment children boys girls divided one three groups first group would witness model display aggressive behaviours toward bobo doll followed researcher praising model behaviour rewarding candy second group would witness scripted scenario aggressive behaviours model instead reprimanded actions hit rolled wooden golf club third group served control group model neither rewarded punished displayed behaviour children would watch individually control group biases afterwards child would placed individually room structured similarly one saw minutes experimenters would score children based number variation aggressive behaviours acted experiment would repeated second time time children would incentivized various rewards including candy juice stickers mimic behaviour study showed little difference reward control groups however punishment group displayed much less aggressive behavior especially girls three groups personal incentives substantially increased aggressive behavior boys girls analysis study shows reinforcement punishment influence learned aggressive behavior outward expression findings experiments support principles social learning theory proposed bandura research found behavior influenced observing behavior others imitating central theory idea inclination imitate behavior increases presence admirable model models crucial component learning new behaviors achieving change across different institutions drive individuals shape behavior actions unlike behaviorism learning directly influenced reinforcement punishment social learning theory suggests watching others rewarded punished indirectly influence known vicarious reinforcement model receives validation exhibiting certain behaviors someone looks model likelier imitate behaviors receive validation role vicarious reinforcement shown bobo doll experiment demonstrates behavior adults easily influences experiment adults received praise aggressive behavior result likelihood children striking doll increased however adults punished behaving aggressively towards doll children stopped hitting doll bobo doll experiment enhanced peoples understanding factors issues contribute httpsenwikipediaorgwikibobodollexperiment
