victor ambros regulates translation target messenger rnas via imperfect basepairing targets discovered second mirna conserved across animal phylogeny including humans mirna discoveries revealed new world rna regulation unprecedented small size scale mechanism regulation ruvkun also discovered many features insulinlike signaling regulation aging metabolism elected member american philosophical society ruvkun obtained undergraduate degree university california berkeley phd work done harvard university laboratory frederick ausubel investigated bacterial nitrogen fixation genes ruvkun completed postdoctoral studies robert horvitz massachusetts institute technology mit walter gilbert ruvkuns research revealed mirna nucleotide regulatory rna discovered victor ambros lab regulates target mrna forming imperfect rna duplexes downregulate translation first indication key regulatory element gene recognized gene product untranslated region came analysis gainoffunction mutations showed deletions conserved elements untranslated region deletion elements relieves normal late stagespecific repression protein production necessary repression normal untranslated key breakthrough ambros lab discovered encodes small rna product defining nucleotide mirnas ambros ruvkun compared sequence mirna untranslated region discovered rna base pairs conserved bulges loops untranslated region target mrna gain function mutations delete complementary sites relieve normal repression translation addition showed untranslated region could confer translational repression unrelated mrnas creating chimeric mrnas ruvkun reported journal cell regulation issue cell victor ambros described regulatory product small papers revealed new world rna regulation unprecedented small size scale mechanism together research recognized first description micrornas mechanism partially basepaired mirnamrna duplexes inhibit ruvkun lab reported identification second c elegans microrna like first microrna regulates translation target gene case via imperfect base pairing untranslated region indication mirna regulation via utr complementarity may common feature likely micrornas generality microrna regulation animals established ruvkun lab later reported sequence regulation microrna conserved across animal phylogeny including presently thousands mirnas discovered pointing world gene regulation size regime sirnas nucleotide size discovered hamilton baulcombe fields rnai mirnas suddenly converged seemed likely similarly sized mirnas sirnas would use similar mechanisms collaborative effort mello ruvkun labs showed first known components rna interference paralogs dicer piwi proteins used mirnas ruvkuns lab identified many identified mirnas mammalian discovered many new proteincofactors mirna ruvkuns laboratory also discovered insulinlike signaling pathway controls c elegans metabolism longevity showed developmental arrest program mediated mutations increase c elegans longevity ruvkun lab established genes constitute insulin like receptor downstream phosphatidylinositol kinase couple gene product highly conserved forkhead transcription factor homologues genes implicated regulation human findings also important diabetes since mammalian orthologs referred foxo transcription factors also regulated insulin ruvkun lab used full genome rnai libraries
