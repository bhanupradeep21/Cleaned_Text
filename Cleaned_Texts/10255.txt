kinyang extinct genus osteolaemine crocodile early middle miocene kenya two species currently known k mabokoensis lake victoria basin k tchernovi lake victoria lake turkana basin kinyang exceptionally broad robust skull much wider living crocodile species might allowed attack kill prey size even bigger kinyang notably larger contemporary relative brochuchus precise reasons extinction kinyang known

superficially short rostrum well inflated premaxillae although rostrum appears short first glance proportionally little shorter seen similarly sized nile crocodiles shortened appearance instead result incredibly wide rostrum broader modern crocodile kinyang shows width length ratio back skull level fifth maxillary tooth compared nile crocodiles show ratios respective areas palatine process unique among crocodiles margins converging towards front bone flattened compared modern crocodiles kinyang also much simpler occlusion teeth crocodylids extensive occlusal pits located first sixth maxillary tooth kinyang pits found six eighth tooth maxilla pattern typically observed species transitioning ancestral overbite interlocking dentition pattern seen modern taxa kinyang among known examples crocodylid returning interlocking dentition partial overbite another instance found australian mekosuchines overall number maxillary teeth observed fossils ranges twelve thirteen teeth fewer seen modern crocodylids fourteen consistent voay osteolaemus although tooth count may vary crocodylids usually minor difference one tooth position less additionally instances difference typically caused lack tooth one toothrows making tooth count asymmetrical due brochu team argue despite ranging twelve thirteen teeth kinyang would fourteen maxillary alveoli generally larger tightly packed crocodylids especially brochuchus widely spaced small teeth species quadratojugal extends far towards rear end infratemporal fenestra largely blocking quadrate bone contributing margin strange feature found across multiple especially closely related crocodile species including paleoafrican species crocodylus crocodylus checchiai osteolaemus new guinea crocodile borneo crocodile one feature unique kinyang fact lateral collateral ligament located towards back mandible additionally divided function serves however noted type description although subtle differences kinyang mabokoensis kinyang tchernovi consistently observed notably type species wider supratemporal fenestrae k tchernovi fenestrae elongated although proportions fenestrae may change growth brochu colleagues argue deciding

environment inhabited various water birds storks pelicans flamingos cormorants well great abundance indetermined crocodile teeth like brochuchus kinyang also known riparian woodlands mixed open skull kinyang shows several unique traits proportions found modern crocodile suggesting highly specialized animal proper modern analog compare however clues taken overall skull shape according drumheller wilberg broadsnouted crocodiles split species vshaped snouts generalists feeding diverse prey items size species wider less triangular snouts later group kinyang would belong generalist feeders preying animals big even bigger presence kinyang lake victoria lake turkana supports idea crocodilian fauna east africa relatively uniform across kenya although euthecodon entirely match hypothesis appears around lake turkana later miocene brochu argues lack early miocene remains likely caused poor sampling kinyang may also play key role understanding faunal turnover occurred miocene distinct shift observed comparing early middle miocene crocodile fauna consisting osteolaemines brochuchus kinyang fauna later miocene preserving mecistops crocodylus shows clear change osteolaemines possible crocodylines later taking ecological niche former consistently present crocodilians longsnouted forms euthecodon eogavialis miocene specimens mecistops possess longirostrine proportions modern exact reasons faunal turnover however entirely understood one hypothesis suggests change dominant crocodile group started aridification spread open grassland opposed woodland accelerated seasonal rainfall change grasses changes clearly observed local mammal fauna went dominated browsers fauna adapted towards grazing modern osteolaemus mecistops primarily known lowland forests rain forests also occur seasonal wetlands riparian woodlands assuming extant extinct osteolaemines share similar habitat preferences possible extinction kinyang may tied disappearance forests allowed resilient crocodylines take mecistops may represent issue hypothesis however known much younger deposits around lake turkana despite sharing similar environmental preferences dwarf crocodiles common late miocene crocodiles region presence match idea habitat loss caused disappearance kinyang osteolaemines besides connection vegetation prey well habitat change plant life could also heavily affected nesting habits east african crocodiles slendersnouted crocodiles dwarf crocodiles show high degrees specialization comes nest building creating mounds largely consist plant material protect warm eggs exact shape size nests depends various factors including available vegetation water levels additionally differs two genera areas coexist dwarf crocodiles prefer nest swamp environments slendersnouted crocodiles nest close riverbanks accordingly shift vegetation environment could much impacted nesting habitats miocene osteolaemines found east africa caused replaced species better adapted making nests pits sediment crocodylus gharials mecistops less dependent wetlands create nests may also explain survived longer around lake however connection aridification east africa end miocene climatic optimum disappearance
