benthic bottomdwellers although important food fish humans great significance prey species commercially important fish cod haddock sea bass flatfish several gobiids also interest aquarium fish

habitats europe gobies generally bottomdwellers although many live burrows species eg genus glossogobius true coral reefs species gobiids constitute total number fishes species family gobiidae underwent major revision edition fishes world revision gobiidae contained six subfamilies gobiinae benthophilinae amblyopinae gobionellinae oxudercinae sicydiinae revision retained first two subfamilies removed four separate family oxudercidae addition species formerly placed families kraemeriidae microdesmidae ptereleotridae schindleriidae added revised gobiidae although subfamilies two formerly recognised subfamilies species retained gobiidae edition fishes members benthophilinae endemic pontocaspian region including marmara black azov caspian aral representatives subfamily fused pelvic fins elongated dorsal anal distinguished closely related subfamily gobiinae absence swimbladder adults location uppermost rays pectoral fins within fin members include tadpole gobies monkey gobies bighead gobies members gobiinae known true gobies widespread diverse subfamilies formerly recognised gobiidae containing around species genera gobiids primarily fish shallow marine habitats including tide pools coral reefs seagrass meadows also numerous brackish water estuarine habitats including lower reaches rivers mangrove swamps salt marshes gobiid species unknown exactly low hundreds also fully adapted freshwater environments include round goby neogobius melanostomus australian desert goby chlamydogobius eremius european freshwater goby padogobius bonelli gobies feed small invertebrates although larger species eat fish eat planktonic algae species gobiidae attach eggs substrate vegetation coral rock surface lay five thousand eggs depending species fertilizing eggs male guards eggs predators keep free detritus male fans eggs thereby providing oxygen female maintains burrow eggs hatch days larvae born transparent develop coloration spreading find suitable habitat larvae many freshwater gobiid species carried downstream brackish waters even sea return fresh water weeks months gobiids warmer waters reach adulthood months gobies cooler environments reach adulthood two years total lifespan gobiid varies one ten years species warmer waters generally living many species gobiidae live malefemale pairs construct share burrows similar many fish mozambique tilapia burrows used shelters spawning places gobiids use mouths dig sea bottom removing dead coralfragments rubble benthic algae order build gobiids maintain burrows fanning away sand inside burrows furthermore gobies use coral rubble block burrow entrance single goby carry many nine pieces coral rubble per minute gobiids also build cm high mound entrance spawning mound lets water flow fast mound water flow created mound helps provide oxygen eggs burrow building cooperative behavior done sexes males usually put effort burrow maintenance females females feed instead reproductive success optimal females put energy preparing spawning eggs roles male female changes females primarily maintain burrow males mainly care eggs fanning thereby providing oxygen females leave burrow however mounds lose heights males give eggs eat preparing future mating opportunities gobiid burrows vary size depending size kleptogamy refers sneaking behavior reproduction unpaired male fertilises eggs paired female paired male cares eggs females prefer male gobies large bodies since males large bodies smaller ones may cheat instead expending energy find sneakers wait near spawning ground paired fish sneakers release sperm spawning ground soon paired female releases though sneakers sperm fertilizes eggs paired male distinguish eggs fertilized sneakers fertilized sperm therefore paired male gives parental care equally kleptogamy good strategy many ways first sneakers need territories indicating need spend energy protecting territories males male gobies need territories since females choose mate male secondly sneakers provide parental care eggs paired males provide parental care instead sneakers therefore sneakers save energy put effort finding new targets cost kleptogamy sneakers receive aggressive attacks paired males usually much larger stronger sneakers small sneakers attacks paired males detrimental often lead sneakers also referred pseudofemales since small hardly distinguishable females small body size makes cheating easier time paired males mistake sneakers females thus chase sneakers away paired males called bourgeois males larger stronger importantly species gobiid blackeye goby lythrypnus dalli change sexes sex change possible gobies since external genitalia males females differ sex changes take days weeks sex changes gobies female male protogyny rather male female protandry femaletomale changes observed gobiids also wrasses damselfishes sea femaletomale change usually occurs resident male group dead male group reproduction impossible therefore dominant female turns male allowing mating maletofemale change occurs females preference specific features males example females prefer large males large males mate multiple females whereas small males lose chance mate small males either choose become sneakers kleptogamy choose transform females females technically high mating opportunities turning females males ensure produce many gobies extraordinarily developed sex change ability gobiodon histrio great barrier reef exhibits bidirectional sex changes g histrio one species change sex ways two g historio females used males coral reef one transforms back male sex determination coral goby gobiodon erythrospilus occur juveniles meet potential confronting potential mate difficult gobiodon erythrospilus juveniles since coral resources crucial attracting mates occupied preexisting paired gobies juveniles meet potential mates one member preexisting pairs dies juveniles sexes determined according sexes potential mates juvenile meets female becomes male vice versa type sex determination referred socially influenced sex gobiids remember landmarks within short distances use find ways small frillfin gobies bathygobius soporator live intertidal zones swim pools high tides memorize pool connects others low tides exhibit accurate jumping behaviors memorized new environment fish show jumping behaviors jump wrong pools nevertheless one night show accurate jumping study done understand gobiids react changing habitat fish given two choices safe habitat less food dangerous habitat food results full hungry fish revealed gobiids confronted tradeoff foraging avoiding predation made choices would better species gobiidae sometimes form symbiotic relationships burrowing shrimps shrimp maintains burrow sand shrimp fish live shrimp
