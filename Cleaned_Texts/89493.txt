george keble hirst md march january american virologist science administrator among first study molecular biology genetics animal viruses especially influenza virus directed public health research institute new york city also founding editorinchief virology first englishlanguage journal focus viruses particularly known inventing hemagglutination assay simple method quantifying viruses adapting hemagglutination inhibition assay measures virusspecific antibodies serum first discover viruses contain enzymes first propose virus genomes consist discontinuous segments new york times described pioneer molecular hirst born eau claire wisconsin usa family soon moved lewistown montana studied hobart college geneva new york later yale university new connecticut gained first degree medical degree worked rockefeller institute medical research new york city supervision homer swift rebecca lancefield moved rockefeller foundations international health division laboratories combined research collaboration frank horsfall edwin kilbourne others army service member armed forces epidemiological boards commission second world war hirst joined public health research institute new york city established remained retirement became head infectious diseases virology divisions succeeded l whittington gorham director institute position held nearly years tenure superintended expansion move new location street first also held teaching position new york university school hirsts earliest research bacteria including pneumococci streptococci collaboration lancefield rockefeller foundation started work influenza viruses enveloped rna viruses infecting humans birds focus much subsequent human influenza virus first isolated years later hirst also studied vertebrate rna viruses including poliovirus mumps newcastle disease although viruses shown infect animals research animal viruses much less advanced plant viruses bacteriophages easier handle hirst discovered adding influenza virus particles red blood cells caused agglutinate stick together forming lattice phenomenon called hemagglutination provided convenient method diagnosing influenza laboratory previously performed cultivating virus hirst developed reaction hemagglutination assay allows amount virus sample technique rapid accurate convenient later proved applicable many wolfgang joklik cites discovery hemagglutination one early epochmaking discoveries virology stating made influenza virus first mammalian virus whose replication could studied although hirst know time hemagglutination caused influenza virus hemagglutinin glycoprotein viral envelope binding sialic acid surface red blood cell mechanism central influenza virus entering host soon realised hemagglutination assay could easily adapted measure levels antibody specific virus strain human serum antibodies present bind influenza virus particles prevent crosslinking red blood cells inhibit hemagglutination inhibition assay hia applied many viruses carrying hemagglutinin molecule including rubella measles mumps parainfluenza adenoviruses polyomaviruses arboviruses still widely used influenza surveillance vaccine hannah hoag writing nature medicine describes assay goldstandard serologic test type influenza antibodies humans hia powerful epidemiological tool according virologist vincent hirst explored application epidemiological one several researchers developed trialed inactivated influenza vaccines applied hia study antibody responses hirst noticed hemagglutination tended wear time discovered influenza virus intrinsic enzymatic activity release virus attachment red blood groundbreaking discovery previously key distinction viruses bacteria viruses believed lack hirst demonstrated red blood cells deagglutinated could reagglutinated correctly deduced enzyme destroys receptor virus red blood cells enzyme referred receptordestroying enzyme later shown influenza neuraminidase another viral envelope glycoprotein acts like hemagglutinin neuraminidase essential influenza life cycle required progeny virus leave host neuraminidase target neuraminidase inhibitor class antiviral drugs include oseltamivir tamiflu zanamivir hirst subsequently found influenza virus interacts similar receptor target cell infection providing model initiation viral infection turned apply continued investigate nature cellular receptor correctly proposing receptor might one starting late hirst carried pioneering research genetics animal team built frank macfarlane burnets work recombination influenza virus carrying series experiments led hirst conclude influenzas genome must consist several separate fragments truly revolutionary idea time according r walter schlesinger allan influenza viruses known eight segments segmentation genome facilitates exchange segments different influenza viruses causing antigenic shift result segmented genomes also found many hirst founded journal virology together bacteriophage specialist salvador luria plant virologist lindsay black first journal english language specialise publishing research viruses united basic science research across viruses infecting types host lifelong objective hirsts founding editorinchief headed journal years retirement praised coeditors discipline virology owes large debt gratitude clear vision unfailing sense fairness uncompromising dedication scientific excellence guided virology first years existence hand helm sorely missed defined journals objectives established hirst gave harvey lecture new york academy medicine topic nature hemagglutination viruses inaugural pfizer lecture virology institute virology glasgow uk development virology independent elected membership national academy sciences american
