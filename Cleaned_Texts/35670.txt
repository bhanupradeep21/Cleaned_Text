normally develop mating plug prevents copulation plug necessary pregnancy initiation also occur without plug presence absence plug affect litter size plug stays place hours gestation period days give

males eight weeks copulate early five although house mice either monogamous polygamous commonly polygamous generally show characteristics matedefense polygyny males highly territorial protective mates females less communal nursing groups result behaviors lead lower numbers infanticide since females able protect greater numbers evolutionary behavioral consequences result polygamous nature house mouse one consequence paternal investment lower polygamous mice mice occurs due fact males spend time involved sexual competition females leaving less time paternal polygamous male house mice spend less time alone also less likely slower retrieve lost pups males monogamous contrast maternal investment similar female mice mated versus polygamous behavior female house mice promotes sperm competition affects male female evolutionary females mate multiple males tend produce pups greater higher survival increasing female fitness sperm competition arises polygamy favors males faster motile sperm higher numbers increasing male competitive aspect insemination increases frequency polyandrous events fertilizations polyandry evolved increase reproductive male mating behavior also affected response practice polygamous behavior compared monogamous house mice polygamous house mice mate longer periods behaviour allows increase transfer sperm paternity success turn increases male

populations larger number mates diverse mates choose within population males females show different levels multiple mating females show bias toward unrelated males rather related males sexual selection resulting genetically diverse offspring reduction inbreeding inbreeding depression increases genetic incompatibilities levels homozygosity chance expression deleterious recessive polyandry shown increase offspring survival compared monandry fitness females increases polyandrous lines due genetic diversity greater litter due polyandry males confused identity new multiple mating females paternity confusion decrease rates males uncertain offspring less likely kill intrauterine insemination causes evolutionary consequence resulting polyandrous multiple males mate one female multiple
