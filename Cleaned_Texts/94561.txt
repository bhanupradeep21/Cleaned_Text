exceptionally adept withstanding wide variations temperature ranging freezing cold blistering heat remarkable ability go without water months time water available may drink liters well fed humps plump erect resources decline humps shrink lean side moving faster walking speed pace stepping forwards legs side opposed trotting using alternate diagonals done quadrupeds speeds kilometres per hour mph

camels induced ovulators ovulate insemination insertion semen vagina seminal plasma spermatozoa induces ovulation ovulation occurs females insemination ovulate within hours rest hours natural mating
