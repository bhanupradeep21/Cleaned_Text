dwarfism chickens inherited condition found chickens consisting significant delayed growth resulting adult individuals distinctive small size comparison normal specimens breed population affected birds show signs dwarfism first weeks differences size due dwarfism appear slow progressively along growing stage poultry breeders begin distinguish gradually dwarfs normal birds shortest shanks smallest body depending breed types dwarfism chickens begin recognized birds reach weeks classification precise chickens five months old point differences normal dwarf sibs evident males dwarfs chickens reach sexual maturity reproduce normally dwarfism chickens found controlled several simple genetic factors types autosomic others sexlinked poultry breeders make reference dwarf chickens

commercial broiler chicken production use dwarf female parents acquired great nowadays majority broiler breeders europe standard fast growing genotype broiler breeders dwarf parental females produce standard alternative medium slow growing use dwarfism also found application commercial egg production dwarf leghorn layers need less housing space main advantage allow efficient use housing space producing eggs per unit surface smallest size eggs imposes serious drawback purpose current practice normal parent poultry breeding stock potentially face welfare problems intensive selection production traits especially growth rate associated increased nutritious requirement thus feed consumption also reproductive dysfunctions decreased sexual activity broiler breeders first resulting serious welfare problem subsequent severe feed restriction applied rearing order prevent health problems reach better egg production severe feed restriction negative effects bird welfare causes chronic stress resulting use normal fast growing broiler breeder hens require dedicated programmes feed restriction maximise egg chick production secondly avoid metabolic disorders mortality broiler breeders negative correlation muscle growth reproduction effectiveness known broiler breeder using dwarf broiler breeder hens good alternative dwarf hens combine relatively good reproductive fitness ad libitum respect bird welfare use slow growing birds viable alternative reduce negative effects feed restriction dwarf broiler breeders need severely feed resulting male progeny grow fast progeny normal female use female broiler female parent breeders improves feed allows reduction feed costs take less housing space tolerance comparative performance tests proved important advantages tropical
