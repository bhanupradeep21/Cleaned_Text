cooking oil also known edible oil plant animal liquid fat used frying baking types cooking oil allows higher cooking temperatures water making cooking faster flavorful likewise distributing heat reducing burning uneven cooking sometimes imparts flavor cooking oil also used food preparation flavoring involving heat salad dressings bread dips cooking oil typically liquid room temperature although oils contain saturated fat coconut oil palm oil palm kernel oil wide variety cooking oils plant sources olive oil palm oil soybean oil canola oil rapeseed oil corn oil peanut oil vegetable oils well animalbased oils like butter lard oil flavored aromatic foodstuffs herbs chillies garlic cooking spray aerosol cooking oil consumption small amounts saturated fats common metaanalyses found significant correlation high consumption saturated fats blood ldl risk factor cardiovascular metaanalyses based cohort studies controlled randomized trials found effect consuming polyunsaturated fats instead saturated fats lower risk mayo clinic highlighted certain oils high saturated fats including coconut palm oil palm kernel oil lower amounts saturated fats higher levels unsaturated preferably fats like olive oil peanut oil canola oil soy cottonseed oils generally us national heart lung blood urged saturated fats replaced polyunsaturated monounsaturated fats listing olive canola oils sources healthier monounsaturated oils soybean sunflower oils good sources polyunsaturated fats one study showed consumption nonhydrogenated unsaturated oils like soybean sunflower preferable consumption palm oil lowering risk heart cashew oil nutbased oils present danger persons nut allergy oils primarily lipids allergic reactions due surface proteins seeds cultivated plants contain higher levels fatty acids notable exceptions growth colder temperatures tends result higher levels fatty acids seed unlike dietary fats trans fats essential promote good consumption trans fats

trans fats us trans fats longer generally recognized safe added foods including cooking oils without special heating well heating vessel rapidly changes characteristics cooking oils healthy room temperature become unhealthy heated certain temperatures especially heating repeatedly toxic risk linked oxidation fatty acids fatty acids higher levels unsaturation oxidized rapidly heating choosing cooking oil important match oils heat tolerance temperature change frying oil times per deepfat frying temperatures commonly range less commonly lower temperatures palm oil contains saturated fats canola oil corn oil linseed oil soybean oil safflower oil sunflower oil therefore palm oil withstand deep frying higher temperatures resistant oxidation compared highpolyunsaturated vegetable since palm oil increasingly added food global commercial food industry remains stable deep frying baking high high levels natural antioxidants though refined palm oil used industrial food lost carotenoid content orangered following oils suitable hightemperature frying due high smoke point less aggressive frying temperatures frequently quality frying oil bland flavor least smoke flash points maximums free fatty acids linolenic oils higher linolenic fractions avoided due polymerization gumming marked increases viscosity olive oil resists thermal degradation used frying oil thousands oils degrade response heat light delay onset rancidity blanket inert gas usually nitrogen applied vapor space storage container immediately production process called tank blanketingcitation cool dry place oils greater stability may thicken although soon return liquid form left room temperature minimize degrading effects heat light oils removed cold storage long enough usecitation needed refined oils high monounsaturated fats macadamia keep year high polyunsaturated fats soybean oil keep six months rancidity tests shown shelf life walnut oil months period considerably shorter best date shown contrast oils high saturated fats avocado oil relatively long shelf lives safely stored room temperature low polyunsaturated fat content facilitates cooking oils composed various fractions fatty purpose frying food oils high monounsaturated saturated fats generally popular oils high polyunsaturated fats less high oleic acid oils include almond macadamia olive pecan pistachio higholeic cultivars safflower

used cooking oil important wastemanagement concern oil congeal pipes causing sanitary sewer cooking oil never dumped kitchen sink toilet bowl proper way dispose oil put sealed nonrecyclable container discard regular placing container oil refrigerator harden also makes disposal easier less messy cooking oil recycled used animal feed soap makeup clothes rubber detergents directly fuel produce recycling industry used cooking oil recovered restaurants foodprocessing industries typically deep fryers griddles called yellow grease recycled vegetable oil rvo used vegetable oil uvo waste vegetable oil grease traps interceptors collect fats oils kitchen sinks floor drains result called brown grease unlike yellow grease severe contaminants make much harder recycle gutter oil trench oil terms used china describe recycled oil processed resemble virgin oil containing toxic contaminants sold illegally cooking origin frequently brown grease kenya thieves sell stolen electric transformers
