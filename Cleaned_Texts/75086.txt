skin airway stomach ingestion may come consumption moldy whole grains absorbed human although significant systemic effects expected dermal contact normal agricultural residential environments local skin effects excluded hence skin contact limited alimentary toxic aleukia ata disease caused trichothecenes like mycotoxin killed many thousands ussr citizens orenburg district reported mortality rate entire population area proposed consumption contaminated food cause mass poisoning world war ii harvesting grains delayed food scarce russia resulted consumption grain contaminated fusarium molds produce united states secretary state alexander haig successor george p shultz accused soviet union using mycotoxin chemical weapon known yellow rain laos kampuchea afghanistan allegedly caused thousands although several us chemical weapons experts claim identified yellow rain samples laos trichothecenes experts believe exposure due naturally occurring mycotoxin contaminated another alternative theory developed harvard biologist matthew meselson proposed yellow rain found southeast asia originated excrement jungle first indication theory came finding high levels pollen collected samples giving substance yellow color also found jungle bees area fly collectively great numbers altitudes high easily seen producing showers feces could mistaken sprays testing later determined oily liquid fact pollenfilled feces jungle similar case china brought light instance cause phenomenon also bee despite conclusive analysis united states withdrawn allegations declares issue fully resolved mycotoxin also thought cause gulf war syndrome us troops suffered mycotoxicosislike symptoms iraqi missile detonated us military camp saudi arabia operation desert storm persian gulf war shown iraq researched trichothecene mycotoxins among substances thus capable possession employment chemical warfare nevertheless much key information incidents remains classified leaving matters still compound

bind integral part ribosomal subunit peptidyltransferase thereby inhibiting protein synthesis effects thought explanation toxin inducing apoptosis cell death different tissues immune system gastrointestinal tissue also fetal tissue regard apoptosis noticed level proapoptotic factor bas x protein increased level bclxl antiapoptotic factor decreased human chrondocytes cartilage cells exposed mycotoxin furthermore level fas apoptosisrelated cellsurface antigen protein regulating cell cycle increased mycotoxin produced naturally fusarium fungi important species f sporotrichioides f langsethiae f acuminatum f poae fungi found grains barley wheat oats production compound research commercial purposes generally accomplished cultivating strain mycotoxin producing fungi agar plates agar plates fungi appear powdery yield substantial amounts mycotoxin isolation compound high pressure liquid chromatography commonly used fusarium species biosynthesis mycotoxin often starts trichodiene many species share common route oxidizations cyclizations example f sporotrichioides species important oxidation steps occur start trichodiene goes isotrichodiol eleventh carbon atom oxidized form isotrichotriol ninth carbon oxidized trichotriol formed cyclizes make isotrichodermol fifteenth carbon oxidized form didecalonectrin leads fourth carbon oxidized diacetoxyscirpenol formed second last step oxidation eighth carbon make neosolaniol undergoes slight modification create humans animals generally exposed mycotoxins food certain grains contain toxin makes threat human health economic unlike biological toxins mycotoxin absorbed intact skin compound delivered via food water droplets aerosols smoke various dispersal systems makes potential biological weapon however large amounts compound required lethal dose mycotoxin approximately milligram per kilogram body weight efsa estimates mean exposure eu lies ngkg range tdi ng kg body weight sum toxins used efsa mycotoxin distributed uniformly throughout body without preference specific organ site rodents plasma concentration levels peak around roughly thirty minutes exposure one study halflife toxin seen less twenty minutes different study involving pigs distribution four hours iv injection seen gi tract various absorbed distributed various tissues mycotoxin goes various metabolic reactions gets excreted vivo studies showed occurring reactions ester hydrolysis hydroxylation isovaleryl group deepoxidation glucuronide conjugation also occur main metabolite hydroxylation cytochrome enzyme complex suggested involved triol tetraol likely formed via acetylcholine esterases metabolic reactions mycotoxin performed microflora gut formed metabolites reactions species phdependent ester cleavages however performed mammal microflora red blood cells mycotoxin metabolized neosolaniol white blood cells via hydrolysis catalyzed carboxylesterases following absorption distribution metabolism mycotoxin excreted fairly quickly excreted within main methods excretion seem urine excretion bile contributes heavily feces route also little parent mycotoxin excretions meaning initial compound metabolized highly toxic inhaled acute toxic symptoms include vomiting diarrhea skin irritation itching rash blisters bleeding individual exposed longer period alimentary toxic aleukia ata develops first patient experiences burning sensation mouth throat stomach days person suffer acute gastroenteritis last days within weeks bone marrow slowly degenerate also skin starts bleeding total number leukocytes decreases problems nervous system occur end following symptoms might occur high fever petechial haemorrhage necrosis muscles skin bacterial infections necrotic tissue enlarged lymph nodes possibility asphyxiation laryngeal oedema stenosis glottis lack oxygen cause death otherwise patient die bronchial pneumonia lung mycotoxin also toxic animals compound known lethal sublethal effects farm animals often found contaminated cereal grains fed toxic effects shared humans animals exposing zebra fish embryos concentration Î¼moll higher malformation mortality rates increased malformations included tail deformities cardiovascular defects changes behavior early stages life result increase amount epoxides causes cell studies shown causes lipid peroxidation rats feeding effect toxin elevated reactive oxygen species ros levels observed several mammalian species however spite general harmful effects caused toxin study carried different chicken derived hepatic cell culture models alterations found redox status compound also seems reduce fertility ewes heifers research shown high dose delays ovulation due delayed follicle maturation possibly retards following
