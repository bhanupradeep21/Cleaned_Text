bouba rounded shape kiki spiky shape discovery dates back psychologists documented experimental participants connecting nonsense words shapes consistent ways strong general tendency towards effect worldwide robustly confirmed across majority cultures languages example including among englishspeaking american university students tamil speakers india speakers certain languages writing system young children infants though much lesser degree individuals congenitally also shown occur familiar names effect investigated using fmri boubakiki effect one form sound another popular version taketemaluma effect involving different sharp round shape effect first observed georgian psychologist dimitri uznadze source needed conducted experiment participants given list nonsense words shown six drawings five seconds pick name drawing list given words describes different strategies participants developed match words drawings quotes reasoning also describes situations participants described specific forms associated nonsense word without reference shown drawings develops theory four factors influence way names objects decided total words one particular drawing picked word three others percentages uznadze points significantly overlap one could expect given high number possible words speculates must therefore certain regularities human soul follows process namegiving german american psychologist wolfgang köhler referred uznadzes experiment showed two forms asked readers shape called takete called maluma although explicitly stated köhler implies strong preference pair jagged shape takete rounded shape v ramachandran edward hubbard repeated köhlers experiment using words kiki bouba asked american college undergraduates tamil speakers india shapes bouba kiki groups selected curvy shape bouba jagged one kiki suggesting human brain somehow attaches abstract meanings shapes sounds verification see discussion daphne maurer colleagues showed even children young years old may show recent work ozge ozturk colleagues showed even infants mapping biases adults infants able differentiate congruent trials pairing angular shape kiki curvy shape bubu incongruent trials pairing curvy shape kiki angular shape bubu infants looked longer incongruent pairings congruent pairings infants mapping based combination consonants vowels words neither consonants vowels alone sufficed mapping results suggest mappings precede language learning may fact aid language learning establishing basis matching labels referents narrowing hypothesis space young infants adults study like infants used combination consonant vowel information match labels heard shapes saw however strategy available adults unlike infants also able use consonant information alone vowel information alone match labels shapes albeit less frequently combination vowels consonants put conflict adults used consonants often vowels effect also shown emerge contexts words paired evaluative meanings bouba words associated positive concepts kiki words associated negative words paired existing first names suggesting familiarity linguistic stimuli eliminate effect study showed individuals pair names molly round silhouettes names kate sharp silhouettes moreover individuals associate different personality traits either group names eg easygoingness round names determination sharp names may hint role abstract concepts research suggests effect occur appears effect breaks sounds make licit words boubakiki effect seems dependent long sensitive period high visual capacities childhood necessary typical development contrast typically sighted individuals congenitally blind individuals reported show boubakiki effect though show much smaller effect touched shapes sighted individuals show visual studies show speakers certain languages notably failed show effect namely including mandarin chinese turkish nathan peiffersmadja laurent cohen published first study using fmri explore boubakiki found
