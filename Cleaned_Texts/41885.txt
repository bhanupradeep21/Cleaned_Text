palaelodus extinct genus bird palaelodidae family distantly related flamingos slender birds long thin legs long neck resembling modern relatives likely lived different livestyles straight conical beaks suited filter feeding legs showing similarities grebes precise lifestyle disputed researchers past suggesting may divers recent research suggests may used stiff toes paddles swimming feeding insect larvae snails behavior may key later phoenicopteriforms developing filterfeeding bills genus includes five eight species found across europe australia new zealand asia possibly south america however argue taxa named europe simply represent differently sized individuals one single species palaelodus abundant late oligocene middle miocene periods isolated remains australia indicate genus least relative survived pleistocene genus palaelodus first described french scientist alphonse milneedwards basis fossils discovered frances early miocene deposits saintgérandlepuy area milneedwards identified named three distinct species palaelodus ambiguus type species palaelodus gracilipes palaelodus years following initial description milneedwards named two species palaelodus minutus palaelodus goliath p minutus sunk p gracilipes lambrecht decision immediately followed paleontologists like brodkorb švec later accepted jacques cheneval major revision palaelodids saintgérandlepuy besides agreeing synonymity p gracilipes p minutus cheneval also placed p goliath genus assessment followed heizmann hesse conservative number species suggested mlíkovský placed goliath back palaelodus turn sunk remaining european palaelodus species p ambiguus reasoning differentiated size thus simply represent variation within species although acknowledging species proposed milneedwards may indeed simply differently sized members single taxon worthy colleagues argue synonymity proposed mlíkovský premature comprehensive comparison european material later publications likewise follow mlíkovskýs proposed species palaelodus remains first recognized australia described baird vickersrich erected two new species p wilsoni p pledgei based fossils lake eyre basin despite well known postcrania remains unambiguous fossils skull long unknown largely complete crania described cheneval escuillié two distal right tibiotarsi saint bathans fauna bannockburn formation new zealand described worthy colleagues another new palaelodus recently named member palaelodus p kurochkini miocene mongolia name palaelodus derives ancient greek palaios ancient elodus means inhabitant megapaloelodus goliath originally described species palaelodus later moved american genus megapaloelodus due robust morphology separating contemporary palaelodus ambiguus still mlíkovský suggests species returned original crane pliogrus germanicus considered type palaelodid possibly genus neurocranium palaelodus shares several ancestral traits skulls modern grebes order podicipediformes among autapomorphic traits position development fossae glandulae nasales two depressions nasal glands situated orbits animal trait helps differentiate skull palaelodus skulls known birds temporal fossae form somewhat intermediary grebes flamingos pronounced later deep premaxilla superficially resembles making bill palaelodus appear straight highly distinct curved bills modern mandibular ramus notably deep almost straight upper edge lower edge bends narrows far behind symphysis rami lack spongy texture typically associated flamingos upper rim widened either towards back mandible elongated fossa found also unlike seen flamingos instead resembling condition observed grebes towards front mandible meanwhile distinct foramina preceding short deep mandibular symphysis skull palaelodus also clearly shows presence salt specimens mainz basin well saintgérandlepuy show notarium series fused vertebrae shoulder girdle consists five vertebrae rather four seen extant mirandornithes notarium differs orientation first vertebra flamingos faces downwards contributing marked kink spine animal nearly pronounced palaelodus first three vertebrae notarium bear ventral process flamingos show ventral processes one two far less pronounced condition palaelodus seems show intermediate condition flamingos grebes later well developed ventral processes vertebrae notarium precise number vertebrae prior notarium unknown mayr assumes count flamingos similar division neck vertebrae based bending properties based central caudal cervicals appear largely similar flamingos similarly elongated lacking foramina towards front individual vertebrae regarding cranial cervicals differences identified appear elongated relative modern flamingos deeper crest formed spinous processes known vertebrae thought closest head appear less elongated pedal phalanges bones make middle toes palaelodus compressed mediolaterally unlike flamingos deep weakly developed convex distal articulation points lack furrow later characteristic would impact flexion toes associated webbed feet used locomotion water although also true grebes extant podicipediforms show dorsoventrally flattened toes indicating ancestral trait instead acquired independently lineages ungual phalanges could described mayr detailed analysis palaelodus material however notes older figures seem indicate toe tips flattened like grebes flamingos instead show state typical bird although still relatively long legs palaelodus nearly elongated modern flamingos particular tarsometatarsus notably shorter humerus opposite true phoenicopterids tarsometatarsus differs flamingos laterally compressed similar seen pelvis also differs flamingos narrower extant family palaelodidae sister taxon modern flamingos placed order phoenicopteriformes palaeolodids palaelodus considered important link understanding relationship flamingos next closest relatives diving grebes clade mirandornithes relationship well supported molecular morphological evidence palaelodidae form link two extant groups cranial anatomy general proportions similar flamingos legs akin following phylogenetic tree depicts mirandornithes recovered torres colleagues juncitarsus podicipediformes palaelodidae phoenicopterus phoenicoparrus due unique anatomy intermediary position within mirandornithes exact ecology palaelodus entirely understood cheneval escuillié suggest palaelodus may diver using webbed feet however hypothesis questioned works mayr well worthy colleagues suggest different alternatives worthy et al suggested palaelodids wading birds akin publications mayr suggest swimming traits used infer diving lifestyle noted also present flamingos pneumatised humerus present palaelodus entirely unknown worthy colleagues point laterally compressed tibiotarsi may trait shared diving birds bird lifestyle features degree limb elongation present palaelodus counter compression well traits hindlimbs could well adaptions easily wade deeper mayr meanwhile specifically points several traits according support swimming lifestyle compression toes unlike seen modern wading bird decreased ability flex toes suggests use webbed feet stiff paddles distinctly narrower pelvis also points towards different way life cheneval escuillié proposed deep mandible palaelodus may housed enlarged tongue similar flamingos birds may shown first signs becoming filter feeders although directly disputing presence enlarged tongue mayr points bill palaelodus lacked widened rim holds keratinous lamellae allow flamingos filter water subsequently even thick tongue present palaelodus would likely able filter feed manner adult flamingos instead bill shows greater similarity juvenile flamingos yet developed mechanism furthermore enlarged fossae sides mandibular ramus indicate movement head played greater role foraging flamingos pointing conventional method feeding besides anatomy mandible way spine formed another indicator palaelodids differed ecology flamingos flamingos feed standing necks lowering right angle likely aided kink spine prior shoulder girdle kink nearly pronounced palaelodus likely assumed different position feeding also matches fact bill lacks typical hooked shape flamingo fossils palaelodus exclusively known lacustrine environments presence salt glands indicates regardless details diet must foraged saline least brackish waters like flamingos large number palaelodus remains found certain localities indicates areas inhabited genus rich favored food items milneedwards proposed could contain larvae caddisflies snails particularly abundant saintgérandlepuy caddisflies fact common early miocene strata casings make part local limestone therefore possible palaelodids related genera specialised feeding small invertebrates subsequently set groundwork derived filter feeding apparatus social behavior may varied species worthy colleagues argue discovery thousands bones france could indicate european palaelodus species may lived large flocks like modern flamingos species australia new zealand meanwhile may less social based fact bones known across multiple localities case made partially light palaelodid remains new zealand fossil ducks found abundance likely due flocking behavior yet remains phoenicopteriforms genus known inhabited saline brackish lakes especially abundant oligocene miocene sediments europe two four species may coexisted however great species diversity depends whether goliath found nest within palaelodus whether milneedwards species represent single taxon neogene
