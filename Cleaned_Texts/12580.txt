thiazide ˈθaɪəzaɪd refers class sulfurcontaining organic class diuretics based chemical structure thiazide drug class discovered developed merck co first approved drug class chlorothiazide marketed trade name diuril beginning countries thiazides least expensive antihypertensive drugs thiazide organic molecules bicyclic structures contain adjacent sulfur nitrogen atoms one confusion sometimes occurs thiazidelike diuretics indapamide referred thiazides despite thiazide chemical used way thiazide refers drug acts thiazide thiazide receptor sodiumchloride transporter pulls nacl lumen distal convoluted tubule thiazide diuretics inhibit receptor causing body release nacl water lumen thereby increasing amount urine produced example molecule chemically thiazide used diuretic methylchloroisothiazolinone often found antimicrobial thiazide diuretics primarily used treat hypertension high blood pressure edema swelling caused water overload well certain conditions related unbalanced calcium metabolism many causes hypertension high blood pressure including advancing age smoking sometimes underlying cause hypertension determined resulting diagnosis idiopathic hypertension regardless cause someone may high hypertension without initial symptoms uncontrolled hypertension eventually cause damage heart kidneys eyes lifestyle changes including reducing dietary salt increasing exercise losing weight help reduce blood thiazides thiazidelike diuretics constant use since introduction decades cornerstone hypertension treatment show well drugs perform lowdose

collaboration specifically recommended lowdose thiazides used initial pharmacological therapy high blood lowdose thiazides effective treating hypertension beta blockers similar angiotensinconverting enzyme ace thiazides recommended treatment hypertension europe however uk national institute health clinical excellence recommends ace inhibitor calcium channel blockers firstline treatment hypertension adults thiazides considered initial treatment patient high risk developing heart thiazides also replaced ace inhibitors australia due association thaizide use increased risk developing diabetes mellitus type threshold thiazides used paradoxically decrease urine flow people nephrogenic diabetes thiazides may also useful treating hyponatremia low blood sodium infants central diabetes
