experience refers conscious events general specifically perceptions practical knowledge familiarity produced processes understood conscious event widest sense experience involves subject various items presented sense seeing yellow bird branch presents subject objects bird branch relation property yellow unreal items may included well happens experiencing hallucinations dreams understood restricted sense sensory consciousness counts experience sense experience usually identified perception contrasted types conscious events like thinking imagining slightly different sense experience refers conscious events practical knowledge familiarity produce sense important direct perceptual contact external world source knowledge experienced hiker someone actually lived many hikes someone merely read many books hiking associated recurrent past acquaintance abilities learned many scholarly debates nature experience focus experience conscious event either wide restricted sense one important topic field question whether experiences intentional ie directed objects different another debate focuses question whether nonconceptual experiences role could play justifying beliefs theorists claim experiences transparent meaning experience feels like depends contents presented experience theorists reject claim pointing matters presented also presented great variety types experiences discussed academic literature perceptual experiences example represent external world stimuli registered transmitted senses experience episodic memory hand involves reliving past event one experienced imaginative experience objects presented without aiming show things actually experience thinking involves mental representations processing information ideas propositions entertained judged connected pleasure refers experience feels good closely related emotional experience additionally evaluative physiological behavioral components moods similar emotions one key difference lack specific object found emotions conscious desires involve experience wanting something play central role experience agency intentions formed courses action planned decisions taken realized nonordinary experience refers rare experiences significantly differ experience ordinary waking state like religious experiences outofbody experiences neardeath experiences experience discussed various disciplines phenomenology science structure contents experience uses different methods like epoché eidetic variation sensory experience special interest epistemology important traditional discussion field concerns whether knowledge based sensory experience empiricists claim rationalists contend closely related role experience science experience said act neutral arbiter competing theories metaphysics experience involved problem hard problem consciousness try explain relation matter experience psychology theorists hold concepts learned experience others argue concepts innate according merriamwebster dictionary definition term experience stated direct observation participation events basis term experience associated variety closely related meanings various different definitions found academic experience often understood conscious event sometimes restricted certain types consciousness like perception sensation subject attains knowledge wider sense experience includes types conscious events besides perception case example experience thinking experience different sense experience refers conscious events knowledge practical familiarity bring according meaning person job experience experienced hiker someone good practical familiarity respective field sense experience refers conscious process result word experience shares common latin root word experience often understood conscious event widest sense includes various types experiences perception bodily awareness memory imagination emotion desire action usually refers experience particular individual also take meaning experience group individuals example nation social class particular historical phenomenology discipline studies subjective structures experience ie like firstperson perspective experience different conscious someone experience presented various items items may belong diverse ontological categories corresponding eg objects properties relations seeing yellow bird branch example presents subject objects bird branch relation property yellow items include familiar unfamiliar items means possible experience something without fully understanding understood widest sense items present experience include unreal items case example experiencing illusions hallucinations dreams sense one experience yellow bird branch even though yellow bird experiences may include real items unreal items mix two phenomenologists made various suggestions basic features experience suggested features include spatialtemporal awareness difference attention foreground background subjects awareness sense agency purpose bodily awareness awareness understood restricted sense sensory consciousness counts sense possible experience something without understanding would case example someone experienced robbery without aware exactly happening case sensations caused robbery constitute experience characterization excludes abstract types consciousness experience sense sometimes held experience thought two separate aspects mental similar distinction sometimes drawn experience views generally accepted critics often point experience involves various cognitive components reduced sensory another approach distinguish internal external experience sensory perception belongs external experience may also types experience like remembering imagining belong internal another sense experience refers conscious events knowledge sense important knowledge comes direct perceptual contact external knowledge direct means obtained immediate observation ie without involving inference one may obtain kinds knowledge indirectly example reading books watching movies topic type knowledge constitute experience topic since direct contact question concerns books movies topic objects knowledge often understood public objects open observation regular meaning term experience everyday language usually sees knowledge question merely theoretical knowthat descriptive knowledge instead includes form practical knowhow ie familiarity certain practical matter familiarity rests recurrent past acquaintance often involves learned something heart able skillfully practice rather mere theoretical understanding knowledge skills obtained directly way normally limited generalized rulesofthumb lack behind scientific certainty comes methodological analysis scientists condenses corresponding insights laws experiences especially ones perceptual kind aim representing reality usually expressed stating intentionality intentional successful veridical represent world actually may also fail case give false representation traditionally held experience thesis known context often claimed mental states experiences intentional special prominence usually given experiences debates since seem constitute fundamental form commonly accepted experiences phenomenal features ie something like live opponents intentionalism claim experiences intentional features ie phenomenal features intentional features come alleged counterexamples intentionalism involve pure sensory experiences like pain claimed lack representational defenders intentionalism often responded claiming states intentional aspects example pain represents bodily mystical states experience constitute another putative counterexample context claimed possible experiences pure consciousness awareness still exists lacks object evaluating claim difficult since experiences seen extremely rare therefore difficult another debate concerns question whether experiences conceptual concepts general notions constitute fundamental building blocks conceptual contents usually contrasted sensory contents like seeing colors hearing noises discussion especially relevant perceptual experience empiricists claim made sense data without conceptual view type experience exists plays important role epistemological issues termed myth given given refers immediate uninterpreted sensory contents experiences underlying discussion distinction bare immediate experience contrast developed idea behind distinction aspects experience directly given subject without interpretation basic aspects interpreted various ways leading reflective conceptually rich experience showing various new relations basic distinction could explain example various faulty perceptions like perceptual illusions arise due false interpretations inferences constructions subject found basic sense often remarked experience product world distinction immediate interpreted aspects experience proven contentious philosophy critics claiming immediate given within experience ie everything interpreted one problem criticism difficult see interpretation could get started nothing interpreted begin among accept form immediate experience different theories concerning nature sense datum theorists example hold immediate experience consists basic sensations like colors shapes immediate given chaotic undifferentiated mass ordered various mental processes like association memory language normal everyday objects perceive like trees cars spoons direct realists hand hold material everyday objects immediate philosophers tried approach disagreements formulating general characteristics possessed contents immediate experience given often held private sensory simple privacy refers idea experience belongs subject experiencing directly accessible subjects access best indirect example experiencer tells others simplicity means context given constitutes basic building blocks free additional interpretations inferences idea given incorrigible important many traditional disputes idea wrong certain aspects experience view subject may wrong inferences drawn experience external reality example green tree outside window wrong certain fundamental aspects things seem us example subject presented green critics view argued may wrong even things seem us eg possibly wrong conceptualization may already happen basic disagreement among theorists experience concerning whether subjective character experience entirely determined contents claim called transparency states like undergo experience depends items presented would mean two experiences exactly alike various philosophers rejected thesis often argument matters presented also presented example property roundness presented visually looking sphere haptically touching defenders transparencythesis pointed difference experiences examples explained level content one experience presents property visualroundness presents counterexamples include blurry vision blurriness seen flawed representation without presenting seen object argued universals present experience determine subjective character experience view two experiences involving different particulars instantiate exactly universals would subjectively perceptual experience refers immediate consciousness existence things outside representation external world happens stimuli registered transmitted perceptual experience occurs different modalities corresponding different senses eg visual perception auditory perception haptic usually held objects perceived way ordinary material objects like stones flowers cats airplanes presented public objects existing independent mind perceiving stands contrast example objects presented imaginative experience another feature commonly ascribed perceptual experience seems put us direct touch object presents perceiver normally aware cognitive processes starting stimulation sense organs continuing transmission information brain ending information processing happening perception usually reliable source information practical matters everyday affairs also include false information form illusion cases unreliability perception already indicated within experience example perceiver fails identify object due blurry indications found misleading experiences may appear reliable accurate source socalled problem perception consists fact features ascribed perception far seem incompatible making socharacterized perception impossible case misleading perceptions perceiver may presented objects exist would impossible direct touch presented different solutions problem suggested sense datum theories example hold perceive sense data like patches color visual perception exist even thereby deny ordinary material things objects disjunctivists hand try solve problem denying veridical perceptions illusions belong kind approaches include adverbialism problem different approaches neither fully satisfying since one seems contradict kind introspective evidence concerning fundamental features perceptual experience episodic memory consists form reliving past event one experienced different semantic memory one access knowledge various facts concerning event question without experiential component associated episodic memory hand past event consciously sense form mental time travel present nonepisodic reexperiencing exact copy original experience since experienced event presented something past seen ones current perspective associated kind feeling pastness familiarity present original context often held episodic memory provides two types information firstorder information past event secondorder information role event subjects current episodic memory different merely imagining experience past event important aspect difference part nature episodic memory try represent original experience even sometimes fails suggested differences include degree vividness causal connection original experience episodic imaginative experience involves special form representation objects presented without aiming show things actually like memory unlike perception associated mental images normally caused stimulation sensory often held imagination memory depend previous perceptual acquaintance experienced unlike memory freedom involved forms imagination since subject freely vary change recombine various experienced contents memory aims preserve original different theorists focus different elements trying conceptualize nature imagination impoverishment view holds imagination distinguished perception memory less vivid clear willdependence view hand centers power actively shape contents imagination whereas nonexistence view focuses impression unreality distance reality belonging imaginative despite freedom lack relation actuality imaginative experience serve certain epistemological functions representing possible case example imaginatively speculating event happened might imagination happen various different forms one difference concerns whether imagined scenario deliberately controlled arises spontaneously another concerns whether subject imagines experiencing imagined event inside one protagonists within event different imaginative experiences tend different degrees imagined scenario reconstruction something experienced previously creative accounts imaginative experience usually focus visual domain also less prominent forms like auditory imagination olfactory term thinking used refer wide variety cognitive experiences involve mental representations processing way ideas propositions entertained judged connected similar memory imagination experience thinking arise internally without stimulation sensory organs contrast thinking still removed sensory contents memory imagination since contents belong abstract level closely related phenomenon speech theorists claiming thinking form inner speech expressed claim controversial since seem thoughts linguistically fully moderate claim often accepted thinking associated dispositions perform speech acts view making judgment thought may happen nonlinguistically associated disposition linguistically affirm judged various theories nature experience thinking proposed according platonism spiritual activity platonic forms interrelations discerned conceptualists hand hold thinking involves entertaining view judgments arise two concepts connected lead inferences judgments connected various types thinking discussed academic sometimes divided four categories concept formation problem solving judgment decision making concept formation features common examples certain type learned usually corresponds understanding meaning word associated case problem solving thinking goal overcome certain obstacles discovering solution problem happens either following algorithm guarantees success followed correctly using heuristics informal methods tend bring thinker closer judgment decision making involve choosing best course action among various reasoning thinker starts certain set premises tries draw conclusions simpler categorization divides thinking two categories theoretical contemplation practical pleasure refers experience feels involves enjoyment something like eating cake sex understood widest sense includes sensory pleasures form pleasant experience engaging intellectually satisfying activity joy playing game pleasure comes degrees exists dimension includes negative degrees well negative degrees usually referred pain suffering stand contrast pleasure forms feeling discussions dimension often focus positive side many theories insights apply equally negative side disagreement among philosophers psychologists concerning nature pleasure understand pleasure simple sensation view pleasure experience experience pleasuresensation among account rejected attitude theories hold pleasure consists content certain attitude towards content according perspective pleasure eating cake consists taste sensation together pleasure sensation sensationtheorists claim instead consists certain attitude like desire towards taste third type theory defines pleasure terms representational properties view experience pleasurable presents objects good emotional experiences come many forms like fear anger excitement surprise grief usually include either pleasurable unpleasurable normally involve various components well present every experience pleasure pain often held also comprise evaluative components ascribe positive negative value object physiological components involve bodily changes behavioral components form reaction presented example suddenly encountering grizzly bear hiking may evoke emotional experience fear hiker experienced unpleasant represents bear dangerous leads increase heart rate may provoke fleeing types components often used categorize emotions different types disagreement concerning essential component determining relevant category dominant approaches categorize according emotion feels evaluates object behavior emotional experiences beneficial individual gain experience positive emotions dictate individual creates effective growth success negative emotions also seen great thing everyones life since helps us realize opposition everything help us grow productive moods closely related emotions identical like emotions usually categorized either positive negative depending feels one core difference emotional experiences usually specific object like fear bear mood experiences hand often either object object rather diffuse like person anxious something bad might happen without able clearly articulate source differences include emotions tend caused specific events whereas moods often lack clearly identifiable cause emotions usually intensive whereas moods tend last examples moods include anxiety depression euphoria irritability melancholy desires comprise wide class mental states include unconscious desires conscious forms directly relevant conscious desires involve experience wanting wishing something often understood wide sense phenomena like love intention thirst seen forms usually understood attitudes toward conceivable states represent objects valuable sense aim realize changing world correspondingly either happen positive negative sense positive sense object experienced good aim create maintain negative sense object experienced bad aim destroy hinder coming intrinsic desires object desired sake whereas extrinsic desires object desired positive consequences associated desires come different degrees intensity satisfaction usually experienced agency refers capacity act manifestation experience involves various different aspects including formation intentions planning possible courses action decision different alternatives effort trying realize intended course often held desires provide motivational force behind experiences desire accompanied experience agency case example desire fulfilled without agent trying possible course action available agent fulfill restricted sense term sense agency refers impression control owner ones often held two components central sources sense agency one hand agent constantly makes predictions intentions influence bodily movement compares predictions sensory feedback view positive match generates sense agency negative match disrupts sense hand looking backward agent interprets intention cause action successful case intention precedes action action consistent terms nonordinary experience anomalous experience altered state consciousness used describe wide variety rare experiences significantly differ experience ordinary waking examples nonordinary experiences religious experiences closely related spiritual mystical experiences outofbody experiences neardeath experiences psychotic episodes psychedelic religious experiences nonordinary experiences carry religious significance often involve kind encounter divine person example form seeing god hearing gods command also involve intensive feeling one believes caused god recognizing divine nature oneself religious experiences said ineffable meaning far away ordinary described outofbody experiences involve impression detached ones material body perceiving external world different often seems person floating body seeing outside various different causes including traumatic brain injuries psychedelic drugs sleep paralysis also take form neardeath experiences usually provoked lifethreatening situations include contents flying tunnel towards light talking deceased relatives life review person sees whole life flash uncontroversial experiences occur sometimes people one study example report least one outofbody experience highly controversial reliable experiences accurately representing aspects reality accessible ordinary due fact various widereaching claims made based nonordinary experiences many claims verified regular perception frequently seem contradict based religious experience example claimed divine creator distinct nature exists divine exists outofbody experiences neardeath experiences hand often used argue dualism holding soul exist without body continues exist death defenders claims often contend decisive reason deny reliability experiences example important ways similar regular sensory experience additional cognitive faculty provides us access knowledge beyond regular great variety experiences discussed academic literature besides types mentioned far term flow example refers experiences agent fully immersed certain activity type

knowledge ultimately rest sensory experience traditionally view opposed rationalists accept sensory experience ground knowledge also allow sources knowledge example rationalists claim humans either innate intuitive knowledge mathematics rest generalizations based sensory another problem understand possible sensory experiences justify beliefs according one view sensory experiences belieflike sense involve affirmation propositional view seeing white snow involves among things affirmation proposition snow given assumption experiences justify beliefs way beliefs justify beliefs propositional contents stand appropriate logical explanatory relations assumption many opponents argue sensations nonconceptual therefore nonpropositional view affirmation snow white already something added sensory experience may amount much presentation patch one problem nonconceptualist approach perceptual experience faces difficulties explaining sensory experiences justify beliefs apparently one way avoid problem deny appearance holding justify beliefs cause coherence theory justification beliefs may still justified experiences responsible way cohere rest persons relation justification knowledge experience plays central role empirical whether rational someone believe certain claim depends among things experiences person example teacher may justified believing certain student pass exam based teachers experience student classroom belief would justified stranger lacking experiences rationality relative experience sense implies may rational one person accept certain claim another person may rationally reject closely related role experience epistemology role often argued observational experience central scientific experiments evidence obtained manner used confirm disconfirm scientific
