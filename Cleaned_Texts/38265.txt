wanted enemy soviet union time kershaw sees considerable merit work historians timothy mason hans mommsen martin broszat wolfgang schieder argue hitler programme foreign policy instead contend foreign

edelweiss pirates example group whose behavior initially fell dissent advanced opposition finally kershaws view much dissent opposition within german society outside working class little although

goldhagens book nation trial goldhagen thesis historical truth stating finkelstein birn provide devastating critique daniel goldhagens simplistic misleading interpretation holocaust contribution debate view indispensablecitation needed like broszat kershaw sees structures nazi state far important personality hitler individual matter explanation way nazi germany developed particular kershaw subscribes view argued broszat german historian hans mommsen nazi germany chaotic collection rival bureaucracies perpetual power struggles kershaws view nazi dictatorship totalitarian monolith rather unstable coalition several blocs power cartel comprising nsdap big business german state bureaucracy army sspolice agencies moreover power blocs turn divided several kershaws opinion radical blocs sspolice nazi party gained increasing ascendancy blocs economic crisis onwards increased power expense kershaw real significance hitler lies dictator rather german peoples perception biography hitler kershaw presented ultimate unperson boring pedestrian man devoid even negative greatness attributed joachim kershaw rejects great man theory history criticised seek explain everything happened nazi

remarks made german historian hansulrich wehler theories wehler wrote understanding national socialist policies really depend whether hitler one testicle perhaps führer three made things difficult

kershaw shares wehlers opinion besides problem theories hitlers medical condition extremely difficult prove effect personalising phenomena nazi germany less attributing everything happened nazi germany one flawed kershaws biography hitler examination hitlers power obtained maintained following ideas first introduced book hitler kershaw argued hitlers leadership model example max webers

context already kershaw finds picture hitler mountebank opportunistic adventurer alan bullocks biography unsatisfactory joachim fests quest determine great hitler wider sense kershaw sees nazi regime part broader crisis afflicted european society though disagreement many claims especially noltes kershaws concept second thirty years war reflects many similarities ernst nolte j p taylor arno j mayer also advanced concept thirty years crisis explain european history functionalism versus intentionalism debate kershaw argued synthesis two schools though leaning towards functionalist school despite disagreements kershaw called mommsen good personal friend important vital stimulus work kershaw argued twovolume biography hitler hitler play decisive role development policies genocide also argued many measures led holocaust undertaken many lowerranking officials without direct orders hitler expectation steps would win though kershaw deny radical antisemitism nazis favours mommsens view holocaust caused cumulative radicalization nazi germany caused endless bureaucratic power struggles turn towards increasingly radical antisemitism within nazi elite despite background functionalist historiography kershaw admits account hitler world war ii owes much intentionalist historians like gerhard weinberg hugh trevorroper lucy dawidowicz eberhard kershaw accepts picture hitler drawn intentionalist historians fanatical ideologue obsessed social darwinism völkisch antisemitism jewish people viewed race biologically different rest humanity rather religion militarism perceived need however essay improvised genocide kershaw traces ethnic cleansing campaign gauleiter arthur greiser warthegaua region annexed germany poland led campaign genocide kershaw argued process indeed improvised genocide rather fulfilment master kershaw views holocaust plan argued intentionalists rather process caused cumulative radicalization nazi state articulated functionalists citing work american historian christopher browning biography hitler kershaw argues period phrase final solution jewish question territorial solution plans nisko plan madagascar plan serious latter half phrase final solution come refer view holocaust process rather plan antithesis extreme intentionalist approach advocated lucy dawidowicz argues hitler decided upon genocide early november everything time onwards directed towards kershaw disagrees mommsens weak dictator thesis idea hitler relatively unimportant player nazi germany however agreed idea hitler play much role daytoday administration government nazi germany kershaws way explaining paradox theory working towards führer phrase taken speech prussian civil servant werner everyone opportunity observe knows fuhrer hardly dictate everything intends realize sooner later contrary till everyone post new germany worked best speak worked towards fuhrer often many spheres previous years individuals simply waited orders instructions unfortunately true future fact duty everybody try work towards fuhrer along lines would wish anyone makes mistakes notice soon enough anyone really works towards fuhrer along lines towards goal certainly future one day finest reward form sudden legal confirmation kershaw argued nazi germany officials german state party bureaucracy usually took initiative initiating policy meet hitlers perceived wishes alternatively attempted turn policy hitlers often loosely indistinctly phrased though kershaw agree hitler possessed powers master third reich thesis championed norman rich karl dietrich bracher would suggest argued hitler lazy dictator indifferent dictator really interested involving much daily running nazi exceptions areas foreign policy military decisions areas hitler increasingly involved late essay working towards führer kershaw argued german soviet dictatorships differences kershaw argued hitler unbureaucratic leader highly averse paperwork marked contrast joseph likewise kershaw argued stalin highly involved running soviet union contrast hitler whose involvement daytoday decision making limited infrequent kershaw argued soviet regime despite extreme brutality utter ruthlessness basically rational goal seeking modernise backward country equivalent cumulative radicalization towards increasingly irrational goals kershaw sees characteristic nazi kershaws opinion stalins power corresponded webers category bureaucratic authority whereas hitlers power corresponded webers category charismatic kershaws view happened germany imposition hitlers charismatic authority top legalrational authority system existed prior leading gradual breakdown system ordered authority kershaw argues german state reduced hopeless polycratic shambles rival agencies competing win hitlers favour time become source political kershaw sees rivalry causing cumulative radicalization germany argues though hitler always favoured radical solution problem german officials part attempting win führers approval carried initiative increasingly radical solutions perceived problems like jewish question opposed ordered kershaw largely agrees mommsens portrait hitler distant remote leader standing many ways system whose charisma ideas served set general tone example hitlers power functioned practice kershaw used hitlers directive gauleiters albert forster arthur greiser germanize part northwestern poland annexed germany within next years promise questions would asked would kershaw notes completely different ways forster greiser sought germanize gaue forster simply local polish population gau signing forms saying german blood greiser carrying program brutal ethnic cleansing poles gau showed hitler set events motion gauleiters could carry totally different policies pursuit believed hitlers kershaws opinion hitlers vision racially cleansed volksgemeinschaft provided impetus german officials carry increasingly extreme measures win approval ended israeli
