sporogenesis production spores biology term also used refer process reproduction via spores reproductive spores found formed eukaryotic organisms plants algae fungi normal reproductive life cycle dormant spores formed example certain fungi algae primarily response unfavorable growing conditions eukaryotic spores haploid form cell division though types diploid sor dikaryons form cell fusionwe also say type reproduction single pollination reproductive spores generally result cell division commonly meiosis eg plant sporophytes sporic meiosis needed complete sexual life cycle organisms using cases sporogenesis occurs via mitosis eg fungi algae mitotic sporogenesis form asexual reproduction examples conidial fungi aspergillus penicillium mitospore formation appears primary mode reproduction fungi ascomycetes utilize mitotic meiotic spores red alga polysiphonia alternates mitotic meiotic sporogenesis processes required complete complex reproductive life cycle case dormant spores eukaryotes sporogenesis often occurs result fertilization karyogamy forming diploid spore equivalent zygote therefore zygospores result sexual reproduction reproduction via spores involves spreading spores water air algae fungi chytrids often use motile zoospores swim new locations developing sessile organisms airborne spores obvious fungi example released puffballs fungi active spore dispersal mechanisms example fungus pilobolus shoot sporangia towards light plant spores designed dispersal also referred diaspores plant spores obvious reproduction ferns mosses however also exist flowering plants develop hidden inside flower example pollen grains flowering plants develop microspores produced anthers reproductive spores grow multicellular haploid individuals sporelings heterosporous organisms two types spores exist microspores give rise males megaspores females homosporous organisms spores look alike grow individuals carrying reproductive parts genders sporogenesis occurs reproductive structures termed sporangia process involves sporogenous cells sporocytes also called spore mother cells undergoing cell division give rise spores meiotic sporogenesis diploid spore mother cell within sporangium undergoes meiosis producing tetrad haploid spores organisms heterosporous two types spores occur microsporangia produce male microspores megasporangia produce female megaspores megasporogenesis often three four spores degenerate meiosis whereas microsporogenesis four microspores survive gymnosperms conifers microspores produced meiosis microsporocytes microstrobili male cones flowering plants microspores produced anthers flowers anther contains four pollen sacs contain microsporocytes meiosis microspore undergoes mitotic cell division giving rise multicellular pollen grains six nuclei gymnosperms three nuclei flowering plants megasporogenesis occurs megastrobili conifers example pine cone inside ovule flowers flowering plants megasporocyte inside megasporangium ovule undergoes meiosis producing four megaspores one functional megaspore whereas others stay dysfunctional degenerate megaspore undergoes several mitotic divisions develop female gametophyte example sevencelleightnuclei embryo sac flowering plants fungi algae produce mitospores mitotic cell division within sporangium fungi mitospores referred conidia algae fungi form resting spores made survive unfavorable conditions typically changes environment favorable unfavorable growing conditions trigger switch asexual reproduction sexual reproduction organisms resulting spores protected formation thick cell wall withstand harsh conditions drought extreme temperatures examples chlamydospores teliospores zygospores myxospores similar survival structures produced bacteria known endospores chlamydospores generally multicellular asexual structures teliospores form chlamydospore produced fusion cells hyphae nuclei fused cells stay separate nuclei undergo karyogamy meiosis upon germination spore zygospores formed certain fungi zygomycota example rhizopus algae example chlamydomonas zygospore forms isogamic fusion two cells motile single cells chlamydomonas sexual conjugation two hyphae zygomycota plasmogamy followed karyogamy therefore zygospores diploid zygotes undergo zygotic meiosis upon germinating oomycetes zygote forms fertilization egg cell sperm nucleus enters resting stage diploid thickwalled oospore germinating oospore undergoes mitosis gives rise diploid hyphae reproduce asexually via mitotic zoospores long conditions favorable diatoms fertilization gives rise zygote termed auxospore besides sexual reproduction resting stage function auxospore restoration original cell size diatoms get progressively smaller mitotic cell division auxospores divide mitosis term sporogenesis also refer endospore formation bacteria allows cells survive unfavorable conditions endospores reproductive structures formation require cell fusion division instead form production encapsulating spore coat within sporeforming cell many parts spore plant structure enclosing group spores called sporangiumclarification needed
