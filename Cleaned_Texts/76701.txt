intense thermal energy modifications currently studied better understand allows organism protein survive harsh conditions learning lets organisms survive harsh conditions researchers better synthesize molecules industry harder denature two dna strands held together base pairing allows nucleotide bases adenosine bind thymine guanine g bind cytosine c proposed thermophilic archaea would expected higher gc content within dna gc pairings three hydrogen bonds pairings two increasing number hydrogen bonds would increase stability dna thereby increasing energy required separate two strands dna would help dna remain double stranded high temperatures would normally provide enough thermal energy separate dna strands p fumarii first sequenced diversa corporation sequence released public data analysis showed gc content supports hypothesis thermophiles experience selective pressure increase gc content order stabilize dna however research conclusively supported hypothesis study done hurst merchant showed correlation higher gc content prokaryotes increased optimal growing temperatures however analysis show higher gc content third nucleic acid within codon demonstrates within wobble position likely selective pressure hydrogen bonds increase stability within dna less selective pressure gc pairings within dna whole supports seen p fumarii majority dna composed g c nucleotides dna still contains many nucleotides results likely indicate along increasing gc pairing wobble position thermophilic archaea mechanisms stabilizing dna high temperatures one possible mechanism stabilizing

plays role dna stabilization hyperthermophilic archaea special strategies coping dna damage including essential requirement key proteins employed process homologous recombinational dna also dna exchange occurs archaeal hyperthermophiles exchange likely plays role repair genomic dna via homologous recombination process could crucial conditions damage dna high microbes ranging smallest bacteria largest multicellular eukaryote contains membrane phospholipids phospholipid molecule composed long fatty acid often called tail molecule phosphate group serves head molecule phospholipid membranes range widely structure fatty acid tail composed mostly hydrocarbons phospholipid molecules form bilayers polar phosphate groups facing aqueous solution inside outside cell hydrocarbons facing inward interacting membrane along proteins controls molecules allowed cell reason membrane plays crucial role survival cell faulty membrane allow many solutes cell resulting cell death different organisms devised different strategies control goes cell bacteria eukaryotic cells contain phospholipid bilayers containing ester linkages archaea contain ether linkages mechanisms work well organisms live mesophilic environments work extremophiles mesophiles organisms live within relatively moderate temperatures organisms live around sea level survive around temperatures humans extremophiles organisms grow best extremely cold acidic basic hot environments p fumarii hyperthermophile indicating organism grows best extremely high temperatures p fumarii grows best due extremely high temperatures archaea subjected organism must extremely stable biomolecules survive without increased stability membrane cell would fall apart many molecules would flow membrane destroying chemical gradients cell uses energy letting proteins cell synthesized diffuse away stopping metabolic processes deal problem archaea changed membrane lipid compositions still contain phosphate groups long fatty acid tails also contain ether linkages instead ester linkages ether linkages make bonds phosphate groups hydrocarbons stable carbon connecting phosphate group glycerol molecule electronrich would ester making carbon less electrophilic therefore less chemically reactive lets etherlinked phospholipid stable less susceptible breakdown large amounts increased thermal energy contributes archaeas ability live extreme environments another membrane adaptation seen archaea tetraether phospholipids specific adaptation found p fumarii along hyperthermophiles tetraether phospholipid molecule containing two hydrocarbon tails coming one ester bond one phosphate molecule phospholipids form monolayers instead typical bilayers seen bacteria eukaryotes therefore instead two different molecules interacting one molecule spans entire width membrane monolayer allows tighter packing molecules within membrane fewer molecules must fit membrane however large molecules less able move within membrane decreases membrane fluidity allowing cell keep molecules crossing membrane extremely important adaptation high temperatures molecules move quickly mesophilic temperatures decreasing membrane fluidity cell decrease movement phospholipid molecules stops unwanted movement molecules across membrane another extremely important membrane regulation modification archaea use control influx efflux solutes addition cyclopentane rings within hydrocarbon tails esterlinked phospholipids addition rings membrane allows even tighter packing membrane molecules cyclopentane rings exist tetraether lipids diether lipids increasing number atoms middle membrane less space solutes move cell helps control amount solutes moving cell cyclopentane rings help crowd membranes inner structure making difficult solutes get membrane side cell important cell hyperthermophilic conditions solutes travel fast carrying lot thermal energy environment cell rings many unwanted molecules would likely pass membrane either cell would result slowing complete stop metabolic processes resulting cell death cyclopentane rings extremely useful keeping unwanted solutes entering leaving cell archaea use even seen psychrophiles archaea require cold conditions survive counterintuitive cyclopentane molecules help make membrane rigid something happens naturally unclear rings seen ends temperature spectrum clear serve functions simply slowing molecules entering leaving cell organisms like p fumarii live harsh environments archaea needed devise unusual ways gather energy environment protect heat stress p fumarii like plants able harvest environment build biomolecules unlike plants take electrons instead transfer electrons type metabolic process classified chemolithoautrophism meaning carbon
