absorbent rat known deliberately chew roots bark poisonarrow tree acokanthera schimperi contains ouabain rat chewed tree instead swallowing poison slathers resulting masticate onto specialised flank

kenyans tanzanians rwandans ethiopians somalis would use arrow poison extracted branches leaves plant boiling fire arrows would dipped concentrated black tarlike juice often certain magical additives also mixed ouabain extract order make poison work according hunters wishes kenya giriama langulu poison makers would add elephant shrew poison mixture order facilitate pursuit observed elephant shrew would always run straight ahead follow direct path thought properties would transferred poison poisonous arrow made shrew thought cause hunted animal behave like shrew run straight path rwanda members nyambo tribe also known poison arrow makers harvest aconkathera plants according many dead insects found dead insects shrub indicating higher potency although ouabain used arrow poison primarily hunting also used battle one example occurred battle portuguese stormed mombasa portuguese records indicated suffered great deal poisoned european imperial expansion exploration africa overlapped rise
