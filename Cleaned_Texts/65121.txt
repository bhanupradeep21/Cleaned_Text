subjects tested using tapping task used fingers tap specific sequence numbers keyboard performances measured accuracy speed fingertapping task used simulate learning motor skill first group tested retested hours later awake finally tested another hours later sleep group tested retested hours later sleep retested hours later awake results showed groups slight improvement wake session significant

memory decrement results specifically loss stage rem declarative memory also shown benefit sleep way procedural memory declarative memories benefit slowwaves nrem conducted subjects learned word pairs results showed sleep prevents decay memory also actively fixates declarative two groups learned word pairs either slept stayed awake tested two groups thing except also learned interference pairs

people reanalyze memories patterns brain activity occur learning found occur sleep faster one way sleep strengthens memories weeding less successful connections neurons brain weeding essential prevent
