periodic limb movement disorder plmd sleep disorder patient moves limbs involuntarily periodically sleep symptoms problems related movement plmd confused restless legs syndrome rls characterized voluntary response urge move legs due discomfort plmd hand involuntary patient often unaware movements altogether periodic limb movements plms occurring daytime period found considered symptom rls plms sleep suggest diagnosis periodic limb movement disorder characterized recurrent episodes frequent limb movements sleeping mostly happens lower parts body like toes ankles knees hips also cases appear upper extremities body movements lead patient wake sleep interruption origin excessive daytime plmd characterized increased periodic limb movements sleep must coexist sleep disturbance functional impairment explicit causeeffect usually involuntary movements come lower extremities including toes ankles knees hips although also observed upper extremities plms seem common features within many people identifying whether movements clinically relevant distinct diagnosis plmd remains challenge clinical scientific moreover diagnosis plmd used narcolepsy restless legs syndrome rls rem sleep behaviour disorder rbd untreated obstructive sleep apnea osa already diagnosed since abnormal movements sleep frequent people plmd often excessive daytime sleepiness eds falling asleep day trouble falling asleep night difficulty staying asleep throughout night patients also display involuntary limb movements occur periodic intervals anywhere seconds apart often last first half night nonrem sleep stages movements occur rem muscle atonia plms unilateral bilateral really symmetrical plms often symptom rls evidence differences two sleep disorders found literature sleep structure differed rls patients significantly rem sleep less stage sleep compared plmd patients besides plmi significantly higher patients mostly unknown causes plmd many cases patient also medical problems parkinsons disease narcolepsy medical agents must taken consideration several psychopharmacological drugs serotonergic tricyclic antidepressants venlafaxine mirtazapine heighten risk women presence musculoskeletal disease heart disease obstructive sleep apnea cataplexy physical activities close bedtime presence mental disorder significantly associated higher risk plmd restless legs plms seems origin spinal fact plms suggested associated increased spinal reflexes manifestations plms seem occur mostly disorders associated dopaminergic hypothesis low ferritin levels adult population raised explain plmd increased rls severity increased plms significantly correlated low ferritin levels research evidence suggested iron possibly contributing plmd thus lack iron may induce inhibition dopamine formation might underlie people plmd often know cause excessive daytime sleepiness limb movements reported spouse sleep partner plmd diagnosed polysomnogram psg alone necessary obtain full medical history taking account available polysomnography recognized assessment method brings precise information sleep quality sleep structure physiological parameters sleep respiration heart rate movements therefore diagnostic plmd usually established laboratory settings people usually ignore cause daytime impairments plms sleep mostly found laboratory examination rather clinical videopolysomnography may recommended distinguish plms leg movements sleep time may similar plms comes duration pattern measures psg allocated diagnostic plmd essentially based electromyography emg measuring muscle activity emg electrodes usually placed anterior tibialis recent studies showed actigraphy may combined psg screening tool plmd diagnosis actigraphs watchshaped devices usually worn adult population wrist used record sleep wake periods least week recent actigraphy devices allow precise recordings helps evaluating actual movements meet diagnostic criteria plmd recent studies showed actigraph records reflect quite accurately plmi crucial diagnosis intermovement intervals frequency plms movement must happen within second interval previous movement periodic limb movement index plmi corresponds number periodic limb movements per hour must movements per hour adults movements per hour diagnosis plmd requires visible causeeffect relationship plms observed sleep disturbance daytime impairment disturbance impairment clinically relevant causes insomnia hypersomnia ruled diagnosing plmd importantly anxiety obstructive sleep apnea furthermore symptoms better explained differential diagnosis important differentiate plmd leg movements sleep plmd classified third edition international classification sleep disorders presents current sleep disorders nosology divided sections plmd classified sleeprelated movement disorders updates diagnosis simple complaint longer enough significant clinical impairment sleep impairments need clearly caused plms symptoms also need explained solely plmd effectively treated dopaminergic agents pramipexole ropinirole cabergoline rotigotine found patients low ferritin level respond well oral iron adverse effects agents reported include occurrence restless leg syndrome triggered medication well cortical arousals cause disturbed patients must stay medications order experience relief known cure disorder plms tend exacerbated tricyclic antidepressants ssris stress sleep deprivation also advised consume caffeine alcohol antidepressants substances could worsen plmd symptoms medications aimed reducing eliminating leg jerks arousals prescribed nonergot derived dopaminergic medications pramipexole ropinirole dopaminergic agents cocareldopa cobeneldopa pergolide lisuride may also used medications decrease eliminate leg jerks arousals medications also successful treatment restless legs syndrome one study cocareldopa superior dextropropoxyphene decreasing number leg kicks number arousals per hour sleep however cocareldopa lesser extent pergolide may shift leg movements nighttime clonazepam doses mg shown improve objective subjective measures hypothesis presented supplementation magnesium use plmd improvement due evidence therapeutic effects magnesium normal magnesium level patients insomnia evidence magnesium pathomechanisms plmd yet found however remains insufficient evidences related efficacy pharmacological treatment plmd use based dopaminergic medication effect therefore careful clinical monitoring pharmacological use plmd plmd estimated occur approximately adults aged common elderly especially females experiencing plmd appears related restless legs syndrome rls study people found rls also however opposite true many people plms also restless legs plmd uncommon childhood disorder based adult criteria psg analysis studies showed prevalence isolated plmd children population comorbidity also evidence children plmi periodic limb movements sleep associated lower quality
