horse behavior best understood view horses prey animals welldeveloped fightorflight response first reaction threat often flee although sometimes stand ground defend offspring cases flight untenable foal would nonetheless physiology horses also suited number work entertainmentrelated tasks humans domesticated horses thousands years ago used humans ever since selective breeding breeds horses bred quite docile particularly certain large draft horses hand light horse riding breeds developed speed agility alertness endurance building natural qualities extended wild ancestors horses instincts used human advantage create bond human horse techniques vary part art horse training horses evolved small mammals whose survival depended ability flee predators example wolves big cats survival mechanism still exists modern domestic horse humans removed many predators life domestic horse however first instinct frightened escape running possible horse resorts biting kicking striking rearing protect many horses natural behavior patterns herdformation social facilitation activities directly related prey fightorflight response involves nervous impulses result hormone secretions bloodstream horse reacts threat may initially freeze preparation take fightorflight reaction begins amygdala triggers neural response hypothalamus initial reaction followed activation pituitary gland secretion hormone adrenal gland activated almost simultaneously releases neurotransmitters epinephrine adrenaline norepinephrine noradrenaline release chemical messengers results production hormone cortisol increases

horses linear dominance newer research shows pecking order horse herds free ranging wild horses mostly communicating via positive reinforcement less via horses able form companionship attachments species animals well notably humans fact many domesticated horses become anxious flighty hard manage isolated horses kept nearcomplete isolation particularly closed stable see animals may require stable companion cat goat even small pony donkey provide company reduce stress anxiety separation occurs horse handled human horse described herdbound however proper training horses learn comfortable away horses often learn trust human handler horses able trust human handler since possible form interspecies herds humans part horse herd hierarchy therefore never take place leadmares leadstallions feral wild horse herds usually made several separate small bands share territory size may range two individuals mostly mares offspring one five bands defined harem model band led dominant mare sometimes called lead mare boss composition bands changes young animals driven natal band join bands stallions challenge dominance bands usually single herd lead stallion though occasionally lessdominant males may remain fringes reproductive success lead stallion determined part ability prevent males mating mares harem stallion also exercises protective behavior patrolling around band taking initiative band encounters potential stability band affected size tends stable subordinate stallions attached modern reintroduced populations przewalskis horse remaining truly wild horse family groups formed one adult stallion one three mares common offspring stay family group longer dependent usually two three years old horses evolved live herds many animals live large groups establishment stable hierarchical system pecking order important reduce aggression increase group cohesion often always linear system nonlinear hierarchies horse may dominant horse b dominant horse c yet horse c may dominant horse dominance depend variety factors including individuals need particular resource given time therefore variable throughout lifetime herd individual animal horses may dominant resources others may submissive resources part natural horse behavior forced humans forcing horses live together limited space limited resources called dominant horses often horses dysfunctional social abilities caused human intervention early lives weaning stable isolation etccitation needed dominance hierarchy established horses often travel rank young horses wild allowed stay herd reach sexual maturity usually first second year studies wild herds shown herd stallion usually drive colts fillies may instinct prevents inbreeding fillies usually join another band soon afterward colts driven several herds usually join small bachelor groups able establish dominance older stallion another contrary popular belief herd stallion ruler harem females though usually engages herding protective behavior rather horse tends lead wild feral herd commonly dominant mare guides herd food water controls daily routine movement herd ensures general wellbeing recent supplemental theory posits distributed leadership single individual universal herd leader study horses italy described feral researcher observed herd movements may initiated individual although higherranked members followed often herd stallions tend stay periphery herd fight predators males herd travels stallion usually rear apparently drives straggling herd members forward keeping herd together mares lowerranked males usually engage herding mating season stallions tend act aggressively keep mares within herd however time stallion relaxed spends much time guarding herd scentmarking manure piles urination spots communicate dominance herd domesticated stallions human management often mate cover mares year possible wild traditionally thoroughbred stud farms limited stallions breeding mares year breeding mares peak estrous cycle thoroughbred stallions mated mares per year use artificial insemination one stallion could potentially sire thousands offspring annually though practice economic considerations usually limit number foals breeders keep horses seminatural conditions single stallion amongst group mares referred pasture breeding young immature stallions kept separate bachelor herd advantages less intensive labor human caretakers fulltime turnout living pasture may psychologically healthy horses pasture breeding presents risk injury valuable breeding stock stallions mares particularly unfamiliar animals added herd also raises questions mare bred may also raise questions parentage foals therefore keeping stallions natural herd common especially breeding farms mating multiple stallions mares herds natural herds often kept farms closed herds ie one stallions stable mare herd mares herds mature domesticated stallions commonly kept stable small paddock stallions stabled manner allows visual tactile communication often challenge another sometimes attempt fight therefore stallions often kept isolated reduce risk injury disruption rest stable stallions provided access paddocks often corridor paddocks stallions touch cases stallions released exercise different times day ensure see hear another avoid stable vices associated isolation stallions provided nonhorse companion castrated donkey goat godolphin arabian particularly fond barn catcitation needed many domesticated stallions become aggressive tolerate close presence male horse without fighting tolerate gelding companion particularly one calm temperament one example racehorse seabiscuit lived gelding companion named stallions may tolerate close presence immature less dominant stallion stallions mares often compete together horse shows horse races however stallions generally must kept away close contact mares avoid unintentional unplanned matings away stallions minimize fighting dominance horses lined award presentations shows handlers keep stallions least one horse length animal stallions taught ignore mares stallions close proximity working stallions live peacefully bachelor herds wild natural management settings example stallions new forest uk live bachelor herds winter grazing pastures managed domesticated animals farms assert carefully managed social contact benefits stallions welltempered stallions intended kept together long period may stabled closer proximity though method stabling generally used experienced stable managers example stallions spanish riding school travel train stabled close proximity settings dominant animals kept apart stabling young less dominant stallion stall domestication horse usually requires stallions isolated horses either mares geldings may become dominant domestic herd usually dominance cases matter age extent temperament common older animals dominant though old weak animals may lose rank herd also studies suggesting foal inherit perhaps imprint dominance behavior dam maturity seek obtain rank later herd mother held horse young studies domesticated horses indicate horses appear benefit strong female presence herd groupings geldings herds gelding dominant rest herd example mares herd quite young low status may anxious group less relaxed mare horses communicate various ways including vocalizations nickering squealing whinnying touch mutual grooming nuzzling smell body language horses use combination ear position neck head height movement foot stomping tail swishing discipline maintained horse herd first body language gestures needed physical contact biting kicking nudging means forcing misbehaving herd member move cases animal successfully causes another move dominant whether uses body language adds physical reinforcement horses interpret body language creatures including humans view predators socialized human contact horses usually respond humans nonthreatening predator humans always understand however may behave way particularly using aggressive discipline resembles attacking predator triggers horses fightorflight response hand humans exhibit fear horse horse may interpret behavior human submission authority horse placing human subordinate role horses mind may lead horse behave dominant aggressive fashion human handlers successful learn properly interpret horses body language temper responses accordingly methods horse training explicitly instruct horse handlers behave ways horse interpret behavior trusted leader herd thus willingly comply commands human handler methods encourage operant conditioning teach horse respond desired way human body language also teach handlers recognize meaning horse body language horses particularly vocal four basic vocalizations neigh whinny nicker squeal may also make sighing grunting groaning noises ear position often one obvious behaviors humans notice interpreting horse body language general horse direct pinna ear toward source input also looking horses narrow range binocular vision thus horse ears forward generally concentrating something front similarly horse turns ears forward degree tension horses pinna suggests animal calmly attentive surroundings tensely observing potential danger however horses strong monocular vision possible horse position one ear forward one ear back indicative similar divided visual attention behavior often observed horses working humans need simultaneously focus attention handler surroundings horse may turn pinna back also seeing something coming behind due nature horses vision head position may indicate animal focusing attention focus distant object horse raise head focus object close especially ground horse lower nose carry head nearvertical position eyes rolled point white eye visible often indicates fear anger ear position head height body language may change reflect emotional status well example clearest signal horse sends ears flattened tightly back head sometimes eyes rolled white eye shows often indicative pain anger frequently foreshadowing aggressive behavior soon follow sometimes ears laid back especially accompanied strongly swishing tail stomping pawing feet signals used horse express discomfort irritation impatience anxiety however horses ears slightly turned back loose position may drowsing bored fatigued simply relaxed horse raises head neck animal alert often tense lowered head neck may sign relaxation depending behaviors may also indicate fatigue illness tail motion may also form communication slight tail swishing often tool dislodge biting insects skin irritants however aggressive tailswishing may indicate either irritation pain anger tail tucked tightly body may indicate discomfort due cold cases pain horse may demonstrate tension excitement raising tail also flaring nostrils snorting intently focusing eyes ears source concern horse use mouth communicate degree uses ears tail mouth gestures meaning beyond eating grooming biting irritation bared teeth noted expression anger imminent attempt bite horses particularly foals sometimes indicate appeasement aggressive herd member extending necks clacking teeth horses making chewing motion food mouth soothing mechanism possibly linked release tension though horse trainers view expression submission horses sometimes extend upper lip scratched particularly good spot mouth touches something time lip teeth may move mutual grooming gesture relaxed sleeping horse may loose lower lip chin may extend upper lip curled lip flehmen response noted often seen stallions usually response smell another horses urine may exhibited horses sex horses also assorted mouth motions response bit riders hands indicating relaxation acceptance others
