leukemia also spelled leukaemia pronounced lookeemee…ô group blood cancers usually begin bone marrow result high numbers abnormal blood blood cells fully developed called blasts leukemia symptoms may include bleeding bruising bone pain fatigue fever increased risk symptoms occur due lack normal blood diagnosis typically made blood tests bone marrow exact cause leukemia combination genetic factors environmental noninherited factors believed play risk factors include smoking ionizing radiation petrochemicals benzene prior chemotherapy people family history leukemia also higher four main types lymphoblastic leukemia acute myeloid leukemia aml chronic lymphocytic leukemia cll chronic myeloid leukemia well number less common leukemias lymphomas belong broader group tumors affect blood bone marrow lymphoid system known tumors hematopoietic lymphoid treatment may involve combination chemotherapy radiation therapy targeted therapy bone marrow transplant addition supportive care palliative care certain types leukemia may managed watchful success treatment depends type leukemia age person outcomes improved developed fiveyear survival rate united children firstworld countries fiveyear survival rate greater even depending type children acute leukemia cancerfree five years cancer unlikely leukemia present million people worldwide caused newly developed common type cancer children threequarters leukemia cases children acute lymphoblastic however leukemias diagnosed adults cll aml common occurs commonly developed clinically pathologically leukemia subdivided variety large groups first division acute chronic additionally diseases subdivided according kind blood cell affected divides leukemias lymphoblastic lymphocytic leukemias myeloid myelogenous combining two classifications provides total four main categories within main categories typically several subcategories finally rarer types usually considered outside classification common symptoms children easy bruising pale skin fever enlarged spleen damage bone marrow way displacing normal bone marrow cells higher numbers immature white blood cells results lack blood platelets important blood clotting process means people leukemia may easily become bruised bleed excessively develop pinprick bleeds white blood cells involved fighting pathogens may suppressed dysfunctional could cause persons immune system unable fight simple infection start attacking body cells leukemia prevents immune system working normally people experience frequent infection ranging infected tonsils sores mouth diarrhea lifethreatening pneumonia opportunistic finally red blood cell deficiency leads anemia may cause dyspnea people experience symptoms fevers chills night sweats weakness limbs feeling fatigued common flulike symptoms people experience nausea feeling fullness due enlarged liver spleen result unintentional weight loss blasts affected disease may come together become swollen liver lymph nodes causing pain leading leukemic cells invade central nervous system neurological symptoms notably headaches occur uncommon neurological symptoms like migraines seizures coma occur result brain stem pressure symptoms associated leukemia attributed diseases consequently leukemia always diagnosed medical tests word leukemia means white blood derived characteristic high white blood cell count presents affected people treatment high number white blood cells apparent blood sample viewed microscope extra white blood cells frequently immature dysfunctional excessive number cells also interfere level cells causing harmful imbalance blood people diagnosed leukemia high white blood cell counts visible regular blood count lesscommon condition called aleukemia bone marrow still contains cancerous white blood cells disrupt normal production blood cells remain marrow instead entering bloodstream would visible blood test person aleukemia white blood cell counts bloodstream normal low aleukemia occur four major types leukemia particularly common hairy cell studies shown positive correlation exposure formaldehyde development leukemia particularly myeloid different leukemias likely different leukemia like cancers results mutations dna certain mutations trigger leukemia activating oncogenes deactivating tumor suppressor genes thereby disrupting regulation cell death differentiation division mutations may occur spontaneously result exposure radiation carcinogenic among adults known causes natural artificial ionizing radiation petrochemicals notably benzene alkylating chemotherapy agents previous use tobacco associated small increase risk developing acute myeloid leukemia cohort casecontrol studies linked exposure petrochemicals hair dyes development forms leukemia diet limited effect although eating vegetables may confer small protective viruses also linked forms leukemia example human tlymphotropic virus causes adult tcell cases maternalfetal transmission baby acquires leukemia mother leukemia pregnancy children born mothers use fertility drugs induce ovulation twice likely develop leukemia childhoods recent systematic review metaanalysis type leukemia neonates using phototherapy typically treat neonatal jaundice statistically significant association detected using phototherapy myeloid leukemia however still questionable whether phototherapy genuinely cause cancer simply result underlying factors gave rise cancer large doses emission nuclear reactor accidents nicknamed bone seeker increases risk bone cancer leukemia animals presumed people genetic predisposition towards developing leukemia predisposition demonstrated family histories twin affected people may single gene multiple genes common cases families tend develop kinds leukemia members families affected people may develop different forms leukemia related blood addition genetic issues people chromosomal abnormalities certain genetic conditions greater risk example people syndrome significantly increased risk developing forms acute leukemia especially acute myeloid leukemia fanconi anemia risk factor developing acute myeloid mutation gene associated predisposition childhood chronic myelogenous leukemia associated genetic abnormality called philadelphia translocation people cml carry philadelphia mutation although exclusive cml observed people types whether nonionizing radiation causes leukemia studied several decades international agency research cancer expert working group undertook detailed review data static extremely low frequency electromagnetic energy occurs naturally association generation transmission use electrical concluded limited evidence high levels elf magnetic electric fields might cause cases childhood evidence relationship leukemia another form malignancy adults since exposure levels elfs relatively uncommon world health organization concludes elf exposure later proven causative would account cases worldwide year representing total incidence childhood leukemia year diagnosis usually based repeated complete blood counts bone marrow examination following observations symptoms sometimes blood tests may show person leukemia especially early stages disease remission lymph node biopsy performed diagnose certain types leukemia certain following diagnosis blood chemistry tests used determine degree liver kidney damage effects chemotherapy person concerns arise damages due leukemia doctors may use xray mri ultrasound potentially show leukemias effects body parts bones xray brain mri kidneys spleen liver ultrasound ct scans used check lymph nodes chest though despite use methods diagnose whether person leukemia many people diagnosed many symptoms vague nonspecific refer diseases reason american cancer society estimates least onefifth people leukemia yet forms leukemia treated pharmaceutical medication typically combined multidrug chemotherapy regimen also treated radiation therapy cases bone marrow transplant effective management directed towards control bone marrow systemic wholebody disease additionally treatment must prevent leukemic cells spreading sites particularly central nervous system cns eg monthly lumbar

individuals cllrelated complications advanced disease often benefit treatment general indications treatment cll cases incurable present treatments treatment directed towards suppressing disease many years rather curing primary chemotherapeutic plan combination chemotherapy chlorambucil cyclophosphamide plus corticosteroid prednisone prednisolone use corticosteroid additional benefit suppressing related autoimmune diseases immunohemolytic anemia immunemediated thrombocytopenia resistant cases singleagent treatments nucleoside drugs pentostatin cladribine may successful younger healthier people may choose allogeneic autologous bone marrow transplantation hope permanent many different anticancer drugs effective treatment aml treatments vary somewhat according age person according specific subtype aml overall strategy control bone marrow systemic wholebody disease offering specific treatment central nervous system cns general oncologists rely combinations drugs initial induction phase chemotherapy combination chemotherapy usually offers benefits early remission lower risk disease resistance consolidation maintenance treatments intended prevent disease recurrence consolidation treatment often entails repetition induction chemotherapy intensification chemotherapy additional drugs contrast maintenance treatment involves drug doses lower administered induction many possible treatments cml standard care newly diagnosed people imatinib gleevec compared anticancer drugs relatively side effects taken orally home drug people able keep disease check least five cml becomes chronic manageable condition advanced uncontrolled state person tolerate imatinib person wishes attempt permanent cure allogeneic bone marrow transplantation may performed procedure involves highdose chemotherapy radiation followed infusion bone marrow compatible donor approximately people die decision treat people hairy cell leukemia symptomfree typically receive immediate treatment treatment generally considered necessary person shows signs symptoms low blood cell counts eg infectionfighting neutrophil count k¬µl frequent infections unexplained bruises anemia fatigue significant enough disrupt persons everyday typical treatment approach people need treatment usually receive either one week cladribine given daily intravenous infusion simple injection skin six months pentostatin given every four weeks intravenous infusion cases one round treatment produce prolonged treatments include rituximab infusion selfinjection interferonalpha limited cases person may benefit splenectomy removal spleen treatments typically given first treatment success rates lower cladribine people tcell prolymphocytic leukemia rare aggressive leukemia median survival less one year require immediate tcell prolymphocytic leukemia difficult treat respond available chemotherapeutic many different treatments attempted limited success certain people purine analogues pentostatin fludarabine cladribine chlorambucil various forms combination chemotherapy cyclophosphamide doxorubicin vincristine prednisone chop cyclophosphamide vincristine prednisone cop vincristine doxorubicin prednisone etoposide cyclophosphamide bleomycin vapecb alemtuzumab campath monoclonal antibody attacks white blood cells used treatment greater success previous people successfully respond treatment
