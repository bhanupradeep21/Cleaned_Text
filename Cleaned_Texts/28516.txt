cardiac catheterization heart cath insertion catheter chamber vessel heart done diagnostic interventional purposes common example cardiac catheterization coronary catheterization involves catheterization coronary arteries coronary artery disease myocardial infarctions heart attacks catheterization often performed special laboratories fluoroscopy highly maneuverable tables cath labs often equipped cabinets catheters stents balloons etc various sizes increase efficiency monitors show fluoroscopy imaging electrocardiogram ecg pressure waves coronary angiography diagnostic procedure allows visualization coronary vessels fluoroscopy used visualize lumens arteries projection arteries show narrowing blockage techniques exist open arteries percutaneous coronary intervention blanket

catheter enters heart enters coronary arteries coronary arteries known epicardial vessels located epicardium outermost layer use fluoroscopy requires radiopaque contrast rare cases lead contrastinduced kidney injury see contrastinduced nephropathy people constantly exposed low doses ionizing radiation ideal table positioning xray source receiver radiation monitoring via thermoluminescent dosimetry two main ways reducing persons exposure people certain comorbidities people one condition time higher risk adverse events cardiac catheterization comorbidity conditions
