genetically modified plants engineered scientific research create new colours plants deliver vaccines create enhanced crops plant genomes engineered physical methods use agrobacterium delivery sequences hosted tdna binary vectors many plant cells pluripotent meaning single cell mature plant harvested right conditions form new plant ability often taken advantage genetic engineers selecting cells successfully transformed adult plant grown multiple new plants containing transgene every cell process known tissue much advances field genetic engineering come experimentation tobacco major advances tissue culture plant cellular mechanisms wide range plants originated systems developed first plant genetically engineered considered model organism genetic engineering range transgenic tools procedures well established making one easiest plants another major model organism relevant genetic engineering arabidopsis thaliana small genome short life cycle makes easy manipulate contains many homologs important crop first plant sequenced abundant bioinformatic resources transformed simply dipping flower transformed agrobacterium research plants engineered help discover functions certain genes simplest way remove gene see phenotype develops compared wild type form differences possibly result missing gene unlike mutagenisis genetic engineering allows targeted removal without disrupting genes genes expressed certain tissue reporter genes like gus attached gene interest allowing visualisation ways test gene alter slightly return plant see still effect phenotype strategies include attaching gene strong promoter see happens expressed forcing gene expressed different location different developmental genetically modified plants purely ornamental modified flower color fragrance flower shape plant first genetically modified ornamentals commercialised altered carnations released popular genetically modified organism blue rose actually lavender mauve created roses sold japan united states genetically modified ornamentals include chrysanthemum well increasing aesthetic value plans develop ornamentals use less water resistant cold would allow grown outside natural proposed genetically modify plant species threatened extinction resistant invasive plants diseases emerald ash borer north american fungal disease ceratocystis platani european plane papaya ringspot virus prsv devastated papaya trees hawaii twentieth century transgenic papaya plants given pathogenderived however genetic modification conservation plants remains mainly speculative unique concern transgenic species may longer bear enough resemblance original species truly claim original species conserved instead transgenic species may genetically different enough considered new species thus diminishing conservation worth genetic genetically modified crops genetically modified plants used agriculture first crops provided used animal human food provide resistance certain pests diseases environmental conditions spoilage chemical treatments eg resistance second generation crops aimed improve quality often altering nutrient profile third generation genetically modified crops used nonfood purposes including production pharmaceutical agents biofuels industrially useful goods well three main aims agricultural advancement increased production improved conditions agricultural workers sustainability gm crops contribute improving harvests reducing insect pressure increasing nutrient value tolerating different abiotic stresses despite potential commercialised crops limited mostly cash crops like cotton soybean maize canola vast majority introduced traits provide either herbicide tolerance insect soybeans accounted half genetically modified crops planted adoption farmers rapid total surface area land cultivated gm crops increased factor square kilometers acres million geographically though spread uneven strong growth americas parts asia little europe socioeconomic spread even approximately worldwide gm crops grown developing countries majority gm crops modified resistant selected herbicides usually glyphosate glufosinate based one genetically modified crops engineered resist herbicides available conventionally bred resistant usa soybeans gm maize grown glyphosate currently available genes used engineer insect resistance come bacillus thuringiensis bacterium form delta endotoxin genes known cry proteins use genes encode vegetative insecticidal gene commercially used provide insect protection originate b thuringiensis cowpea trypsin inhibitor cpti cpti first approved use cotton currently undergoing trials less one percent gm crops contained traits include providing virus resistance delaying senescence modifying flower colour altering plants golden rice well known gm crop aimed increasing nutrient value engineered three genes biosynthesise betacarotene precursor vitamin edible parts intended produce fortified food grown consumed areas shortage dietary vitamin deficiency year estimated kill children age cause additional cases irreversible childhood original golden rice produced carotenoids development increasing gained first approvals use

include cytokines hormones antibodies enzymes vaccines accumulated plant seeds many drugs also contain natural plant ingredients pathways lead production genetically altered transferred plant species produce greater volume better options bioreactors unlike bacteria plants modify proteins posttranslationally allowing make complex molecules also pose less risk therapeutics cultured transgenic carrot tobacco including drug treatment gauchers vaccine production storage great potential transgenic plants vaccines expensive produce transport administer system could produce locally would allow greater access poorer developing well purifying vaccines expressed plants also possible produce edible vaccines plants edible vaccines stimulate immune system ingested protect certain diseases stored plants reduces longterm cost disseminated without need cold storage need purified long term stability also housed within plant cells provides protection gut acids upon digestion cost developing regulating
