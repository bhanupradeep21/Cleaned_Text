dysgeusia also known parageusia distortion sense taste dysgeusia also often associated ageusia complete lack taste hypogeusia decrease taste alteration taste smell may secondary process various disease states may primary symptom distortion sense taste symptom diagnosis usually complicated since sense taste tied together sensory systems common causes include chemotherapy asthma treatment albuterol zinc deficiency liver disease hypothyroidism rarely certain types seizures also lead dysgeusia different drugs also responsible altering taste resulting dysgeusia due variety causes dysgeusia many possible treatments effective alleviating terminating symptoms include artificial saliva pilocarpine zinc supplementation alterations drug therapy alpha lipoic acid alterations sense taste usually metallic taste sometimes smell major cause dysgeusia chemotherapy cancer chemotherapy often induces damage oral cavity resulting oral mucositis oral infection salivary gland dysfunction oral mucositis consists inflammation mouth along sores ulcers healthy individuals normally diverse range microbial organisms residing oral cavities however chemotherapy permit typically nonpathogenic agents cause serious infection may result decrease saliva addition patients undergo radiation therapy also lose salivary saliva important component taste mechanism saliva interacts protects taste

cofactor alkaline phosphatase abundant enzyme taste bud membranes also component parotid salivary protein important development maintenance normal taste also wide variety drugs trigger dysgeusia including azelastine approximately drugs affect taste including paxlovid drug used treat describe socalled paxlovid mouth like mouthful dirty pennies rotten soymilk according wall street sodium channels linked taste receptors inhibited amiloride creation new taste buds saliva impeded antiproliferative saliva traces drug giving rise metallic flavor mouth examples include lithium carbonate drugs containing sulfhydryl groups including penicillamine captopril may react zinc cause metronidazole chlorhexidine found interact metal ions associate cell drugs act blocking system example antagonizing angiotensin ii receptor eprosartan linked case reports claiming calcium channel blockers like amlodipine also cause dysgeusia blocking calcium sensitive taste changes hormone levels pregnancy estrogen affect sense study found percent pregnant women reported change taste also known dry mouth syndrome precipitate dysgeusia normal salivary flow concentration necessary taste injury

often occurs unknown reasons wide range miscellaneous factors may contribute taste disorder gastric reflux lead poisoning diabetes minority pine nuts apparently cause taste disturbances reasons entirely proven certain pesticides damaging effects taste buds nerves mouth pesticides include organochloride compounds carbamate pesticides damage peripheral nerves along injury chorda tympani branch facial nerve also cause surgical risk laryngoscopy tonsillectomy include patients burning mouth syndrome primarily menopausal women often dysgeusia sense taste based detection chemicals specialized taste cells mouth mouth throat larynx esophagus taste buds replaced every ten days taste bud contains receptor afferent nerves make contact receptor cells base taste single taste bud innervated several afferent nerves single efferent fiber innervates several taste fungiform papillae present anterior portion tongue circumvallate papillae foliate papillae found posterior portion tongue salivary glands responsible keeping taste buds moist single taste bud composed four types cells taste bud cells type cells thinly shaped usually periphery cells also contain high amounts chromatin

tasting spicy foods difficult examine sensations mediated individual addition gustatory dysfunction rare compared olfactory diagnosis dysgeusia begins patient questioned salivation swallowing chewing oral pain previous ear infections possibly indicated hearing balance problems oral hygiene stomach initial history assessment also considers possibility accompanying diseases diabetes mellitus hypothyroidism clinical examination conducted includes inspection tongue oral cavity furthermore ear canal inspected lesions chorda tympani predilection order classify extent dysgeusia clinically measure sense taste gustatory testing may performed gustatory testing performed either wholemouth procedure regional test techniques natural electrical stimuli used regional testing Âµl liquid stimulus presented anterior posterior tongue using pipette soaked filterpaper disks cotton whole mouth testing small quantities ml solution administered patient asked swish solution around threshold tests sucrose sweet citric acid sour sodium chloride salty quinine caffeine bitter frequently performed natural stimuli one frequently used techniques threedrop test three drops liquid presented subject one drops taste stimulus two drops pure threshold defined concentration patient identifies taste correctly three times suprathreshold tests provide intensities taste stimuli threshold levels used assess patients ability differentiate different intensities taste estimate magnitude suprathreshold loss taste tests ratings pleasantness obtained using either direct scaling magnitude matching method may value diagnosis dysgeusia direct scaling tests show ability discriminate among different intensities stimuli whether stimulus one quality sweet stronger weaker stimulus another quality direct scaling used determine taste stimulus perceived abnormal levels case magnitude matching used patient asked rate intensities taste stimuli stimuli another sensory system loudness tone similar example connecticut chemosensory clinical research center asks patients rate intensities nacl sucrose citric acid quininehcl stimuli loudness hz tests include identification discrimination common taste substances topical anesthesia tongue reported use diagnosis dysgeusia well since shown relieve symptoms dysgeusia addition techniques based administration chemicals tongue electrogustometry frequently used based induction gustatory sensations means anodal electrical direct current patients usually report sour metallic sensations similar associated touching poles live battery although electrogustometry widely used seems poor correlation electrically chemically induced certain diagnostic tools also used help determine extent dysgeusia electrophysiological tests simple reflex tests may applied identify abnormalities nervetobrainstem pathways example blink reflex may used evaluate integrity trigeminal nerve pathway may play role gustatory structural imaging routinely used investigate lesions taste pathway magnetic resonance imaging allows direct visualization cranial furthermore provides significant information type cause analysis mucosal blood flow oral cavity combination assessment autonomous cardiovascular factors appears useful diagnosis autonomic nervous system disorders burning mouth syndrome patients inborn disorders associated gustatory cell cultures
