halisaurus extinct genus marine reptile belonging mosasaur family holotype consisting angular basicranium fragment discovered near hornerstown new jersey already revealed relatively unique combination features prompted new genus described named othniel charles marsh means ocean lizard renamed marsh baptosaurus since believed name already preoccupied fish halosaurus according modern rules difference
