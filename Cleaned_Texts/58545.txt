banded mongoose mungos mungo mongoose species native sahel southern africa lives savannas open forests grasslands feeds primarily beetles millipedes mongooses use various types dens shelter including termite mounds mongoose species live solitary lives banded mongoose live colonies complex social structure banded mongoose sturdy mongoose large head small ears short muscular limbs long tail almost long rest body animals wetter areas larger darker colored animals dryer regions abdominal part body higher rounder breast area rough fur grayish brown black several dark brown black horizontal bars across back limbs snout darker underparts lighter rest body banded mongooses long strong claws allow dig soil nose color banded mongoose varies graybrown orangered adult animal reach length cm weight kg tail cm long viverra mungo scientific name proposed johann friedrich gmelin mongoose described earlier several centuries several naturalists described mongoose specimens proposed subspecies banded mongoose found large part east southeast southcentral africa also populations northern savannas west africa banded mongoose lives savannas open forests grassland especially near water also dry thorny bushland deserts species uses various types dens shelter commonly termite also live rock shelters thickets gullies warrens bushes mongooses prefer multientranced termitaria open thicket averaging nearest shelter located semiclosed contrast den dwarf mongoose banded mongoose dens less dependent vegetation cover banded mongooses live larger groups dwarf mongooses thus entrances means members

around three mongooses per southern kwazulunatal mongoose numbers similar density queen elizabeth national park much higher mongoose densities banded mongooses live mixedsex groups individuals average around groups sleep together night underground dens often abandoned termite mounds change dens frequently every days refuge available hardpressed predators african wild dogs group form compact arrangement lie heads facing outwards upwards generally strict hierarchy mongoose groups aggression low sometimes mongooses may squabble food however typically one claims food first wins aggression hierarchical behavior occurs males females oestrus females usually aggressive live hierarchies based age older females earlier estrous periods larger groups get large females forced group either older females males females may form new groups subordinate relations groups highly aggressive mongooses sometimes killed injured intergroup encounters nevertheless breeding females often mate males rival groups mongooses establish territories scent markings may also serve communication society banded mongoose clear separation mating rivals territorial rivals individuals within groups rivals mates neighboring groups competitors food banded mongooses feed primarily insects myriapods small reptiles birds millipedes beetles make also commonly eat ants crickets termites grasshoppers caterpillars prey items mongoose includes frogs lizards small snakes ground birds eggs birds reptiles occasions mongooses drink water rain pools lake banded mongoose forage groups member searches food however work team dealing venomous snakes cobras forage morning several hours rest shade usually forage late afternoon mongooses use sense smell locate prey dig long claws holes ground holes trees mongoose also
