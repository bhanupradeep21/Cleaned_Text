reinforcement theory limited effects media model applicable within realm communication theory generally states people seek remember information provides cognitive support preexisting attitudes beliefs main assumption guides theory people like wrong often feel uncomfortable beliefs challenged additionally theory focuses behavior consequence connection within abc model theory management also referred operant conditioning law effect quite simply theory notes behavior continue certain level frequency based pleasant unpleasant results politics provides excellent setting study reinforcement theory statistics undecided voters indicate people preexisting beliefs comes politics relatively people remain undecided late highprofile elections example month prior us presidential election less onefifth likely voters claimed undecided sidoti much political advertising targeted individuals importance overall result also susceptible political persuasion johnsoncartee copeland part reason undecided voters frequent message targets found reinforcement theory reinforcement theory predicts people already developed opinions selectively attend cognitively incorporate information supports views reinforcement theory three primary mechanisms behind selective exposure selective perception selective retention primary basis selective exposure assumption located within cognitive dissonance theory although contemporary work knoblochwesterwick draws numerous theories basically theory states people like previouslyheld beliefs challenged individuals encounter information discrepant opinions seek resolve resultant disharmony somehow people general like wrong change shift attitude sometimes interpreted admission original belief inaccurate inadequate avoid opinions challenged research indicates people tend simply avoid information might discrepant nature johnsoncartee copeland support tendency avoid dissonant messages also found mood management theory basically theory states people expose stimuli pleasurable avoid stimuli might induce negative reaction zillman bryant selective exposure phenomenon focuses people manage avoid incongruent information primarily encounter information supports predispositions obviously able completely avoid potentially challenging information cases message receivers may outright reject dissonant messages wheeless reasons rejection varied plentiful example person might justify message rejection attacking sources credibility topic emotional involving political preference especially subject selective exposure phenomenon fact lazarsfeld berelson gaudet found selective exposure early necessary link theory campaigns primarily reinforce activate preexisting political notions everincreasing number media options facilitates publics ability selectively expose desired media messages explosion internet put individual drivers seat regard kind information encounter mcleod kosicki mcleod stated information selection exposure much specialized individualized p era world wide web furthermore cable channel options continue multiply specific niche target audiences mind researchers worry increased level fragmentation makes possible people effectively avoid diverse viewpoints perspectives mcleod kosicki mcleod person limits hisher information acquisition consistent personal point view surely contribute fully informed electorate possible completely avoid discrepant messages exposure dissonant message occurred phenomenon selective perception often follows process simply means people skew perceptions coincide desire johnsoncartee copeland perception subjective dependent several factors one factor example media type prior research indicates people actively process television news tend engage individualized explanations event opposed active processors newspapers mcleod kosicki mcleod selective perception discussed however done order reduce dissonance previously held beliefs wheeless several communication theories use assumption skewed perception basis ie hostile media phenomenon thirdperson effect political realm selective perception often occurs voters presented candidate position agree otherwise supports candidate sherrod found voters preferring particular candidate selectively perceive candidates position issue way make consistent p pinpointed three primary reasons initial disagreement happens first candidate voter may share political party affiliation may agree issues second voter may simply unaware candidates actual position third social pressure take particular stand issue may exist causes voter incongruent preferred candidate sherrod selective perception associated voter candidate affiliate selective perception also seen someone attacks political opponent focusing particular issue disagree voters ignore common stances issues opposition thus scorch opponent one main idea falcon example political selective perception seen barry ritholtzs politics selective perception chart chart given unemployment numbers specific points time different house majorities selective perception allows user view chart way feel deemed correct though chart doesnt reveal really anything politics unemployment ritholtz according sherrod three potential actions voter may take reduce dissonance situation first voter may learn candidates stand issue change either opinion candidate alter position issue question bring line second voter may still choose disagree preferred candidates position instead lessen issues personal importance last voter may engage selective perception actually misperceive candidates position align better voters stand actually require change attitude regarding either candidate issue part voter sherrods research found third option occur greatest frequency found voters often selectively misperceive candidates position issue rather either change ones view relegate issue status lesser importance final mechanism behind reinforcement theory selective retention recall phenomenon occurs people remember items agreement predispositions johnsoncartee copeland ease person recall information impacts level intensity judgment related topic example people easily recall example related message likely make intense judgment shrum general people unable accurately recall current event information presented news gunter found television news viewers could accurately recall details saw short time newscast audience factors education socioeconomic status also affect recall ability surlin gordon although additional variables news presentation format affect information retention people generally better remember messages consistent attitudes beliefs wheeless surlin gordon found political information particular readily retained summoned supports preexisting beliefs political opinions information threatens beliefs easily forgotten lost phenomenon also extends political advertising prior research found candidates supporters could easily bring mind hisher political
