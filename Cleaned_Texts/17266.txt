plant hormones phytohormones signal molecules produced within plants occur extremely low concentrations plant hormones control aspects plant growth development including regulation organ size pathogen stress reproductive unlike animals hormone production restricted specialized glands plant cell capable producing went thimann coined term phytohormone used title phytohormones occur across plant kingdom even algae similar functions seen vascular plants higher phytohormones also occur microorganisms unicellular fungi bacteria however cases play hormonal role better regarded secondary word
