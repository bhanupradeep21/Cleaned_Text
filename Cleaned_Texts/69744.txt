upper incisors broad parareptilelike neural however williston noted enough differences groups place limnoscelis within subfamily would later erected limnoscelidae contained genera limnosceloides limnoscelops limnostygis currently monogeneric containing early descriptions framed limnoscelis member paraphyletic group captorhinomorpha within cotylosauria alongside clades diadectomorpha however early authors also noted many similarities limnoscelis diadectid diadectes including bones forming orbital border presence glenoid foramen scapula similar pectoral pelvic differences noted well including single continuous rib articulation rather doubleheaded conical teeth carnivorous lack fused presence two fused coracoid elements rather single element coracoid despite differences similarities diadectes would eventually used place limnoscelis current taxonomic position diadectomorph limnoscelidae erected family within order diadectomorpha alongside family diadectidae genus tseajaia monogeneric family monophyletic grouping diadectomorpha supported anterior processes atlas axis intercentra presence external iliac features shared within diadectomorpha limnoscelis often found sister diadectidae tseajaia later clades forming monophyletic group many cladistic cladogram shows order diadectomorpha modified heaton limnoscelis tseajaia diadectidae due highly generalized postcranial morphology limnoscelis long thought morphologically similar hypothetical ancestor although occurrences recent ancestor limnoscelis possessed several reptilian cranial homologies including closure otic notch development pterygoid flange palatal surface retaining generalized amphibianlike postcranial furthermore noted limnoscelis shared many features early pelycosaurs like ophiacodon particularly postcranial others disagreed citing differences postorbital arguing hypothetical ancestor amniotes small enough efficiently produce amniotic limnoscelis big relationship limnoscelis amniotes later expanded upon several features skull limnoscelis suggesting might representative ancestor amniotes representative presynapsid condition included large supratemporal bone contacting postorbital anteriorly line weakness postorbital supratemporal squamosal bones could eventually develop temporal fenestra however several authors argued validity many recent studies focused placement limnoscelis diadectomorpha relative amniota synapsida heatons originally classified diadectomorphs amphibians outside sister however subsequent studies argued close relationship diadectomorphs synapsids many cladistic analyses placing sister grouping based variety shared characters including possession otic similar atlasaxis possession small posttemporal possession small parietal foramen structure position septomaxillae possession tall broad flat recently study inner ear morphology diadectomorphs using xray microcomputed tomography klembara et al also supported close relationship

absence temporal notch presence ossified shared digital possession ventrally displaced laterally directed paroccipital limnoscelis lacked feature present diadectidae could evidence uniting diadectomorpha however may also result convergent studies question reliability characters allying diadectomorpha synapsida instead agreeing heatons original placement diadectomorpha outside amniota

descriptions williston limnoscelis characterized slow nonetheless powerful poor ossification along short limbs flattened suggest likely aquatic semiaquatic williston hypothesized limnoscelis might used water hide predators look alfred sherwood romer suggested might retention ancestral semiaquatic lifestyle found amphibians might also retained early however studies suggested significantly terrestrial lifestyle limnoscelis based relatively wellossified portions postcranial despite long conical teeth indicating carnivorous williston doubted limnoscelis could predator believed short robust limbs made slow pursue instead hypothesized limnoscelis might fed however romer argued limnoscelis could successful semiaquatic predator comparing anatomy known aquatic predators like crocodilians several subsequent analyses agreed romers argument studies agree limnoscelis likely predatory differs significantly diadectomorphs particularly family diadectidae limnoscelis paludis
