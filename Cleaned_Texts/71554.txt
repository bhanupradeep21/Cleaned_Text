soil groundwater unlike vitis vinifera wide range susceptibility downy mildew among vitis interspecific hybrids example among north american grapevine species vitis aestivalis vitis labrusca moderately susceptible vitis cordifolia vitis rupestris vitis rotundifolia relatively certain vitis interspecific hybrid cultivars display organspecific resistance example leaves aurore delaware cultivars moderate highly susceptible whereas fruit highly resistant downy another example cultivar chancellor leaves exhibit moderate levels resistance downy mildew clusters tendrils shoot tips highly susceptible several new european cultivars regent developed progeny crosses v vinifera resistant north american species effort incorporate desirable qualities parental branches note berries become resistant infection weeks bloom parts plants may remain susceptible months reduce risk disease establishing vineyards practice includes choosing location drainage soil irrigation avoid distribution infected soil plant tissue carefully clean equipment change equipment used infected areas also carefully clean boots clothes entering infected areas canopy management practices low
