nikolai kardashev published second article entitled strategies searching extraterrestrial intelligence fundamental approach basic stated detection studies extraterrestrial civilizations constitute problem immense significance progress humanity culture philosophy discovery intelligent life universe would provide guideline possible development civilization astronomical time spans according soviet astronomer civilization would young able contact another civilization would certainly advanced us solar system young five billion years first ancestors todays man appeared million years ago oldest celestial objects billion years old clear civilizations incomparably older human civilization therefore knowledge civilizations must greater reasoned must surely aware kardashev believed probable present state civilization one stages civilizations pass evolution thus possible define civilization basis universal characteristic allowed aleksandr lyapunov define life highly stable state matter

kardashev drew three conclusions first postulated vast unlimited set activities required scientific problems period civilizations must transmit communicate necessarily long even unlimited hand since present development covers negligible fraction communication phase kardashev hypothesized high improbability meet brothers intelligence stage evolution highly advanced civilizations know use laws physics degree yet suspect kardashev asserted last point taken account research programs extraterrestrial civilizations concluded likely present state one stages every civilization passes kardashev analyzed various models hypotheses evolution civilization answering question russian astronomer iosif shklovsky article published titled possibility intelligent life universe unique found strange shock wave intelligence supercivilization yet reached limits whole universe kardashev put forward two explanatory hypotheses first postulated would useful supercivilization expand space occupies order maintain activity second possible civilization instead dispersing space would rather continue activities information analysis order discover new fundamental laws exploration microcosm black holes however civilization activities require use abundant energy according laws thermodynamics important part consumed energy must converted radiation bolometric magnitude approximately equal radiation background surrounding source spectral distribution intensity must close black body would possible way search extraterrestrial civilizations energy consumption would also require large amount solid matter stellar engineering activities kardashev called cosmic miracles short information possible existence extraterrestrial civilization would come form electromagnetic regard fate civilizations kardashev saw two concepts two strategies search extraterrestrial civilizations derived first called terrestrial chauvinism based principle civilizations stabilize perish level development close currently reached second called evolutionary concept holds civilizations capable reaching higher levels development contemporary humanity first case best search strategy using astronomical detection means eg seti program would observe powerful often distant sources radiation space observer able determine natural emission sources search focus objects weaker radiation second case recommended search new powerful sources radiation especially poorly known regions electromagnetic spectrum sources could significant periodic monochromatic signals galactic center galaxies quasars exotic cosmic objects kardashev believed search focus millimeter wavelength spectrum close maximum intensity cosmic microwave background rather band domain investigation seti program according kardashev order capture significant radiation advanced civilization emitted megastructure dyson sphere radio telescope diameter larger diameter earth would placed orbital kardashev concluded predicting search extraterrestrial civilizations would lead positive results next decade giving humanity access vast amount information universe evolution period several billion article inevitability possible structure supercivilizations published kardashev evokes possible scenarios means investigation available humanity detection hypothetical extraterrestrial supercivilizations soviet astronomer reminds us search supercivilizations basis development criteria predictions possible extraterrestrial worlds close technological level others beyond intellectual representation nevertheless seems useful conceive models supercivilizations based time imagination present scientific knowledge since laws physics immutable even new laws discovered future abolish already according kardashev theoretical models supercivilizations must meet two basic assumptions first range supercivilization activities obey laws physics limited natural scientific constraints second evolution supercivilization activities interrupted limited intrinsic inherent contingencies largescale social conflicts kardashev unlike scientists supercivilizations selfdestruct retrogress according principles must exist space megastructures great size emitting lot energy information existing billions years compact enough rapidly exchange large amounts data supercivilization would thus create technological structure cosmic dimensions example kardashev cites freeman dysons megastructure form sphere several astronomical units diameter phenomena may indicate highly technological activities artificially exploding stars changing stellar orbits store mass energy giant molecular clouds also hold great potential astroengineering kardashev even raises possibility supercivilization reshaping entire evokes theoretical

article subject entitled radioastron radio telescope much greater supercivilization science cosmic ethnography must highly developed however fact contact made far could explained ethical considerations civilizations based principle kardashev sees two possible evolutionary scenarios supercivilization natural evolution evolution contact extraterrestrial civilizations considers likely scenario based contact two civilizations highly developed technologically culturally advanced civilizations scenario calls urbanization hypothesis would result regrouping unification several civilizations within compact regions kardashev lists form investigative tools six possible scenarios summarized table end explain evolution civilization scenarios corresponds probability one objects observed adapted procedure finally possible consequences article cosmology civilizations published kardashev reiterates need carefully observe astronomical objects strong radiation order detect supercivilizations however discovery civilization stage development similar unlikely existence supercivilizations made possible fact life earth recent compared age universe years formation solar

proposed particular putting orbit cryogenic space telescope millimetron according kardashev results combined research age certain cosmic objects suggest civilizations dating billion years ago may exist galaxy likely long since discovered civilization hypothesis could answer question posed enrico fermi formulated paradox without discovery artificial sources however shklovskys theory civilizations selfdestruct result largescale social conflicts would proven kardashev mentions another hypothesis opinion capable explaining dynamics supercivilizations feedback effect theorized sebastian von hoerner based hypothesis high technological level civilizations tend converge rather isolate distance supercivilizations could determined half time technological evolution oldest civilization would billion years hand supercivilization may present galaxy long time kardashev concludes saying since expansion universe infinite number lifetime supercivilizations also hypothetical classification known kardashev scale distinguishes three stages evolution civilizations according dual criteria access energy purpose classification guide search extraterrestrial civilizations
