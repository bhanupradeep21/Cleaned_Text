posttraumatic seizures pts seizures result traumatic brain injury tbi brain damage caused physical trauma pts may risk factor posttraumatic epilepsy pte person seizure seizures due traumatic brain injury necessarily pte form epilepsy chronic condition seizures occur repeatedly however pts pte may used interchangeably medical seizures usually indication severe seizures occur shortly person sustains brain injury may damage already vulnerable may reduce amount oxygen available cause excitatory neurotransmitters released excess increase brains metabolic need raise pressure within intracranial space contributing thus people sustain severe head trauma given anticonvulsant medications precaution around people hospitalized tbi least one pts likely occur severe injuries certain types injuries increase risk risk person develop pts becomes progressively lower time passes injury however tbi survivors may still risk years children older adults higher risk pts pts first classified bryan jennett early late seizures occurring within first week injury occurring week though sevenday cutoff early seizures used widely arbitrary seizures occurring first week within first

excitotoxicity iron immediate seizures occurring within two seconds injury probably occur force injury stimulates brain tissue low threshold seizures early pts considered provoked seizure result direct effects head trauma thus considered actual epilepsy late seizures thought indicate permanent changes brains structure imply early seizures caused factors cerebral edema intracranial hemorrhage cerebral contusion factors may result seizures occur within two weeks insult include presence blood within brain alterations blood brain barrier excessive release excitatory neurotransmitters

medical personnel aim determine whether seizure caused change patients biochemistry neurological examinations tests measure levels serum electrolytes seizures occur trauma pts may due seizure disorder already existed may even caused addition posttraumatic seizures confused concussive convulsions may immediately follow concussion actually seizures predictive factor neuroimaging used guide treatment often mri performed patient pts less sensitive easily accessed ct scan may also shortly tbi people given anticonvulsant medication seizures occur early trauma increase brain damage excessive release excitatory neurotransmitters increased metabolic demands increased pressure within intracranial medications used prevent seizures include valproate phenytoin recommended treatment antiseizure medication initiated soon possible prevention early seizures differs late seizures aim former prevent damage caused seizures whereas aim latter prevent strong evidence clinical trials suggests antiepileptic drugs given within day injury prevent seizures within first week injury example review medical literature found phenytoin preventative early probably late children anticonvulsants may ineffective early late unknown reasons prophylactic use antiepileptic drugs long period associated increased risk reasons antiepileptic drugs widely recommended short time head trauma prevent immediate early late treatment widely accepted prevent development however medications may given repress seizures late seizures seizures result tbi often difficult antiepileptic drugs may given intravenously shortly injury include phenytoin sodium valproate carbamazepine antiepileptic drugs prevent seizures phenytoin sodium valproate usually stop seizures pts associated generally good unknown exactly long tbi person higher risk seizures rest population estimates suggested lengths people tbi seizures occur three months people tbi pts two years however moderate severe tbi still confer high risk pts five years studies reported pts patients go remission later studies conducted development effective seizure medications reported higher overall remission one quarter people
