lingual papillae sg papilla small structures upper surface tongue give characteristic rough texture four types papillae human tongue different structures accordingly classified circumvallate vallate fungiform filiform foliate except filiform papillae associated taste living subjects lingual papillae readily seen tongue four types papillae present tongue filiform papillae numerous lingual fine small coneshaped papillae found anterior surface responsible giving tongue texture responsible sensation touch unlike kinds papillae filiform papillae contain taste cover front twothirds tongues appear small conical cylindrical surface arranged rows lie parallel sulcus terminalis tip tongue rows become histologically made irregular connective tissue cores epithelium fine secondary heavy keratinization filiform papillae occurring instance cats gives tongue roughness characteristic animals papillae whitish tint owing thickness density epithelium epithelium undergone peculiar modification cells become elongated dense overlapping brushlike threads also contain number elastic fibers render firmer elastic types papillae larger longer papillae group sometimes termed papillae conicae fungiform papillae club shaped projections tongue generally red color found tip tongue scattered amongst filiform papillae mostly present tip sides tongue taste buds upper surface distinguish five tastes sweet sour bitter salty umami core connective tissue fungiform papillae innervated seventh cranial nerve specifically via submandibular ganglion chorda tympani geniculate ganglion ascending solitary nucleus brainstem foliate papillae short vertical folds present side located sides back tongue front palatoglossal arch four five vertical size shape foliate papillae appear series red colored ridges covered epithelium lack keratin softer bear many taste usually bilaterally symmetrical sometimes appear small inconspicuous times prominent location high risk site oral cancer tendency occasionally swell may mistaken tumors inflammatory disease taste buds receptors gustatory sense scattered mucous membrane surface serous glands drain folds clean taste buds lingual tonsils found immediately behind foliate papillae hyperplastic cause prominence papillae circumvallate papillae vallate papillae domeshaped structures human tongue vary number situated surface tongue immediately front foramen cecum sulcus terminalis forming row either side two rows run backward medially meet midline papillae consists projection mucous membrane mm wide attached bottom circular depression mucous membrane margin depression elevated form wall vallum papilla circular sulcus termed fossa papilla shaped like truncated cone smaller end directed downward attached tongue broader part base projecting little surface tongue studded numerous small secondary papillae covered stratified squamous epithelium ducts lingual salivary glands known von ebners glands empty serous secretion base circular depression acts like moat function secretion presumed flush materials base circular depression ensure taste buds respond changing stimuli circumvallate papillae get special afferent taste innervation cranial nerve ix glossopharyngeal nerve even though anterior sulcus terminalis rest anterior twothirds tongue gets taste innervation chorda tympani cranial nerve vii distributed lingual nerve cranial nerve v lingual papillae particularly filiform papillae thought increase surface area tongue increase area contact friction tongue may increase tongues ability manipulate bolus food also position food teeth mastication chewing swallowing diseases depapillation tongue lingual papillae lost leaving smooth red possibly sore area examples depapillating oral conditions include geographic tongue median rhomboid glossitis types glossitis term glossitis particularly atrophic glossitis often used synonymously depapillation entire dorsal surface tongue lost papillae sometimes termed bald nutritional deficiencies iron folic acid b vitamins may cause depapillation papillitis refers inflammation papillae sometimes term hypertrophy used interchangeablycitation needed foliate papillitis foliate papillae appear swollen may occur due mechanical irritation reaction upper respiratory tract sources state foliate papilitis refers inflammation lingual tonsil lymphoid term lingual derived latin word lingua meaning tongue speech papilla latin meaning nipple vallate pronounced ˈvæleɪt valayt latin word vallum rampart wall means raised edge surrounding depression refers circular mucosal elevation surrounds circumvallate papillae fungiform pronounced ˈfʌndʒɪfɔːrm funjiform latin words fungus mushroom forma means shaped like mushroom fungus foliate pronounced ˈfoʊliət fohleeət latin word foliatus leafy means shaped like leaf filiform pronounced ˈfɪlɪfɔːrm filiform latin word filum thread means shaped like filament thread foliate papillae fairly rudimentary structures representing evolutionary vestiges similar structures many mouth cheeks slit transversely tongue pulled forward papillae tongue landmarks foliate papillae floor mouth deep dissectionanterior view
