trace connectionist model speech perception proposed james mcclelland jeffrey elman based structure called trace dynamic processing structure made network units performs systems working memory well perceptual processing trace made working computer program running perceptual simulations simulations predictions human mindbrain processes speech sounds words heard real time trace created formative period connectionism included chapter parallel distributed processing explorations microstructures researchers found certain problems regarding speech perception could conceptualized terms connectionist interactive activation model problems speech extended time sounds speech phonemes overlap articulation speech sound affected sounds come natural variability speech eg foreign accent well noise environment eg busy restaurant causes speech signal complex often ambiguous making difficult human mindbrain decide words really hearing simple terms interactive activation model solves problem placing different kinds processing units phonemes words isolated layers allowing activated units pass information layers units within layers compete one another winner considered recognized model trace first model instantiated activation multiple word candidates match part speech simulation speech perception involves presenting trace computer program mock speech input running program generating result successful simulation indicates result found meaningfully similar people process speech generally accepted psycholinguistics beginning word heard set words share initial sound become activated words activated compete word point due auditory input lexical competition one word example listener hears beginning bald words bald ball bad bill become active memory soon bald ball remain competition bad bill eliminated vowel sound doesnt match input soon bald recognized trace simulates process representing temporal dimension speech allowing words lexicon vary activation strength words compete processing figure shows line graph word activation simple trace simulation ambiguous speech sound spoken exactly hearer may difficulty deciding ambiguous sound heard end word like woo ambiguous sound hearer likely perceive sound probably occurs wood word woot ambiguous phoneme presented lexical context perceived consistent surrounding lexical context perceptual effect known ganong trace reliably simulates explain relatively simple terms essentially lexical unit become activated input ie wood feeds back activation phoneme layer boosting activation constituent phonemes ie thus resolving ambiguity speakers usually dont leave pauses words speakingcitation needed yet listeners seem difficulty hearing speech sequence words known segmentation problem one oldest problems psychology language trace proposed following solution backed simulations words become activated recognized reveals location word boundaries stronger word activation leads greater confidence word boundaries informs hearer expect next word trace model connectionist network input layer three processing layers pseudospectra feature phoneme word figure shows schematic diagram trace three types connectivity feedforward excitatory connections input features features phonemes phonemes words lateral ie within layer inhibitory connections feature phoneme word layers topdown feedback excitatory connections words phonemes input trace works follows user provides phoneme sequence converted multidimensional feature vector approximation acoustic spectra extended time input vector revealed little time simulate temporal nature speech new chunk input presented sends activity along network connections changing activation values processing layers features activate phoneme units phonemes activate word units parameters govern strength excitatory inhibitory connections well many processing details specific mechanism determines word phoneme recognized simulations compared reaction time data perceptual experiment eg lexical decision typically activation threshold used allows model behavior interpreted recognition recognition time recorded number processing cycles elapsed deeper understanding trace processing dynamics readers referred original trace software tool runs simulations graphical user interface trace relevance modularity debate recently brought fore norris cutler mcqueen report merge model speech shares number features trace key difference following trace permits word units feedback activation phoneme level merge restricts processing feedforward connections terms debate trace considered violate principle information encapsulation central modularity permits later stage processing words send information earlier stage phonemes merge advocates modularity arguing class perceptual phenomena accounted trace explained connectionist architecture include feedback connections norris et al point two theories explain phenomenon parsimony dictates simpler theory preferable models language processing used conceptualize nature impairment persons speech language disorder example suggested language deficits expressive aphasia may caused excessive competition lexical units thus preventing word becoming sufficiently arguments hypothesis consider mental dysfunction explained slight perturbation network models processing emerging line research incorporates wide range theories models trace represents one piece growing puzzle psycholinguistic models speech perception eg trace must distinguished computer speech recognition tools former
