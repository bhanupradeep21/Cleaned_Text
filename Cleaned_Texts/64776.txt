prevailing emphasis nutrition science monteiro observed significant shift brazils dietary landscape marked rise obesity rates among economically disadvantaged populations affluent areas saw declines transformation led explore dietary patterns holistically rather focusing solely individual nutrients employing statistical methods monteiro identified two distinct eating patterns brazil one rooted traditional foods like rice beans another characterized consumption highly processed classifications name title original scientific article published new classification foods portuguese uma nova

including papers written monteiros nova framework presents four food groups defined according nature extent purpose industrial food processing databases open food facts provide nova classifications commercial products based analysis categories assigning foods categories straightforward information available food preparation classifications attention social aspects food give intuitive character

successfully developed quantitative definition hyperpalatable proponents opponents nova agree food processing vitally affects human health definition unprocessed foods edible parts plants animals along algae fungi water group also includes minimally processed foods unprocessed foods modified industrial methods removal unwanted parts crushing drying fractioning grinding pasteurization nonalcoholic fermentation freezing preservation techniques maintain foods integrity introduce salt sugar oils fats culinary ingredients additives absent examples include fresh frozen fruits vegetables

mined extracted nature ingredients primarily used seasoning cooking group foods preparing dishes scratch typically free additives products group may include added vitamins minerals iodized salt examples include oils produced crushing seeds nuts fruits olive oil salt sugar vinegar starches honey syrups extracted trees butter substances used season processed foods relatively simple food products produced adding processed culinary ingredients group substances salt sugar unprocessed group processed foods made preserved baking boiling canning bottling nonalcoholic fermentation often use additives enhance shelf life protect properties unprocessed food prevent spread microorganisms making examples include cheese canned vegetables salted nuts fruits syrup dried canned fish breads pastries cakes biscuits snacks meat products fall group made predominantly group foods addition group ultraprocessed foods formulations ingredients mostly exclusive industrial use typically created series industrial techniques processes unprocessed group foods often compose small proportion ingredients even lacking entirelycitation needed ultraprocessing often introduces food substances little culinary use hydrogenated oil modified starch protein isolate highfructose corn syrup manufacturing processes ultraprocessed foods typically involve techniques extrusion moulding prefrying along addition various cosmetic additives including flavour enhancement colour examples include carbonated soft drinks reconstituted fruit juices margarine reconstituted meat products plantbased meat

increasingly used evaluate relationship extent food processing health outcomes several epidemiological studies linked consumption ultraprocessed foods obesity cardiovascular disease hypertension metabolic syndrome depression various types researchers conclude creation ultraprocessed foods primarily motivated economic considerations within food industry processes ingredients used foods specifically designed maximize profitability incorporating lowcost ingredients ensuring long shelflife emphasizing furthermore ultraprocessed foods engineered convenient hyperpalatable making potential replacement food groups within nova classification particularly unprocessed minimally processed result researchers public health campaigners using nova classification means enhance human health outcomes food system also used inform food nutrition policies several countries international organizations example pan american health organization adopted nova classification dietary ministry health brazil published new dietary guidelines based part nova crediting carlos monteiro coordinator recommend golden rule always prefer natural minimally processed foods freshly made dishes meals ultraprocessed foods also set recommendations corresponding nova food agriculture organization united nations recognized first national dietary guidelines emphasize social economic aspects sustainability advising people wary advertising example avoid ultraprocessed foods bad health seen undermine traditional food cultures stand contrast largely environmental definition sustainability
