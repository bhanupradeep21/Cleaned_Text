fisherian runaway runaway selection sexual selection mechanism proposed mathematical biologist ronald fisher early century account evolution ostentatious male ornamentation persistent directional female example colourful elaborate peacock plumage compared relatively subdued peahen plumage costly ornaments notably birds extremely long tail appear incompatible natural selection fisherian runaway

developed theory assuming genetic correlation preference ornament initially ornament signalled greater potential fitness likelihood leaving descendants preference ornament selective advantage subsequently strong enough female preference exaggerated ornamentation mate selection could enough undermine natural selection even ornament become subsequent generations could lead runaway selection
