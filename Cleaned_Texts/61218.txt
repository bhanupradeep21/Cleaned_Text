mammals viviparous giving birth live young however five species monotreme platypuses echidnas lay eggs monotremes sex determination system different particular sex chromosomes platypus like chicken therian mammary glands mammals specialized produce milk liquid used newborns primary source nutrition monotremes branched early mammals teats seen mammals mammary glands young lick milk mammary patch mothers belly viviparous mammals subclass theria living today marsupialia placentalia infraclasses marsupial short gestation period typically shorter estrous cycle gives birth underdeveloped altricial newborn undergoes development many species takes place within pouchlike sac marsupium located front mothers abdomen placentals eg guinea pig give birth fully developed precocial young usually long gestation periods others eg mouse give birth underdeveloped young sexual maturity thus earliest age mammals reproduce varies dramatically across species members rodent family cricetidae reach sexual maturity months eg norway lemming lemmus lemmus days many dogs family canidae bovids bovidae take year reach maturity primates including humans dolphins delphinidae require years whales take even longer longest duration recorded bowhead whale balaena mysticetus reaches maturity age mammalian male reproductive system contains two main divisions penis testicles latter sperm produced always contained scrotum humans organs outside abdominal cavity primarily housed within abdomen animals instance dogs penis covered penile sheath except mating testicles outside abdomen best facilitates temperature regulation sperm require specific temperatures survive external location may also cause reduction heatinduced contribution spontaneous mutation rate male germinal sperm smaller two gametes generally shortlived requiring males produce continuously time sexual maturity death produced sperm stored epididymis ejaculation sperm cells motile swim using taillike flagella propel towards ovum sperm follows temperature gradients chemical gradients chemotaxis locate ovum mammalian female reproductive system contains three main divisions vagina uterus act receptacle sperm ovaries produce females ova vulva consists labia clitoris vagina uterus ovaries always internal vulva external vagina attached uterus cervix uterus attached ovaries via oviducts certain intervals ovaries release ovum passes oviduct uterus transit meets sperm egg selects sperm merge termed fertilization fertilization usually occurs oviducts happen uterus zygote implants wall uterus begins processes embryogenesis morphogenesis developed enough survive outside womb cervix dilates contractions uterus propel fetus birth canal vagina ova female sex cells much larger sperm normally formed within ovaries fetus birth mostly fixed location within ovary transit uterus contain nutrients later zygote embryo regular interval response hormonal signals process oogenesis matures one ovum released sent oviduct fertilized egg released menstruation humans great apes reabsorbed mammals estrus cycle gestation called pregnancy humans period time fetus develops dividing via mitosis inside female time fetus receives nutrition oxygenated blood female filtered placenta attached fetus abdomen via umbilical cord drain nutrients quite taxing female required ingest slightly higher levels calories addition certain vitamins nutrients required greater quantities normal often creating abnormal eating habits length gestation called gestation period varies greatly species species weeks humans giraffes days hamsters fetus sufficiently developing chemical signals start process birth begins contractions uterus dilation cervix fetus descends cervix pushed vagina eventually female newborn called infant humans typically begin respiration shortly birth long placenta passed well monotremes five species exist australia new guinea mammals lay eggs one opening excretion reproduction called cloaca hold eggs internally several weeks providing nutrients lay cover like birds like marsupial joeys monotreme puggles larval like expand torso due presence epipubic bones forcing produce undeveloped young marsupials reproductive systems differ markedly placental though probably plesiomorphic condition found viviparous mammals including nonplacental embryonic development choriovitelline placenta forms marsupials bandicoots additional chorioallantoic placenta forms although lacks chorionic villi found eutherian placentas bull stallion male domestic cat female domestic cat female raccoon male raccoon
