spirodela polyrhiza orth var polyrrhiza species duckweed known common names common greater great common duckweed duckmeat found nearly worldwide many types freshwater spirodela polyrhiza perennial aquatic plant usually growing dense colonies forming mat water surface plant smooth round flat disc cm wide upper surface mostly green sometimes red lower surface dark produces several minute roots pouch containing male female flowers top part dies fall plant often overwinters turion turion sinks bottom water body stays dormant phase water temperature reaches turions germinate bottom water body start new life species lives ponds slowmoving water bodies differs developmentally terrestrial plants morphology physiology undergoes mainly vegetative growth spring summer forming new fronds spirodela polyrhiza rarely fall winter switches dormant phase represented turions due nutrition starvation freezing temperaturescitation needed fast growth direct contact media small genome size mb polyrhiza ideal system biofuels bioremediation carbon comprehensive genomic study polyrhiza published february results provide insights organism adapted rapid growth aquatic turions induced plant hormone abscisic acid aba lab researchers reported turions rich anthocyanin pigmentation density submerged liquid media transmission electron microscopy turions showed comparison fronds shrunken vacuoles smaller intercellular space abundant starch granules surrounded thylakoid membranes turions accumulated starch dry mass two weeks aba spirodela polyrhiza found worldwide namely north rarely central south america also central grows tropical temperate prevalent new zealand rarely large scale cultivation done outdoor water tanks mostly connection wastewater treatment tanks fed wastewater floating duckweed harvested surface used biofuel industrial wastewater animal feed agricultural wastewater treatment spirodela polyrhiza used bioremediation removing toxic substances aquatic environment well cleaning eutrophic waters especially wastewater treatment plants uses biofuel animal feed also gaining importance hardly used human nutritioncitation needed capability hyperaccumulate heavy metals high uptake nutrients water polyrhiza used bioremediation main pollutants used remediate arsenic mercury common wastewater nutrients like sulphate phosphate nitrate needed greater duckweed showed accumulation arsenic laboratory tests arsenic uptake found negatively correlated phosphate positively correlated iron uptake indicates phosphate arsenic compete uptake polyrhiza arsenics absorption facilitated iron oxides shows affinity root surface polyrhiza taken greater duckweed thought detoxify arsenic reducing v less toxic iii difficulties arise management plants high contents one possible use biomass containing production charcoal gas byproduct used fuel problems approach low charcoal quality high investments direct burning burning coal thought release arsenic air would pollute environment options fuel production would hydrolysis fermentation economically feasible biomass would treated strong acids heat capital intensive briquetting considered one best options plants dried pressed pellets briquets raises question whether arsenic released back environment burning process production biogas also considered redistribution avoided spirodela polyrhiza found efficient bio accumulator mercuric chloride laboratory settings plant biomass showed times higher mercuric chloride concentration aquatic environment spirodela polyrhiza showed highest accumulation factor compared lemna gibba l minor also dgreater duckweed used remove common pollutants wastewater laboratory setting polyrhiza showed maximum removal efficiency nitrate phosphate sulphate efficiency three pollutants combined makes environmentally economically viable bioremediatory wastewater due spaceefficient starch production good growth animal wastewater polyrhiza great potential bioethanol despite environmental problems associated production competition human animal feed corn main raw material bioethanol spirodela polyrhiza could produce bioethanol time production bioethanol polyrhiza competition human food production bioethanol polyrhiza still development phasecitation needed smallscale agriculture polyrhiza used fish poultry due fast growth high protein content interesting feedstuff sanitary problems risk heavy metal accumulation yet used feeding larger animal husbandry rainbow trout poorer growth rates found polyrhiza added tilapia oreochromis niloticus l greater weight gains found fish meal feed replaced review also shown duckweed used cattle pig poultry diets however problems heavy metals pathogen contamination although duckweed species wolffia arrhiza
