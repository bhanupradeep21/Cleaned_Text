eosinophils sometimes called eosinophiles less commonly acidophils variety white blood cells one immune system components responsible combating multicellular parasites certain infections along mast cells basophils also control mechanisms associated allergy asthma granulocytes develop hematopoiesis bone marrow migrating blood terminally differentiated form white blood cells body cells eosinophilic acidloving due large acidophilic cytoplasmic granules show affinity acids affinity coal tar dyes normally transparent affinity causes appear brickred staining eosin red dye using romanowsky staining concentrated small granules within cellular cytoplasm contain many chemical mediators eosinophil peroxidase ribonuclease rnase deoxyribonucleases dnase lipase plasminogen major

mediators allergic responses asthma pathogenesis associated disease severity also fight helminth worm colonization may slightly elevated presence certain parasites eosinophils also involved many biological processes including postpubertal mammary gland development oestrus cycling allograft rejection also implicated antigen presentation eosinophils responsible tissue damage inflammation many diseases including high levels observed regulate expression adhesion molecules facilitate adhesion eosinophils endothelial cells thereby causing inflammation tissue accumulation eosinophils nasal
