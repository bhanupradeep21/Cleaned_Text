benjamin maisie lockwood immediately makes rest jurassic franchise seem dull comparison sure dinosaurs running around theres also scientist whos apparently cloning actual human beings years noted dinosaurs focal point films argued taking cloning focus away dinosaurs even one character part shock reveal changes entire series ben kuchera polygon speculated maisie dinosaur dna disappointed eventual plot twist human clone finding underdeveloped referring dinosaur theory clone reveal kuchera wrote film spends lot running time setting would one ridiculous plot twists possible backs away last moment instead deliver something seems even bore characters liz young movieweb noted parallels maisie series dinosaurs writing fallen kingdom seems use maisies presence clone metaphor dinosaurs impact world matt goldberg collider found film including clone twist predictable whats meant major reveal loses impact film ridiculously dumb yet assumes audience isnt happening also criticized maisies release dinosaurs writing big red button leads outdoors precaution place maisie pushes button says theyre like guess maisie eats people destroys referring role dominion nick bartlett film wrote person released dinosaurs world would think would interesting arc film potentially grappling conscience consequences actions coming terms new identity unfortunately barely touched upon storyline ultimately frustrating called sermons performance particularly strong scenes without dialogue found let cliched characterization writing rather personality shes depicted stereotypical sullen teenager zero chemistry surrogate parents bartlett said meandering plot thread regarding truth biological origins fine kills momentum essentially serves distraction michael john petty collider praised sermons performance wrote maisies inclusion greater jurassic mythology something celebrated explored many potential scientific societal social implications persons existence however disappointed characters newly explained origin dominion instead learning maisie deep learn thomas bacon screen rant also critical new origin saim cheeda also screen rant ranked maisies character arc secondbest film series writing developed scared child set path continuing biological mothers legacy ultimately providing wu means reverse effects httpsenwikipediaorgwikimaisielockwood
