ames test widely employed method uses bacteria test whether given chemical cause mutations dna test organism formally biological assay assess mutagenic potential chemical positive test indicates chemical mutagenic therefore may act carcinogen cancer often linked mutation test serves quick convenient assay estimate carcinogenic potential compound standard carcinogen assays mice rats timeconsuming taking two three years complete expensive however falsepositives falsenegatives procedure described series papers early bruce ames group university california ames test uses several strains bacterium salmonella typhimurium carry mutations genes involved histidine synthesis strains auxotrophic mutants ie require histidine growth produce method tests capability tested substance creating mutations result return prototrophic state cells grow histidinefree medium tester strains specially constructed detect either frameshift eg strains point eg strain mutations genes required synthesize histidine mutagens acting via different mechanisms may identified compounds quite specific causing reversions one two tester strains also carry mutations genes responsible lipopolysaccharide synthesis making cell wall bacteria excision repair system make test larger organisms like mammals metabolic processes could potentially turn chemical considered mutagenic one one considered mutagenic one therefore effectively test chemical compounds mutagenicity relation larger organisms rat liver enzymes added attempt replicate metabolic processes effect compound tested ames test rat liver extract optionally added simulate effect metabolism compounds like benzoapyrene mutagenic metabolic products bacteria spread agar plate small amount histidine small amount histidine growth medium allows bacteria grow initial time opportunity mutate histidine depleted bacteria mutated gain ability produce histidine survive plate incubated hours mutagenicity substance proportional number colonies observed mutagens identified via ames test also possible carcinogens early studies ames showed known carcinogens may identified via later studies however showed identification known carcinogenscitation needed test used identify number compounds previously used commercial products potential examples include used flame retardant plastic textiles childrens furylfuramide used antibacterial additive food japan furylfuramide fact previously passed animal tests vigorous tests identification ames test showed positive tests resulted chemicals withdrawn use consumer products one interesting result ames test dose response curve using varying concentrations chemical almost always indicating threshold concentration mutagenesis therefore suggests radiation may safe threshold chemical mutagens however proposed organisms could tolerate low levels mutagens due protective mechanisms dna repair thus threshold may exist certain chemical bruce ames argued linear doseresponse extrapolation high dose used carcinogenesis tests animal systems lower dose chemicals normally encountered human exposure results may false positives due mitogenic response caused artificially high dose chemicals used also cautioned hysteria tiny traces chemicals may may cause cancer completely drives major risks aware ames test often used one initial screens potential drugs weed possible carcinogens one eight tests required pesticide act usa one six tests required toxic substances control act salmonella typhimurium prokaryote therefore perfect model humans rat liver fraction used mimic mammalian metabolic conditions mutagenic potential metabolites formed parent molecule hepatic system assessed however differences metabolism humans rats affect mutagenicity chemicals test may therefore improved use human liver fraction use previously limited availability available commercially therefore may adapted vitro model made eukaryotic cells example yeast mutagens identified ames test need necessarily carcinogenic tests required potential carcinogen identified test drugs contain nitrate moiety sometimes come back positive ames indeed safe nitrate compounds may generate nitric oxide important signal molecule give false positive nitroglycerin example gives positive ames yet still used treatment today nitrates food however may reduced bacterial action nitrites known generate carcinogens reacting amines amides long toxicology outcome studies needed compounds disprove positive ames test ames test initially developed using agar plates plate incorporation technique described since time alternative performing ames test developed known fluctuation method technique concept agarbased method bacteria added reaction mixture small amount histidine allows bacteria grow mutate
