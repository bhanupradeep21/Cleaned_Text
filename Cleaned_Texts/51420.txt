atenolol beta blocker medication primarily used treat high blood pressure heartassociated chest atenolol however seem improve mortality high blood uses include prevention migraines treatment certain irregular heart taken orally mouth intravenous injection injection also used blood pressure common side effects include feeling tired heart failure dizziness depression shortness serious side effects include bronchial use recommended alternative drugs preferred works blocking receptors heart thus decreasing heart rate atenolol patented approved medical use world health organizations list essential available generic commonly prescribed medication united states million atenolol used number conditions including hypertension angina long qt syndrome acute myocardial infarction supraventricular tachycardia ventricular tachycardia symptoms alcohol role βblockers general hypertension downgraded june united kingdom later united states less appropriate agents ace inhibitors calcium channel blockers thiazide diuretics angiotensin receptor blockers particularly hypertension treated βblocker atenolol alone conjunction thiazide diuretic associated higher incidence new onset type diabetes mellitus compared treated ace inhibitor angiotensin receptor blocker βblockers atenolol mainly studied provides weaker protection stroke mortality patients years old compared antihypertensive diuretics may associated better cardiovascular cerebrovascular outcomes βblockers symptoms overdose due excessive pharmacodynamic actions also include bradycardia slow heartbeat severe hypotension shock acute heart failure hypoglycemia bronchospastic reactions treatment largely symptomatic hospitalization intensive monitoring indicated activated charcoal useful absorb drug atropine counteract bradycardia glucagon helps hypoglycemia dobutamine given hypotension inhalation hexoprenalin salbutamol terminate bronchospasms blood plasma atenolol concentrations may measured confirm diagnosis poisoning hospitalized patients assist medicolegal death investigation plasma levels usually less mgl therapeutic administration range mgl overdose atenolol beta blocker antagonist βadrenergic specifically selective antagonist receptor intrinsic sympathomimetic activity ie partial agonist activity membranestabilizing however preferential action atenolol absolute high doses also block betablocking effects atenolol include reduction resting exercise heart rate cardiac output reduction systolic diastolic blood pressure rest exercise inhibition tachycardia induced isoproterenol nonselective βadrenergic receptor agonist reduction reflex orthostatic betablocking effects atenolol measured reduction exerciserelated tachycardia apparent within hour maximal within hours following single oral pharmacodynamic effects atenolol including betablocking antihypertensive effects last least hours following oral doses intravenous administration maximal reduction exerciserelated tachycardia occurs within minutes following single mg dose dissipated within duration action atenolol doserelated correlated circulating levels absorption atenolol oral administration rapid consistent oral dose atenolol absorbed intestines rest excreted maximal concentrations atenolol occur hours following oral dose whereas peak concentrations occur within minutes intravenous pharmacokinetic profile atenolol results relatively consistent plasma drug levels variation plasma protein binding atenolol atenolol classified beta blocker low lipophilicity hence lower potential crossing barrier entering turn may result fewer effects central nervous system well lower risk neuropsychiatric side atenolol undergoes little metabolism contrast beta blockers like propranolol metoprolol similar instead hepatic metabolism atenolol eliminated mainly via renal atenolol excreted urine oral administration urine intravenous elimination halflife atenolol halflife atenolol change continuous intravenous administration atenolol levels rapidly decline first hours thereafter decline rate similar oral elimination atenolol slowed renal impairment elimination rate closely related glomerular filtration rate significant accumulation occurring creatinine clearance rate atenolol given example slow healthcare providers change prescribing practices face medical evidence indicates drug effective others treating million prescriptions written american patients top common drugs prescribed medicare although number prescriptions declining steadily since limited evidence articles contesting efficacy published estimated would take years doctors stop prescribing despite diminished efficacy compared newer antihypertensive drugs atenolol beta blockers still relevant clinical choice treating conditions since beta blockers diverse group medicines different properties still requires consequence reasons popularity beta blockers fully attributed slow healthcare system patient
