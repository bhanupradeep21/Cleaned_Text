term alternation phases may debates alternation generations early twentieth century confusing various ways classifying generations coexist sexual vs asexual gametophyte vs sporophyte haploid vs diploid initially chamisso steenstrup described succession differently organized generations sexual asexual animals alternation generations studying development tunicates cnidarians trematode phenomenon also known heterogamy presently term alternation generations almost exclusively associated life cycles plants specifically alternation haploid gametophytes diploid wilhelm hofmeister
