norrie disease rare disease genetic disorder primarily affects eyes almost always leads blindness caused mutations norrin cystine knot growth factor ndp gene located x addition congenital ocular symptoms majority patients experience progressive hearing loss starting mostly decade life may learning difficulties among additional characteristics patients norrie disease may develop cataracts leukocoria pupils appear white light shone along developmental issues eye shrinking globe wasting away around also developmental delay learning difficulties psychoticlike features incoordination movements behavioral patients born normal hearing however onset hearing loss common early patients estimated develop features due xlinked recessive pattern inheritance norrie disease affects almost entirely males rare cases females diagnosed norrie disease cases symptomatic female carriers rare disorder associated specific ethnic racial groups cases reported worldwide including cases north america south america europe asia cases described prevalence incidence disease still remains prominent symptoms initially observed norrie disease ocular initial characteristics usually identified birth early infancy parents often noticing abnormal eye features child fails show response first visible finding leukocoria grayishyellow pupillary reflection originates mass disorganized tissue behind lens material possibly includes already detached retina may confused tumor thus termed however affected baby may normally sized eye globe unremarkable iris anterior chamber cornea intraocular pressure first months life complete partial retinal detachment evolves infancy childhood patient may undergo progressive changes disease progression often includes vitreoretinal hemorrhages formation cataracts deterioration iris adhesions forming iris lens cornea shallowing anterior chamber may increase intraocular pressure causing eye situation worsens corneal opacification cornea becomes opaque band keratopathy intraocular pressure lost globe shrinks last stage norrie disease globes appear small sunken phthisis bulbi cornea appears auditory symptoms common norrie disease progressive hearing loss reported occur patients onset generally childhood patient reaches early hearing loss sensorineural mild adolescence highfrequency hearing loss begins appear hearing loss severe symmetric broadspectrum age years however studies show hearing deteriorates ability speak well highly slowly progressing hearing loss problematic adjust congenital blindness people norrie individuals norrie disease also cognitive behavioral symptoms developmental delay learning difficulties present males norrie psychosocial disturbances poorly characterized behavior abnormalities may also present study reporting extraocular manifestations patients norrie disease conditions reported included cognitive impairment patients behavioral issues example autism spectrum disorder patients presented autism autismlike disorders neurological features including seizure disorders epilepsy patients reported seizures seizure history peripheral vascular disease additionally children visual impairment shown struggle establishing regular sleepwake cycles due reduced light perception impacting understanding night day impact individuals behavior mood cognitive consistent case reports norrie disease patients reported presence sleep peripheral vascular disease pvd also associated norrie disease study patients norrie disease patients reported pvd including varicose veins peripheral venous stasis ulcers erectile due known role protein norrin vascular development eye inner ear well association pvd norrin thought important angiogenic role norrie disease rare genetic disorder caused mutations ndp gene located geneid inherited xlinked recessive manner means almost males affected sons affected men mutation daughters genetic carriers mutation female carriers usually show clinical symptoms pass mutation offspring daughters mutated gene also like mother asymptomatic carriers sons express clinical symptomscitation needed females unlikely express clinical signs however rare cases females shown symptoms associated norrie disease retinal abnormalities mild hearing additionally cases symptomatic female carriers one possible scenario could lead female case norrie disease copies ndp gene bear mutations could case consanguineous families due spontaneous somatic mutation another explanation affected females could skewed xchromosome inactivation latter case carrier females one mutated ndp allele could higher proportion defective norrin expressed leading presentation symptoms norrie norrie disease caused mutation norrin cystine knot growth factor gene also known norrie disease pseudoglioma gene ndp gene mutations could include splicing missense mutations well partial full gene normal function ndp gene produce instructions creating protein called norrin normal development eye body systems norrin believed norrin also appears crucial specialization cells retina establishment blood supply inner ear tissues retina role norrin specialization retinal cells unique sensory function impeded mutation results accumulation immature retinal cells back eye norrins role establishment blood vessels supplying eye disrupted tissues develop norrin important development eye mutation ndp gene affect systems body well severe problems caused chromosomal deletions region ndp gene causing prevention gene product even neighboring mao genes mutations simply change single amino acid norrin effects less widespread severe however location type ndp mutation necessarily determine degree severity disease since highly varying clinical signs diagnosed patients carrying exactly mutation therefore involvement modifying genes likely hand certain structurally important amino acids changed eg cysteines forming putative cystine knot clinical outcome shown norrie disease ndp related diseases diagnosed combination clinical findings molecular genetic testing molecular genetic testing identifies mutations cause disease affected clinical diagnoses rely ocular findings norrie disease diagnosed grayishyellow fibrovascular masses found behind eye birth three months doctors also look progression disease three months years age progressions include cataracts iris atrophy shallowing anterior chamber shrinking children condition either light perception vision allcitation needed addition use initial diagnosis molecular genetic testing used confirm diagnostic testing diagnosis ocular examination carrier testing females prenatal diagnosis preimplantation genetic diagnosis three types clinical molecular genetic testing approximately males missense splice mutations ndp gene partial whole gene deletions detected using sequence deletionduplication analysis used detect mutations submicroscopic deletions also used testing carrier females last testing used linkage analysis used first two types unavailable linkage analysis also recommended families one member affected mri often used diagnose retinal dysplasia occurs norrie disease however retinal dysplasia indistinguishable mri persistent fetal vasculature dysplasia trisomy families existing history norrie disease genetic counselling utero diagnosis norrie disease may utero diagnosis reported include genetic testing amniocentesis ultrasonography examine fetal eyes confirmation diagnosis first day life ophthalmological examination anesthesia also reported ocular auditory behavioral management common areas intervention treatment patients norrie disease ocular eye management often patients already complete retinal detachment birth time diagnosis surgical intervention often offered however evidence benefit early surgery laser therapy cases retinal detachment surgery may also used treat increased intraocular pressure rare cases enucleation removal eye considered control high proportion individuals norrie disease experience progressive hearing loss second decade life cases use hearing aids shown effective middle late adulthood significantly impaired hearing cochlear implants may also individuals norrie disease reported present developmental delay cognitive impairment additionally behavioral issues also reported supportive intervention therapy example working speech language therapists occupational therapists used maximize educational opportunities furthermore training teachers school counselors best support children vision hearing impairment extremely beneficialcitation needed routine monitoring individuals norrie disease recommended best manage disease includes regular followup ophthalmologist even vision severely compromised additionally due high proportion individuals norrie disease develop hearing loss regular monitoring hearing loss beneficial allow hearing loss detected early correctly recently use dual sensory clinics proposed provide improved care patients living conditions norrie disease example great ormond street hospital gosh london building new sight sound center aim improving patient experience individuals conditions norrie benefits dual sensory clinics include improved communication different health care professionals hcps involved management norrie disease eg ophthalmologists audiologists well allowing consistent training staff best practices managing interacting individuals sensory impairmentcitation needed individuals norrie disease often feel isolated society due difficulties communication cases hearing loss also experienced psychological burden shown increase example number norrie disease patients reported experience transient depression correlating onset hearing provision emotional support individuals norrie disease important clinical treatment strategies terms improving quality life reducing disease burdencitation needed research understanding norrie disease improve lives norrie disease ongoing example research taking place great ormond street institute child health university college london ucl gosich study developmental changes ear eye norrie disease hope understand improve current treatment group ucl gosich focusing particularly hearing loss aspect disease whether might possible treat gene therapycitation needed danish ophthalmologist named mette warburg reported danish family showed seven cases hereditary degenerative disease throughout seven generations first member family thoroughly studied boy childs examination three months noticed normal except lens appeared opaque irises area behind lens filled growing yellowish mass five months later left eye removed due suspicion retinoblastoma cancerous tumor retina histologic examination showed hemorrhagic necrotic mass posterior chamber surrounded undifferentiated immature undeveloped glial tissue diagnosis included pseudotumor retina hyperplasia retinal ciliary iris pigment epithelium hypoplasia necrosis inner layer retina cataract phthisis bulbi physician suspected tumor although emerged developmental defect led malformation inner parts eye eye functional cells already begun die necrosis eye globe began shrink due dysfunction phthisi bulbi danish family five seven people cases developed deafness later life also four seven mental capacity determined low warburg researched literature various medical categories discovered similar cases believed caused disease suggested disease named another famous danish ophthalmologist gordon norrie norrie greatly recognized work blind surgeon danish institute blind ndp gene previously named norrie disease pseudoglioma gene still used widely referring ndp however current approved name ndp norrin cystine knot growth factor two patient organizations people affected norrie disease norrie disease association nda founded usbased nonprofit organization aiming provide information support people living norrie disease families nda holds conference norrie disease every three
