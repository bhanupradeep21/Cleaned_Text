nonalphabetic writing systems like syllabaries ideal phonemic orthography would complete onetoone correspondence bijection graphemes letters phonemes language phoneme would invariably represented

orthography established partly english acquired large number loanwords different times retaining original spelling varying levels partly regularisation spelling moving away situation many different

need periodic updating attempted various language regulators proposed spelling reformers sometimes pronunciation word changes match spelling called spelling pronunciation common loanwords occasionally

pronunciation subsequently evolved fixed spelling said phonemes represent graphemes rather vice versa much technical jargon primary medium communication written language rather spoken language phonemes represent graphemes unimportant word pronounced moreover sounds literate people perceive heard word significantly influenced actual spelling sometimes countries written language undergo spelling reform realign writing contemporary spoken language range simple spelling changes word forms switching entire writing system turkey switched arabic alphabet turkish alphabet latin origin methods phonetic transcription international phonetic alphabet ipa aim describe pronunciation standard form often used solve ambiguities spelling written language may also used write languages previous written form systems like ipa used phonemic representation showing detailed phonetic information see narrow vs broad transcription phonemic orthographies different phonetic transcription whereas phonemic orthography allophones usually represented grapheme purely phonetic script would demand phonetically distinct allophones distinguished take example american english sound words table cat would phonemic orthography written character however strictly phonetic script would make distinction aspirated table flap butter unaspirated stop glottalized cat allophones exist english dialects words sound english speakers think really group sounds pronounced slightly differently depending occur word perfect phonemic orthography one letter per group sounds phoneme different letters sounds distinguish words bed spelled differently bet narrow phonetic transcription represents phones sounds humans capable producing many often grouped together single phoneme given natural language though groupings vary across languages english example distinguish aspirated unaspirated consonants languages like korean bengali hindi sounds speech languages world written rather small universal phonetic
