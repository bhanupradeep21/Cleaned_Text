nih assessment neurological behavioral function multidimensional set brief royaltyfree measures researchers clinicians use assess cognitive sensory motor emotional function people ages suite measures administered study participants two hours less variety settings particular emphasis measuring outcomes longitudinal epidemiologic studies prevention intervention trials battery normed validated across lifespan subjects age use ensures assessment methods results used comparisons across existing future studies nih toolbox capable monitoring neurological behavioral function time measuring key constructs across developmental institutes centers offices national institutes health support neuroscience research formed coalition called nih blueprint neuroscience nih blueprint goal develop new tools resources training opportunities accelerate pace discovery neuroscience research research community long sought development standard instruments measure cognitive emotional health nih blueprint awarded contract develop innovative approach meet need leadership principal investigator richard c gershon team scientists nearly academic institutions charged developing set tools enhance data collection large cohort studies advance neurobehavioral research nih toolbox divides tests four aspects neural function called domain batteries prior nih toolbox many studies collected information aspects neural function little uniformity among measures used capture moreover capturing information four domains within study would costly terms time subject burden custom measures could easily compared across studies assessments typically limited looking cognitive variables expensive equipment persubject royalty fees often required timeconsuming measures usually required highly trained administrators nih toolbox researchers assess function using common metric crosswalk among measures supporting pooling sharing large data sets nih toolbox support scientific discovery bringing common language research questions respect primary study aims arising secondary data analyses four batteries provide researchers measures minimal subject burden nih toolbox battery measures used human connectome project hcp understand relationship brain connectivity standardized measures easily compared across studies measures validated gold standard instruments easily incorporate multiple areas neurological functioning nih toolbox requires inexpensive equipment royalties low persubject costs persubject costs limited taste olfaction assessments nih toolbox offers brief psychometrically sound measures administered minimal expertise initial literature database reviews request information nihfunded researchers identified subdomains inclusion nih toolbox existing measures relevant project

applicability across life span psychometric soundness brevity ease use applicability diverse settings different groups lack intellectual property constraints also preference instruments already validated normed use individuals years old results instrument selection process greatly facilitated drafting plans develop nih toolbox measures validation studies conducted nih toolbox measures assure important tools research met rigorous scientific standards studies conducted across entire age range typically included subjects statistically compared gold standard measures wherever tests using item
