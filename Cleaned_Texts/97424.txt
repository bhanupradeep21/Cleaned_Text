roletaking theory social perspective taking socialpsychological concept one important factors facilitating social cognition children growing ability understand others feelings perspectives ability emerges result general cognitive part process requires children come realize others views may differ roletaking ability involves understanding cognitive affective ie relating moods emotions attitudes aspects another persons point view differs perceptual perspective taking ability recognize another persons visual point view furthermore albeit mixed evidence issue role taking perceptual perspective taking seem functionally developmentally independent robert selman noted emphasizing importance theory within field cognitive argues matured roletaking ability allows us better appreciate actions affect fail develop ability role take forced erroneously judge others behaving solely result external one selmans principal additions theory empirically supported developmental theory roletaking ability social cognitive research childrens thoughts others perspectives feelings behaviors emerged one largest areas research roletaking theory provide theoretical foundation upon research rest guided relations applications numerous theories topics robert selman developed developmental theory roletaking ability based four first work h feffer feffer gourevitch related roletaking ability piagets theory social decentering developed projective test assess childrens ability decenter second research john h flavell studied childrens growing abilities judge peoples conceptual perceptual third developmental ideas differentiation whereupon one learns distinguish hisher perspective perspectives others integration ability relate ones perspective perspectives final source influence comes selmans previous research assessed childrens ability describe different perspectives characters one example selmans stories holly children told holly avid tree climber one day holly falls tree hurt hollys father sees makes holly promise stop climbing trees holly promises later however holly friends meet shawn boy whose kitten stuck tree holly one amongst friends climb trees well enough save shawns kitten may fall moment remembers promise made father selman goes ask children perspectives holly father stage associated typical responses level ages characterized two lacking first failure distinguish perspectives specifically child unable distinguish perspective including perspective social action occurred others second ability child lacks relating perspectives social holly dilemma children tend respond holly save kitten father mind hollys disobedience happy likes kittens actuality child displaying hisher inability separate hisher liking kittens perspectives holly level ages roughly children recognize others situation may different information available thus may differ words children matured child still significantly lacks integration ability however heshe understand views influenced views others vice versa ad addition child believes sole reason differing social perspectives different information nothing holly dilemma asked father would angry found holly climbed tree children might respond know climbed tree would angry knew would realize good reason recognizing father may still angry regardless wanting save kitten values concern daughters childs differentiation ability matures level ages roughly enough heshe understands people also differ social perspectives particularly held differing values set turn child able better put himherself position another terms integration child understand others think hisher point view allows child predict person might react childs still lacking however child able consider another persons point view another persons point view child holly dilemma children asked holly climb tree typically respond yes knows father understand indicates child considering fathers perspective light hollys perspective however asked father would want holly climb tree children typically respond would shows child solely considering fathers point view worry hollys level ages roughly child differentiate hisher perspective viewpoint likely average member addition child take view detached thirdperson view situation terms integration child simultaneously consider hisher view others others view child consequences feedback loop perspectives terms behaviour describing result holly dilemma child may take perceptive detached third party responding holly wanted get kitten likes kittens knew supposed climb trees holly father knew holly told climb trees known kitten level ages roughly adolescent considers others perspectives reference social environment culture person comes assuming person believe act accord societys norms asked holly deserves punished transgression adolescents typically respond holly father understand need humanely treat three studies conducted assess selmans theory shown support developmental outline roletaking ability progression selman conducted first study theory using middleclass children ages experiment children asked predict explain predictions another childs behaviour certain situation child participants given situational information available child making behavioural cognitive predictions results implied stage progression role taking ability function age theorized second assessment theory selman f byrne interviewed children ages two sociomoral children required discuss perspectives different characters dilemma results showed role taking ability progressed stages function third study assessing selmans theory longitudinal study male children role taking results showed children interviewed followed stages outlined selman none skipped jean piaget stressed importance play children especially play involves role believed role taking play promotes mature social understanding teaching children take roles others allowing understand different people differing addition piaget argued good solutions interpersonal conflicts involve compromise arises ability consider points view two piagets fundamental concepts primarily influenced role taking piagetian theory concepts used describe solely cognitive development applied role taking theory social evidence piagets cognitive theories applied interpersonal aspects roletaking theory comes two sources first empirical evidence childrens ability role take correlated iq performance piagetian secondly two theories conceptually linked selmans roletaking stages correspond piagets cognitive development stages preoperational children level concrete operators level formal operators level selmans given relation h well feffer v argued social roletaking extension decentering social sphere selman argued point also noting growth roletaking ability brought childs decreased egocentrism heshe lawrence kohlberg argued higher moral development requires roletaking instance kohlbergs conventional level morality ages roughly involves moral stereotyping empathybased morality alertness behaviour guided predicted evaluations others identifying authority require role selman tested children ages kohlbergs moraljudgment measure two roletaking found development role taking within age range related progression kohlbergs conventional moral stage retest year later confirmed kohlbergs argument general shown higher moral development conventional stage requires childrens achieved ability age reciprocally deal others mason gibbs found moral judgment development measured kohlbergs theory consistently related role taking opportunities experienced childhood adolescence finding supported kohlbergs view moral progress beyond third stage necessitates contact perspectives namely entire cultures political groups individuals likely encounter become adolescents adults thus meet many different people school kohlberg piaget emphasized role taking ability facilitates moral kohlberg argued cognitive roletaking development required sufficient moral turn maintained piagets cognitive developmental stages underlie selmans role taking stages subsequently fundamental moral developmental predicts cognition develops first followed corresponding role taking stage finally corresponding moral stage never way conceptually three processes tied together walker reasoning cognitive development involves progressive understanding environment roletaking step upon recognition people subjective interpretation environment including think behave towards people moral development final step grasping people think behave towards one evidence support view comes first three reviews showed moderate correlations selmans role taking theory piagets cognitive developmental stages kohlbergs moral developmental evidence comes walker richards finding moral development kohlbergs stage occurred already early basic formal operations according piagets developmental theory earlier similarly paolittos attempts stimulate moral development worked subjects already attained corresponding role taking previous research also shown short role taking treatments exposing subjects role taking reasoning subjects one stage higher lead moral general demonstrations argument faust arbuthnot researchers shown moral development probable subjects higher cognitive direct investigation kohlbergs necessary sufficient argument walker tested hypothesis children attained beginning formal operations role taking stage could progress kohlbergs moral stage grade children participated study results strongly supported hypothesis given children beginning formal substage cognitive development role taking stage progressed moral stage support came studys demonstration short role playing treatment stimulated progress moral reasoning followup krebs gilmore also directly tested kohlbergs necessary sufficient argument moral development children ages first three stages cognitive role taking moral results generally supported kohlbergs view strongly given demonstrated cognitive development prerequisite role taking development moral based results researchers suggested moral education programs underlain kohlbergs theory must first ensure prerequisite cognitive role taking abilities roletaking ability argued related prosocial behaviours evidence claim found many sources underwood moore instance found perceptual affective cognitive perspectivetaking positively correlated prosocial children trained improve roletaking ability subsequently become generous cooperative apprehensive needs others comparison children received role taking research also shown people good roletaking greater ability sympathize overall picture clear prosocial behaviour related role taking ability development social deviance linked study one reason link roletaking ability prosociality secondgrade children found either high low roletaking instructed teach two kindergartners arts crafts task sixteen measures prosocial behaviour scored high low role takers diverged measures including several helping measures providing options social problem solving analysis results showed low role takers helped less high role takers lack wanting help poorer ability interpreting social cues indicating need words low role takers tended able recognize problems made plainly role taking also related empathy batson participants listen interview woman going instructed participants imagine feels imagine would feel situation found conditions produced feelings empathy schoenrade found result imagining person distress feels one would feel persons situation produces feelings finally many theorists including mead piaget asch heider deutsch madsen kohlberg theorized relationship cooperation role taking one study childrens predisposition cooperate shown strongly correlate affective role taking researchers also shown indirect relationship cooperation roletaking childs ability function social relationships found depend partially hisher roletaking ability instance researchers found children poor roletaking ability greater difficulty forming sustaining social relationships well receiving lower peer davis found roletaking ability positively correlated social general progress roletaking ability shown beneficial ones personal interpersonal better functioning interpersonal domain particularly shown relation roletaking ability social problem solving ability role playing shown improve male teenagers handling social problem gehlbach found similar supporting result demonstrating adolescents better role taking abilities superior ability conflict many researchers also found role taking ability development positively affects interpersonal problem solving additionally role taking promote better social functioning interpersonal domain smoothening social interactions improving behavioural mimicking training children roletaking ability improve interpersonal functioning well one study preschoolers made role play interpersonal conflicts using task end discuss alternative solutions problems solution would affect weeks preschoolers participated role playing solutions became less aggressive classroom adjustment became moreover use role reversal interpersonal problem situations found stimulate cooperation help participants better understand others arguments position elicit new interpretations situation change attitudes problem improve perceptions persons efforts solving issue willingness compromise cooperate result research suggested one way improve cooperative skills improve affective role taking roletaking also work decrease prejudice importantly decrease prejudice stereotyping occurs target individual targets addition role taking ability demonstrated decrease social children adhd struggle social environments socialcognitive reasons several studies indicated difference children without adhd role taking ability wherein children adhd lower role taking ability lower role taking use slower role taking development children without given results suggested children adhd trained role taking improve social skills including often comorbid oppositional conduct relationship childhood adolescent delinquency role taking considerable burack found maltreated children adolescents behavioural problems exhibited egocentrism higher levels nonmaltreated children adolescents progressed faster expectedly role taking chandler found chronically delinquent boys exhibited lower role taking abilities much role taking ability comparable role taking ability scores nondelinquent children nearly half turn onethird delinquent boys study assigned treatment program designed improve role taking posttreatment measures demonstrated program successfully induced role taking ability progress group followup assessment found nearly decrease delinquent behaviours following progresses role taking found delinquent girls chalmers townsend trained delinquent girls ages role taking skills sessions following girls demonstrated improved understanding interpersonal situations problems greater empathy acceptance individual differences exhibited prosociality overall picture roletaking training help delinquent youth youth conduct lag behind roletaking several researchers argued deficits social lives communication ability imagination autistic children result deficiencies role believed autistic childrens inability role take prevents developing theory indeed role taking described theory mind failing role take failing develop theory mind may lead autistic children use understanding situation predict others behaviour resulting deficits social support two studies found shortcomings roletaking ability autistic children comparison another study found lower ability role taking related significantly lower social competency autistic particular autistic children study could focus concurrently different cognitions required successful role taking proficient social specifically dawson fernald found conceptual roletaking related social deficits severity autism experienced autistic children affective role taking related severity main criticism selmans roletaking theory focuses much effect cognitive development roletaking ability social cognition thereby overlooking noncognitive factors affect childrens abilities instance social experiences disagreements close friends found
