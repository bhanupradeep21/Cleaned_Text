metastatic insulinoma rare form malignant insulinoma involving metastatic insulinoma small tumor localized pancreas originating islet beta cells produce excess increase insulin ultimately leads hypoglycemia insulinomas commonly benign tumors metastasize become malignant metastatic growth characterized local invasion distal however insulinomas often difficult detect due relatively small size diameter oftentimes less cm therefore clinical appearance pathology sufficient diagnosing malignant malignant insulinomas easily treated require various treatments dependent persons metastatic insulinomas commonly preceded hypoglycemic symptoms whipple triad majority hypoglycemic symptoms manifest neuroglycopenic symptoms andor autonomic common neuroglycopenic symptoms include generalized confusion significant behavioral changes coma seizure common autonomic symptoms include diaphoresis weakness palpitations thus various presenting symptoms observed patients primarily attributed fact metastatic insulinoma initially diagnosed another disease benign insulinoma potential progress insulinomas generally occur sporadically date current cause metastatic insulinomas unknown primarily due form already rare disease insulinoma metastatic insulinomas even less prevalent insulinomas commonly begin benign insulinomas metastasize metastastic patients insulinoma initially exhibit symptoms hypoglycemia resulting excess insulin secretion islet beta cells within pancreatic tumor nonpancreatic tumor cells excess insulin secretes blood stream causes significant drop blood glucose level also known hypoglycemia hypoglycemia accompanied many listed neuroglycopenic andor autonomic symptoms metastatic insulinoma cancerous cells initial insulinoma begin break away enter either bloodstream lymphatic system upon spreading entering another part body process metastasis successfully occurred cancerous cells rapidly divide spread main sites metastasis pancreatic cancer liver lung diagnosis occur via two distinct ways first inclusive patient initially diagnosed benign insulinoma initial presentation hypoglycemic symptoms blood tests taken order confirm hypoglycemia glucose insulin cpeptide drawn initial diagnoses routinely also include preoperative ct confirm insulinoma upon completion bloodwork required radiology majority metastatic insulinomas diagnosed common treatment option diagnosed benign insulinomas treated isolated removal insulinoma patient cases progress metastasize metastatic insulinoma occurs cancerous cells break away insulinoma enter bloodstream lymphatic system thus possible later develop malignancy initial diagnosis insulinoma even operative removal insulinoma cases common site metastases well lymph however second type diagnoses metastatic insulinoma involves patient presents symptoms insulinoma taken preoperative following blood tests needed diagnose insulinomacitation needed significant blood glucose level Î¼iuml cpeptide level indicative hypoinsulinemic hypoglycemiacitation needed less invasive imaging us ct scan mri utilized confirm presence insulinoma specifically transabdominal ultrasound ct typically first diagnostic images ordered testing includes endoscopic ultrasound mricitation needed patients diagnosed general insulinoma commonly treated surgical removal insulinoma patients metastatic insulinoma surgery enough thus medical therapies widely considered reserved especially unresectable cytoreductive surgery alongside antitumor therapies part initial treatment plans utilized potential removal insulinoma patients metastatic insulinoma cytoreductive surgery effective rate less surgery however shown improve symptomatology overall survival diazoxide medication used primarily reduce excess insulin secreted insulinoma cells insulin suppressed affecting atpsensitive potassium channels also lead excess potassium ultimately result oedema sodium retention body order counteract diazoxide commonly used combination thiazide diuretics although diazoxide noted immediate effect patients course time dosage may need betablockers also positive effect overall reduction insulin production therefore resolving hypoglycemiacitation needed prognosis diagnosed metastatic insulinoma falls large spectrum patients live anywhere months years initial reason huge gap perspective life expectancy related minimal follow information gathered patients metastatic insulinoma therefore currently reliable information regarding hard statistics exact time intervalscitation needed extremely rare prevalence disease much information available regarding epidemiology general insulinoma diagnosed every one four cases per one million people malignant insulinoma extremely rare form insulinoma affecting total insulinoma insulinomas tend slightly higher prevalence females total diagnosed general insulinoma cases occur median age minimal research completed metastatic insulinoma addresses specific patient cases presenting signs symptoms potential treatment options also commonly discussed within case studies research date comprehensive generalized patients diagnosed metastatic insulinoma therefore recommend research conducted potential treatment cases metastatic insulinoma would also recommend greater follow patients provide concrete life expectancy intervalcitation needed
