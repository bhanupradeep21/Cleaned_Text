acidobacteriota phylum gramnegative bacteria members physiologically diverse ubiquitous especially soils underrepresented members phylum physiologically diverse found variety environments including soil decomposing hot springs oceans caves metalcontaminated members phylum particularly abundant soil habitats representing total bacterial environmental factors ph nutrients seen drive acidobacteriota many acidobacteriota acidophilic including first described member phylum acidobacterium much unknown acidobacteria form function thus growing field microbiology uncertainty attributed difficulty bacteria grown laboratory recent success propagation using low concentrations nutrients combination high amounts yet progress still quite slow new methods allowed approximately subdivisions species additionally many samples sequenced taxonomic names yet fully characterized area study current topic scientific understanding expected grow change new information comes light notable species holophaga geothrix acanthopleuribacter bryobacter since recently discovered large majority cultured ecology metabolism bacteria well however bacteria may important contributor ecosystems since particularly abundant within members subdivisions found particularly abundant well natural soil habitat unclassified subdivision acidobacteriota also identified contaminant dna extraction kit reagents may lead erroneous appearance microbiota metagenomic members subdivision found dominate low ph additionally acidobacteriota acid mine drainage found adapted acidic ph conditions ph compared acidobacteriota potentially due cell specialization enzyme gc content acidobacteria genomes consistent within subdivisions group v fragments roughly lower group iii majority acidobacteriota considered acidobacteriota considered anaerobes within subdivision subdivision found strains acidobacteriota originating soils genomic potential respire oxygen atmospheric subatmospheric members acidobacteriota phylum considered oligotrophic bacteria due high abundances low organic carbon however variation phylum may indicate may ecological first species acidobacterium capsulatum phylum discovered however acidobacteriota recognized distinct clade recognized phylum first genome sequenced effort classify acidobacteria rrna gene regions sequenced many different strains sequences lead formation subdivisions within phyla today accepted subdivisions recognized ribosomal database much variety comes populations acidobacteria found soils contaminated uranium therefore known species phyla concentrated subdivisions largest microbes aerobes heterotrophic subdivision contains known genera addition majority species able cultivated thus within known genera conclusive species genera divided amongst subdivisions acidobateria developing area microbiology hypothesized numbers change drastically members subdivision able use dglucose dxylose lactose carbon unable use fucose members subdivision also contain enzymes galactosidases used breakdown members subdivision found use chitin carbon despite presence genetic information generally known encode carbohydrate processing machinery various genera acidobacteria several experimental studies demonstrated inability break various cellulose main component plant cell walls seemingly opportune resource carbon however single species across subdivisions shown process telmactobacter bradus subvision scientists note much early understanding field draw conclusions carbon processing acidobacteria believe xylan degradation polysaccharide primarily found secondary cell wall plants currently appears universal carbon breakdown researchers believe additional factor lack understanding carbon degradation acidobacteria may stem present limited ability provide adequate cultivation study natural behavior bacteria must grow live controlled observable environment habitat provided recorded data reliably report activity microbes question therefore inconsistencies genome sequence based predictions observed carbon processes may explained present study methods clear evidence acidobacteriota involved nitrogencycle processes nitrification denitrification nitrogen however geothrix fermantans shown able reduce nitrate contained norb norb gene also identified koribacter verstailis solibacter addition presence nira gene observed members subdivision additionally date genomes described directly uptake ammonium via ammonium channel transporter family acidobacteriota use inorganic organic nitrogen nitrogen sources
