meckels diverticulum true congenital diverticulum slight bulge small intestine present birth vestigial remnant vitelline duct common malformation gastrointestinal tract present approximately males frequently experiencing symptoms meckels diverticulum first explained fabricius hildanus sixteenth century later named johann friedrich meckel described embryological origin type diverticulum majority people meckels diverticulum asymptomatic asymptomatic meckels diverticulum called silent meckels symptoms occur typically appear age two common presenting symptom painless rectal bleeding melaenalike black offensive stools followed intestinal obstruction volvulus intussusception occasionally meckels diverticulitis may present features acute also severe pain epigastric region experienced person along bloating epigastric umbilical regions times symptoms painful may cause sleepless nights acute pain felt foregut region specifically epigastric umbilical regionscitation needed cases bleeding occurs without warning may stop spontaneously symptoms extremely painful often mistaken stomach pain resulting eating constipationcitation needed rarely meckels diverticulum containing ectopic pancreatic tissue present abdominal pain increased serum amylase levels mimicking acute lifetime risk person meckels diverticulum develop certain complications gastrointestinal bleeding peritonitis intestinal obstruction may occur symptomatic people table rare occasions diverticulum herniate abdominal wall also known littre hernia complications require surgical treatment untreated meckels diverticulum mortality rate table complications meckels bleeding diverticulum common young children especially males less years symptoms may include bright red blood stools hematochezia weakness abdominal tenderness pain even anaemia bleeding may caused appearance stools may indicate nature bleeding inflammation diverticulum mimic symptoms appendicitis ie periumbilical tenderness intermittent crampy abdominal pain perforation inflamed diverticulum result peritonitis diverticulitis also cause adhesions leading intestinal diverticulitis may result symptoms vomiting abdominal pain severe complete anomalies diverticulum umbilicus may include presence fibrous cord cyst fistula sinus leading neoplasms tumors meckels diverticulum may cause bleeding acute abdominal pain gastrointestinal

meckels diverticula children scan detects gastric mucosa since approximately symptomatic meckels diverticula ectopic gastric pancreatic cells contained within displayed spot scan distant stomach children scan highly accurate noninvasive specificity however adults test specific scan accurate children gastric mucosa found bleeding diverticula common symptom children adults patients misplaced gastric cells may experience peptic ulcers consequence therefore tests colonoscopy screenings bleeding disorders performed angiography assist determining location severity bleeding colonoscopy might helpful rule sources bleeding used identification toolcitation needed angiography might identify brisk bleeding patients meckels ultrasonography could demonstrate omphaloenteric duct remnants computed
