nanshiungosaurus meaning nanxiongs lizard genus therizinosaurid lived asia late cretaceous south china type species nanshiungosaurus brevispinus first discovered described dong zhiming represented single specimen preserving cervical dorsal vertebrae pelvis supposed unlikely second species nanshiungosaurus bohlini found described also represented vertebrae species however differs geological age lacks authentic characteristics compared type making affinity genus unsupported largesized therizinosaurid estimated cover nearly ft length weighed kg lb nanshiungosaurus pneumatized vertebral column posterior cervical vertebrae long neck unusually robust slightly elongated dorsals equipped broad torso seen bulky pelvis therizinosaurids keratinous beak used feeding stocky feet four weightbearing toes large flattened claws nanshiungosaurus classified therizinosaurian dinosaur along therizinosaurus segnosaurus nanshiungosaurus one earliest therizinosaurs described named unusual shape pelvis led original interpret remains belonging dwarf sauropod genus recognized segnosaur therizinosaur based pelvic similarities segnosaurus first research therizinosaurs complicated since sparse remains known time features multiple dinosaur lineages leading interpretation prosauropod dinosaurs geological expedition nanxiong basin led institute vertebrate paleontology paleoanthropology several fossilized remains dinosaurs discovered team near village dapingcun nanxiong formation guangdong province relatively large partial skeleton found articulation dating back late cretaceous specimen labelled number ivpp consisted cervical lacking atlas dorsal actually sacral first caudal vertebrae nearly complete bulky pelvis lacking right ilium ischium later specimen formally described chinese paleontologist dong zhiming used basis new genus species nanshiungosaurus brevispinus generic name nanshiungosaurus refers site provenance nanxiong city derived greek σαῦρος sauros meaning lizard lastly specific name brevispinus derived latin brevis spina meaning short spine respectively reference relatively short vertebral spines first described dong mistakenly thought specimen dwarf strange titanosaurine sauropod characterized shorter thicker neck sauropods based pelvis dong zhiming hailu named described supposed second species nanshiungosaurus bohlini based skeleton found near mazongshan consists cervical dorsal vertebrae ribs specimen catalogued ivpp coming early cretaceous upper xinminbao group also coined nanshiungosauridae contain species dong yu presented evidence argumentation supporting assignment species north american paleontologist lindsay zanno considered referral highly improbable since n bohlini dates back barremianaptian ages view lack synapomorphies considered supposed second species unrelated nanshiungosaurus might warrant genus addition corrected number sacral vertebrae noted holotype pelvis latter suffered damage since collection reconstructed painted plaster affected
