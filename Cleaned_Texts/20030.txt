cross modal plasticity adaptive reorganization neurons integrate function two sensory systems cross modal plasticity type neuroplasticity often occurs sensory deprivation due disease brain damage reorganization neural network greatest following longterm sensory deprivation congenital blindness prelingual deafness instances cross modal plasticity strengthen sensory systems compensate lack vision hearing strengthening due new connections formed brain cortices longer receive sensory even though blind longer able see visual cortex still active use although deals information different visual input studies found volume white matter myelinated nerve connections reduced optic tract primary visual cortex however grey matter volume reduced primary visual cortex atrophy grey matter neuron bodies likely due association optic eyes longer receive visual information disuse connected optic tract causes loss grey matter volume primary visual cortex white matter thought atrophy way although primary visual cortex less affected example blind individuals show enhanced perceptual attentional sensitivity identification different auditory stimuli including speech sounds spatial detection sound interrupted early blind inducing virtual lesion visual cortex using transcranial magnetic somatosensory cortex also able recruit visual cortex assist tactile sensation cross modal plasticity reworks network structure brain leading increased connections somatosensory visual furthermore somatosensory cortex acts hub region nerve connections brain early blind crossmodal networking early blind able react tactile stimuli greater speed accuracy neural pathways work one element visual system somatosensory cortex able recruit dorsalvisual stream dorsal stream used sighted identify spatial information visually early blind use tactile sensation however sighted blind participants used dorsal stream process spatial information suggesting cross modal plasticity blind rerouted dorsal visual stream work sense touch rather changing overall function stream evidence degree cross modal plasticity somatosensory visual cortices experiencedependent study using tactile tongue devices transmit spatial information early blind individuals able show visual cortex activations week training although cross modal connections start early blind able develop connections somatosensory visual cortices sighted controls unable early congenitally blind individuals stronger cross modal connections earlier began learning earlier start allows stronger connections form early blind children grow using sense touch read instead using sight perhaps due cross modal connections sensory testing studies shown people born blind read braille proficiently perceive touch rapidly furthermore tactile spatial acuity enhanced enhancement cross modal plasticity also occur prelingual deaf individuals functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri study found deaf participants use primary auditory cortex well visual cortex observe sign although auditory cortex longer receives input ears deaf still use specific regions cortex process visual primary sensory abilities like brightness discrimination visual contrast sensitivity temporal discrimination thresholds temporal resolution discrimination thresholds motion directions appear change loss modality like hearing however higherlevel processing tasks may undergo compensating changes case auditory deprivation compensations appear affect visual periphery processing movement detection peripheral deaf individuals lack auditory input auditory cortex instead used assist visual language processing auditory activations also appear attentiondependent deaf however process visual attention deaf significantly different hearing stronger activations auditory cortex visual observation occur deaf individuals pay attention visual cue activations weaker cue direct line one study found deaf participants process peripheral visual stimuli quickly hearing deafness appears heighten spatial attention peripheral visual field central brain thus seems compensate auditory loss within visual system enhancing peripheral field attention resources however central visual resources may improvements tend limited areas brain dedicated auditory visual stimuli simply rewriting audiodedicated areas visual areas visual enhancements seem especially focused areas brain normally process convergence auditory input specifically seen studies showing changes posterior parietal cortex deaf individuals one main centers visual attention also area known integrating information various recent research indicates attentionbased tasks object tracking enumeration deaf subjects perform better hearing improvement visual processing still observed even deaf subject paying attention direct study published found congenitally deaf subjects significantly larger neuroretinal rim areas hearing subjects suggests deaf subjects may greater concentration retinal ganglion deaf individuals often use sign language mode communication however sign language alone appear significantly change brain organization fact neuroimaging electrophysiology data studying functional changes visual pathways well animal studies sensory deprivation shown enhancement attention peripheral visual processing found deaf individuals found hearing peripheral visual changes seen forms deaf individuals signers oral communicators comparative fmris hearing speakers hearing early signers hand show comparable peripheral activation enhancement attention peripheral visual processing found deaf individuals found hearing signers therefore unlikely signing causes neurological differences visual another way see cross modal plasticity deaf looking effects installing cochlear implants became deaf prelingually cross modal plasticity interfered ability process language using cochlear implant prelingual deaf auditory cortex reshaped deal visual information deal well new sensory input implant provides however postlingual deaf experience visual cues like lip reading help understand speech better along assistance cochlear implant postlingual deaf much recruitment
