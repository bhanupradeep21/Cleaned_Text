drinking act ingesting water liquids body mouth proboscis elsewhere humans drink swallowing completed peristalsis esophagus physiological processes drinking vary widely among animals animals drink water maintain bodily hydration although many survive water gained food water required many physiological processes inadequate less commonly excessive water intake associated health problems liquid enters human mouth swallowing process completed peristalsis delivers liquid esophagus stomach much activity abetted gravity liquid may poured hands drinkware may used vessels drinking also performed acts inhalation typically imbibing hot liquids drinking spoon infants employ method suction wherein lips pressed tight around source breastfeeding combination breath tongue movement creates vacuum draws necessity terrestrial animals captivity become accustomed drinking water freeroaming animals stay hydrated fluids moisture fresh learn actively seek foods high fluid conditions impel drink bodies water methods motions differ greatly among cats canines ruminants lower neck lap water powerful cats canines lap water tongue spoonlike canines lap water scooping mouth tongue taken shape ladle however cats tip tongue smooth touches water cat quickly pulls tongue back mouth soon closes results column liquid pulled cats mouth secured mouth ruminants herbivores partially submerge tip mouth order draw water means plunging action tongue held cats drink significantly slower pace ruminants face greater natural predation many desert animals drink even water becomes available rely eating succulent cold frozen environments animals like hares tree squirrels bighorn sheep resort consuming snow savannas drinking method giraffes source speculation apparent defiance gravity recent theory contemplates animals long neck functions like plunger uniquely elephants draw water trunks squirt three general ways birds drink using gravity sucking using tongue fluid also obtained food birds unable swallow sucking pumping action peristalsis esophagus humans drink repeatedly raising heads filling mouths allow liquid flow gravity method usually described sipping tipping notable exception family pigeons doves columbidae fact according konrad lorenz one recognizes order single behavioral characteristic namely drinking water pumped peristalsis esophagus occurs without exception within order group however shows behavior pteroclidae placed near doves doubtlessly old although general rule still stands since time observations made exceptions addition specialized nectar feeders like sunbirds nectariniidae hummingbirds trochilidae drink using protrusible grooved troughlike tongues parrots psittacidae lap birds scoop draw water buccal areas bills raising tilting heads back drink exception common pigeon suck water directly insects obtain adequate water food dehydrated lack moist food however many species drink standing additionally terrestrial insects constantly absorb certain amount airs humidity desert insects onymacris unguicularis evolved drink substantially nighttime amphibians aquatic animals live freshwater need drink absorb water steadily skin saltwater fish however drink mouth swim purge excess salt saltwater fishes drink plenty water excrete small volume concentrated urine like nearly life forms humans require water tissue hydration lack hydration causes thirst desire drink regulated hypothalamus response subtle changes bodys electrolyte levels blood volume decline total body water called dehydration eventually lead death hypernatremia methods used management dehydration include assisted drinking oral rehydration therapy overconsumption water lead water intoxication dangerously dilute concentration salts body overhydration sometimes occurs among athletes outdoor laborers also sign disease damage hypothalamus persistent desire drink inordinate quantities water psychological condition termed polydipsia often accompanied polyuria may symptom diabetes mellitus diabetes daily intake water required normal physiological functioning human body usda recommends daily intake total water necessarily drinking consumption water contained beverages foods recommended intake liters appx gallon per day adult male liters appx gallon adult sources however claim high intake fresh drinking water separate distinct sources moisture necessary good health eight servings per day eight fluid ounces liters gallon amount recommended many although scientific evidence supporting evidencebased hydration experts say amount drinking water needed depends ambient temperature activity level body size sweat research shows drinking thirsty maintain hydration within needed drinking beyond thirst might beneficial people need perform tasks require intense concentration kidney disease kidney stones urinary tract infections people weak sense thirst may include older term drinking often used metonymically consumption alcoholic beverages cultures throughout history incorporated number wide variety strong drinks meals celebrations ceremonies toasts evidence fermented drinks human culture goes back early neolithic first pictorial evidence found
