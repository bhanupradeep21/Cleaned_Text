itch also known pruritus sensation causes desire reflex itches resisted many attempts classified one type sensory experience itches many similarities pain unpleasant sensory experiences behavioral response patterns different pain creates withdrawal reflex whereas itches leads scratch unmyelinated nerve fibers itches pain originate skin information conveyed centrally two distinct systems use nerve bundle spinothalamic commonly itch felt one place felt body called generalized itch generalized generalized itch infrequently symptom serious underlying condition sensation itching persists six weeks longer called chronic itch chronic chronic idiopathic pruritus chronic pruritus unknown origin form itch persists longer six weeks clear cause pain itch different behavioral response patterns pain elicits withdrawal reflex leads retraction therefore reaction trying protect endangered part body itch contrast creates scratch reflex draws one affected skin site itch generates stimulus foreign object underneath upon skin also urge remove example responding local itch sensation effective way remove insects ones skin scratching traditionally regarded way relieve oneself reducing annoying itch sensation however hedonic aspects scratching one would find noxious scratching highly problematic chronic itch patients ones atopic dermatitis may scratch affected spots longer produce pleasant painful sensation instead itch sensation hypothesized motivational aspects scratching include frontal brain areas reward decision making aspects might therefore contribute compulsive nature itch
