successful attempt combine image text via relief etching thus earliest illuminated manuscripts serve significant milestone blakes career peter ackroyd points newly invented form changed nature

causing exposed parts plate melt away design andor text remain slightly rest plate ie relief like modern rubber stamp acid poured wax removed raised part plate covered ink finally pressed onto paper printing method allowed expressive effects impossible achieve via major disadvantage text written backwards whatever plate would print reverse pressed onto paper dominant theory blake solved problem simply wrote another theory suggested david bindman blake wrote acid resistant text sheet paper correct way around pressed paper onto plate thus reversing text producing result written backwards first

published facsimile edition edited william william muir attempted impose order various plates efforts universally successful geoffrey keynes attempt many decisions still followed modern keynes important controversial editorial choice rigidly divide two printing sessions two distinct series came known series series b specifically used later addition framing lines series b ie print help
