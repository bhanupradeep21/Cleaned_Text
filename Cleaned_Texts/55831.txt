prenatal development latin natalis relating birth includes development embryo fetus viviparous animals gestation prenatal development starts fertilization germinal stage embryonic development continues fetal development birth human pregnancy prenatal development also called antenatal development development human embryo follows fertilization continues fetal development end tenth week gestational age embryo acquired basic form referred fetus next period fetal development many organs become fully developed fetal period described topically organ chronologically time major occurrences listed gestational age early stages embryonic development mammals later stages development length gestation varies human different terms used describe prenatal development meaning development birth term meaning antepartum latin ante parere give birth sometimes antepartum however used denote period week gestational age birth example antepartum perinatal period greek peri around latin nasci born around time birth developed countries facilities expert neonatal care available considered completed weeks usually days gestation time birth weight normally g completed days many developing countries starting point period considered completed weeks gestation weight fertilization marks first germinal stage embryonic development semen released vagina spermatozoa travel cervix along body uterus one fallopian tubes fertilization usually takes place ampulla great many sperm cells released possibility one managing adhere enter thick protective layer surrounding egg cell ovum first sperm cell successfully penetrate egg cell donates genetic material dna combine dna egg cell resulting new onecelled zygote term conception refers variably either fertilization formation conceptus implantation uterus terminology controversial zygote develop male egg fertilized sperm carries chromosome female sperm carries x chromosome contains gene sry switch androgen production later stage leading development male body type contrast mitochondrial dna zygote comes entirely egg cell following fertilization embryonic stage development continues end week gestational age week fertilization age first two weeks fertilization also referred germinal stage preembryonic zygote spends next days traveling fallopian tube dividing several times form ball cells called morula cellular division accompanied formation small cavity cells stage called blastocyst point growth overall size embryo confined within glycoprotein shell known zona pellucida instead division produces successively smaller cells blastocyst reaches uterus roughly fifth day fertilization blastocyst hatches zona pellucida allowing blastocysts outer cell layer trophoblasts come contact adhere endometrial cells uterus trophoblasts eventually give rise extraembryonic structures placenta membranes embryo becomes embedded endometrium process called implantation successful pregnancies embryo implants days embryo extraembryonic membranes placenta collectively referred conceptus products conception rapid growth occurs embryos main features begin take form process called differentiation produces varied cell types blood cells kidney cells nerve cells spontaneous abortion miscarriage first trimester pregnancy due major genetic mistakes abnormalities developing embryo critical period developing embryo also susceptible toxic exposures embryo passes phases acquisition nutrition first ten weeks gestational age period embryogenesis together first three weeks prenatal development make first trimester pregnancy week gestation week development developing embryo called fetus major structures formed time continue grow develop precursors organs formed fetus sensitive damage environmental exposure embryo instead toxic exposure often causes physiological abnormalities minor congenital malformation development continues throughout life fetus life birth significant changes occur many systems period birth adapt life outside

cognitive development individuals born dutch famine first studies focused consequences famine cognitive development including prevalence intellectual studies predate david barkers hypothesis association prenatal environment development chronic conditions later initial studies found association malnourishment cognitive later studies found associations malnourishment increased risk antisocial affective evidence acquisition language begins prenatal stage weeks gestation peripheral auditory system already fully also lowfrequency sounds less hz reach fetal inner ear womb lowfrequency sounds include pitch rhythm phonetic information related studies indicated fetuses react recognize differences ideas reinforced fact newborns present preference mothers present behavioral recognition stories heard monolingual mothers present preference native recent study eeg demonstrated different brain activation newborns hearing native language compared presented different language supporting idea language learning starts growth rate fetus linear weeks gestation growth rate embryo infant reflected weight per gestational age often given weight put relation would expected gestational age baby born within normal range weight gestational age known appropriate gestational age aga abnormally slow growth rate results infant small gestational age abnormally large growth rate results infant large gestational age slow growth rate preterm birth two factors cause low birth weight low birth weight grams slightly increase likelihood growth rate roughly correlated fundal height uterus estimated abdominal palpation exact measurements performed obstetric ultrasonography intrauterine growth restriction one causes low birth weight associated half neonatal poverty linked poor prenatal care influence prenatal development women poverty likely children younger age results low birth weight many expecting mothers little education therefore less aware risks smoking drinking alcohol drug use factors influence growth rate fetus women ages healthier environment fetus women women age gap likely fewer complications women inclined longer labor period could potentially result death mother fetus women higher risk preterm labor premature baby risk increases women poverty women take drugs women smoke young mothers likely engage high risk behaviors using alcohol drugs smoking resulting negative consequences premature babies young mothers likely neurological defects influence coping capabilities irritability trouble sleeping constant crying example increased risk syndrome infants born aged years young teenaged mothers younger mothers exposed risks miscarriages premature births birth defects estimated percent fetuses united states exposed illicit drug use maternal drug use occurs drugs ingested pregnant woman metabolized placenta transmitted fetus recent research displays correlation fine motor skills prenatal risk factors use psychoactive substances signs abortion pregnancy well perinatal risk factors gestation time duration delivery birth weight postnatal risk factors constant using cannabis greater risk birth defects low birth weight higher rate death infants drug use influence extreme irritability crying risk sids fetus marijuana slow fetal growth rate result premature delivery also lead low birth weight shortened gestational period complications cannabis use pregnancy unrelated risk perinatal death need special care babies women used cannabis least per week throughout pregnancy lighter significantly shorter birth lengths smaller head opioids including heroin cause interrupted fetal development stillbirths lead numerous birth defects heroin also result premature delivery creates higher risk miscarriages result facial abnormalities head size create gastrointestinal abnormalities fetus increased risk sids dysfunction central nervous system neurological dysfunctions including tremors sleep problems seizures fetus also put great risk low birth weight respiratory cocaine use results smaller brain results learning disabilities fetus cocaine puts fetus higher risk stillborn premature cocaine use also results low birthweight damage central nervous system motor dysfunction vasoconstriction effects cocaine lead decrease placental blood flow fetus results fetal hypoxia oxygen deficiency decreased fetal nutrition vasoconstrictive effects placenta linked number complications malformations evident newborn prenatal methamphetamine exposure shown negatively impact brain development behavioral functioning study investigated neurocognitive neurodevelopmental effects prenatal methamphetamine exposure study two groups one containing children prenatally exposed methamphetamine illicit drugs one containing children met diagnosis criteria adhd prenatally exposed illicit substance groups children completed intelligence measures compute iq study results showed prenatally exposed children performed lower intelligence measures nonexposed peers adhd study results also suggest prenatal exposure methamphetamine may negatively impact processing speed children maternal alcohol use leads disruptions fetus brain development interferes fetus cell development organization affects maturation central nervous system even small amounts alcohol use cause lower height weight head size birth higher aggressiveness lower intelligence fetal alcohol spectrum disorder developmental disorder consequence heavy alcohol intake mother pregnancy children fasd variety distinctive facial features heart problems cognitive problems developmental disabilities attention difficulties memory tobacco smoking pregnancy exposes fetus nicotine tar carbon monoxide nicotine results less blood flow fetus constricts blood vessels carbon monoxide reduces oxygen flow fetus reduction blood oxygen flow may result miscarriage stillbirth low birth weight premature exposure secondhand smoke leads higher risks low birth weight childhood mother infected disease placenta always filter pathogens viruses rubella chicken pox mumps herpes human immunodeficiency virus hiv associated increased risk miscarriage low birth weight prematurity physical malformations intellectual hiv lead acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids untreated hiv carries risk per cent passed bacterial parasitic diseases may also passed fetus include chlamydia syphilis tuberculosis malaria commonly toxoplasmosis acquired eating infected undercooked meat contaminated food drinking contaminated risk fetal infection lowest early pregnancy highest third trimester however early pregnancy outcome worse adequate nutrition needed healthy fetus mothers gain less pounds pregnancy increased risk preterm low birth weight iron iodine especially important prenatal development mothers deficient iron risk preterm low birth weight iodine deficiencies increase risk miscarriage stillbirth fetal brain abnormalities adequate prenatal care gives improved result low birth weight increases infants risk longterm growth cognitive language deficits also results shortened gestational period lead prenatal complications stress pregnancy impact development embryo reilly states stress come many forms life events community family financial issues natural causes woman pregnant stress outside sources take toll growth womb may affect childs learning relationships born instance may behavioral problems might antisocial stress mother experiences affects fetus fetus growth include fetus nervous system reilly stress also lead low birth weight even avoiding factors like alcohol drugs healthy stress impacts whether families know many women deal maternal stress seek treatment similar stress reilly stated recent studies researchers found pregnant women show depressive symptoms attached bonded child womb exposure environmental toxins pregnancy lead higher rates miscarriage sterility birth defects toxins include fetal exposure lead mercury ethanol hazardous environments prenatal exposure mercury may lead physical deformation difficulty chewing swallowing poor motoric exposure high levels lead prenatally related prematurity low birth weight brain damage
