petrifilm plate allinone plating system made food safety division company heavily used many microbiologyrelated industries fields culture various microorganisms meant efficient method detection enumeration compared conventional plating techniques majority use testing foodstuffs petrifilm plates designed accurate conventional plating methods ingredients usually vary plate plate depending microorganism cultured generally petrifilm comprises coldwatersoluble gelling agent nutrients indicators activity enumeration typical petrifilm plate cmh cmw bottom film contains foam barrier accommodating plating surface plating surface circular area top film encloses sample within petrifilm cm cm yellow grid printed back plate assist enumeration plastic spreader also used spread inoculum evenly petrifilm plates become widely used costeffectiveness simplicity convenience ease use example conventional plating would require preparing agar pour plating using agar plates vial inoculum loops streak plating petrifilm plates agar completely housed single unit sample added saves time incubation petrifilm plates safely stacked incubated like petri dishes since paper thin plates stacked together petri dishes although recommends petrifilms stacked higher enumeration petrifilm plates used colony counter enumeration like petri dish various enumeration experiments shown little variance counts obtained petrifilm standard agar cases petrifilms sensitive detection standard microbiology methods case higher sensitivity could possibly lead increased risk false positive first sample must prepared standard weighing serial dilution stomaching ph adjustment necessary next inoculate top layer lifted expose plating surface pipette diluted sample added top film slowly rolled spreader used even distribution takes minute gelling occur required incubation period colonies appear either splotches spots surrounded bubbles combination differ microorganism microorganism enumeration done standard colony counter picking individual colonies interpretation also done top film lifted quite effortlessly expose gel unfortunately sample dark colour eg chocolate hot chocolate enumeration becomes difficult impossible since stained colonies less visible httpsenwikipediaorgwikipetrifilm
