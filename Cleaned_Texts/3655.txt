neuronal tiling phenomenon multiple arbors neurons innervate surface tissue nonredundant tiled pattern maximizes coverage surface minimizing overlap neighboring hence dendrites neuron spread avoiding one another selfavoidance moreover dendrites certain types neurons class iii class iv dendritic arborization neurons avoid dendrites neighboring neurons type tiling whereas dendrites different neuronal types cover territory one good example organization cell bodies virtually retinal cell types arranged independent nonrandom mosaics maximize distance neighbouring elucidating mechanisms process spacing development therefore relevant understanding principles tissue organization inside outside nervous neuroscience article stub help wikipedia expanding httpsenwikipediaorgwikineuronaltiling
