terminal investment hypothesis idea life history theory organisms residual reproductive value total reproductive value minus reproductive value current breeding attempt decreases reproductive effort increase thus organisms prospects survival decreases age immune challenge example invest reproduction hypothesis generally supported animals although results contrary exist terminal investment hypothesis posits residual reproductive value measured total reproductive value minus reproductive value current breeding decreases reproductive effort based cost reproduction hypothesis says increase resources dedicated current reproduction decreases potential future reproduction residual reproductive value decreases importance tradeoff decreases leading increased investment current reproductive

older ages versus younger ages last type test considered reliable measure senescences effect reproductive effort younger individuals reduce reproductive effort reduce chance death high future reproductive prospects older animals increase effort low future overall terminal investment hypothesis generally supported variety study blue tits published found individuals injected human vaccine fed nestlings less injected control study published house sparrows injected newcastle disease vaccine likely lay replacement clutch first clutch artificially removed injected control study published old bluefooted boobies injected lipopolysaccharides challenge immune system laying fledged young normal whereas young individuals fledged less increase maternal effort immune challenged birds may mediated hormone corticosterone study published found house wrens injected lipopolysaccharides increased foraging measurements corticosterone eggs laid injection found positive correlation hormone maternal foraging study published supported cost reproduction terminal investment hypotheses burying beetle found beetles manipulated overproduce young replacing grams oz mouse carcass grams oz carcass shorter lifespans bred grams oz carcasses followed grams oz carcass turn nonbreeding beetles significantly longer lifespan bred supports cost reproduction hypothesis another experiment study found beetles first bred days larger brood size dispersal larvae start pupate soil initially bred days supports terminal investment hypothesis prevents effect increased average brood size older animals due differential survival quality study published flatworm diplostomum spathaceum found intermediate host snail aged production cercariae passed final host fish decreased line bet hedging hypothesis case says flatworm attempt keep host alive longer young produced support terminal investment study published found results contrary terminal investment hypothesis reindeer calf weight peaked mothers seventh year age declined thereafter however would opposed hypothesis reproductive costs increase age alternative hypothesis senescence hypothesis positing reproductive output declines agerelated loss function supported two hypotheses necessarily mutually exclusive study rhesus macaques published strongly supported senescence hypothesis weakly supported terminal investment hypothesis found older mothers lighter less active lighter infants reduced survival rates compared younger mothers supporting senescence hypothesis older individuals spent time contact young supporting terminal investment additionally study published red deer island rhum found older mothers produced less offspring lighter offspring expected given body weight longer suckling bouts previously correlated milk yield calf body condition early winter calf survival spring compared younger study spotted turtles published found individuals poor condition sometimes breed consistent bet hedging hypothesis indicates decision making large temporal scale spotted turtles may live years however individuals poor condition generally produced relatively large amount small eggs consistent
