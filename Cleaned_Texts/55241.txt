metaphorically pedagogically described contention genes passed ones whose evolutionary consequences serve implicit interest continue anthropomorphism replicated necessarily organism later work dawkins brings evolutionary selfishness creation widely proliferated extended metaphor selfishness entirely clear others confusing misleading simply silly ascribe mental attributes something mindless example andrew brown donald symons also finds inappropriate use anthropomorphism conveying scientific meaning general particularly instance writes evolution human sexuality dawkins proposes idea original replicator dawkins replicator initial molecule first managed reproduce thus gained advantage molecules within primordial replicating molecules became complex dawkins postulates replicators became genes within organisms organisms body serving purpose survival machine genes dawkins writes gene combinations help organism survive reproduce tend also improve genes chances replicated result successful genes frequently provide benefit organism example might gene protects organism disease helps gene spread also helps organism times implicit interests vehicle replicator conflict genes behind certain male spiders instinctive mating behaviour increase organisms inclusive fitness allowing reproduce shorten life exposing risk eaten cannibalistic female another example existence

dna variations connect individual genetically parents confer survival examples might suggest power struggle genes interactor fact claim isnt much struggle genes usually win without fight however claim
