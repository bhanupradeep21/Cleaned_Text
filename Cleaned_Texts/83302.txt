individuals specified genotype phenotype fitness defined either respect genotype phenotype given environment time fitness genotype manifested phenotype also affected developmental environment fitness given phenotype also different different selective environments asexual reproduction sufficient assign fitnesses genotypes sexual reproduction recombination scrambles alleles different genotypes every generation case fitness values assigned alleles averaging possible genetic backgrounds natural selection tends make alleles higher fitness common time resulting darwinian evolution term darwinian fitness used make clear distinction physical fitness include measure survival lifespan herbert spencers wellknown phrase survival fittest interpreted survival form phenotypic genotypic leave copies successive generations inclusive fitness differs individual fitness including ability allele one individual promote survival andor reproduction individuals share allele preference individuals different allele one mechanism inclusive fitness kin selection fitness often defined propensity probability rather actual number offspring example according maynard smith fitness property individual class example homozygous allele particular locus thus phrase expected number offspring means average number number produced one individual first human infant gene levitation struck lightning pram would prove new genotype low fitness particular child alternatively fitness array x probability sx individual included among group selected parents next order avoid complications sex recombination concept fitness restricted asexual population without genetic recombination thus fitnesses assigned directly genotypes measured two commonly used measures fitness absolute fitness relative fitness absolute fitness w displaystyle w genotype defined proportional change abundance genotype one generation attributable selection example n displaystyle nt abundance genotype generation displaystyle
