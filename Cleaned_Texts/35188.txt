angiofibroma agf descriptive term wide range benign skin mucous membrane ie outer membrane lining body cavities mouth nose lesions individuals agf lesions share common macroscopic ie gross microscopic appearances grossly agf lesions consist multiple papules one skincolored erythematous domeshaped nodules usually single tumor microscopically consist spindleshaped stellateshaped cells centered around dilated thinwalled blood vessels background coarse bundles collagen ie main fibrous component connective angiofibromas divided different types commonly specific type given multiple different names different papule nodule andor tumor lesions occur face typically termed fibrous papules penis typically termed pearly penile papules underneath fingernail toenail typically termed periungual angiofibromas cutaneous agf lesions occur individuals one different genetic diseases tuberous sclerosis multiple endocrine neoplasia type birthoggdube following examples cutaneous angiofibromas
