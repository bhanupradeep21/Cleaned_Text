saquinavirno experimental drug developed onconox currently undergoing clinical studies investigations treatment cancer nitrate ester analog approved hiv protease inhibitor saquinavir modification increases anticancer property decreasing toxicity drug shows broad activity cancer cells particularly effective hematological prostate melanoma cancers seen vitro vivo analog already approved hiv protease inhibitor saquinavir hiv protease inhibitor drugs work hiv also proved function anticancer however drugs tend many toxic effects adding nitrate ester functional group hiv protease inhibitors found curb negative effects well increase antitumor properties still preclinical testing mechanism action unclear however said opposed saquinavir likely works slowing growth rate tumor cells rather causing apoptosis cell studies suggest stoppage cell proliferation though difference saquinavir lies presence nitrate ester clear exactly modification directly affects function hypothesized presence nitrate ester plays role inhibiting activity cytochrome enzyme normally deactivates aside superior antitumor properties also much lower toxicity profile saquinavir one experiment determined dose saquinavir produced toxicity showed signs inducing might due drug ability produce powerful yet shortlived stimulus normal cells akt signaling pathways protects
