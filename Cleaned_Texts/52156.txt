ventricular tachycardia exhibits distinct characteristics electrocardiogram ecg described french physician françois dessertenne prolongation qt interval increase persons risk developing abnormal heart rhythm occurring patients receive qtprolonging antiarrhythmic episodes revert spontaneously normal sinus symptoms consequences include palpitations dizziness lightheadedness shorter episodes fainting longer episodes sudden cardiac deathcitation needed torsades occurs inherited linked least acquired form caused often drugs andor electrolyte disorders cause excessive lengthening qt common causes torsades de pointes include druginduced qt prolongation less often diarrhea low serum magnesium low serum potassium congenital long qt syndrome seen malnourished individuals chronic alcoholics due deficiency potassium andor magnesium certain drugs combinations drugs resulting drug interactions common contributors torsades de pointes risk qtprolonging medications clarithromycin levofloxacin haloperidol taken concurrently cytochrome inhibitors fluoxetine cimetidine particular foods including grapefruit result higherthannormal levels medications prolong qt interval bloodstream therefore

market linked deaths caused long qt syndromeinduced torsades de pointes effect directly linked qt prolongation mediated predominantly inhibition herg channel cases augmentation late sodium following partial list factors associated increased tendency towards developing torsades de action potential cardiac muscles broken five phasescitation needed repolarization cardiomyocytes occurs phases caused predominantly outward movement potassium ions torsades de pointes however repolarization prolonged due electrolyte disturbances hypokalemia hypomagnesemia hypocalcemia bradycardia certain drugs disopyramide sotalol amiodarone amitriptyline chlorpromazine erythromycin andor congenital prolongation repolarisation may result subsequent activation inward depolarisation current known early afterdepolarisation may promote triggered reentry due dispersion refractory periods also cells found mid myocardial layer show prolonged repolarization phase response potassium blockage cells turn produces zone functional refractoriness inability depolarize mid myocardial new action potential generated mid myocardial layer remain refractory period surrounding tissue depolarize soon mid myocardial layer longer refractory period excitation nearby tissue cause retrograde current reentry circuit result positive chronotropic cycle leading tachycardiacitation needed ecg tracing torsades demonstrates polymorphic ventricular tachycardia characteristic illusion twisting qrs complex around isoelectric baseline peaks first pointing appear pointing subsequent beats looking ecg traces heartbeat hemodynamically unstable causes sudden drop arterial blood pressure leading dizziness fainting depending cause individual episodes torsades de pointes revert normal sinus rhythm within seconds however episodes may also persist possibly degenerate ventricular fibrillation leading sudden death absence prompt medical intervention torsades de pointes associated long qt syndrome condition whereby prolonged qt intervals visible ecg long qt intervals predispose patient ront phenomenon wherein rwave representing ventricular depolarization occurs relative refractory period end repolarization represented latter half twave ront initiate torsades sometimes pathologic tu waves may seen ecg initiation shortcoupled variant torsade de pointes presents without long qt syndrome also described following ront phenomenon superimposition premature ventricular contraction wave preceding heart beat studies suggest ront phenomenon likely start sustained ventricular tachycardia ventricular considered cardiac arrhythmia ventricles heart become excited repolarization previous heart action part heart muscle excited early point time premature chamber action trigger

may spontaneously revert normal sinus rhythm sustained torsades requires emergency treatment prevent cardiac effective treatment terminate torsades electrical cardioversion procedure electrical

hypokalaemia withdrawal medications prolong qt interval treatments used prevent torsades specific circumstances include beta blockers mexiletine long qt occasionally pacemaker may used accelerate
