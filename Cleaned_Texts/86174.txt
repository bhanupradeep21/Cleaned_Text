employees work overtime hours experience numerous mental physical social effects landmark study world health organization international labour organization estimated people died ischemic heart disease stroke result worked hours per significant effects include stress lack free time poor worklife balance health employee performance levels could also lowered long work hours could lead tiredness fatigue lack result suggestions proposed risk mitigation health safety effects overtime work vary widely much remains studies reported numerous adverse health effects including increased alcohol tobacco usage decreased birthweight offspring decreased cognitive functioning found subjectively objectively using specialized testing however studies established relationships overtime work decreased health work shifts lasting hours work shifts exceeding hours work weeks exceeding hours levels decreased cognitive testing performance increased workplace injury inconsistencies studies may secondary numerous workplace employee factors make difficult researchers establish specific causal relationships larger amount data exist regarding male workforce whereas additional studies needed better assess impacts overtime work extended shifts survey events found cohort men women overtime work associated excess rate injury compared jobs without overtime injury rate directly proportional length work shift number hours work week study authors found excess injury risk associated jobs hazardous also overall fatigue working overtime extended work mental effects workers vary based upon work number hours work individual working groupon performed study july effects work results found work much never time relax pollers unhealthy worklife research showed trends concerning effects research performed test satisfaction levels employees study workers australia showed trend satisfaction levels decreased number hours worked increased also stated effects could lessened enjoyed working extensive types workers satisfied worklife balance addition working satisfaction another australian longitudinal cohort study revealed poorer mental health workers long working hours authors conducted longitudinal followup cohort consisting people observations mental component summary mcs short form measure noted increased probability regarding mental health decline workers working hours per week compared standard working hours hours per week probability increased working hours week also found difference gender among working hours per week scores lower among female male indicating worse mental health among female impacts also seen working longer daily hours even case work week hours spread days longer days shown higher fatigue government employees similar gender differences noted studies followup whitehall study research team conducted prospective cohort study following middleage fulltime workers consisting men women results revealed increase depression symptoms increase anxiety symptoms among female workers working hours per week compared standard working hours hours per week also indicated trend every increase weekly working hours associated increase depression symptoms increase anxiety symptoms noted similar trends noted among male similarly margot shields surveyed men women ages worked hours per week analyzed relationship working hours depression results found women increased likelihood experiencing depression hours suicidal ideation another concern overtime work research conducted south korea recruited samples results revealed higher suicidal ideation among workers working hours hours increase male workers increase female workers also increased suicidal ideation noted among workers working hours per week males summary mental effects related overtime work include lower working satisfaction depression anxiety suicidal ideation among depression anxiety predominant among female workers research proposed probable reasons gender difference female workers tend take household responsibilities work contributes mental stress also female workers reported relative minorities within working place times experiencing lower job control bullying discrimination consecutive periods working straight shifts lack breaks day consecutive days working without day lead decreased efficiency productivity workers synopsis book tired cops importance managing police fatigue bryan

concluded long work hours negativelyassociated risk authors one paper performed mental analysis four published cohort studies nineteen unpublished studies looking effect long working hours defined authors hours per week look association developing type ii diabetes compared referent group workers working hours per week found statistically significant evidence association longer working hours development type ii diabetes individuals low socioeconomic status manual laborers compared ses groups lower ses group working longer hours increased risk developing type ii diabetes even adjusting physical activity smoking alcohol use however another author commented residual confounding might account higher risk lower ses group compared higher ses group also postulated sleep may mediator association since inadequate sleep sleep poor quality quantity predictor type ii diabetes workers lower ses group may less control schedule may include disruptive schedules interfering circadian one largescale study using data individualparticipantdata metaanalysis working population consortium involving workers several european countries also looked effects long work hours association developing atrial fibrillation participants free atrial fibrillation baseline mean age years follow years working long hours hours per week higher risk developing atrial fibrillation compared working standard hourweek study investigators controlled age sex ses smoking bmi physical activity alcohol consumption investigators also commented association long working hours atrial fibrillation appeared independent classic risk factors atrial fibrillation due similarities exposed group long work hours referent coronary heart disease chd metaanalysis four prospective studies published found increased risk chd associated long working hours investigators also noted association higher men women hypothesized underlying mechanisms association may include longer exposure stress sleep deprivation dysregulation hpa axis causing increase cortisol production also noted estimate might biased several reasons one reason could workers underlying chd reduced working hours years chd event second reason could due confounding ses metaanalysis adjusting factors found risk chd event instead furthermore study authors also found higher risk working long worklife balance major aspect employees lives naturally hours someone works less time spend family leisure activities professors penn state abington analyzed tradeoff working overtime home family life activities major finding workers struggled take time personal family needs however additional income working long hours could limit actual impact loss specifically impact child exponentially increased impact working overtime especially young age important child development parents involved provide care positive due reason worklife conflicts arise much frequently parents stress levels heightened effects even worse single parents karoshi translated worked death concern japan paper published showed quarter japans workforce working hours per week half working hours per week ministry health labor welfare launched investigation examine cases possible karoshi death overworked time frame study recommended employers offer physician interview guidance employee working hours overtime month employee requested doctors overall research evidence shown long working hours increases mortality risk uk censusbased longitudinal study people aged years showed overtime work increases mortality risk men working hours per authors showed mortality higher technical semiroutine routine occupations positions high demand low levels control perceived imbalance effort reward authors also demonstrated increased mortality risk mainly attributed cardiovascular disease similar results found studies longitudinal study denmark employed caucasian men aged years showed men working hours per week increased risk mortality due ischemic heart disease compared men working less hours per authors also found physical fitness played significant role among men low physical fitness working hours per week twice risk death ischemic heart disease compared men working less hours per week increased risk seen among fittest men furthermore study based data swedish twin registry showed association overtime work hours week increased mortality association also seen men first five years followup contrast authors showed working less five hours week overtime decreases risk mortality men studies argue direct causeandeffect relationship hours worked short longterm risks claims include comments factors alter outcome effects include individuals personality occupation income research done hilda household income labour dynamics australia survey completed prior research counterarguments completed group researchers found links increased cvd events mental health disorders along decreases production number hours worked increased however state research necessary definitive conclusions made factors individual vast consequences effect working addition workers work overtime mandatory find minimal effects fatigue contrast japanese study employees demonstrated longer working hours associated better health status older authors study showed overall health differed age group reflects generational difference respect attitudes toward work among older workers longer work hours might beneficial workbased social networks offer structured environment social support companionship definitive conclusion could made suggestions exist minimize potential risks long working hours creation work schedule managed properly avoid multiple consecutive shifts long periods working without rest balanced breaks families children important employees manage schedule family personal needs help alleviate stress provide flexible work hours throughout year avoid many worklife conflicts jay kim anthony campagna researchers
