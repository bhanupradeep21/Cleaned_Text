diamond coal mine linton ohio fossiliferous coal deposit dated late moscovian stage westphalian million years odonterpeton one smallest known microsaurs skull length millimeters skull rounded

odonterpeton initially considered small reptile though modern sources consider microsaurs grade clade small reptiliomorph amphibians branched tetrapod family tree prior microsaur taxonomy summarized order microsauria book robert carroll pamela gaskill overview proposed twofold division microsaur taxonomy tuditanomorpha microbrachomorpha odonterpeton assigned microbrachomorph based simple teeth threefingered hands skull roof bones strongly unequal size microbrachomorphs included aquatic forms like microbrachis hyloplesion possibly brachystelechus within microbrachomorpha odonterpeton given family fundamental division proposed carroll gaskill long superseded results phylogenetic analyses though microsaur systematics still unstable little consensus exists many studies continued support close affinities odonterpeton microbrachis hyloplesion either one analysis modified previous studies expanded set taxa suggested odonterpeton completely unrelated microbrachomorphs instead related
