alternatively may acted direct competitor although large dicynodont lisowicia still closely resembles triassic stahleckeriids close relative placerias north america heavily built quadruped rotund barrelshaped body large head beaked jaws short neck stocky limbs short skull incomplete known various isolated individual pieces enough determine similar skull stahleckeriids temporal fenestra large back skull drawn high crest providing extensive jaw muscle attachment back skull snout relatively elongate like stahleckeriids toothless tortoiselike beak front like triassic dicynodonts lisowicia completely toothless lacked even tusks typical dicynodonts instead pair short thick triangular projections maxillary jaw bone behind beak called caniniform processes similar related ischigualastia stahleckeriids likewise comparing proportions quadrate bone back skull ischigualastia suggests lisowicia broad skull roughly centimetres wide quadrate jaw backbone ribs typical dicynodonts however cervical vertebrae neck notable unusual hollows excavated sides similar holes dinosaur vertebrae associated system air sacs birdlike respiratory system however unlike dinosaurs lisowicia lacks openings vertebrae pleurocoels air sacs interior vertebra solid trait unique lisowicia amongst dicynodonts function unclear bones pelvis hind limb robust compared dicynodonts due massive size animal

parasagittal gait arrangement found hindlimbs various large triassic kannemeyeriiforms retain sprawling forelimbs elbows bowed outwards joints allow radius ulna rotate step sprawled posture achieve posture forelimbs lisowicia undergo several prominent anatomical changes compared normal condition dicynodonts humerus shoulder joint elbow parallel unlike rotated humerus sprawling dicynodonts humerus held upright beneath shoulder directly radius ulna forearm also unusually short compared dicynodonts since elbow positioned directly body closer ground musculature forelimb also rearranged facilitate upright posture gait functioning draw limb forwards backwards losing ability rotate upper arm would sprawling although skeleton incomplete massive size various elements skeleton indicates

biostratigraphic methods dating providing varying results site typically dated rhaetian would make lisowicia one youngest dicynodonts world however palaeontologists grzegorz racki spencer lucas

evolution gigantism dicynodonts gradual process occurring approximately million years acquired major restructuring musculoskeletal system achieve size posture lisowicia possible gigantism lisowicia driven increasing body size predators metabolic adaptation getting nutrition food increasing size also highlights dicynodont evolution late triassic still poorly understood previously considered geographically restricted decline lisowicia demonstrates dicynodonts still geographically widespread continuing diversify late triassic particularly evolving traits support massive body lisowicia herbivore like dicynodonts using relatively long beak crop chew although large size implies feeding higher levels vegetation typical group coprolites attributed lisowicia indicate mostly ate soft vegetation conifers however coprolites contain large portions woody material trait observed dicynodont coprolites suggested represent seasonal variation diet possibly preferred diet soft vegetation bite marks found bones lisowicia match teeth contemporary predatory archosaur smok dicynodont bone fragments also identified proposed coprolites implying lisowicia major component predators diet majority bite marks found juvenile specimens lisowicia preponderance suggested indicate juvenile lisowicia preferentially hunted smok represent active predation scavenged histological studies limb bones lisowicia showed features characteristic rapid growth rate juveniles similar large dicynodonts however growth rate dicynodonts slowed grew studied bones lisowicia showed signs slowing growth possibility bones belonged juveniles even larger adult body size estimated ruled partly basis already massive size also bones well ossified developmentally mature instead likely lisowicia grew rapidly without interruptions reaching adult body size clear lines arrested growth lags otherwise indicate periods slower reduced growth lags may truly absent possibly erased extensive remodelling bone adulthood would support permanently rapid growth lisowicia similar mammals coprolites attributed lisowicia discovered abundant accumulations areas believed around standing water assemblages similar discoveries brazil believed represent communal latrines made dicynodont dinodontosaurus possible lisowicia may performed similar behaviour communal latrines documented modern gregarious mammals
