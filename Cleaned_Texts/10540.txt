prenatal memory also called fetal memory important development memory humans many factors impair fetal memory functions primarily maternal actions multiple techniques available demonstrate existence fetal memory measure fetal memory vulnerable certain diseases much exposure permanently damage development fetus even terminate pregnancy aborting fetus maternal nutrition avoidance drugs alcohol substances nine months pregnancy especially critical period nervous system developing important development fetus memory systems use certain substances entail longterm permanent effects fetus carry throughout lifespan evidence fetal memory may begin within second trimester conception substantial evidence fetal memories found around weeks fetal memory important parental recognition facilitates bond child parents one important types memory stores information contributing maternal bond infant mother form memory important type development known fetal memory thus critical survival fetus prenatally womb birth infant central nervous system cns memory fetus develop ectoderm following fertilization via process called neurulation ectoderm outermost layer embryo happens towards end third week gestation time period embryo carried womens uterus ends start development neural tube important structure crucial development central nervous system evidence suggests memory actually responsible carrying development cns neurulation however much research needs done fetal memory brain development impaired number maternal implications rubella intrauterine hypoxia hypothyroidism researched examples alcohol substances hard drugs affect process wellcitation needed neurulation complete given rise nervous system fetal memory becomes responsible variety tasks one main functions point control breathing fetus also noted ability control eye movement coordination nine months development evidence practiced womb carried similarly birth learning language infant also requires fetal memory known mothers voice clearly heard inside womb fetus differentiate speech sounds particularly phonemes single segment sound speech evident baby born showing many signs early language comprehension also shown infants prefer mothers native language exposed womb evidence also exists infant born prefers mothers smell memorized scent fetus memory critical recognition process takes place mother infant breastfeeding breast milk contains contents recognizable infant exposed amniotic fluid fluid encompasses fetus responsible nutrition womb fetal stage since baby dependent upon mother maternal nutrition also plays large role infant developing healthy brain functioning including memory function infant live without thus fetal memory critical survival healthy development infant birth many functions measured methods classical conditioning habituation exposure learning considered three paradigms used investigate fetal learning memory classical conditioning habituation exposure classical conditioning described pairing conditioned stimulus cs vibration unconditioned stimulus us loud noise evoke conditioned response cr agitation pairing vibration presented immediately followed loud noise initially presentation loud noise us would cause unconditioned response ur natural agitation without prior classical conditioning however continuous pairing loud noise us vibration cs converts unconditioned response ur cr fetus learns presentation vibration followed loud noise eventually fetus respond vibration cs without exposed loud noise us conditioning occurred conditioning demonstrated pairings vibration cs loud noise us fetuses early weeks another study replicated fetuses weeks gestation presented pure tone cs paired vibroacoustic stimulus us vibroacoustic stimulus low bass sound frequency felt fetus mechanical pairings approximately fetuses showed successful conditioning unrelated age sex fetus suggested poorly prepared experimental set inaccurate inappropriate response measures unsuitable stimuli could contribute failed conditioning opposed lack fetal reasons fetuses demonstrating conditioning others remains undetermined second paradigm habituation one successful ways investigating fetal memory habituation demonstrated fetuses early weeks corresponds onset fetal auditory auditory vibroacoustic stimulation used habituation vibroacoustic stimulation technique involving repetitive stimulation fetus applying vibroacoustic stimulus predetermined intervals abdomen mother movement reaction fetus response stimulus recorded using ultrasound technology process repeated habituation defined lack response stimulus fetus reached stimulation trials continue neonatal period first days birth presenting auditory stimulus test whether fetus memory stimulation events scientific control group babies neonatal period exposed stimulus fetus used neonatal trials serve comparison results another recent study suggest fetuses able form short longterm conclusion drawn fact habituation rates number stimuli needed habituate higher babies neonatal stage previously undergone fetal stimulations compared therefore demonstrating memory stimulus fetal stage carried neonatal stage final experimental technique used investigate fetal learning memory exposure learning technique allows experimenter lot control presentation stimulus following exposure learning act presenting fetus stimulus television theme tune repeatedly womb testing recognition learning tune birth one experiment conducted fetuses exposed television theme tune show neighbours first condition experiment newborns age days exposed tune womb presented tune birth upon hearing tune newborns showed physiological changes decrease heart rate observed change happen unfamiliar tunes newborns exposed tune womb tune learned womb recognition tune strong days birth however diminished age days without repeated second exposure learning experiment using television theme tune conducted determine learning memory could first take place utero determined weeks gestation fetuses previously exposed theme tune active presented tune previous experience tune demonstrates stimulus recognition begins earlier weeks overall studies indicate ability fetal learning memory classical conditioning habituation exposure learning memory measured important note certain periods fetal development allow different learning memory abilities taken consideration determining fetal memory exists auditory stimuli presented womb retained recognized learned days following birth learning specific familiar auditory measuring
