carol gilligan book different voice argued kohlbergs theory excessively kohlbergs theory initially based empirical research using male participants gilligan argued adequately describe concerns kohlberg stated women tend get stuck level primarily concerned details maintain relationships promote welfare family friends men likely move abstract principles thus less concern particulars consistent observation gilligans theory moral development value justice considerations developed alternative theory moral reasoning based ethics critics christina hoff sommers american enterprise

generally considered incompatible inconsistencies moral carpendale argued kohlbergs theory modified focus view process moral reasoning involves integrating varying perspectives moral dilemma rather simply fixating applying view would allow inconsistency moral reasoning since individuals may hampered inability consider different krebs denton also attempted modify kohlbergs theory account conflicting findings eventually concluded theory account individuals make moral decisions everyday immanuel kant predicted rebutted argument considered actions opening exception categorical imperative psychologists questioned assumption moral action primarily result formal reasoning social intuitionists jonathan haidt argue individuals often make moral judgments without weighing concerns fairness
