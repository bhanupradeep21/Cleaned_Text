fatigue describes state tiredness sleepiness general usage fatigue often follows prolonged physical mental activity fatigue occurs independently physical mental exertion resolve rest sleep may causes medical fatigue medical context complex cause often fatigue associated wide variety conditions including autoimmune disease organ failure chronic pain conditions mood disorders heart disease infectious diseases postinfectiousdisease fatigue general usage sense normal tiredness include physical mental fatigue physical fatigue results muscle fatigue brought intense physical mental fatigue results prolonged periods cognitive activity impairs cognitive ability mental fatigue manifest sleepiness lethargy directed attention mental fatigue also impair physical fatigue medical context used cover experiences low energy caused normal fatigue multifaceted broadly defined makes understanding cause manifestations especially difficult conditions diverse pathology including autoimmune use term fatigue medical contexts may carry inaccurate connotations general usage word accurate terminology may also needed cover variants within umbrella term tiredness normal result work mental stress anxiety overstimulation understimulation jet lag active recreation boredom lack sleep considered medical fatiguemedical citation fatigue generally considered longerterm condition sleepiness although sleepiness symptom medical condition usually results lack restful sleep lack fatigue often described uncomfortable tiredness whereas sleepiness comfortable inviting fatigue significant negative impacts quality profound debilitating fatigue common complaint reported among individuals autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus multiple sclerosis type diabetes celiac disease chronic fatigue syndrome rheumatoid disputed whether different dimensions fatigue peripheral muscle central mental fatigue whether fatigue unidimensional phenomenon influences different aspects human physical fatigue muscle fatigue temporary physical inability muscles perform optimally onset muscle fatigue physical activity gradual depends upon individuals level physical fitness factors include sleep deprivation overall physical fatigue caused lack energy muscle decrease efficiency neuromuscular junction reduction drive originating central nervous system reversed central component fatigue triggered increase level serotonin central nervous motor activity serotonin released synapses contact motor neurons promotes muscle high level motor activity amount serotonin released increases spillover occurs serotonin binds extrasynaptic receptors located axonal initial segment motor neurons result nerve impulse initiation thereby muscle contraction muscle strength testing used determine presence neuromuscular disease determine cause additional testing electromyography provide diagnostic information information gained muscle strength testing alone enough diagnose neuromuscular mental fatigue temporary inability maintain optimal cognitive performance onset mental fatigue cognitive activity gradual depends upon individuals cognitive ability also upon factors sleep deprivation overall health mental fatigue also shown decrease physical manifest somnolence lethargy directed attention fatigue disengagement research also suggests mental fatigue closely linked concept ego depletion though validity concept disputed example one preregistered study participants found exerting mental effort people likely disengage become less interested exerting decreased attention also described less decreased level case dangerous performing tasks require constant concentration operating large vehicles instance person sufficiently somnolent may experience microsleep however objective cognitive testing used differentiate neurocognitive deficits brain disease attributable tirednesscitation needed perception mental fatigue believed modulated brains reticular activating system rascitation needed fatigue impacts drivers reaction time awareness hazards around attention drowsy drivers three times likely involved car crash awake hours equivalent driving bloodalcohol concentration level people multiple sclerosis experience form overwhelming tiredness occur time day duration necessarily recur recognizable pattern given patient referred neurological fatigue often multiple sclerosis fatigue people inflammatory rheumatic diseases including rheumatoid arthritis psoriatic arthritis primary sjögrens syndrome experience similar patients often present many types subsets acute fatigue temporary selflimited acute fatigue often caused infection common cold cognized one part sickness behavior response occurring immune system fights common causes acute fatigue include depression chemical causes dehydration poisoning low blood sugar mineral vitamin deficiencies prolonged fatigue selfreported persistent constant fatigue lasting least one monthmedical citation needed chronic fatigue selfreported fatigue lasting least consecutive months chronic fatigue may either persistent chronic fatigue symptom many chronic illnesses idiopathic chronic fatigue mechanisms cause fatigue well inflammation distorts neural chemistry brain function functional connectivity across broad range brain linked many types findings implicate neuroinflammation etiology fatigue autoimmune related lowgrade inflammation may cause imbalance energy availability cytokines small protein molecules modulate immune responses inflammation well functions may causal roles however inflammation model may difficulty explaining unpredictability variability ie appearing intermittently day days fatigue associated inflammatory rheumatic diseases autoimmune diseases multiple small study found primary sjögren syndrome patients high fatigue compared low fatigue significantly higher plasma concentrations tendency higher concentrations cause fatigue often idiopathic chronic fatigue chronic fatigue caused known proximate cause discrete medical condition drug alcohol use fatigue may side effect certain medications eg lithium salts ciprofloxacin beta blockers induce exercise intolerance many cancer treatments particularly chemotherapy radiotherapy caffeine alcohol cause obesity appears correlate greater fatigue depression adverse life events associated fatigue often associated diseases conditions major categories conditions often list fatigue symptom include areas proposed fatigue separated primary fatigue caused directly disease process secondary fatigue caused general impacts person disease disrupted fatigue currently measured many different selfmeasurement consensus best existing surveys capture intermittent nature forms fatigue nintendo announced plans device possibly quantitatively measure fatigue project stopped one study concluded people fatigue receive diagnosis could explain fatigue year condition people possible diagnosis musculoskeletal psychological problems common definitive physical conditions found person fatigue decides seek medical advice overall goal identify rule treatable conditions done considering persons medical history symptoms present evaluating qualities fatigue affected person may able identify patterns fatigue tired certain times day whether fatigue increases throughout day whether fatigue reduced taking nap disrupted sleep significant contributor fatigue diagnostic evaluation considers quality sleep emotional state person sleep pattern stress level amount sleep hours set aside sleep number times person awakens night important sleep study may ordered rule sleep disorder depression psychological conditions produce fatigue people report fatigue routinely screened conditions along substance use disorders poor diet lack physical exercise paradoxically increases fatigue basic medical tests may performed rule common causes fatigue include blood tests check infection anemia urinalysis look signs liver disease diabetes mellitus tests check kidney liver function comprehensive metabolic tests may chosen depending patients social history hiv test pregnancy test management may include following
