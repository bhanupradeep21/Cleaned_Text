three bones meet early forms connection vertebral column complete small pair ribs connecting two structures nonetheless pelvis already forms complete ring found subsequent practice modern amphibians reptiles substantially modified ancestral structure based varied forms lifestyles obturator foramen generally small animals although reptiles possess large gap pubis ischium referred thyroid fenestra presents similar appearance obturator foramen mammals birds pubic symphysis present ostrich two hip bones usually widely separated making easier lay large therapsids hip bone came rotate counterclockwise relative position reptiles ilium moved forward pubis ischium moved rear pattern seen modern mammals thyroid fenestra obturator foramen merged form single space ilium typically narrow triangular mammals much larger ungulates humans anchors powerful gluteal muscles monotremes marsupials also possess fourth pair bones prepubes marsupial bones extend forward pubes help support
