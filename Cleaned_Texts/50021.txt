viral hepatitis liver inflammation due viral may present acute form recent infection relatively rapid onset chronic form typically progressing longlasting asymptomatic condition decompensated hepatic disease hepatocellular carcinoma common causes viral hepatitis five unrelated hepatotropic viruses hepatitis b c e viruses also cause liver inflammation including cytomegalovirus virus yellow fever
