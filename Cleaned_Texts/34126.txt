evolutionary approaches depression attempts evolutionary psychologists use theory evolution shed light problem mood disorders within perspective evolutionary psychiatry depression generally thought dysfunction mental disorder prevalence increase age way dementia organic dysfunction commonly researchers surmised disorder may evolutionary roots way others suggest evolutionary contributions schizophrenia sickle cell anemia psychopathy disorders psychology psychiatry generally embraced evolutionary explanations behaviors proposed explanations evolution depression remain controversial major depression also called major depressive disorder clinical depression often simply depression leading cause disability worldwide fourth leading contributor global burden disease measured dalys also important risk factor understandable clinical depression thought major dysfunction brain cases rates organ dysfunction increase age low rates adolescents young adults highest rates patterns consistent evolutionary theories aging posit selection dysfunctional traits decreases age decreasing probability surviving later ages contrast patterns prevalence clinical depression high age categories including otherwise healthy adolescents young adults one study us population example month prevalence major depression episode highest youngest age category high prevalence unipolar depression excluding depression associated bipolar disorder also outlier compared prevalence mental disorders major intellectual disability autism schizophrenia even aforementioned bipolar disorder prevalence rates one tenth depression mental disorders higher prevalence depression anxiety common occurrence persistence trait like clinical depression negative effects early life difficult explain rates infectious disease high young people course clinical depression thought caused infection evolutionary psychology application evolutionary medicine suggest behaviour mental states including seemingly harmful states depression may beneficial adaptations human ancestors improved fitness individuals argued example abraham lincolns lifelong depression source insight even suggest arent designed happiness natural default state depression evolutionary following hypotheses attempt identify benefit depression outweighs obvious costs hypotheses necessarily incompatible one another may explain different aspects causes symptoms one reason depression thought pathology causes much psychic pain distress however physical pain also distressful yet evolved function inform organism damaged motivate withdraw source damage learn avoid damagecausing circumstances future sadness also distressing yet widely believed evolved adaptation fact perhaps influential evolutionary view cases depression simply particularly intense cases sadness response adversity loss loved according psychic pain hypothesis depression analogous physical pain informs current circumstances loss friend imposing threat biological fitness motivates cease activities led costly situation possible causes learn avoid similar circumstances future proponents view tend focus low mood regard clinical depression dysfunctional extreme low unique set characteristics physiologically distanced regular depressed mood alongside absence pleasure noticeable changes include psychomotor retardation disrupted patterns sleeping feeding loss sex drive also characteristics bodys reaction actual physical pain depressed people increased activity regions cortex involved perception pain anterior cingulate cortex left prefrontal cortex activity allows cortex manifest abstract negative thought true physical stressor rest behavioral shutdown model states organism faces risk expenditure reward activities best evolutionary strategy may withdraw model proposes emotional pain like physical pain serves useful adaptive purpose negative emotions like disappointment sadness grief fear anxiety anger guilt described evolved strategies allow identification avoidance specific problems especially social domain depression characteristically associated anhedonia lack energy experiencing riskaversive perceive negative pessimistic outcomes focused preventing loss although model views depression adaptive response suggest beneficial standards current society suggest many approaches depression treat symptoms rather causes underlying social problems need related phenomenon behavioral shutdown model learned helplessness animal subjects loss control predictability subjects experiences results condition similar clinical depression humans say uncontrollable unstoppable stressors repeated long enough rat subject adopt learned helplessness shares number behavioral psychological features human depression subject attempt cope problems even placed stressorfree novel environment rare attempts coping prove successful new environment long lasting cognitive block prevents perceiving action useful coping strategy last long evolutionary perspective learned helplessness also allows conservation energy extended period time people find predicament outside control illness dry season however todays humans whose depression resembles learned helplessness phenomenon usually manifests loss motivation distortion one uncontrollable aspect persons life viewed representative aspects life suggesting mismatch ultimate cause modern hypothesis suggests depression adaptation causes affected individual concentrate attention focus complex problem order analyze solve one way depression increases individuals focus problem inducing rumination depression activates left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex increases attention control maintains problemrelated information active accessible state referred working memory wm result depressed individuals shown ruminate reflecting reasons current problems feelings regret associated depression also cause individuals reflect analyze past events order determine happened could rumination hypothesis come criticism evolutionary fitness increased ruminating rather bad outcomes situation resulted child danger unharmed lead parent ruminate avoid dangerous situation future waiting child dies ruminating state depression cognitive psychologists argue ruminative tendency increases likelihood onset another way depression increases individuals ability concentrate problem reducing distraction problem example anhedonia often associated depression decreases individuals desire participate activities provide shortterm rewards instead allows individual concentrate longterm goals addition psychomotoric changes solitariness decreased appetite insomnia also reduce distractions instance insomnia enables conscious analysis problem maintained preventing sleep disrupting processes likewise solitariness lack physical activity lack appetite eliminate sources distraction social interactions navigation oral activity disrupt stimuli depression especially modern context may necessarily adaptive ability feel pain experience depression adaptive defense easily triggered intense long lasting become case defense mechanisms become diseases chronic pain dehydration diarrhea depression may similar kind defense mechanism may become dysregulated thus unlike evolutionary theories one sees depression maladaptive extreme something beneficial smaller amounts particular one theory focuses personality trait neuroticism low amounts neuroticism may increase persons fitness various processes much may reduce fitness example recurring depressions thus evolution select optimal amount people neuroticism near amount however genetic variation continually occurs people high neuroticism increases risk rank theory hypothesis individual involved lengthy fight dominance social group clearly losing depression causes individual back accept submissive role individual protected unnecessary harm way depression helps maintain social hierarchy theory special case general theory derived psychic pain hypothesis cognitive response produces modernday depression evolved mechanism allows people assess whether pursuit unreachable goal motivate hypothesis similar social rank hypothesis focuses importance avoiding exclusion social groups rather direct dominance contests fitness benefits forming cooperative bonds others long pleistocene period instance social ties vital food foraging finding protection depression seen represent adaptive riskaverse response threat exclusion social relationships would critical impact survival reproductive success ancestors multiple lines evidence mechanisms phenomenology depression suggest mild moderate normative depressed states preserve individuals inclusion key social contexts via three intersecting features cognitive sensitivity social risks situations eg depressive realism inhibits confident competitive behaviours likely put individual risk conflict exclusion indicated symptoms low selfesteem social withdrawal results signalling behaviours directed toward significant others elicit support eg socalled cry according view severe cases depression captured clinical diagnoses reflect maladaptive dysregulation mechanism may partly due uncertainty competitiveness modern globalised world another reason depression thought pathology key symptoms loss interest virtually activities extremely costly biologists economists proposed however signals inherent costs credibly signal information conflicts interestcitation needed wake serious negative life event implicated depression eg death divorce cheap signals need crying might believed social partners conflicts interest symptoms major depression loss interest virtually activities suicidality inherently costly costly signaling theory requires costs differ individuals different states individuals genuinely need fitness cost major depression high threatens flow fitness benefits individuals genuine need however fitness cost major depression low individual generating many fitness benefits thus individual genuine need afford major depression major depression therefore serves honest credible signal need example individuals suffering severe loss death spouse often need help assistance others individuals conflicts social partners predicted experience means part signal need others individuals many conflicts social partners contrast predicted experience means part credibly signal need others might skeptical need depression costly affected person also imposes significant burden family friends society another reason thought pathological yet people depression real unmet needs might provide incentive others address needscitation needed bargaining theory depression similar honest signaling niche change social navigation theories depression described draws theories labor strikes developed economists basically add one additional element honest signaling theory fitness social partners generally correlated wife depression reduces investment offspring example husbands fitness also put risk thus symptoms major depression serve costly therefore honest signals need also compel reluctant social partners respond need order prevent fitness explanation depression challenged depression decreases joint product family group husband helper partially compensates loss productivity depressed person instead depressed person could break leg gain help social group obviously counterproductive strategy lack sex drive certainly improve marital relations social navigation niche change proposes depression social navigation adaptation last resort designed especially help individuals overcome costly complex contractual constraints social niche hypothesis combines analytical rumination bargaining hypotheses suggests depression operationally defined combination prolonged anhedonia psychomotor retardation agitation provides focused sober perspective socially imposed constraints hindering persons pursuit major fitness enhancing projects simultaneously publicly displayed symptoms reduce depressives ability conduct basic life activities serve social signal need signals costliness depressive certifies honesty finally social partners find uneconomical respond helpfully honest signal need depressive symptoms also potential extort relevant concessions compromises depressions extortionary power comes fact slows flow goods services partners come expect depressive status quo socioeconomic arrangements thus depression may social adaptation especially useful motivating variety social partners help depressive initiate major fitnessenhancing changes socioeconomic life diverse circumstances may become necessary human social life ranging loss rank key social ally makes current social niche uneconomic set creative new ideas make livelihood begs new niche social navigation hypothesis emphasizes individual become tightly ensnared overly restrictive matrix social exchange contracts situation sometimes necessitates radical contractual upheaval beyond conventional methods negotiation regarding treatment depression hypothesis calls question assumptions clinician typical cause depression related maladaptive perverted thinking processes purely endogenous sources social navigation hypothesis calls instead analysis depressives talents dreams identification relevant social constraints especially relatively diffuse nonpoint source within social network depressive practical social problemsolving therapy designed relax constraints enough allow depressive move forward life improved set social theory subject approach argues depressed state adaptive indeed quite opposite threat depression bad outcomes promise pleasure good outcomes adaptive motivate individual toward

physiological manifestation incentives noticeable individual bipolar bouts extreme elation extreme depression anxiety possibly immediate future highly correlated noted earlier bipolar disorder clinical depression opposed event depression viewed dysregulation persistently high low blood pressure viewed dysregulation even though times high low blood pressure fitness enhancing hypothesized depression evolutionary adaptation helps prevent infection affected individual hisher first associated symptoms depression inactivity lethargy encourage affected individual rest energy conserved methods highly crucial immune activation infections relatively costly must instance increase metabolic activity even change body therefore depression allows one conserve allocate energy immune system
