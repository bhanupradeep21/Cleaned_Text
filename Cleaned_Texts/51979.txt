sopite syndrome soʊˈpaɪt latin sopire lay rest put neurological disorder relates symptoms fatigue drowsiness mood changes prolonged periods sopite syndrome attributed motioninduced drowsiness experienced baby researchers ashton graybiel james knepton us naval aerospace medical research laboratory first used term sopite syndrome refer sometimes sole manifestation motion sickness though researchers referred sopite syndrome several symptoms associated sopite typical responses include sopite syndrome distinguished manifestations motion sickness ie nausea dizziness etc may occur symptoms motion sickness absence sopite syndrome may persist even individual adapted symptoms associated motioninduced effects sopite syndrome may range minor physical inconveniences hazardous conditions people operate automobiles airplanes etc may experience impaired motor function due motions vehicle impairments often result decreased attention span consider wellrested may still succumb drowsiness inopportune moments sopite syndrome may therefore contribute motor vehicle accidents automobile operators fall asleep wheel however sopite syndrome directly result subject experiencing sopite syndrome frequent basis may increase number hours spent sleeping fifty percent study motion sickness occurrences workers offshore oil vessel showed large majority participants experienced mild symptoms fatigue many participants also experienced severe sleep disturbances symptoms associated impaired task sopite syndrome associated visuallyinduced vestibular motion sickness factors associated drowsiness darkness physical fatigue may intensify effects motioninduced sleepiness sopite syndrome may occur little motional stimulus though greatest effects tend observed subjects exposed longer periods time often persists time motional stimulus ceased study certain aspects motion sickness among medical transport attendants showed onset sopite syndrome likely occur independently mode transportation little difference observed frequency sopite symptoms ground transport compared air transport also length time exposed vehicular motion appear affect occurrence lack thereof severity sopite syndrome difference observed incidence sopite syndrome men versus sopite syndrome likely cumulative disorder instance subject flu hangover may exacerbate symptoms illness subject normally resistant motion sickness may experience symptoms motion sickness also experiencing flulike hangoverlike exact mechanism induction sopite syndrome still unknown however leading theory asserts sopite syndrome perhaps motion sickness general somehow related reticular formation area brainstem associated arousal study motioninduced effects potential measure arousal showed subjects exposed motion environments experience decreased sensory gating involves filtering information case space motion sickness unweighting otolith organs lead sensory mismatch visual vestibular somatosensory systems motion studies subjects lacked vestibular systems experience symptoms sopite syndrome manifestations motion sickness role vestibular system inducement sopite syndrome related symptoms may difficult ascertain researchers must compare results test subjects experiencing motion environment control environment lacking motion experimental subjects suffered increased fatigue rotating environment apparently recovered side effect environment ceased motion similar studies control subjects lacking vestibular function experience motioninduced drowsiness associated sopite syndrome subjects normalfunctioning vestibular systems experience increased fatigue rotating relation visualvestibular stimulus sopite syndrome may observed comparing airline cockpit crew cabin crew former typically experience confined conditions airline cabin crew tend experience symptoms associated sopite syndrome effect may attributed lack visual validation increased movement cabin certain hormones biochemicals likely affect pathways associated motion sickness general sopite syndrome particular studies reported kennedy drexler kennedy investigated role cortisol melatonin hormone associated maintenance circadian rhythms motioninduced drowsiness subjects exposed vectionproducing environments virtual reality example symptoms evaluated using simulator sickness questionnaire sopite symptoms also measured using developed scale levels endogenous cortisol melatonin compared levels subjects tested vection environments subjects showed increased levels endogenous cortisol melatonin postvection melatonin may therefore involved drowsy state associated sopite inhibition noradrenergic pathways also associated symptoms sopite syndrome studies shown animals exposed motion environments commonly exhibit drowsiness disinclination activity animals show slowed electroencephalography waves involved firing neurons brain locus coeruleuses animals apparently sopite syndrome therefore linked inhibition locus coeruleusnoradrenergic pathways noradrenaline releasers may useful counteracting symptoms sopite syndrome classified symptomcomplex centered drowsiness may distinguished ordinary fatigue researchers previously studied effect use rotating rooms subjects previously shown minimal susceptibility general motion sickness fatigue particular case four military officers recruited live rotating room several days exhibited several signs drowsiness yawning frequent napping despite numerous activities designed promote awareness excitability subjects showed decreased motivation socialize perform physical many symptoms could attributed vestibular stimulation rotating rooms many drugs taken relieve typical symptoms motion sickness including nausea dizziness etc contain compounds may exacerbate drowsiness antihistamines commonly used treat motion sickness however side effects include drowsiness impaired cognitive abilities anticholinergics scopolamine also proved effective motion sickness may induce treatments may combined stimulants counteract typical motioninduced nausea dizziness also preventing sedation however many stimulants possess addictive properties result high potential substance abuse stimulants also tend interfere normal sleep patterns modafinil studied possible treatment sopite syndrome appear side effects normal stimulants modafinil appears effective taken combination anticholinergics scopolamine studies modafinilonly treatments motion sickness remain sopite syndrome may difficult test due nature symptoms indicators drowsiness mood changes apathy must observed graded objectively therefore many results obtained studies sopite syndrome sufficiently repeatable purposes scientific typical method determining effects sopite syndrome use one several questionnaires available questionnaires motion sickness sopite syndrome described two questionnaires widely used evaluate motion sickness pensacola diagnostic index motion sickness questionnaire questionnaires limited however group symptoms drowsiness nonsopite related effects nausea motion sickness measured based cumulative ratings symptoms without distinguishing different levels effect motion sickness assessment questionnaire developed test multiple dimensions motion sickness thoroughly survey defines motion sickness gastrointestinal involving nausea peripheral referring thermoregulatory effects clamminess sweating central involving symptoms dizziness lightheadedness questionnaire may accurately determine subjects experience sopite symptoms relative motion sickness effects another questionnaire designed measure sleepiness epworth sleepiness scale optokinetic drum may used study visually induced sopite effects optokinetic drum rotating instrument test subjects seated facing wall drum interior surface drum normally striped thus drum rotates subjects eyes subject moving visual field subject remains stationary speed drum duration test may varied control groups placed drum without stripes rotation exposure rotating drum subjects surveyed determine susceptibility motion sickness study optokinetic drum used test symptoms sopite syndrome showed increased mood changes response visual cues though effects compounded environmental factors boredom lack httpsenwikipediaorgwikisopitesyndrome
