many conditions associated disorders function parathyroid gland disorders may purely anatomical resulting enlarged gland raise concern benign disorders parathyroid cyst discussed parathyroid diseases divided causing hyperparathyroidism causing single major disease parathyroid glands overactivity one parathyroid lobes make much parathyroid hormone causing potentially serious calcium imbalance called hyperparathyroidism leads hypercalcemia kidney stones osteoporosis various symptoms hyperparathyroidism first described symptoms collectively become known moans groans stones bones far common symptom fatigue depression memory loss bone aches also common primary hyperparathyroidism relatively common postmenopausal women primary treatment disease surgical removal faulty glandcitation needed patient elevated calcium several different types tests used locate abnormal glands common accurate test find parathyroid tumor sestamibi scan sestamibi scan high resolution neck ultrasound higher resolution requires expertise perform ultrasounds shortcomings include determine glandular function normal vs hyperfunctioning visualize unusual locations retropharyngeal mediastinal thin cut computed tomography neck reveal glands locations ultrasound evaluate well eg retropharyngeal mediastinal tests ordered endocrinologist surgeon specializes parathyroid surgery often localizing tests used find bad parathyroid gland successful locating parathyroid gland become tumor often causes confusion patient doctor since tumor located simply means tumor found using tests mean tumor exist use ultrasoundguided fna parathyroid hormone washings confirm abnormal glands decades known best way find parathyroid tumor experienced parathyroid surgeoncitation needed even patient nonlocalizing sestamibi scan negative sestamibi scan heshe almost always neck exploration remove tumor heshe high calcium levels among symptoms minimallyinvasive parathyroid surgery becoming available depending expertise surgeon patient may need positive sestamibi scan minimallyinvasive operation attempted experienced surgeons perform miniparathyroid surgery patients available highly specialized centers patients need sides necks explored find dysfunctional glandscitation needed another related condition called secondary hyperparathyroidism hpt short common patients chronic kidney disease dialysis secondary hpt parathyroid glands make much parathyroid hormone pth kidneys failed calcium phosphorus balance even though one may symptoms treating secondary hpt important cinacalcet sensipar medicine help treat dialysis patients available prescription experts believe sensipar used patients primary hyperparathyroidism patients high calcium kidney dialysiscitation needed parathyroid surgery usually performed hyperparathyroidism condition causes many diseases related calcium reabsorption principal function parathyroid hormone regulate parathyroid surgery could performed two different ways first complete parathyroidectomy second auto transplantation removed parathyroid glands various conditions indicate need removal transplant parathyroid glands hyperparathyroidism condition caused overproduction pth divided three typescitation needed another condition hypercalcemia refers calcium level mgdl consequences heart rhythm diseases extra production gastrin causes peptic parathyroid transplant recommended parathyroid glands removed accidentally thyroidectomy autotransplanted nearby sternocleidomastoid muscle forearm another intervention would less risky biopsy recommended sure transplanted tissue parathyroid lymph node metastatic disease parathyroid surgery adenoma transplantation recommended instead cryopreserved research recurrent surgery indicated patients diagnosed hyperparathyroidism without symptoms especially younger patients cases surgery works therapy nephrolithiasis bone changes neuromuscular parathyroidectomy removal parathyroids requires general anesthesia patient intubated placed supine position chin fifteen degrees elevating shoulders permit extension neck transverse cut made sternal notch transversal thyroid lobe reached rotated discover ligate thyroid vein separate thyroid artery exploration must done meticulously search adenomas adenoma identified exploration must continued common one neoplasia appears procedure glands marked make visible procedure one found procedure remove complete thyroid lobe side gland found avoid intrathyroid parathyroid gland exploration one two even three parathyroid glands affected removed one left situ four glands affected three half removed remaining half marked suture surgeon must sure blood supply compromised total parathyroidectomy auto transplantation forearm remaining half gland may also parathyroid auto transplantation part treatment patient hyperparathyroidism three four parathyroid glands already removed surgery one glands case removal three relocated another part body make procedure less risky another procedure case complete parathyroidectomy half gland cryopreserved case patient suffers hypoparathyroidism happens extracted parathyroid relocated another place body example forearm parathyroid auto transplantation begins parathyroid tissue extraction must preserved cold isotonic solution patient needs research shown parathyroid tissue function subcutaneous level transplantation possible common procedure create small pocket muscle tissue least cm deep separating muscular fibers parathyroid tissue placed closed suturing extraction tissue might processed laboratory soon possible laboratory tissue sample placed frozen petri dish cut small pieces approximately mm small pieces placed test tubes filled solution three parts one autologous serum ml part isotonic solution ml solution ml polypropylene mixed gently placed container night finally container passes phase liquid vapor nitrogen immersion kept needed needed sample taken nitrogen placed bath water ice melted almost completely except samples core ml melted solution removed replaced fresh isotonic httpsenwikipediaorgwikiparathyroiddisease
