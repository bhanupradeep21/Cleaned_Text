cladogenesis evolutionary splitting parent species two distinct species forming event usually occurs organisms end new often distant areas environmental changes cause several extinctions opening ecological niches survivors causing population bottlenecks founder effects changing allele frequencies diverging populations compared ancestral population events cause species originally separate distant areas may still allow species equal chances surviving reproducing even evolving better suit environments still two distinct species due subsequent natural selection mutations genetic cladogenesis contrast anagenesis ancestral species gradually accumulates change eventually enough accumulated species sufficiently distinct different enough original starting form labeled new form new species anagenesis lineage phylogenetic tree split determine whether speciation event cladogenesis anagenesis researchers may use simulation evidence fossils molecular evidence dna different living species modelling however debated whether distinction cladogenesis anagenesis necessary evolutionary httpsenwikipediaorgwikicladogenesis
