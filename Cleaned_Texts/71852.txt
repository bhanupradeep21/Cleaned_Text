eventually sinking bottom possibly storms caused many individuals die together could also result droughts succession layers shows lake likely inhabited pterosaurs great length time although also possible visited lake regular migrations fossil plants tapejarids often assumed herbivores found direct indications food source likewise remains invertebrates large concentrations fossils among pterosaurs rare equaled found argentine form pterodaustro describers seen proof gregarious lifestyle caiuajara living colonies many specimens also allowed determine growth series first ontogenetic

scapulocoracoid showed juvenile individuals smallest specimens wingspan centimeters generally proportions adults especially important humeri proportionally smaller humeral deltopectoral crests attachments main flight muscles less developed attaining size humeral shaft length suggests precocial taking wing almost soon hatched parental care must limited might typical derived pterosaurs snout crest however strongly changed growth became much taller also much steeply inclined although snout whole also became massive snout tip inclination relative jaw edge remained back skull additional
