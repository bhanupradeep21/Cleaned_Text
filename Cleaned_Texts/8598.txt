triple test score diagnostic tool examining potentially cancerous breasts diagnostic accuracy triple test score nearly scoring includes using procedures physical examination mammography needle biopsy results triple test score greater five excisional biopsy term triple test scoring tss first noted means rapidly diagnosing examining breast tss developed useful accurate clinical tool breast masses cheaper cut diagnosis time obtain triple test score number assigned one procedures score assigned benign test result applies suspicious test result applies malignant result sum scores three procedures triple test score total summed score three tests diagnosis likely benign total summed score considered suspicious score greater possibly malignant different inclusions components triple test score past using procedures physical examination mammography cytology versions triple test score included mammography ultrasound magnetic resonance imaging tts first implemented changed create modified tts main difference two diagnostic tools substitution mammogram ultrasound persons age ultrasound found effecting early detection breast cancer masses persons denser breast tissues individuals denser breast tissues also found increased risk developing breast modified tts exams contain combination physical examination ultrasound needle changes scoring system mtss like triple test score birads breast imagingreporting data system uses similar method scoring breast imaging reports help evaluating determining treatment breast like triple test score birads employs numerical scoring system determine whether mass benign malignant triple test score assigns numerical indicator birads assigns numerical indicator birads scoring mammograms comparable triple test scores scoring instance birads equivalent triple test score similar triple test score lower scoring birads ie indicative benign screening high scoring ie indicative unlike triple test score scores three different exams birads focuses evaluating findings one exam mammograms triple test score reduces cost evaluating breast masses compared traditional methods due reducing likelihood people undergoing excisional biopsy still providing effective excisional biopsy performed remove palpable breast mass triple test scores high accuracy used replace excisional biopsy three portions triple test score scored benign indicating mass necessarily need cost differences traditional methods triple test score varied based stages breast mass evaluation traditional methods evaluating breast masses include radiological assessments eg mammography ultrasound mri pathologic analyses eg fineneedle aspiration cytology core early workup stages evaluate suspicion breast mammography imaging due palpable test score found cost traditional methods diagnosis malignancy triple test score found cost less traditional physical exam breast one three tests scored part triple test clinical breast examination cbe different breast selfexam cbe conducted physician appointment whereas selfexam recommend conducted monthly patients home physician ask patient stand various poses cbe allow look abnormalities may present patients overview different systemic reviews summarized effectiveness clinical breast examination sole method screening breast cancer using sensitivity specificity positive predictive value measures accuracy total reviews reported sensitivity range averaged gave result various imaging tests conducted like magnetic resonance imaging mri ultrasound mammogram one three tests scored part triple test review studies using sensitivity specificity measures accuracy fineneedle aspiration biopsy proved accurate yet minimally invasive diagnostic method evaluating breast malignancy exclusion unsatisfactory samples fineneedle aspiration biopsy sensitivity proportion specificity proportion unsatisfactory samples pooled sensitivity proportion pooled specificity proportion one way fineneedle aspiration biopsy cytology reported via iac yokohama system defines five categories reporting breast cytology clear descriptive term category definition risk malignancy rom suggested management suggested management algorithm may particularly useful countries utilizing triple test score provide various management strategies based breast lesions fineneedle aspiration another review studies subjects using iac yokohama reporting system fineneedle aspiration showed strong overall accuracy sensitivity specificity confidence intervals diagnostic cutoff atypical considered positive malignancy cutoff suspicious malignancy considered positive cutoff malignant considered iac yokohama reporting system also evaluated pooled risk malignancy meta analysis different studies total cases found considering suspicious malignant positive results sensitivity false positive rate overall fineneedle aspiration cytopathology greatly benefit low medical infrastructure communities minimally invasive welltolerated patients inexpensive requires minimal laboratory infrastructure proceduralist costs however two major requirements may slow integration fineneedle aspiration cytology actually attaining training pathologists encourage use cytopathology education local studies investigating applicability effectiveness triple test score united states ranged current prevalence usage triple test score united states well understood united kingdom triple test score usually referred triple assessment majority hospitals uk implemented rapid access breast cancer screening clinics use triple test score clinical diagnostic ongoing research efforts essential longterm effectiveness applicability triple test score healthcare settings breast cancer gender specific disease anyone breast tissue risk getting breast cancer gendering guidelines breast cancer excludes individuals identify female potentially lead late detections breast cancer individuals push various healthcare providers make guidelines inclusive comes
