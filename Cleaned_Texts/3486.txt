population time sheltered natural selection normally affect phenotypes hidden diversity could unleashed extreme changes environment molecular switches releasing previously cryptic genetic variation contribute rapid burst phenomenon termed decanalisation cycles canalizationdecanalization could explain alternating periods stasis genotypic diversity accumulates without morphological changes followed rapid morphological changes decanalization releases phenotypic diversity becomes subject natural selection fossil record thus providing potential developmental explanation punctuated susan lindquist discovered drosophila heterozygous mutants exhibit large diversity phenotypes sexual combs head scutoidlike notched wings phenotypes showed phenotypes could passed next generation suggesting genetic basis authors hypothesized gene mutated chaperone protein plays pivotal role folding activation many proteins involved developmental signaling pathways thus buffering genetic variation mutants would therefore release cryptic genetic variation resulting diversity phenotypes lindquist showed pharmacological inhibition arabidopsis thaliana also lead wide range phenotypes could considered adaptive supporting canalising role finally type experiment cavefish astyanax mexicanus yielded similar results species encompasses two populations eyed population living water surface eyeless blind population living caves cave population eyeless also displays largely reduced orbit size inhibition leads increased variation orbit size could explain trait could evolve generations analysis showed low conductivity cave water induces stress response mimicking inhibition providing mechanism worth noting interpretation original drosophila subject controversy molecular analysis mutant showed required pirna biogenesis set small rnas repressing transposons germline causing massive insertional mutagenesis could explain phenotypic understanding variability important aspect comprehending natural selection mutations variability classified two categories modulating phenotypic variation modulating phenotypes presence socalled bias genetic variability allows us gain insights certain phenotypes successful terms actual morphology biochemical makeup scientifically known organisms need develop systematically integrated systems order thrive specific ecosystems extends morphology variations must occur systematic order otherwise phenotypic mutations persist due occurrence natural selection variation affects speed rate evolutionary change selection modulation phenotypic ultimately results lower amount diversity observed throughout evolution majority phenotypes persist beyond generations due inferior morphology biochemical makeup physical movement appearance
