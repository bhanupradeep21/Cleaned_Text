circadian rhythm sleep disorders crsd also known circadian rhythm sleepwake disorders crswd family sleep disorders affect timing sleep crsds arise persistent pattern sleepwake disturbances caused either dysfunction ones biological clock system misalignment ones endogenous oscillator externally imposed cues result mismatch affected circadian rhythm sleep disorders tendency fall asleep unconventional time points day occurrences often lead recurring instances disturbed rest individuals affected disorder unable go sleep awaken normal times work school social obligations delayed sleep phase disorder advanced sleep phase disorder disorder irregular rhythm disorder represents four main types humans like living organisms various biological rhythms biological clocks control processes fluctuate daily eg body temperature alertness hormone secretion generating circadian rhythms among physiological characteristics sleepwake propensity also considered one daily rhythms regulated biological clock system humans sleeping cycles tightly regulated series circadian processes working tandem allowing experience moments consolidated sleep night long wakeful moment day conversely disruptions processes communication pathways lead problems sleeping patterns collectively referred circadian rhythm sleep disorders circadian rhythm entrainable endogenous biological activity period roughly twentyfour hours internal timekeeping mechanism centralized suprachiasmatic nucleus scn humans allows internal physiological mechanisms underlying sleep alertness become synchronized external environmental cues like lightdark scn also sends signals peripheral clocks organs like liver control processes glucose although rhythms persist constant light dark conditions different zeitgebers time givers lightdark cycle give context clock allow entrain regulate expression physiological processes adjust changing environment genes help control lightinduced entrainment include positive regulators clock negative regulators full circadian cycle described twentyfour hour circadian day circadian time zero ct marks beginning subjective day organism ct marks start subjective humans regular circadian function shown maintain regular sleep schedules regulate daily rhythms hormone secretion sustain oscillations core body even absence zeitgebers humans continue maintain roughly rhythm biological activities regarding sleep normal circadian function allows people maintain balance rest wakefulness allows people work maintain alertness days activities rest misconceptions regarding circadian rhythms sleep commonly mislabel irregular sleep circadian rhythm sleep disorder order diagnosed crsd must either misalignment timing circadian oscillator surrounding environment failure clock entrainment among people typical circadian clock function variation chronotypes preferred wake sleep times individuals although chronotype varies individual individual determined rhythmic expression clock genes people typical circadian clock function able entrain environmental cues example person wishes shift onset biological activity like waking time light exposure late subjective night early subjective morning help advance ones circadian cycle earlier day leading earlier wake international classification sleep disorders classifies circadian rhythm sleep disorder type sleep dyssomnia although studies suggest adult population crsd many people often misdiagnosed insomnia instead crsd adults diagnosed sleep disorders estimated crsd adolescents sleep disorders estimated may patients diagnosed circadian rhythm sleep disorders typically express pattern disturbed sleep whether excessive sleep intrudes working schedules daily functions insomnia desired times sleep note preference extreme early late wake times related circadian rhythm sleep disorder diagnosis must distinct impairment biological rhythms affects persons desired work daily behavior crsd diagnosis sleep specialist gathers history patients sleep wake habits body temperature patterns dimlight melatonin onset gathering data gives insight patients current schedule well physiological phase markers patients biological start crsd diagnostic process thorough sleep history assessment standard questionnaire used record sleep habits patient including typical bedtime sleep duration sleep latency instances waking professional inquire external factors may impact sleep prescription drugs treat mood disorders like tricyclic antidepressants selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors antidepressants associated abnormal sleep behaviors daily habits like work schedule timing exercise also may impact individuals sleep wake patterns measure sleep variables candidly patients wear actigraphy watches record sleep onset wake time many physiological variables patients similarly asked selfreport sleep habits weeklong sleep diary document go bed wake etc supplement actigraphy data collecting data allows sleep professionals carefully document measure patients sleep habits confirm patterns described sleep additional ways classify nature patients sleep biological clock morningnesseveningness questionnaire meq munich chronotype questionnaire fairly strong correlations accurately reporting phase advanced delayed questionnaires like pittsburgh sleep quality index psqi insomnia severity index isi help gauge severity sleep disruption specifically questionnaires help professional assess patients problems sleep latency undesired earlymorning wakefulness problems falling staying tayside childrens sleep questionnaire tenitem questionnaire sleep disorders children aged one five years currently international classification sleep disorders lists disorders category circadian rhythm sleep crsds categorized two groups based underlying mechanisms first category composed disorders endogenous oscillator altered known intrinsic type disorders second category consists disorders external environment endogenous circadian clock misaligned called extrinsic type crsd frequently associated excessive daytime sleepiness nighttime insomnia patients diagnosed alzheimers disease ad representing common characteristic among ad patients well risk factor progressive functional one hand stated people ad melatonin alteration high irregularity circadian rhythm lead disrupted sleepwake cycle probably due damage hypothalamic scn regions typically observed hand disturbed sleep wakefulness states related worsening ad patients cognitive abilities emotional state quality moreover abnormal
