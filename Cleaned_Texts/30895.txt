muscular hydrostat biological structure found animals used manipulate items including food move host consists mainly muscles skeletal support performs hydraulic movement without fluid separate compartment hydrostatic skeleton muscular hydrostat like hydrostatic skeleton relies fact water effectively incompressible physiological pressures contrast hydrostatic skeleton muscle surrounds fluidfilled cavity muscular hydrostat composed mainly muscle tissue since muscle tissue mainly made water also effectively incompressible similar principles apply muscles provide force move muscular
