false dilemma also referred false dichotomy false binary informal fallacy based premise erroneously limits options available source fallacy lies invalid form inference false premise premise form disjunctive claim asserts one among number alternatives must true disjunction problematic oversimplifies choice excluding viable alternatives presenting viewer two absolute choices fact could many example false dilemma committed claimed stacey spoke capitalism therefore must communist one options excluded stacey may neither communist capitalist false dilemmas often form treating two contraries may false contradictories one necessarily true various inferential schemes associated false dilemmas example constructive dilemma destructive dilemma disjunctive syllogism false dilemmas usually discussed terms deductive arguments also occur defeasible arguments liability commit false dilemmas may due tendency simplify reality ordering eitherorstatements extent already built language may also connected tendency insist clear distinction denying vagueness many common expressions false dilemma informal fallacy based premise erroneously limits options simple form called fallacy bifurcation two alternatives excluded fallacy argument ie series premises together conclusion unsound ie valid true fallacies usually divided formal informal fallacies formal fallacies unsound structure informal fallacies unsound problematic content case false dilemma form disjunctive claim asserts one among number alternatives must true disjunction problematic oversimplifies choice excluding viable sometimes distinction made false dilemma false dichotomy view term false dichotomy refers false disjunctive claim term false dilemma refers claim argument based common form false dilemma presents alternatives contradictories truth merely two propositions contradictories case one true false two propositions contraries one true leaves open option might false possible case contradictories follow law excluded middle contraries example sentence exact number marbles urn either presents two contradictory alternatives sentence exact number marbles urn either presents two contrary alternatives urn could also contain marbles marbles common form using contraries false dilemmas force choice extremes agent someone either good bad rich poor normal abnormal cases ignore continuous spectrum extremes excluded false dilemmas involving contraries ie exclusive options common form special case also arguments nonexclusive disjunctions false example choice security freedom involve contraries since two terms compatible logic two main types inferences known dilemmas constructive dilemma destructive dilemma simple form expressed following source fallacy found disjunctive claim third premise ie p r displaystyle plor r q r displaystyle lnot qlor lnot r respectively following example false dilemma simple constructive form tell truth force friend social tragedy therefore immoral person lie immoral person since immoral lie either tell truth lie therefore immoral person whatever choice make given example constitutes false dilemma choices besides telling truth lying like keeping silent false dilemma also occur form disjunctive form first premise p q displaystyle plor q responsible fallacious inference lewiss trilemma famous example type argument involving three disjuncts jesus either liar lunatic denying jesus liar lunatic one forced draw conclusion god leaves various alternatives example jesus prophet claimed false dilemmas usually discussed terms deductive arguments also occur defeasible valid argument deductive truth premises ensures truth conclusion valid defeasible argument hand possible premises true conclusion false premises merely offer certain degree support conclusion ensure case defeasible false dilemma support provided conclusion overestimated since various alternatives considered disjunctive part understanding fallacies involves going beyond logic empirical psychology order explain tendency commit fall fallacy case false dilemma tendency simplify reality ordering eitherorstatements may play important role tendency extent built language full pairs type simplification sometimes necessary make decisions enough time get detailed perspective order avoid false dilemmas agent become aware additional options besides prearranged alternatives critical thinking creativity may necessary see false dichotomy discover new philosophers scholars believe unless distinction made rigorous precise isnt really exception analytic philosopher john searle called incorrect assumption produces false dichotomies searle insists condition adequacy precise theory indeterminate phenomenon precisely characterize phenomenon indeterminate distinction less distinction allowing family related marginal diverging similarly two options presented often although always two extreme points spectrum possibilities may lend credence larger argument giving impression options mutually exclusive even though need furthermore options false dichotomies typically presented collectively exhaustive case fallacy may overcome least weakened considering possibilities perhaps considering whole spectrum possibilities fuzzy issue arises real dichotomies nature prevalent example occurrence event either happened happen ontology sets logical construct reasonably applied epistemology presentation false choice often reflects deliberate attempt eliminate several options may occupy middle ground issue common argument noise pollution laws involves false choice might argued new york city noise regulated number businesses would required close argument assumes example bar must shut prevent disturbing levels noise emanating midnight ignores fact law could require bar lower noise levels install soundproofing structural elements keep noise excessively transmitting onto others psychology phenomenon related false dilemma blackandwhite thinking
