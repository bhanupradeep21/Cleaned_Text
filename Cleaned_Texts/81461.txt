also called cortical homunculus four mechanoreceptors skin respond different stimuli short long periods merkel cell nerve endings found basal epidermis hair follicles react low vibrations hz deep static touch shapes edges due small receptive field extremely detailed information used areas like fingertips covered shelled thus respond pressures long periods tactile corpuscles react moderate vibration hz light touch located dermal papillae due reactivity primarily located fingertips lips respond quick action potentials unlike merkel nerve endings responsible ability read braille feel gentle stimuli pacinian corpuscles determine gross touch distinguish rough soft substances react quick action potentials especially vibrations around hz even centimeters away sensitive vibrations
