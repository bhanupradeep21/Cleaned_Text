male reproductive alliances best understood within context traditional competition specific case cooperative competition cooperative behavior however necessarily result equal sharing resources among cooperating cooperation often requires individuals decrease fitness increase fitness behavior becomes even striking occurs within context cooperative reproduction individuals decrease reproductive fitness improve reproductive fitness species males cooperate forming alliances related nonrelated individuals gain access females prevent males alliances often result monopolization mating opportunities one dominant resulting unequal sharing mating opportunities contradicts traditional competition access females natural selection implies making male reproductive alliances ideal case study costs benefits associated subordinate individual cost cooperation decrease fitness makes difficult reconcile principles natural selection cooperation unless specific circumstances make cooperation despite apparent contradictory nature cooperation occur variety species male reproductive alliances documented bottlenose dolphins tursiops sp slender mongooses galerella sanguine lions panthera leo chimpanzees pan troglodytes however behavior may may evolved within context reproduction alliances may improve individuals fitness either improving foraging capabilities lessening cost defending reproductive tradeoffs males participating reproductive alliances depends extent mating shared among alliance members extent alliance membership incurs reproductive fitness advantage competing single three mechanisms hypothesized reconcile principles natural selection cooperation kin selection direct reciprocity mutualism separate cases provided evidence supporting three routes described male alliances hypothesized evolved within context kin selection red howler monkeys within context direct reciprocity savanna baboons within context mutualism determining evolutionary context cooperative behavior two things consider regarding male alliances whether coalition comprises related unrelated individuals stable coalitions male alliances involve complex interactions many costs benefits making study cooperative behavior difficult coalitions composed relatives contradictory nature male reproductive alliances easily resolved inclusive fitness theory inclusive fitness proposed hamilton states individuals enhance reproductive fitness securing reproductive success relatives kin selection increase reproductive fitness altruist according hamilton cited nowak coefficient relatedness donor recipient altruistic act must greater costtobenefit ratio altruist act r therefore alliances composed closely related individuals large coefficient relatedness widely believed inclusive fitness principal driving force evolution male reproductive pope demonstrated advantageous dominant subordinate male red howler monkeys members male alliance males formed coalitions related unrelated individuals related troops stable lasted longer unstable findings indicate despite low reproductive success subordinate males given dominant males secured mating opportunities still beneficial group opposed alone particularly coalition composed related study suggested red howler monkey coalitions kin selection primary mechanism involved formation male subordinate males decreased direct fitness cooperating dominant males increased inclusive fitness cooperating male philopatry behavior remaining natal groups many cases sets stage alliances among later pope also discovered reproductive success males within coalitions increases increasing said member male alliance direct reproductive benefits individuals alliances come status shifts mate guarding behavior often result injury coalitions also provide reproductive benefit without comprising related species coalitions nonrelatives fairly stable time providing valuable reproductive benefits individuals involved lion collations composed individuals initially thought made related individuals however known large percent lion alliances composed unrelated findings indicate kin selection driving force behind formation male often unclear male coalitions unrelated individuals arise hypothesis direct reciprocity proposed trivers explain altruistic behaviors among direct reciprocity states individuals likely cooperate individuals likely encounter altruist performs behavior benefits another individual decreases repayment altruistic act follows later two individuals meet former altruist becomes receiver altruistic act former receiver becomes direct reciprocity operate unrelated individuals benefit receiver greater cost altruist therefore individuals receiving end partnership increased simplest explanation direct reciprocity titfortat model individuals receiving end altruistic act likely cooperate titfortat strategy successful societies tendency individuals fitting strategy situations cooperation already common winstay loseshift winstay loseshift strategy individuals repeat last act either cooperate defect cooperation well change methods direct reciprocity lead stable cooperative behavior probability two cooperative individuals encountering must greater costbenefit ratio altruistic act despite strategy documented cases direct altruism general even less cases reciprocal altruism within confines reproduction exception savanna subordinate male savanna baboons form friendly relations dominant males rely subordinate males help secure monopolization females intruding friendly relationship dominant male subordinate males temporary eventually subordinate males work together overturn dominant male ending reproductive monopoly thus allowing subordinate males temporarily secure mating opportunities new dominant male key hypothesis dominant male newest member coalition since subordinate males lived together prior dominant males arrival researchers suggest cohabitation allowed baboons come mutual agreement work together overturn dominant coalitions formed lower ranking males interpreted direct reciprocity cooperative subordinate males presumably cooperated however savanna baboon behavior viewed reciprocal altruism evidence weak behavior often deviates framework reciprocal another explanation male alliances mutualism mutualism benefits individuals cooperating immediate benefit associated cooperating outweighs costs associated lions provide interesting case mutualism male lions afford cooperate one another single male lions successfully defend maintain access females invading coalitions males invade pride force single male therefore males cooperate gain defend access resident male alliances maintain access females pride sire offspring control solitary lions rarely gain access coalitions however kill resident cubs beginning therefore vital importance males reproductive success member male coalition defend females intruding originally believed male lions formed groups related individuals clear may also form alliances unrelated male lion alliances extremely successful preventing solitary males invading packer et al found lions often form coalitions nonrelatives specific degree relatedness coalition members related coalition size small coalitions often composed unrelated individuals large coalitions largely composed related although larger coalitions result offspring per capita small coalitions large coalitions composed close large groups select males successful mating resulting large discrepancy reproductive fitness among coalition small groups male dominant individuals displayed similar reproductive therefore lions researchers propose cooperation nonrelatives hypothesized evolved cases little variance mating opportunities among coalition members males share equally mating larger coalitions result greater variability mating opportunities therefore researchers suggest kinship indirect fitness benefit necessary maintenance success larger male lion smaller groups male lions thought share mutual dependence smaller groups composed largely unrelated individuals eliminates possibility kin selection without cooperation males would able defend pride mutualism appears driving force formation small male lion alliances whereas kin selection appears greater importance formation maintenance larger findings demonstrate formation male alliances occurs differently species also within adding variability male alliances species bottlenose dolphins form least two levels male first level alliances termed first order alliances guard access females closely resemble alliances previously discussed primate second order alliances form two first order resulting super alliance works herd females defend preventing outside males gaining access first order alliances stable often lasting ten years second order alliances average males first order alliances closely related second order alliances display genetic scientists suggest different levels alliances bottlenose dolphins risen different evolutionary inclusive fitness suggested driving force behind first order alliances related however first order alliances composed unrelated individuals well second alliances unrelated individuals also occur indicating may another mechanism favoring formation male additionally congruent research also supports earlier predictions high female promiscuity would decrease value male also potential mutualistic benefits individuals involved alliance benefits may include effective female guarding turn enhances reproductive success alliance findings demonstrate formation male alliances highly variable context dependent many hypotheses set forward explain formation stability male alliances notably kin selection direct reciprocity mutualism many factors dictate formation stability male reproductive alliances scientists propose formation male alliances largely result need males cooperate order gain access intense competition
