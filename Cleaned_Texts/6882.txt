conflict poc expression coined robert trivers used describe evolutionary conflict arising differences optimal parental investment pi offspring standpoint parent offspring pi investment parent individual offspring decreases parents ability invest offspring selected offsprings chance surviving increases poc occurs sexually reproducing species based genetic conflict parents equally related offspring therefore expected equalize investment among offspring half less related siblings fully related try get pi parents intended provide even siblings disadvantage however poc limited close genetic relationship parent offspring offspring obtains additional pi expense siblings decreases number surviving siblings therefore gene offspring leads additional pi decreases extent number surviving copies may located siblings thus costs siblings high gene might selected despite benefit offspring problem specifying individual expected weigh relative examined w hamilton context kin selection hamiltons rule says altruistic behavior positively selected benefit recipient multiplied genetic relatedness recipient performer greater cost performer social act conversely selfish behavior favoured hamiltons inequality satisfied leads prediction things equal poc stronger half siblings eg unrelated males father females successive offspring full plants poc allocation resources brood members may affect brood size number seeds matured within single fruit seed concerning brood size economic use maternal resources achieved packing many seeds possible one fruit ie minimizing cost packing per seed contrast offspring benefits low numbers seeds per fruit reduces sibling competition dispersal conflict seed size arises usually exists inverse exponential relationship seed size fitness fitness seed increases diminishing rate resource investment fitness maternal parent optimum demonstrated smith see also marginal value theorem however optimum resource investment offsprings point view would amount optimizes inclusive fitness direct indirect fitness higher maternal parents optimum conflict resource allocation obviously manifested reduction brood size ie decrease proportion ovules matured seeds reduction assumed caused offspring maternal parents interest produce seeds observed selection would favour production extra ovules mature seeds although explanations phenomenon exist genetic load resource depletion maternal regulation offspring quality could supported experiments several possibilities offspring affect paternal resource allocation brood members evidence exists siblicide dominant embryoscitation needed embryos formed early kill remaining embryos aborting chemical oaks early fertilized ovules prevent fertilization ovules inhibiting pollen tube entry embryo sac species maternal parent evolved postfertilization abortion seeded pods nevertheless cheating offspring also possible namely late siblicide postfertilization abortion ceased according general poc model reduction brood size caused poc depend genetic relatedness offspring fruit indeed abortion embryos common outcrossing selfpollinating plants seeds crosspollinating plants less related selfpollinating plants moreover level solicitation resources offspring also increased crosspollinating plants several reports average weight crossed seeds greater seeds produced earliest examples parentoffspring conflict seen bird broods especially raptor species parent birds often lay two eggs attempt raise two young strongest fledgling takes greater share food brought parents often kill weaker sibling siblicide conflicts suggested driving force evolution optimal clutch size bluefooted booby parentoffspring conflict results times food scarcity less food available given year older dominant chick often kill younger chick either attacking directly driving nest parents try prevent siblicide building nests steeper sides laying heavier second even poc theory arose debates took place whether infants wean mothers actively wean infants furthermore discussed whether maternal rejections increase infant independence turned mother infant contribute infant independence maternal rejections followed shortterm increase infant contact eventually result longterm decrease contact shown several primates wild baboons infants rejected early frequently spend less time contact whereas rejected stay much longer proximity mother suckle ride even advanced ages wild chimpanzees abrupt increase maternal rejections decrease motheroffspring contact found mothers resume estrus consort males rhesus macaques high probability conception following mating season associated high rate maternal rejection rejection behavioral conflicts occur first months infants life mother resumes estrus findings suggest reproduction mother influenced interaction offspring potential conflicts pi also observed rhesus macaques number contacts made offspring significantly higher number contacts made mother mating season whereas opposite holds number broken contacts fact suggests mother resists offsprings demands contact whereas offspring apparently interested spending time contact three months infant age shift mother infant responsibility maintaining contact takes place infant becomes independent effort maintain proximity mother increases might sound paradoxical becomes clear one takes account poc increases period pi summary findings consistent poctheory one might object time contact reasonable measure pi example time milk transfer lactation would better one one argue mother infant different thermoregulatory needs due fact different surfacetovolume ratios resulting rapid loss heat infants compared adults infants may sensitive low temperatures mothers infant might try compensate increased contact time mother could initiate behavioral conflict time consistency hypothesis shown japanese macaques decreasing temperatures result higher maternal rejections increased number contacts made eusocial species parentoffspring conflict takes unique role haplodiploidy prevalence sterile workers sisters related mothers brothers cases drives female workers try obtain sex ratio females males colony however queens equally related sons daughters prefer sex ratio conflict social insects level investment queen provide sex current future offspring generally thought workers win conflict sex ratio closer however examples like bombus terrestris queen considerable control forcing important illustration poc within humans provided david haig work genetic conflicts haig argued fetal genes would selected draw resources mother would optimal mother give placenta example secretes allocrine hormones decrease sensitivity mother insulin thus make larger supply blood sugar available fetus mother responds increasing level insulin bloodstream counteract effect placenta insulin receptors stimulate production insulindegrading percent human conceptions progress full term percent becoming clinical creating second arena conflict mother fetus fetus lower quality cut point spontaneous abortion mother mothers quality cutoff point also declines nears end reproductive life significantly seen older mothers older mothers higher incidence offspring genetic defects initially maintenance pregnancy controlled maternal hormone progesterone later stages controlled fetal human chorionic gonadotrophin released maternal bloodstream release fetal human chorionic gonadotrophin causes release maternal progesterone also conflict blood supply placenta fetus prepared demand larger blood supply optimal mother even since high birth weight risk factor results hypertension significantly high birth weight positively correlated maternal blood pressure pregnancy twoway traffic
