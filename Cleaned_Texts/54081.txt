seed predation often referred granivory type plantanimal interaction granivores seed predators feed seeds plants main exclusive food many cases leaving seeds damaged viable granivores found across many families vertebrates especially mammals birds well invertebrates mainly thus seed predation occurs virtually terrestrial ecosystems seed predation commonly divided two distinctive temporal categories predispersal postdispersal predation affect fitness parental plant dispersed offspring seed respectively mitigating pre postdispersal predation may involve different strategies counter seed predation plants evolved physical defenses eg shape toughness seed coat chemical defenses secondary compounds tannins alkaloids however plants evolved seed defenses seed predators adapted plant defenses eg ability detoxify chemical compounds thus many interesting examples coevolution arise dynamic relationship plant seeds important sources nutrition animals across ecosystems seeds contain food storage organs eg endosperm provide nutrients developing plant embryo cotyledon makes seeds attractive food source animals highly concentrated localized nutrient source relation plant parts seeds many plants evolved variety defenses deter predation seeds often contained inside protective structures fruit pulp encapsulate seeds ripe physical defenses include spines hairs fibrous seed coats hard endosperm seeds especially arid areas may mucilaginous seed coat glue soil seed hiding seeds evolved strong antiherbivore chemical compounds contrast physical defenses chemical seed defenses deter consumption using chemicals toxic distasteful granivores inhibit digestibility seed chemicals include toxic nonprotein amino acids cyanogenic glycosides protease amylase inhibitors plants may face tradeoffs allocation toward defenses size number seeds produced plants may reduce severity seed predation making seeds spatially temporally scarce granivores seed dispersal away parent plant hypothesized reduce severity seed seed masting example plant populations able temporally regulate severity seed predation masting refers concerted abundance seed production followed period paucity strategy potential regulate size population seed predators adaptations defend seeds predation impact seeds ability germinate disperse thus antipredator adaptations often occur suite adaptations particular seed life history example chili plants selectively deter mammal seed predators fungi using capsaicin deter bird seed bird taste receptors bind capsaicin chili seeds turn higher survival pass birds stomach fall seed predation occur seed predispersal seed predation takes place seeds removed parent plant dispersal often reported invertebrates birds granivorous rodents clip fruits directly trees herbaceous plants postdispersal seed predation arises seeds released parent plant birds rodents ants known among pervasive postdispersal seed predators furthermore postdispersal seed predation take place two contrasting stages predation seed rain predation seed bank whereas predation seed rain occurs animals prey released seeds usually flush ground surface predation seed bank takes place seeds incorporated deeply nevertheless important vertebrate predispersal predators especially birds small mammals postdispersal seed predation extremely common virtually ecosystems given heterogeneity resource type seeds different species quality seeds different ages andor different status integrity decomposition location seeds scattered hidden environment postdispersal predators generalist predators belong diverse array animals ants beetles crabs fish rodents birds assemblage postdispersal seed predators varies considerably among dispersed seed first independent life stage plant thus postdispersal seed predation first potential mortality event one first biotic interactions plants life cycle pre postdispersal seed predation common predispersal predators differ postdispersal predators often specialists adapted clustered resources plant use specific cues like plant chemistry volatile compounds color size locate seeds short life cycles often match production
