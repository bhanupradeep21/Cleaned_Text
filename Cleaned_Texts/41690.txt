lions often kill cubs pride sire behavior adaptive killing cubs eliminates competition offspring causes nursing females come heat faster thus allowing genes enter population sociobiologists would view

biology departments foundation work almost field biologists sociobiological research nonhuman organisms increased dramatically continuously worlds top scientific journals nature science general term behavioral ecology commonly substituted term sociobiology order avoid public sociobiologists maintain human behavior well nonhuman animal behavior partly explained outcome natural selection contend order fully understand behavior must analyzed terms evolutionary considerations natural selection fundamental evolutionary theory variants hereditary traits increase organisms ability survive reproduce greatly represented subsequent generations ie selected thus inherited behavioral mechanisms allowed organism greater chance surviving andor reproducing past likely survive present organisms inherited adaptive behaviors present nonhuman animal species multiply demonstrated biologists become foundation evolutionary biology however continued resistance researchers application evolutionary models humans particularly within social sciences culture long assumed predominant driver behavior sociobiology based upon two fundamental premises sociobiology uses nikolaas tinbergens four categories questions explanations animal behavior two categories species level two individual level specieslevel categories often called ultimate explanations individuallevel categories often called proximate explanations sociobiologists interested behavior explained logically result selective pressures history species thus often interested instinctive intuitive behavior explaining similarities rather differences cultures example mothers within many species mammals including humans protective offspring sociobiologists reason protective behavior likely evolved time helped offspring individuals characteristic survive parental protection would increase frequency population social behavior believed evolved fashion similar types nonbehavioral adaptations coat fur sense smell
