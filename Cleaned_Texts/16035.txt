asbestosis longterm inflammation scarring lungs due asbestos symptoms may include shortness breath cough wheezing chest complications may include lung cancer mesothelioma pulmonary heart asbestosis caused breathing asbestos fibers requires relatively large exposure long period time typically occur directly work types asbestos fibers associated increased generally recommended currently existing

exposed airborne asbestos fibers asbestosis scarring lung tissue beginning around terminal bronchioles alveolar ducts extending alveolar walls resulting inhalation asbestos fibers two types fibers amphibole thin straight serpentine curly forms asbestos fibers responsible human disease able penetrate deeply lungs fibers reach alveoli air sacs lung oxygen transferred blood foreign bodies asbestos fibers cause activation lungs local immune system provoke inflammatory reaction dominated lung macrophages respond chemotactic factors activated inflammatory reaction described chronic rather acute slow ongoing progression immune system attempting eliminate foreign fibers macrophages phagocytose ingest fibers stimulate fibroblasts deposit connective tissue due asbestos fibers natural resistance digestion macrophages killed others release inflammatory chemical signals attracting lung macrophages fibrolastic cells synthesize fibrous scar tissue eventually becomes diffuse progress heavily exposed individuals tissue seen microscopically soon exposure animal models asbestos fibers become layered ironcontaining proteinaceous material ferruginous body cases heavy exposure fibers become coated inhaled asbestos fibers remain uncoated inhaled fibers transported cytoskeletal components alveolar epithelium interstitial compartment lung interact macrophages mesenchymal cells cytokines
