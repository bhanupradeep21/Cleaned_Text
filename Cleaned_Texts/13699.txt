congenital myopathy broad term muscle disorder present birth defect primarily affects skeletal muscle fibres causes muscular weakness andor hypotonia congenital myopathies account one top neuromuscular disorders world today comprising approximately live births every whole congenital myopathies broadly classified follows congenital myopathies inclusion bodies protein accumulation broad category congenital myopathies fall within group well understood nemaline myopathy see typically development error category occurs muscle proteins aggregate build sarcoplasm leads muscle dysfunctioncitation needed core myopathies multicore myopathy central core disease characterized sharplydemarcated areas devoid oxidative enzymes nadh sdh cox muscle fibrescitation needed myopathies central nuclei myotubular myopathy involves error gene involved vesicle movement throughout cell creates problems vesicles reaching plasma membrane cellular components necessary fuse myoblast major step formation skeletal muscle creates structural problems throughout skeletal muscle z line sarcomere creating weakness myopathies varying fiber size congenital fiber type disproportion occurs type fibers slow twitch fibers involved sustaining activity smaller type fibers fast twitch fibers involved quick activity since smaller type fibers associated nemaline myopathy common type congenital myopathy studied great detail many others however smaller type fibers explains patients typically participate activities shorter periods time struggle extended rarely specific tests congenital myopathies except muscle biopsy tests run check creatine kinase blood often normal mildly elevated congenital myopathies electromyography run check electrical activity muscle diagnosis heavily relies muscle pathology muscle biopsy visualised cellular level diagnosis usually relies method creatine kinase levels electromyography unreliable since congenital myopathies genetic advancements prenatal conditions included term congenital myopathy vary one source includes nemaline myopathy myotubular myopathy central core myopathy congenital fiber type disproportion multicore term also used broadly describe conditions present birthcitation needed nemaline myopathy first described common congenital myopathy characterized generalized muscle weakness low muscle tone severest form affected babies often die respiratory date gene mutations found cause nemaline myopathy identified genes associated actin filament basis muscle contraction histologically nemaline rods stain red gomoris trichrome mostly seen subsarcolemmal region muscle nemaline rods also observed intermyofibrillar region muscle fibres within nemaline myopathy autosomal dominant sometimes autosomal recessive genetic disorder sporadic cases also describedcitation needed myotubular myopathy also known centronuclear myopathy recognized pain exercise difficulty walking people affected disease typically wheelchairreliant middle adulthood weakness muscles involved eye movement nerve function disorders form intellectual disability myotubular myopathy rare less families currently affected genetically myotubular myopathy two causes autosomal dominant autosomal recessive caused mutation gene disorder autosomal dominant meaning passed one mutated gene mutation takes place gene disease instead autosomal recessive genes must mutated disease inherited autosomal recessive onset central core disease central core myopathy first described usually presents infancy early childhood nonprogressive mild proximal weakness persists throughout life central core disease believed prevalent currently reported hard recognize often misdiagnosed early central core disease found allelic malignant lifethreatening anesthetic reaction causes rise body temperature muscular rigidity muscular breakdown grossly elevated creatine kinase acidosis central core disease caused mutation congenital fiber type disproportion affects skeletal muscle typically causing weakness shoulders upper arms thighs hips skeletal muscle made two kinds fiber type type congenital fiber type disproportion type fibers smaller often abundant type leads affected individuals able maintain active lifestyle though usually lower levels severity disease varies greatly people typically present symptoms age one individuals usually worsen time cases even reported multicore myopathy also referred minicore myopathy associated small areas decreased oxidative activities resulting areas appear histology cores appear microscopy similar central core however cores typically smaller multicore myopathy congenital fiber type disproportion patients greater number type fibers overall approximately half diagnosed individuals report progression muscle weakness half report slow cylindrical spirals myopathy rare individual cases described majority cases sporadic observed families characterized presence cylindrical spirals main pathological finding muscle biopsies cylindrical spirals unusual membrane structures spiral pattern membrane structures seen electron microscopic examination affected muscle structures merge surrounded tubular structures resemble tubular aggregates tubular aggregates abnormal accumulations membranous tubules observed wide variety muscle diseases originate sarcoplasmic cylindrical spirals first described thought nonspecific reaction skeletal muscle secondary metabolic disturbance muscle fibre molecular basis cylindrical spiral myopathy currently unknown however genetic mutation affecting sarcoplasmic reticulum patients seems likely calsequestrin shown bind cylindrical cylindrical spirals also shown react mitochondrial enzyme succinate suggests cylindrical spirals originate mitochondria phenotypes quite variable manifestations include weakness abnormal gait myotonia cramps myosin storage myopathies myosin accumulates beneath sarcolemma myofibrils forming protein myopathy associated gene autosomal dominant myosin storage congenital although tubular aggregates seen variety myopathies genetic congenital myopathies associated genes known tubular aggregate myopathy tam types currently treatments congenital myopathies depending severity different therapies available help alleviate pain aid patients performing varying activities example many congenital myopathy patients involved physical occupational therapy attempt strengthen skeletal muscles orthopedic surgery usually necessary correct skeletal deformities secondary muscle weakness scoliosis survival typically determined
