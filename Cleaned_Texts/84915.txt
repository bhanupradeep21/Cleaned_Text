pulmonary atresia ventricular septal defect rare birth defect characterized pulmonary valve atresia occurring alongside defect right ventricular outflow type congenital heart one two recognized subtypes pulmonary atresia pulmonary atresia intact ventricular condition consists atresia affecting pulmonary valve hypoplastic right ventricular outflow tract ventricular septal defect doesnt impede outflowing blood ventricular septum helps form fetal spectrum symptoms exhibited children condition depends severity condition barely show symptoms others might develop complications congestive heart symptomatic children symptoms become apparent soon birth usually consist features occur alongside birth defect including congenital anomalies polydactyly microcephaly congenital hearing loss sensorineural type renal agenesis dextrocardia condition called severe form tetralogy deformed blood vessels coming thoracic aorta appear alongside condition phenotype renamed pulmonary atresia ventricular septal defect major aortopulmonary children condition higher risk developing following children whose pavsd caused digeorge syndrome also known deletion syndrome likely suffer postsurgical complications especially respiratory ones associated surgeries treat women pavsd slightly higher risk infertile miscarriages children congenital heart airway hyperresponsiveness commonly seen comorbidity among afflicted pulmonary atresia pavsd takes place first weeks fetal life pulmonary valve supposed form fails form doesnt allow blood flow pulmonary artery right ventricle ventricular septal defect associated pavsd lets right ventricule cases pavsd major aortopulmonary collateral arteries develop normal fetus arteries usually develop start deteriorating pulmonary arteries grow fetuses pavsd pulmonary arteries dont develop gives chance major aortopulmonary collateral arteries develop mildest variant pulmonary atresia ventricular septal defect involves pulmonary atresia normally developed main pulmonary artery branch pulmonary arteries blood flows lungs right side heart goes left side heart ventricular septum flows patent ductus arteriosus severe variant involves presence severely hypoplastic main pulmonary arteries branch pulmonary arteries alongside agenesis patent ductus arteriosus blood flow lungs comes various dysplastic malformed blood vessels thoracic aorta called major aortapulmonary collateral arteries blood vessels narrow time goes although birth defect congenital exact cause unknown may vary children condition following factors known influence risk baby born molecular genetics condition isnt known people pavsd however candidate genes found possibly implicated pathogenesis also copy number variants described medical literature associated study done britain revealed children mother congenital heart defect including pavsd higher risk born congenital heart defect whose father congenital heart cases pavsd associated genetic syndromes vacterl association alagille syndrome charge syndrome trisomy congenital heart defects cant acquired also caused environmental factors mother exposed andor pregnancy maternal exposure carbon monoxide smoke eg cigarettes known ability quickly crossing placenta fetus attaches fetal haemoglobin leaving shortage nutrients oxygen result relation events congenital heart disease including pavsd showed recent paternal smoking smoking father also shown contributing factor congenital heart disease light smoking slightly increased risk mans offspring congenital conotruncal heart defect heavy smoking cigarettes day doubled risk said man child congenital heart disease higher amounts linked higher risk children septal defects andor obstruction left ventricular outflow risk factors include maternal obesity diabetes rubella indomethacin tocolysis phenylketonuria elderly link certain genes maternal smoking shown increase chance children congenital heart disease including pavsd mothers cc genotype position mthfr gene increased chance chdridden child genes increase chance child chd smoker mothers carry genetic variations include various ways diagnosing congenital heart defect prenatally postnatally methods disorder detected usually soon birth prostaglandin temporarily used soon possible keep ductus arteriosus open long possible surgery done done blood keep flowing lungs since bodies babies pulmonary atresia usually use ductus arteriosus lung blood flow prenatally birth afterwards anomaly usually managed surgeries improvement blood flow function heart although kind treatment one gets depends structure cardiorespiratory surgical methods used treat longterm condition frequency estimates vary populations estimates range live births believed make cases congenital heart defects patients pavsd around microdeletion without treatment highly lifethreatening condition prognosis surgery isnt performed severe cases child die since phenotype pulmonary atresia compatible life due pulmonary valve atresia resulting reduced blood life expectancy untreated children pavsd survival rates untreated people defect reported tenth decade twentieth untreated patients major aortopulmonary arteries higher chance living latter chance surviving tenth decade chance thirtieth prognosis surgical intervention generally combination birth defects first described dichiara et al patients father son united states pulmonary atresia ventricular septal defect point familial cases pa vsd multifactorial etiology cause involving genetics environment suspected patients offered medical counseling oldest patient untreated pavsd woman japan condition discovered childhood refused get surgery treat including cardiac catheterization developed dyspnea teenage years radiological studies showed ventricular septal defect alongside cardiac arterial anomalies heart silhouette enlargement elevation cardiac apex presence right aortic arch enlargement affecting main pulmonary arteries major
