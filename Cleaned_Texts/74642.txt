concept learning also known category learning concept attainment concept formation defined bruner goodnow austin search listing attributes used distinguish exemplars non exemplars various categoriesthis quote needs citation simply put concepts mental categories help us classify objects events ideas building understanding object event idea set common relevant features thus concept learning strategy requires learner compare contrast groups categories contain conceptrelevant features groups categories contain conceptrelevant features concept concept attainment requires following categories concept learning task human classifies objects shown set example objects along class labels learner simplifies observed condensing form example simplified version learned applied future examples concept learning may simple complex learning takes place many areas concept difficult less likely learner able simplify therefore less likely learn colloquially task known learning examples theories concept learning based storage exemplars avoid summarization overt abstraction kind machine learning theory applied training computer concept learning must distinguished learning reciting something memory recall discriminating two things differ discrimination however issues closely related since memory recall facts could considered trivial conceptual process prior exemplars representing concept invariant similarly discrimination initial concept learning discrimination processes involved refining concepts means repeated presentation exemplars concept attainment rooted inductive learning designing curriculum learning method comparing like unlike examples key defining characteristics concrete concepts objects perceived personal sensations perceptions objects like chairs dogs personal interactions occur create concepts become concrete word use associate perceivable according paivio dual coding theory concrete concepts one remembered easier perceptual memory evidence shown words heard associated concrete concept reenact previous interaction word within sensorimotor examples concrete concepts learning early educational math concepts like adding subtracting abstract concepts words ideas deal emotions personality traits terms like fantasy cold abstract concept within every person personal definition ever changing comparing abstract concepts example cold could mean physical temperature surrounding area could define action personality another person within concrete concepts still level abstractness concrete abstract concepts seen scale ideas like chair dog cut dry perceptions concepts like cold fantasy seen obscure way examples abstract concept learning topics like religion ethics abstractconcept learning seeing comparison stimuli based rule eg identity difference oddity greater addition subtraction novel abstractconcept learning three criteria rule alternative explanations define novelty stimuli one transfer stimuli novel individual means needs new stimulus individual two replication transfer stimuli third lastly full abstract learning experience equal amount baseline performance transfer binder westbury mckiernan possing medler used

allan hypothesized dual coding theory states verbal visual information used represent information thinking concept dog thoughts word dog image dog occur dual coding theory assumes abstract concepts involve verbal semantic system concrete concepts additionally involved visual imaginary system relational associated concepts words ideas thoughts connected form relational concepts connected universal definition common relational terms updown leftright fooddinner ideas learned early childhood important children concepts integral within understanding reasoning conservation relational terms

also called functional concept learning involves categorizing stimuli based common response outcome regardless perceptual similarity appropriate associating thoughts ideas thoughts ideas understood

generalization chunking operationalization particular theory concept learning relatively new research conducted test taking mathematical approach concept learning bayesian theories propose human mind produces probabilities certain concept definition based examples seen bayesian concept prior probability stops eing overly specific likelihood hypothesis ensures definition broad example say child shown three horses parent told called horses needs work exactly adult means word much likely define word horses referring either type animal animals rather oddly specific example like horses except clydedales would unnatural concept meanwhile likelihood horses meaning animals three animals shown similar low hypothesis word horse refers animals species likely three possible definitions reasonable prior probability likelihood given examples bayes theorem important provides powerful tool understanding manipulating controlling takes larger view limited data analysis approach subjective requires assessment prior making also complex however bayesians show accumulated evidence application bayes law sufficient work overcome subjectivity inputs bayesian inference used honestly collected data
