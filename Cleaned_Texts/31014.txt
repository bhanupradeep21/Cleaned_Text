social psychology superordinate goals goals worth completing require two social groups cooperatively idea proposed social psychologist muzafer sherif experiments intergroup relations run way reducing conflict competing sherifs idea downplay two separate group identities encourage two groups think one larger superordinate group approach applied many contexts reduce intergroup conflict including business however also critiqued social psychologists proposed competing theories intergroup conflict contact theory social categorization theory context goalsetting theory concept seen terms three goal levels classified subordinate intermediate organizations superordinate goals expressed vision mission statement support strategic alignment activities subordinate intermediate goals overall purpose superordinate superordinate goals first described proposed solution intergroup conflict social psychologist muzafer sherif studied conflict creating boys summer camp robbers cave experiments sherif assigned participating campers two separate groups blue red boys separate games activities lived different cabins ate different tables spent time group sherif introduced competition groups setting athletic contests created conflict two groups boys developed hostile attitudes towards group pranking namecalling shows group pride negative stereotyping even occasionally physical order reduce conflict two groups boys sherif first attempted groups spend time together noncompetitively also encouraged mix eat meals play games boys group however groups remained hostile toward also tried unite groups common enemy outside summer camp early version experiment however deemed inadequate solution simply created new conflict new group common sherif introduced superordinate goals possible solution conflict goals important summer camp could achieved groups working together obtaining water water shortage procuring film groups wanted see enough money sherif found goals encouraged cooperation boys reduced conflict groups increased positive beliefs boys group increased crossgroup friendships superordinate goals often discussed context realistic conflict theory proposes intergroup conflicts stem fight scarce resources especially situations seen realistic conflict theory prejudice discrimination functional groups tools used achieve goals including obtaining scarce resources would difficult get individual case groups see groups similar goals threats therefore perceive negatively groups competing limited resource said negative interdependence hand groups benefit working together goals zerosum case groups said positive order remove competition different factions realistic group conflict theory necessary nonzero sum goals create positive interdependence within groups rather negative superordinate goals create positive interdependence seen desirable groups achievable faction independently work social psychology suggests superordinate goals differ single group goals make larger group identity salient increase positive beliefs everyone larger superordinate group superordinate goals differ smaller group goals achieved single small group thus force multiple groups work together encouraging cooperation penalizing encourages group consider group positively rather negatively group instrumental achieving common fosters sense positive interdependence rather negative interdependence addition increasing positive interdependence two groups work together single superordinate goal makes larger group identity effect superordinate goals make likely groups consider part larger superordinate group common goal rather two independent groups conflict case sherifs summer camp groups boys red blue thought simply campers working together rather part blue red groups groups consider part one larger superordinate group valuable reduction discrimination evaluation members ones group tends positive evaluation members outside ones however two groups need lose individual identities order become part superordinate fact superordinate goals work best reduce intergroup conflict groups consider subgroups shared identity common allows groups keep positive aspects individual identities also keeping salient everything two subgroups common sherifs work superordinate goals widely seen rebuttal contact states prejudice discrimination groups widely exists due lack contact lack contact causes sides develop misconceptions know act misconceptions discriminatory ways however sherifs work showed contact groups enough eliminate prejudice groups competing limited resources increasing contact groups convince groups see positively instead continue discriminate boys sherifs summer camps especially true groups unequal status one group control resources power effects superordinate goals always shown last beyond completion sherifs study separate group identities dissolve end camp two groups boys less hostility toward still identified groups rather larger superordinate identity cases superordinate goals bring together two separate groups really zerosum goals put groups competition groups remain separate stereotype discriminate cases simply perception goals zerosum whether increase prejudice therefore need nonzerosum goals must perceived superordinate goals effective groups performing similar roles within group achieve case groups may see infringing work getting way considered effective members group playing complementary roles achievement although evidence support idea also argue absence trust prospect working together achieve mutual goal may serve bring groups superordinate cases inequalities power lack trust among groups idea must work together foster trust positive interdependence may backfire lead discrimination rather social categorization theory social identity theory differ realistic group conflict theory suggest people belong groups gain material advantage therefore theories propose ways improving intergroup social relations social categorization theory proposes people naturally categorize others groups even motive supporting idea tajfels minimal group shown discrimination among groups created laboratory history future interaction motivation social categorization suggests intergroup competition may feature tendency categorize may arise without zerosum goals tajfels paradigm people go far hurting group order harm group even thus superordinate goals may solve forms discrimination social identity theory proposes people naturally categorize others derive part identities part social part social group source positive selfesteem motivates individuals think group better groups social identity theory superordinate goals useful insofar make salient superordinate identity superordinate identity important reducing intergroup conflict goals superordinate identity made salient without use goals goals instrumental reducing superordinate goals applied multiple types situations order reduce conflict groups elliot aronson applied idea superordinate goals austin texas integration austin public aronson used group projects elementary school classrooms way get white black children work
