abdalodon extinct genus late permian cynodonts known species diastematicus abdalodon together genus charassognathus form clade clade represents earliest known cynodonts first known radiation permian abdalodon diastematicus known one crushed fossil skull karoo basin south permian therapsids cynodonts among rare biarmosuchians therapsids comparable fossil record permian cynodonts characterized long ghost abdalodon important discerning early evolution cynodonts abdalodon sister taxa charassognathus small bodied animals abdalodon skull around six centimeters length charassognathus skull slightly suggests early cynodont evolution occurred small body size could explain rarity permian cynodont inherent taphonomic bias fossilization small bodied genus name abdalodon means abdalas tooth genus named paleontologist fernando abdala made significant contributions understanding evolution earliest cynodonts species epithet diastematicus refers characteristic tooth free gap canines postcanines upper lower abdalodon discovered rocks beaufort group karoo basin south permian south africa made southern edge supercontinent gondwana today climate karoo basin hot dry carboniferous cool semiarid karoo basin situated eccaclarification needed shallow sea north enormous cape fold mountain belt south flowing mountains shallow sea series mississippi size rivers carrying huge amounts sediments late permian sediments filled shallow sea leaving behind ecca group resulting landscape extensive series floodplains flood plains progressed farther northward late permian triassic sediments deposited floodplains would become beaufort since late carboniferous climate warmed dramatically grew wetter environment supported diverse array flora floodplains inhabited earliest reptiles late permian become home earliest cynodonts including abdalodon known existing abdalodon specimen single skull originally described juvenile specimen procynosuchus delaharpeae variation skull existing procynosuchus delaharpeae specimens explained ontogenetic variation classifying skull p delaharpeae extended stratigraphic range procynosuchus million years earlier however result questioned premise intermediate strata containing known procynosuchus delaharpe specimens formation skull discovered well sampled yielded procynosuchus delaharpeae skull reexamined concluded organism whence came fully grown meant features previously explained ontogenetic variation fact unique characters skull actually belonged new genus early cynodonts subsequently named existing specimen abdalodon incomplete dorsoventrally crushed skull lower jaws tightly occluded abdalodon diastematicus characterized presence diastema canines postcanines dentary maxilla even longer diastema canines postcanines maxilla indentation behind canine root area possess several large foramina suggest abdalodon may whiskers posterior end maxilla bends medially insetting postcanines labial border snout dentary abdalodon diastematicus well defined masseteric fossa synapomorphy cynodonts sits high coronoid process masseter muscle would attached dentary postdentary bones particular importance since form ear bones mammals absent severely damaged nasal bone relatively flat separated maxilla anterior end snout septomaxilla therapsid synapomorphy lacrimal bone smaller narrower typical early cynodonts additionally skull significantly broader interorbital region shorter temporal region broader snout either closest known relatives charassognathus gracilis procynosuchus delaharpe gives skull stout appearance comparatively dorsal side orbital margin formed entirely prefrontal postorbital bones zygomatic arch nearly entirely formed jugal bone also makes part postorbital anterior region palatal surface skull obscured lower jaw tightly fixed palate transverse processes pterygoid sweep laterally posteriorly first described skull considered triangular interpterygoid vacuity however upon later examination status pterygoid vacuity left ambiguous dentary symphysis covered foramina suggesting may whiskers dentary symphysis tall sharply angled forming distinct upper postcanines abdalodon diastematicus tricuspid large minimally curved main cusp two smaller accessory cusps accessory cusps nearly symmetrical sit anterior posterior main cusp roots postcanines thecodont meaning teeth sit sockets middle jaw four upper incisors present sides skull posterior incisor separated canine short diastema tip new incisor emerging base incisor number left side jaw suggested fifth incisor however due position immediately incisor likely replacement tooth incisors conical smooth teeth serrations canines like incisors smooth conical proportionally size skull larger seen procynosuchus delaharpae charassognathus dentition abdalodon played critical role distinguishing procynosuchus incisors lower jaw abdalodon lower incisor count known vary ontogenically early cynodont helping distinguish genus procynosuchus postcanines abdalodon also outside range ontengenic variation procynosuchus typically postcanines long diastema canine postcanines upper lower jaw unique abdalodon main cusp abdalodons postcanines straighter early cynodonts abdalodons accessory cusps proportionally larger compared main cusp early cynodonts dentition abdalodon helps distinguish procynosuchus genus originally attributed charassognathus however bears similar dental formula abdalodon basis behind grouping clade charrasognathus however lacks substantial maxillary dentary diastema found abdalodon well masseteric fossa distinguishes abdalodon belongs clade charassognathidae subclade nested within cynodonta cynodonta notable given rise clade mammalia cynodonta belongs clade therapsida turn clade within synapsida synapsida represents one two major branches crown group amniota sauropsida clade includes lepidosauria dinosauria aves crocodilia cynodonts embody transition mammal like reptiles modern mammals since postcranial skeleton abdalodon exact posture unknown however assumptions abdalodon posture made based data collected cynodonts cynodonts articular surface femoral head oriented axis femoral shaft compared pelycosaurs typical mammals additionally distal femoral condyles cynodonts incline long axis pelycosaur femur run approximately parallel long axis mammals distal femoral condyles perpendicular long axis cynodonts also possess deeper acetabulum pelycosaurs expanded ilium reduced ischium similar pelvic structure modern taken account evidence suggested cynodonts like abdalodon semisprawling posture somewhere upright posture modern mammals sprawling posture pelycosaurs also suggested therapsids including early cynodonts could hind limb posture could alternate sprawling upright posture condition similar modern crocodilians hypothesis based shape femoral head addition ankle joint seems suited articulation upright sprawled though direct evidence abdalodon burrowed plausible clear evidence closely related triassic cynodonts thrinaxodon trirachodon also karoo basin south africa burrowers suggests long history burrowing behavior abdalodons teeth appear well suited chewing grinding large quantities plant matter therefore abdalodon like early cynodonts likely insectivore carnivore preyed upon anything smaller early middle triassic cynodonts began diversify diets becoming omnivorous herbivorous others remained httpsenwikipediaorgwikiabdalodon
