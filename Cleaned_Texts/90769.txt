sternum pl sternums sterna breastbone long flat bone located central part chest connects ribs via cartilage forms front rib cage thus helping protect heart lungs major blood vessels injury shaped roughly like necktie one largest longest flat bones body three regions manubrium body xiphoid word sternum originates ancient greek στέρνον stérnon chest sternum narrow flat bone forming middle portion front chest top sternum supports clavicles collarbones edges join costal cartilages first two pairs ribs inner surface sternum also attachment sternopericardial top also connected sternocleidomastoid muscle sternum consists three main parts listed top natural position sternum angled obliquely downward forward slightly convex front concave behind broad shaped like becoming narrowed point manubrium joins body widens little middle body narrows lower extremity adults sternum average cm longer male femalecitation needed manubrium latin handle broad upper part sternum quadrangular shape narrowing top gives four borders suprasternal notch jugular notch located middle upper broadest part manubrium notch felt two clavicles either side notch right left clavicular manubrium joins body sternum clavicles cartilages first pair ribs inferior border oval rough covered thin layer cartilage articulation body lateral borders marked depression first costal cartilage small facet similar facet upper angle body forms notch reception costal cartilage second rib depression first costal cartilage demifacet second narrow curved edge slopes downward towards middle also superior sternopericardial ligament attaches pericardium posterior side manubrium body gladiolus longest sternal part flat considered front back surface flat front directed upward forward marked three transverse ridges cross bone opposite third fourth fifth articular depressions pectoralis major attaches either side junction third fourth parts body occasionally seen orifice sternal foramen varying size form posterior surface slightly concave also marked three transverse lines less distinct however front lower part either side transversus thoracis takes origin sternal angle located point body joins manubrium sternal angle felt point sternum projects farthest forward however people sternal angle concave rounded physical examinations sternal angle useful landmark second rib attaches outer border superior angle small facet similar facet manubrium forms cavity cartilage second rib four angular depressions receive cartilages third fourth fifth sixth ribs inferior angle small facet corresponding one xiphoid process forms notch cartilage seventh rib articular depressions separated series curved interarticular intervals diminish length downward correspond intercostal spaces cartilages belonging true ribs articulate sternum lines junction primitive component segments well seen vertebrates parts bone remain separated longercitation needed upper border oval articulates manubrium sternal angle lower border narrow articulates xiphoid process located inferior end sternum pointed xiphoid process improperly performed chest compressions cardiopulmonary resuscitation cause xiphoid process snap driving liver cause fatal sternum composed highly vascular tissue covered thin layer compact bone thickest manubrium articular facets clavicles inferior sternopericardial ligament attaches pericardium posterior xiphoid process cartilages top five ribs join sternum sternocostal joints right left clavicular notches articulate right left clavicles respectively costal cartilage second rib articulates sternum sternal angle making easy transversus thoracis muscle innervated one intercostal nerves superiorly attaches posterior surface lower sternum inferior attachment internal surface costal cartilages two six works depress sternum develops two cartilaginous bars one left one right connected cartilages ribs two bars fuse together along middle form cartilaginous sternum ossified six centers one manubrium four body one xiphoid process ossification centers appear intervals articular depressions costal cartilages following order manubrium first piece body sixth month fetal life second third pieces body seventh month fetal life fourth piece first year birth xiphoid process fifth eighteenth years centers make appearance upper parts segments proceed gradually downward may added occasional existence two small episternal centers make appearance one either side jugular notch probably vestiges episternal bone monotremata lizardscitation needed occasionally segments formed one center number position vary fig thus first piece may two three even six centers two present generally situated one upper larger second piece seldom one third fourth fifth pieces often formed two centers placed laterally irregular union explains rare occurrence sternal foramen fig vertical fissure occasionally intersects part bone constituting malformation known fissura sterni conditions explained manner cartilaginous sternum formed rarely still upper end sternum may divided fissure union various centers body begins puberty proceeds upward fig age united xiphoid process may become joined body age thirty occurs frequently forty hand sometimes remains ununited old age advanced life manubrium occasionally joined body bone takes place however bony tissue generally superficial central portion intervening cartilage remaining unossified body sternum formed fusion four segments called population foramen known sternal foramen may presented lower third sternal extremely rare cases multiple foramina may observed fusion manubriosternal joint also occurs around small ossicles known episternal ossicles may also present posterior superior end another variant called suprasternal tubercle formed episternal ossicles fuse sternum contains bone marrow sometimes used site bone marrow biopsy particular patients high bmi obese grossly overweight may present excess tissue makes access traditional marrow biopsy sites pelvis difficult somewhat rare congenital disorder sternum sometimes referred anatomical variation sternal foramen single round hole sternum present birth usually offcentered right left commonly forming segments breastbone body congenital sternal foramina often mistaken bullet usually without symptoms problematic acupuncture area fractures sternum rather uncommon may result trauma drivers chest forced steering column car car accident fracture sternum usually comminuted fracture common site sternal fractures sternal angle studies reveal repeated punches continual beatings sometimes called breastbone punches sternum area also caused fractured sternums known occurred contact sports hockey football sternal fractures frequently associated underlying injuries pulmonary contusions bruised lung manubriosternal dislocation rare usually caused severe trauma may also result minor trauma precondition breastbone sometimes cut open median sternotomy gain access thoracic contents performing cardiothoracic surgery surgical fixation sternotomy achieved use either wire cerclage plate screw technique incidence sternotomy complications falls within narrow range nevertheless complications severe consequences including increased mortality rates need reoperation mortality rate high complications often entail issues like dehiscence sternal nonunion primarily stemming lateral forces exerted postoperative activities coughing sneezing sternum totally removed resected part radical surgery usually surgically treat malignancy either without mediastinal lymphadenectomy current procedural terminology codes respectively bifid sternum extremely rare congenital abnormality caused fusion failure condition results sternal cleft observed birth without sternum vertebrate anatomy flat bone lies middle front part rib cage endochondral probably first evolved early tetrapods extension pectoral girdle found fish amphibians reptiles typically shieldshaped structure often composed entirely cartilage absent turtles snakes birds relatively large bone typically bears enormous projecting keel flight muscles mammals sternum take elongated segmented form seen humans arthropods sternum ventral part segment thorax abdomen english sternum translation ancient greek στέρνον greek writer homer used term στέρνον refer male term στῆθος stithos refer chest greek physician hippocrates used στέρνον refer στῆθος greek physician galen first use στέρνον present meaning sternum solid bony part related ancient greek στερεόςστερρός meaning firm english term breastbone actually like latin os derived classical latin os pectus chest confusingly pectus also used classical latin position sternum shown red animation
