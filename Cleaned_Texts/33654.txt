microbiological culture microbial culture method multiplying microbial organisms letting reproduce predetermined culture medium controlled laboratory conditions microbial cultures foundational basic diagnostic methods used research tools molecular biology term culture also refer microorganisms grown microbial cultures used determine type organism abundance sample tested one primary diagnostic methods microbiology used tool determine cause infectious disease letting agent multiply predetermined medium example throat culture taken scraping lining tissue back throat blotting sample medium able screen harmful microorganisms streptococcus pyogenes causative agent strep furthermore term culture generally used informally refer selectively growing specific kind microorganism lab often essential isolate pure culture microorganisms pure axenic culture population cells multicellular organisms growing absence species types pure culture may originate single cell single organism case cells genetic clones one another purpose gelling microbial culture medium agarose gel agar used agar gelatinous substance derived seaweed cheap substitute agar guar gum used isolation maintenance thermophiles several types bacterial culture methods selected based agent cultured downstream use one method bacterial culture liquid culture desired bacteria suspended liquid nutrient medium luria broth upright flask allows scientist grow large amounts bacteria variety downstream applications liquid cultures ideal preparation antimicrobial assay liquid broth inoculated bacteria let grow overnight shaker may used mechanically mix broth encourage uniform growth subsequently aliquots sample taken test antimicrobial activity specific drug protein antimicrobial peptides static liquid cultures may used alternative cultures shaken provide microbes oxygen microbiological cultures grown petri dishes differing sizes thin layer agarbased growth medium growth medium petri dish inoculated desired bacteria plates incubated optimal temperature growing selected bacteria example usually degrees celsius human body temperature cultures humans animals lower environmental cultures desired level growth achieved agar plates stored upside refrigerator extended period time keep bacteria future experiments variety additives added agar poured plate allowed solidify types bacteria grow presence certain additives also used creating engineered strains bacteria contain antibioticresistance gene selected antibiotic added agar bacterial cells containing gene insert conferring resistance able grow allows researcher select colonies successfully transformed miniaturised version agar plates implemented dipstick formats eg dip slide digital dipstick show potential used pointofcare diagnosis purposes advantages agar plates since cost effective operation require expertise laboratory environment enable used pointofcare stab cultures similar agar plates formed solid agar test tube bacteria introduced via inoculation needle pipette tip stabbed center agar bacteria grow punctured stab cultures commonly used shortterm storage shipment cultures microbial culture collections focus acquisition authentication production preservation catalogueing distribution viable cultures standard reference microorganisms cell lines materials research microbial culture collection also repositories type strains solid plate cultures thermophilic microorganisms bacillus acidocaldarius bacillus stearothermophilus thermus aquaticus thermus thermophilus etc growing temperatures degrees c low acyl clarified gellan gum proven preferred gelling agent comparing agar counting isolation thermophilic virus phage cultures require host cells virus phage multiply bacteriophages cultures grown infecting bacterial cells phage isolated resulting plaques lawn bacteria plate viral cultures obtained appropriate eukaryotic host cells streak plate method way physically separate microbial
