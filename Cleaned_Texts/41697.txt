resection craniotomy remains standard treating astroblastoma despite high recurrence rate highgrade since cases reported around world year standard surgery varies physician physician often difficult rightfully diagnose lowgrade astroblastomas exhibit low recurrence rates following resection varying reports prove patients despite severity lesion unpredictably witness recent study male lowgrade astroblastoma resected recurred within months therapy forcing oncologist administer chemotherapy radiotherapy second resection completely put tumor radiation therapy selectively kills astroblastoma cells leaving surrounding normal brain tissue unharmed use radiation therapy astroblastoma excision variable conventional external beam radiation positive negative effects patients recommended point treat radiosensitivity astroblastoma therapy remains unclear since research advocate effectiveness others diminish effects future studies must done patients total excision subexcision tumor accurately

unfavorable prognosis exists patients highgrade anaplastic astroblastoma tend recur almost indefinitely forcing patient invest invasive surgeries contrast favorable prognosis exists patients welldifferentiated lowgrade astroblastoma since patients usually never require strict blackandwhite diagnosis astroblastoma based grade determine tumor behaviors used benchmark patients varying

simply directed towards therapeutic techniques children continue lead productive healthy lives lowgrade astroblastoma treated surviving symptoms highgrade astroblastoma lifethreatening significant portion patients die due repeated recurrence tumors continue grow spread unlike conventional lowgrade tumors highgrade tumors associate plethora factors metastasize areas body therefore complications frequently occur surgery performed since oncologist efficiently control tumor suitable cases literature confirm highgrade patients face five six resection surgeries still experience symptoms dualaction chemotherapy radiotherapy slow recurrence gross total resection performed multiple times guarantee tumor ever remission onsiderations specialized astroblastoma therapies mentioned current literaturecitation needed astroblastoma predominantly affects children young adults also susceptible tumor although tumor widely considered pediatric disease elderly patients documented throughout age
