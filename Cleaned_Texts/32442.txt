paraburnetia extinct genus biarmosuchian therapsids late permian south africa known species p sneeubergensis belongs family paraburnetia lived mass extinction event etymology paraburnetia sneeubergensis comes para meaning beside near burnetia indicating first named member clade sneeubergensis location sneeuberge mountains specimen p sneeubergensis known knobby shared synapomorphy b p synapsids clade therapsids derived descending one first therapsids biarmosuchus paraburnetia evolved prominent canine teeth long zygomatic process extends orbit shorter phalanges fewer joints lizardlike small medium sized burnetiamorphs distinguished basal forms biarmosuchians developing bumpy knobs skulls specifically towards posterior skull paraburnetia first discovered team south african museum working southern karoo basin july specimen separated two large portions first originally identified due knob synapsid skull snout found downstream lower beaufort group fitting two portions created complete skull burnetiid therapsid previous burnetiids found burnetia mirabilis south africa proburnetia viatkensis russia historically burnetiamorphs difficult place due sharing characteristics dinocephalians recently series taxa added group systematics become better codified burnetiamorpha currently encompasses six genera bullacephalus burnetia lemurosaurus lobalopex niuksenitia paraburnetia diagnosed characteristics superior temporal bulbous vertical horn upper orbital boss defined apical crest elongated palatinepterygoid paraburnetia proburnetia share features indicating sistertaxon relationship including presence welldeveloped median nasal crest tall superior orbital bosses distinctive characteristics characterize burnetiamorph triangular supraorbital bosses ridgelike nasal frontal crests bosses suborbital bar swollen knob squamosal lateral quadrate small incisors thickened rim along posterior margin dorsal view size skull similar bullacephalus burnetia proburnetia slightly smaller skull size lemurosaurus skull roof triangular dorsal view width skull roof narrower specimens skull measures length additionally skull appears higher skull burnetia lobalopexdue due level preservation lacking dorsalventral shared many basal therapsids eg dinocephalians anomodonts maxilla paraburnetia contacts paraburnetia maxilla stretches posteriorly extends meet different situation reported proburnetia sister taxa maxilla considered extend far four postcaniniforms left maxilla five postcaniniforms right differs seven postcaniniforms probernetia premaxilla make tip snout relatively short five small additionally nasal dorsal surface thickened median similarly present proburnetia burnetiamorphs except lemurosaurus possess median nasal dorsal view frontal crest prominent paraburnetia flattens broadens reaches interorbital squamosal appears thickened along posterior border supraorbital boss shape varies among basal forms lemurosaurus lobalopex primitive condition single supraorbital paraburnetia proburnetia whereas bullacephalus burnetia show derived variation supraorbital boss comprises two separate swellings valley paraburnetia lack prominent anterior dorsal orbital depression fossa seen bullacephalus burnetia prominent knobs supratemporal created primarily squamosal unique among burnetiamorphs supratemporal knob extends parietal foramen thickened crease large swelling notable distinct characteristic palate elongated palatine part palatinepterygoidis relative bullacephalus pterygoid palatine flare combined wide contrast narrow flare shown burnetia shared burnetia labalopex proburnetia paraburnetia lack teeth pterygoid expanded lateral view lower jaw long dentary provides lateral near coronoid dorsal rim swells thickens four large incisiform teeth present either side lower jaw additional small one present adjacent small incisiform much shorter rest appears replacement tooth yet fully coronoid element flat triangular element differs biarmosuchians coronoid element paraburnetia large reflected angular ridge structure lemurosaurus burnetiamorph biostratigraphic overlap beaufort group south africa extremely single event overlap discovery lemurosaurus paraburnetia beaufort group mudrock thick layers multicolored siltstone floodplains connected although beaufort group semidesert hypothesized forests historically cold since near arctic time beaufort group known dicynodontia fossils many cooccurrences burnetiamorphs found near cooccurrence two burnetiamorphs appeared cistecephalus assemblage andrew geddes bain first discover fossil reptiles beaufort beaufort group become famous permian triassic fossils found since subdivided subzones based third zone six zones suggested broom cistecephalus assemblage biarmosuchian fossils rare thirty specimens currently fossils found cistecephalus az four due lack stratigraphic cooccurrence burnetiamorphs likely wide distribution evidence wide distribution supported findings collecting areas russia south despite burnetiid species occurrences rare discovered different zones family speciesrich one specimen per genus suggesting high rates speciation paraburnetia belongs clade burnetiidae subdivision greater clade biarmosuchian biarmosuchians typically considered basal major lineage biarmosuchia consists paraphyletic series basal biarmosuchians fairly typical early therapsids derived clade burnetiamorpha characterized skulls ornamented horns close morphological similarity paraburnetia proburnetia indicates faunal interaction

paraburnetia leucocephalus lende due retrieving skull paraburnetia specimen burnetiidae little information entire body morphology however knowledge carnivorous traits widespread dispersal burnetiidae occurrences follows pattern carnivore species decrease density near edge ranges result environment resources able support therefore burnetiamorphs populations given area inevitably lower herbivores
