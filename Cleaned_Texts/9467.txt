relational dialectics interpersonal communication theory close personal ties relationships highlights tensions struggles interplay contrary theory proposed respectively leslie barbara defines communication patterns relationship partners result endemic dialectical tensions dialectics described tensions individual feels experiencing paradoxical desires need want theory contains four assumptions one relationships one dimensional rather consist highs lows without moving one second assumption claims change key element relational life words lives change relationships change third assumption contradictions tensions opposites never go away never cease provide tension means always experience feelings pressure come contradictory desires fourth assumption communication essential comes working opposing feelings relationships made dialogue complicated dialogue similarities differences necessary relational communication theories allow opposing views forces come together reasonable making decisions desires viewpoints often contradict one another mentioned lead dialectical leslie baxter barbara montgomery exemplify contradictory statements arise individuals experience dialectal tensions using common proverbs opposites attract birds feather flock together well twos company threes crowd mean opposing tensions fundamentally troublesome relationship contrary simply bring forward discussion connection two relational dialectic elaboration mikhail bakhtins idea life open monologue humans experience collisions opposing desires needs within relational baxter includes list dialectical tensions reminds us relationships constantly changing successful satisfying relationships require constant attention although baxters description relational dialectics thorough exact allinclusive since experience different tensions different ways relational dialectics emotional valuebased version philosophical dialectic rooted dynamism yin yang like classic yin yang balance emotional values relationship constantly motion value pushed extreme contains seed western world ideas yin yang link back greek philosopher heraclitus argued world constant flux like fire creative destructive forces sides every process mikhail bakhtin russian scholar known work dialogism applied marxist dialectic literary rhetorical theory criticism illustrated tensions exists deep structure human example identified tension exists unity difference bakhtin conceived human dialectic two forces analogous physical forces centripetal emotional forces tending towards unity centrifugal emotional forces tending towards divergence like yin yang bakhtins forces ultimate baxter took deep structural analysis bakhtin applied communication theory found set axes dynamic tension later authors added three main approaches relational dialectics monologic dualistic dialectic first approach monologic approach frames contradictions eitheror demonstrating contradictions mutually exclusive opposite example individual either like hot cold weather may like mix weather conditions monologic approach means move closer one concept move away second approach dualistic approach frames contradictions two separate entities showing unrelated nature studying relationship one individual relationship evaluated exclusive interaction partner example dualistic approach third approach dialectic approach contends multiple points view play one another every contradiction two people relationship one desire open relationship exposing certain parts life person time individual also sense selfprotection may want share everything partner feelings exist within individual time four main concepts form backdrop relational dialectics well four major assumptions relational dialectics assumes relationships linear relational life characterized change contradiction fundamental fact relational life communication central organizing negotiating relational four core concepts relational dialectics include contradiction totality process praxis contradictions core concept relational dialectics dynamic interplay unified oppositions contradiction formed whenever two tendencies forces interdependent unity yet mutually negate one another example relationship one simultaneously desire intimacy distance totality suggests contradictions relationship part unified whole understood isolation words dialectics separated intrinsically related example tension dependence interdependence separated tension openness privacy work condition define process relational dialectics must understood terms social processes movement activity change functional properties example instances individual fluctuating disclosure secretiveness addition individual may move periods honest open communication miller praxis philosophical term concept practical behavior sometimes experience practicing praxis dialectic tensions created recreated active participation interaction words practical experience relationship exposes one imposition needs values another relationship endures ones needs values become apparent praxis focuses practical choices individuals make midst opposing needs values dialectical tensions

dialectics includes idea contextual dialectics rather idea every relationship exists within specific place within specific culture also see raise public privatereal ideal dialectics interplay seen television public life versus experienced private lives examples concept include viewing politicians well viewed television shows according west turner tension real ideal dialectic featured think television shows like leave beaver receive idealized message family life like look families live contend troublesome realities family life tension two images forms according original relational dialectic model many core tensions opposing values autonomy connectedness favoritism impartiality openness closedness novelty predictability instrumentality affection finally equality inequality autonomy connectedness refers desire ties connections others versus need separate oneself unique individual example autonomy connectedness would athlete wants feel like heshe part team also wanting highlight hisher individual talents favoritism impartiality refers desire treated fairly impartially versus desire seen known special instance professor may want impartial creating attendance policy makes exceptions students participate class good grades demonstrating favoritism openness closedness refers desire open divulge information versus desire exclusive private chatting boss ones weekend desire open however closedness also play certain details often left context novelty predictability suggest desire relationship predictable versus desire original new creating scheduled meetings board members predictability may lie fixed schedule however novelty may scheduling varying number locations peak interests well inspiration instrumentality affection desire affection genuine versus desire affection motivated benefits perceived advantages relationship example would romantic relationship based love affection maintaining benefits financial security finally equality inequality refers desire considered equals versus desire develop levels superiority female military may seek treatment equivalent received male colleagues requires special barracks adjusted according theory us may

interaction suggest approach researching communication competence among people autism spectrum disorders applying relational dialects theory studying interactions autistic individuals starts approaching autistic individual actor interaction deeming competence result interaction delve social contexts expectations roles contribute autistics competent communication investigation dialects includes integrationseparation expressionprivacy stabilitychange enhance understanding communication people autism spectrum disorders dialogue typically conversation two people conversations constitute relationships communication foundation relationship according cools four important concepts form foundation dialogism self situated contradictory forces unfinalizability chronotope carnivalesque heteroglossia similarity dialogue following components important constitutive dialogue utterance chains dialectical flux aesthetic moment critical sensibility constitutive dialogue theorists along baxter may argue communication simply feature relationship examining constitutive dialogue suggests communication actually creates maintains relationship instead according baxter constitutive approach communication asks communication defines constructs social world including selves personal relationships constitutive perspective persons relationships analytically separable communication instead communication constitutes initial researchers studied relationships found similarities backgrounds interests usually hold people together selfdisclosure root components dialogic researchers would argue differences important similarities discovered utterance chains understand utterance chains must know utterance person says one turn conversation utterances linked competing discourses considered utterance chains baxter believes four links chain struggle competing discourses cultural ideologies relational history nonyet spoken response partner utterance normative evaluation third party utterance baxter also suggest understand utterance must also understand discourse posits broadest sense discourse cultural system meaning circulates among groups members makes talk sensical example united states discourse individualism helps us understand value utterance need find first commit serious relationship another dialectical flux dialectical flux unpredictable unfinalizable indeterminate nature personal relationships complicated intertwined dialectical tensions spiraling inversion segmentation two strategies baxter montgomery established respond complexity spiraling inversion generally nowin situation struggle two different thought processes example something parents approve could lie parents might yell lying hand could tell upfront could completely quiet shock segmentation pertaining one role relationship must altered depending situation example working fathers shop parttime job would considered father boss could mean different expectations different circumstances attitude towards might change roles aesthetic moment aesthetic moments brief incidents relationship bring participants together use dialogue temporary feeling wholeness felt partners involved dialogue easy see examples aesthetic moments romantic relationships first kiss reciting wedding vows moments experienced anyone critical sensibility according griffin critical sensibility obligation critique dominant voices especially suppress opposing viewpoints responsibility advocate means sides dialogue equal one another one person powerful dominant able communicate without imbalances interfering mean dialogue free competing discourses listed utterance chains communicating must understand morals apply people sometimes lying entirely minor communication oftentimes lying majorly affect perspective lied several times people would justify white lie lie causes harm instance mother hospital could tell still looked beautiful even appearance far would make feel better actions followed based whether positive negative outcome called consequential according sissela bok lies drag around initial negative weight must factored ethical equations bok believes principle veracity says truthful statements preferable lies absence special circumstances overcome negative ethics plays major role study interpersonal communication particularly relational dialectics area contradictions seem like norm even important share truth incorporating varying oftentimes opposite view points critical communication grounded human nature forces according theorist leslie baxter three major limitations work relational dialectics baxter claims work distanced naturally occurring talk relating parties claims theory needs firmer empirical base applied talk relating parties naturally occurring talk relating parties could qualitative work utilizing observation method relating parties small groups nonparticipative participative observation would appropriate continued study relational dialectics theory baxter also believes future work needs include multiple voices instead focusing popular research dialectics two voices baxter posits relational dialectics opposite infers binary opposites many discourses competing lastly baxter shares future research focus discourse time studying dialogue transforms longer period time latter would take significant time would studies
