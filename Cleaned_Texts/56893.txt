tendandbefriend behavior exhibited animals including humans response threat refers protection offspring tending seeking social group mutual defense befriending evolutionary psychology tendandbefriend theorized evolved typical female response stress tendandbefriend theoretical model originally developed shelley e taylor research team university california los angeles first described psychological review article published year according polyvagal theory developed dr stephen porges social nervous system affiliative neurocircuitry prompts affiliation particularly response system described regulating social approach behavior biological basis regulation appears oxytocin tied broad array social relationships activities including peer bonding sexual activity affiliative oxytocin released humans response broad array stressors especially may trigger affiliative needs oxytocin promotes affiliative behavior including maternal tending social contact thus affiliation stress serves tending needs including protective responses towards offspring affiliation may also take form befriending namely seeking social contact ones protection protection offspring protection social group social responses threat reduce biological stress responses including lowering heart rate blood pressure hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis hpa stress activity cortisol women likely respond stress tending befriending mencitation needed paralleling behavioral sex difference estrogen enhances effects oxytocin whereas androgens inhibit oxytocin female stress responses increased offspring survival would led higher fitness thus likely passed natural presence threats protecting calming offspring blending environment may increased chances survival mother child faced stress females often respond tending offspring turn reduces stress levels studies conducted repetti show mothers respond highly stressful workdays providing nurturing behaviors towards contrast fathers experienced stressful workdays likely withdraw families interpersonally conflictual evening home furthermore physical contact mothers offspring following threatening event decreased hpa activity sympathetic nervous system oxytocin

benefits including protection predators cooperation achieve shared goals access resources women create maintain use social friendships manage stressful threatening situations group members source support protection women children research shows women likely seek company others times stress compared women adolescent girls report sources social support likely turn samesex peers support men boys crossculturally women girls tend provide frequent effective support men likely seek help support female friends family women tend affiliate women stressful situations however women given choice either wait alone affiliate unfamiliar man stressful laboratory challenge chose wait femalefemale social networks provide assistance childcare exchange resources protection predators threats group members smuts taylor et al argue female social groups also provide protection male human animal studies reviewed taylor et al suggest oxytocin neuroendocrine mechanism underlying female befriend stress oxytocin administration rats prairie voles increased social contact social grooming behaviors reduced stress lowered aggression humans oxytocin promotes motherinfant attachments romantic pair bonds friendships social contact support stressful times leads lowered sympathetic neuroendocrine stress responses although social support downregulates physiological stress responses men women women likely seek social contact stress furthermore support another female provides enhanced stressreducing benefits however review female aggression noted fact ot oxytocin enhances rather diminishes attention potential threat environment casts doubt popular tendandbefriend hypothesis based presumed anxiolytic effect according taylor affiliative behaviors tending activities reduce biological stress responses parents offspring thereby reducing stressrelated health befriending may lead substantial mental physical health benefits times stress social isolation associated significantly enhanced risk mortality whereas social support tied positive health outcomes including reduced risk illness women higher life expectancies birth countries equal access medical united states example difference almost years one hypothesis mens responses stress include aggression social withdrawal substance abuse place risk adverse healthrelated contrast womens responses stress include turning social sources support may protective health group living affiliation multiple unrelated others sex share genetic interests also presents problem competing access limited resources social status food mates interpersonal stress common distressing type stress although befriending stress response may especially activated women conditions resource resource scarcity also entails intense competition resources environments femalebiased sex ratio males limited resource femaletofemale competition mates intensified sometimes even resorting although male crime rates far exceed females arrests assault among females follow similar age distribution males peaking females late teens midtwentiescitation needed ages females peak reproductive potential experience mating competition however benefits affiliation would outweighed costs order tendandbefriend evolved rates aggression human males females may differ patterns aggression sexes differ although females general less physically aggressive tend engage much even indirect aggression eg social exclusion gossip rumors experimentally primed mating motive status competition motive men willing become directly aggressive towards another man whereas women likely indirectly aggress another woman aggressionprovoking however experimentally priming people resource competition motive increased direct aggression men womencitation needed consistent result rates violence crime higher among males females conditions resource contrast resource competition increase direct aggression either men women asked imagine married young childcitation needed costs physical injury parent would also entail costs family lower variance reproductive success higher costs physical aggression may explain lower rates physical aggression among human females compared females general likely produce offspring lifetimes males therefore less gain fighting risk injury death would produce greater fitness cost females survival young children depended maternal paternal care underscores importance maternal safety survival risk infants primary attachment mother maternal death increased chances childhood mortality foraging societies fivefold compared threefold cases paternal therefore women respond threats tending befriending female aggression often indirect covert nature avoid retaliation physical injury women befriend others protection also form alliances compete outgroup members resources food mates social cultural resources eg status social positions rights responsibilities informational warfare strategic competitive tactics taking form indirect verbal aggression directed towards rivalscitation needed gossip one tactic functioning spread information would damage reputation competitor several theories regarding gossip including social bonding group cohesion however consistent informational warfare theory content gossip relevant context competition occurring example competing work promotion people likely spread negative workrelated information competitor coworkerscitation needed negative gossip also increases resource scarcity higher resource value addition people likely spread negative information potential rivals likely pass positive information family members friends mentioned befriending serve protect women threats including harm people threats limited physical harm also include reputational damage women form friendships alliances part compete limited resources also part protect relational reputational harm presence friends allies help deter malicious gossip due alliances greater ability retaliate compared single individuals ability studies hess hagen show presence competitors friend reduced peoples tendencies gossip effect stronger friend competitive social environment eg workplace friend nonrelevant social environment friends increase womens perceived capabilities inflicting reputational harm rival well perceptions defensive capabilities indirect aggression httpsenwikipediaorgwikitendandbefriend
