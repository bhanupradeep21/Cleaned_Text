bounded rationality idea rationality limited individuals make decisions limitations rational individuals select decision satisfactory rather limitations include difficulty problem requiring decision cognitive capability mind time available make decision decisionmakers view act satisficers seeking satisfactory solution everything moment rather optimal solution therefore humans undertake full costbenefit analysis determine optimal decision rather choose option fulfils adequacy models human behavior social sciences assume humans reasonably approximated described rational entities rational choice theory downs political agency concept bounded rationality complements rationality optimization views decisionmaking fully rational process finding optimal choice given information therefore bounded rationality said address discrepancy assumed perfect rationality human behaviour utilised economics theories reality human short bounded rationality revises notions perfect rationality account fact perfectly rational decisions often feasible practice intractability natural decision problems finite computational resources available making concept bounded rationality continues influence debated different disciplines including political science economics psychology law cognitive bounded rationality coined herbert simon proposed alternative basis mathematical neoclassical economic modelling decisionmaking used economics political science related disciplines many economics models assume agents average rational large quantities approximated act according preferences order

another work states boundedly rational agents experience limits formulating solving complex problems processing receiving storing retrieving transmitting simon used analogy pair scissors one blade represents cognitive limitations actual humans structures environment illustrating minds compensate limited resources exploiting known structural regularity simon describes number dimensions along classical models rationality made somewhat realistic remaining within vein fairly rigorous formalization include simon suggests economic agents use heuristics make decisions rather strict rigid rule optimization complexity situation example behaviour inhibited heuristics seen comparing cognitive strategies utilised simple situations eg tictactoe comparison strategies utilised difficult situations eg chess games defined game theory economics finite games perfect information therefore however within chess mental capacities abilities binding constraint therefore optimal choices thus order test mental limits agents complex problems within chess studied test individuals work around cognitive limits behaviours heuristics used form anchoring adjustment types heuristics give explanation bounded

pressure imperfect information market time organisational context ceo make fully rational decisions adhoc situation cognition overwhelmed lot information tense situation ceo also needs take time process information given due limited time fast decision making needed disregard information determining decision decisionmakers make decisions decide ariel rubinstein proposed model bounded rationality explicitly specifying decisionmaking procedures decisionmakers information also able analyse situation equally thus reach rational rubinstein argues consistency reaching final decision level information must factor decision making procedure puts study decision procedures research agenda gerd gigerenzer stated decision theorists extent adhered simons original ideas rather considered

model bounded rationality also extends bounded humans sometimes willing forsake selfinterests benefits others due incomplete information individuals time something considered earlier economic theory rational inattention extension bounded rationality studied christopher sims found decisions may chosen incomplete information opposed affording cost receive complete information shows decision makers

sometimes needed easier simpler ways reach optimal however approach usually known gaze heuristic explained theory noncomplex decision making bounded rationality implies idea humans take reasoning shortcuts may lead suboptimal decisionmaking behavioural economists engage mapping decision shortcuts agents use order help increase effectiveness human decisionmaking one treatment idea comes cass sunstein richard thalers sunstein thaler recommend choice architectures modified light human agents bounded rationality widely cited proposal sunstein thaler urges healthier food placed sight level order increase likelihood person opt choice instead less healthy option critics nudge argued modifying choice architectures lead people becoming worse furthermore bounded rationality attempts address assumption points discussed within neoclassical economics theory theory assumes complex problem way problem presented alternative choices utility function provided decisionmakers may realistic widely used accepted number decades however economists realised disadvantages exist utilising theory theory consider problems initially discovered decisionmakers could impact overall decision additionally personal values way alternatives discovered created environment surrounding decisionmaking process also considered using alternatively bounded rationality focuses cognitive ability decisionmaker factors may inhibit optimal additionally placing focus organisations rather focusing markets neoclassical economics theory bounded rationality also basis many economics theories eg organisational
