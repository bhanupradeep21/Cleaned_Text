selective glucocorticoid receptor modulators segrms selective glucocorticoid receptor agonists segras formerly known dissociated glucocorticoid receptor agonists digras class experimental drugs designed share many desirable antiinflammatory immunosuppressive anticancer properties classical glucocorticoid drugs fewer side effects skin atrophy although preclinical evidence segrams antiinflammatory effects currently efficacy segrams cancer largely unknown selective glucocorticoid receptor agonists segras historically typically steroidal structure selective glucocorticoid receptor modulators segrms typically nonsteroidal combined abbreviation selective glucocorticoid receptor agonist modulator number ligands developed evaluated preclinical clinical testing segrams achieve selectivity triggering subset glucocorticoid receptor mechanisms synthetic steroids segralike properties already discovered late many potential segrams synthesized nonsteroidal structures vitro studies cellular models segram molecules bind glucocorticoid receptor affinity similar dexamethasone potent glucocorticoid ability repress production inflammatory mediators interleukin prostaglandin moreover vitro particular segram promote apoptosis prostate vivo studies mice rats showed topically administered segram inhibited peroxidase activity formation oedema indicators antiinflammatory activity comparably prednisolone systemic administration mice rats indicate segrams diminish acute infections rheumatoid arthritis asthma vivo evidence whether particular segrams elicit similar effects classic glucocorticoid cancer pathologies currently lacking current preclinical tests show segrams available far would elicit fewer side effect least less grave side effects classic glucocorticoids example skin atrophy rats significantly less pronounced prednisolone study using segram mapracorat metabolic effects like weight gain increase blood glucose practically nonselective glucocorticoids selective glucocorticoid receptor agonists work binding activating glucocorticoid receptor gr contrast glucocorticoids activate gr work least two signal transduction segrams activate gr way operates one two main possible absence glucocorticoids gr resides cytosol inactive state complexed heat shock proteins hsps immunophilins binding glucocorticoids gr activates
