syndrome caused underlying chronic disease however symptoms tend reappear active phase underlying cause eg migraine epilepsy treatment alice wonderland syndrome determined necessary useful focused treating suspected underlying disease treatment underlying conditions mostly involves prescription medications antiepileptics migraine prophylaxis antivirals antibiotics antipsychotics rarely used treating alice wonderland syndrome symptoms due minimal treatment methods revolving around migraine prophylaxis include medications following lowtyramine diet drugs may used prevent migraines include anticonvulsants antidepressants calcium channel blockers beta blockers treatments explored migraines include repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation rtms however research needed establish
