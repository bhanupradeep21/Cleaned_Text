adaption occurs assimilation sensory motor birth age first stage piagets theory infants following basic senses vision hearing motor skills stage knowledge world limited constantly developing due childs experiences according piaget infant reaches months age begin develop called object permanence meaning child ability understand objects keep existing even seen example would hiding childs favorite toy blanket although child physically see still know look blanket preoperational begins time child starts talk around age stage young children begin analyzing environment using mental symbols including words images child begin apply everyday lives come across different objects events however piagets main focus stage reason named preoperational children point able apply specific cognitive operations mental math addition symbolism children start engage pretend play pretending people example teachers superheroes sometimes use different props make pretend play weaknesses stage children years old often display called egocentrism meaning child able see someone elses point view feel every person experiencing events feelings however thought processes children longer egocentric intuitive meaning think way something looks though yet use rational concrete first grade early adolescence stage children age use appropriate logic develop cognitive operations begin applying new way thinking different events children stage incorporate inductive reasoning involves drawing conclusions observations order make unlike preoperational stage children change rearrange mental images symbols form logical thought example reversibility child knows reverse action formal operations around early adolescence midlate adolescence final stage piagets cognitive development defines child ability think rationally systematically abstract concepts hypothetical strengths time child adolescent begins forming identity begins understanding people behave way behave weaknesses include child adolescent developing egocentric thoughts including imaginary audience personal imaginary audience adolescent feels world concerned judgemental anything adolescent adolescent may feel stage everyone critic ones personal fable adolescent feels unique person everything unique feel ones ever experienced experiencing invincible nothing bad happen bad things happen vygotsky russian theorist proposed sociocultural

months tripled year quadrupled growth proceeds slow rate period rapid growth occurs shortly puberty years growth uniform rate timing across parts body birth head size already relatively near adult lower parts body much smaller adult size thus development head grows relatively little torso limbs undergo great deal genetic factors play major role determining growth rate particularly characteristic changes proportions early human development however genetic factors produce maximum growth environmental conditions adequate poor nutrition frequent injury disease reduce individuals
