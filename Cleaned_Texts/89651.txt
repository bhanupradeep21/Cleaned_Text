carolyn widney greider born april american molecular biologist nobel laureate joined university california santa cruz distinguished professor department molecular cell developmental october greider discovered enzyme telomerase graduate student elizabeth blackburn university california berkeley greider pioneered research structure telomeres ends chromosomes awarded nobel prize physiology medicine along blackburn jack w szostak discovery telomeres protected progressive shortening enzyme greider born san diego father kenneth greider physics family moved san diego davis california spent many early years graduated davis senior high school graduated college creative studies university california santa barbara ba biology time also studied university g√∂ttingen made significant discoveries greider dyslexic states compensatory skills also played role success scientist one intuit many different things going time apply particular greider initially suspected dyslexia seeing patterns common mistakes backward words received back graded work first greider started memorize words spellings rather attempting sound spelling greider worked significantly overcome dyslexia become successful professional life credits dyslexia helping appreciate differences making unusual decisions one work tetrahymena unusual greider initially difficulty getting graduate school low gre scores result dyslexia greider applied thirteen grad schools accepted two california institute technology university california chose berkeley would able work elizabeth blackburn two would make telomerase greider completed phd molecular biology berkeley elizabeth blackburn berkeley greider blackburn discovered chromosomes protected telomeres enzyme greider joined blackburns laboratory april looking enzyme hypothesized add extra dna bases ends chromosomes without extra bases added repeats sixbase pair motif chromosomes shortened dna replication eventually resulting chromosome deterioration senescence cancercausing chromosome fusion blackburn greider looked enzyme model organism tetrahymena thermophila freshwater protozoan large number december greider first obtained results indicating particular enzyme likely responsible six months additional research greider blackburn concluded enzyme responsible telomere addition published findings journal cell december enzyme originally called telomere terminal transferase known telomerase telomerase rebuilds tips chromosomes determines life span greiders additional research confirm discovery largely focused identifying mechanism telomerase uses greider chose use rna degrading enzymes saw telomeres stopped extending indication rna involved greider started laboratory cold spring harbor laboratory fellow also held faculty position cold spring harbor laboratory long island new york greider continued study tetrahymena telomerase cloning gene encoding rna component demonstrating provided template ttgggg telomere repeats well establishing telomerase processive also able reconstitute tetrahymena telomerase vitro define mechanisms template utilization greider also worked calvin harley show telomere shortening underlies cellular senescence test idea mouse human telomerase characterized mouse telomerase rna component cloned time greider collaboration ronald depinho produced first telomerase knockout showing although telomerase dispensable life increasingly short telomeres result various deleterious phenotypes colloquially referred premature greider recruited michael west founder biotechnology company geron ceo agex therapeutics join companys scientific advisory remained board greider accepted faculty position johns hopkins university school medicine greider continued study telomerase deficient mice saw sixth generation mice become entirely mated control mice telomerase deficient mice able regenerate greider continued work telomerase biochemistry defining secondary structure template boundary vertebrate telomerase rna well analyzing pseudoknot structure human telomerase rna addition working tetrahymena mammalian systems greider also studied telomeres telomerase yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae characterizing recombinationbased gene conversion mechanism yeast cells null telomerase use maintain telomeres greider also showed short telomeres elicit dna damage response yeast greider blackburn szostak shared albert lasker award basic medical research work jointly receiving nobel prize february greider named bloomberg distinguished professor johns hopkins greider served director professor department molecular biology genetics johns hopkins greider first promoted daniel nathans professor department molecular biology genetics professor molecular cellular developmental biology ucsccitation needed greiders lab employs student postdoctoral examine relationships biology telomeres connection greiders lab uses variety tools including yeast mice biochemistry look progressive telomere greiders lab also researching tumor reformation controlled presence short labs future work focus identifying processing regulation telomeres telomere greider married nathaniel c comfort
