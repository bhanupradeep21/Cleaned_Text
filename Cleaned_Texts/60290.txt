thoracic outlet syndrome tos condition compression nerves arteries veins superior thoracic aperture passageway lower neck armpit also known thoracic three main types neurogenic venous neurogenic type common presents pain weakness paraesthesia occasionally loss muscle base venous type results swelling pain possibly bluish coloration arterial type results pain coldness pallor tos may result trauma repetitive arm movements tumors pregnancy anatomical variations cervical diagnosis may supported nerve conduction studies medical tos difficult diagnose many potential differential diagnoses well diseases often cooccurrent initial treatment neurogenic type exercises strengthen chest muscles improve nsaids naproxen may used surgery typically done arterial venous types neurogenic type improve blood thinners may used treat prevent blood condition affects common women men occurs commonly years condition first described current term thoracic outlet syndrome first used tos affects mainly upper limbs signs symptoms manifesting shoulders neck arms hands pain present intermittent permanent basis sharpstabbing burning aching tos involve part hand pinky adjacent half ring finger hand inner aspect forearm upper arm pain also side neck pectoral area clavicle armpitaxillary area upper back ie trapezius rhomboid area discoloration hands one hand colder hand weakness hand arm muscles tingling commonly presentcitation needed people carpal tunnel syndrome concomitant repetitive motions cause enlargement muscles causes compression veins besides overuse injury upper limbs causes swellings small bleeding subsequent fibrosis would cause thrombosis subclavian vein leading disease effortinduced tos related cerebrovascular arterial insufficiency affecting subclavian also affect vertebral artery case could produce vision disturbances including transient embolic cerebral tos also lead eye problems vision loss circumstance vertebral artery compression although rare compression brain stem also involved individual presentation tos transient blindness may occur head held certain left untreated tos lead neurological deficits result hypoperfusion hypometabolism certain areas brain tos similar symptoms pectoralis minor syndrome pms usually results compression braxial plexus beneath pectoralis minor muscle neurogenic tos caused compression nerves unlike tos typically headaches neck pain patients pms instead pain chest initially believed percent patients tos nerve compression scalene area twentyfirst century recognized majority nerve compression pectoralis minor either addition scalene one study patients diagnosed neurogenic tos found percent neurogenic pms percent fact pms without tos attributed one following adsons sign costoclavicular maneuver lack specificity sensitivity make small part mandatory comprehensive history physical examination undertaken patient suspected tos currently single clinical sign makes diagnosis tos degree certaintycitation needed additional maneuvers may abnormal tos include wrights test involves hyperabducting arms head extension evaluating loss radial pulses signs blanching skin hands indicating decrease blood flow maneuver compression test also used exerting pressure clavicle medial humeral head causes radiation pain andor numbness affected doppler arteriography probes fingertips arms tests force smoothness blood flow radial arteries without patient perform various arm maneuvers causes compression subclavian artery thoracic outlet movements elicit symptoms pain numbness produce graphs diminished arterial blood flow fingertips providing strong evidence impingement subclavian artery thoracic doppler arteriography utilize probes fingertips arms case likely confused plethysmography different method utilizes ultrasound without direct visualization affected vessels doppler ultrasound really arteriography would used radial artery order make diagnosis tos finally even doppler study appropriate artery positive would diagnose neurogenic tos far common subtype tos plenty evidence medical literaturecitation needed show arterial compression equate brachial plexus compression although may occur together varying degrees additionally arterial compression make diagnosis arterial tos rarest form tos lesser degrees arterial compression shown normal individuals various arm positions thought little significance without criteria arterial toscitation neededclarification needed mri scan show anatomy thoracic outlet soft tissues causing compression show directly brachial plexus three main types tos named according cause symptoms however three classifications coming disfavor tos involve three types compression various degrees compression occur three anatomical structures arteries veins nerves isolated commonly two three structures compressed greater lesser degrees addition compressive forces different magnitude affected structure therefore symptoms many causes tos frequent cause trauma either sudden clavicle fracture caused car accident repetitive legal secretary works hisher hands wrists arms fastpaced desk station nonergonomic posture many yearscitation needed tos also found certain occupations involving much lifting arms repetitive use wrists armscitation needed one cause arterial compression trauma recent case involving fracture clavicle two groups people likely develop tos neck injuries due traffic accidents use computers nonergonomic postures extended periods timecitation needed tos frequently repetitive stress injury rsi caused certain types work environmentscitation needed also possible classify tos location obstructioncitation needed people born extra incomplete small rib first rib protrudes superior thoracic outlet space rudimentary rib causes fibrous changes around brachial plexus nerves inducing compression causing symptoms signs tos called cervical rib attachment seventh cervical vertebra surgical removal almost always recommended symptoms tos first appear early teen years child becoming athletic evidence treatment thoracic outlet syndrome stretching occupational physical therapy common noninvasive approaches used treatment tos goal stretching relieve compression thoracic cavity reduce blood vessel nerve impingement realign bones muscles ligaments tendons causing problemcitation needed tos rapidly aggravated poor

need removed scalenectomy allows increased blood flow reduction nerve cases may rudimentary rib cervical rib causing compression removed using techniquecitation needed physical therapy often used operation improve recovery time outcomes potential complications include pneumothorax infection loss sensation motor problems subclavian vessel damage surgeries small risk permanent serious injury deathcitation needed several major league baseball players especially pitchers diagnosed thoracic outlet syndrome including stephen strasburg chris archer matt chris jaime shaun matt clayton nate noah starting pitcher chris young previously struggled shoulder problems underwent surgery tos felt completely different young exceeded expectations return major leagues age becoming valuable member seattle mariners starting july houston astros starting pitcher jr richard collapsed playing game catch found experienced stroke due severe blockage right carotid artery given fact shortly beforehand
