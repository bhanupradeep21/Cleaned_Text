action bias psychological phenomenon people tend favor action inaction even indication would point towards better result automatic response similar reflex impulse based rational thinking one first appearances term action bias scientific journals paper patt zechenhauser titled action bias environmental decisions relevance politics people tend preference welljustified actions term action bias refers subset voluntary actions one takes even explicitly good reason case decision positive negative outcomes action taken favor achieving apparent advantageous final result preferred inactivity besides gains losses occur resources redistributed adversely neglected decisionmaking opposite effect omission multiple different theories people prefer action inaction suggested humans might naturally aspire act since perceived beneficial even though occasionally worsen outcome inaction may perceived inferior alternative action view explained evolutionary perspective since early action proved adaptive terms survival becoming reinforced behavioral pattern even though living circumstances people changed beyond need prefer action inaction ensure survival bias persists modern society actions cause visible positive outcomes omissions actions link becomes general tendency reward action punish shown operant conditioning rewards efficient increasing display behavior punishments decreasing likelihood display behavior results humans choosing action rather inaction engaging action also serve means signalling emphasizing ones productivity others rewarded societal praise positive results originating inactivity action also provides doer impression control situation creates feeling personal contrast inaction readily linked feelings regret face lack praise even possible punishments outcome associated action inaction also affects future decisions since link inevitably immediately reinforced punished time behavior carried neutral outcome contribute another reason existence bias might people develop decision heuristic taking action transfer inappropriate context resulting action politics action bias manifested politicians taking action issues global warming wishing appear make statements actually actions offer relatively ineffective proposals implementations actions promises future actions taken primarily bring impactful change rather showcase one working symbolic power external image action far powerful true benefit field medicine action bias occur diagnosis subsequent treatment among things problem caused specific diagnostic criteria patient meet enough criteria happens meet exactly enough criteria premature diagnosis misdiagnosis may leads patient receiving satisfactory needed treatment one way counteract action bias use broader range tests get second opinion colleagues technical experts relevant fields making final medical decisionmaking predisposition professionals interfere even interfering would better option action bias takes name intervention bias existence proven many studies medical action bias occurs among patients well equally presented physician options either taking medicine resting patients greatly prefer taking medicine preference prevails even patients warned medicine could cause certain side effects explicitly told would effect taking causes intervention bias medicine likely interplay two biases researched humans selfinterest bias confirmation another reason intervention bias found fear malpractice cases possible charges selfinterest bias occurs person shows selfserving behaviors justifies favor interests medical intervention partly guided financial selfinterest practitioners healthcare industry industrysponsored studies analyses lead conflicts interest biased interpretations results specialists make questionable decisions defend already biased doctors seem satisfied greater involvement patients treatment means amount intervention closely linked career happiness personal confirmation bias influences human decision making sources confirm ones preexisting hypotheses incorporated readily preferably challenging ideas studies assessments justify promote medical intervention given emphasis data contradicts reviewers assumptions either ignored experience evaluation viewed reliable due action bias medical intervention becomes less objective physicians primary focus longer best possible therapy patient possible therapies may implemented without proper tailored consequences include incorrect biased medical advice additionally physical harm patient collapse health care although physicians also choice wait see symptoms subside intensify perform followup check would temporary inaction instead common perform direct testing prescription according psychologists goalkeeper shows action bias percent penalty kicks soccer diving either left right theorists assert effective stand still wait see direction ball kicked moving guessing wrong almost

penalty takers counter strategy rolling chipping ball middle called panenka penalty czech player made famous uefa euro final action bias also influenced previous outcomes team loses match coach likely choose action changing players inaction even though might necessarily lead better expressed one coach something mean activity relevant action bias also influences decisionmaking field economics management situations economic downfall central banks governments experience pressure take action feel increased scrutiny public expected fix situation action seen appropriate inaction even outcome successful taking action public figures avoid criticism cases good economic performance authorities inclined towards omission bias wish accused making wrong choices might destroy current actionomission bias seen similar scenarios investors changing portfolio switching companys strategy applying different job moving different city macroeconomic level actionomission bias comes play discussing changes politicsrelated variables interest rates tax rates various types effect action bias environmental policy decisions investigated anthony patt richard zeckhauser argued action bias likely lead nonrational decisionmaking domain due uncertainty delayed effect actions contributions coming many parties effective markets unclear objectives strong study concluded value decision influenced ones perceived involvement individual susceptibility action bias well framing context leading occurrence action bias environmental utilitybased action bias type action bias underlies purposive behavior works comparing advantages possible effects different actions result selects action lead outcome highest utility value values different options predicted compared action chance reward advantages bias include finding beneficial option available environment main disadvantage subject needs test environment trial error order identify utility value unfamiliar new environment person often choose action proven advantageous previous situation suitable current scenario utility value action decreases person opt different action even though changing strategy might entirely utilitybased action bias opposite goalbased action selection aims completing goal without taking consideration utility value actions performed unlike utilitybased action bias possible actions compared action leads goal found options disregarded making less timeconsuming term singleaction bias coined elke u weber took notice farmers reactions climate change decisionmakers tend take one action lower risk concerned much less likely take additional steps would provide risk reduction single action taken always effective one although reason phenomenon yet fully confirmed presumably first action suffices reducing feeling worry action often example weber found farmers early started worry consequences global warming either changed something production practice pricing lobbied government interventions generally engage one actions shows undertaking single action possibly fulfills ones need something could prevent end singleaction bias improves persons selfimage eliminates cognitive dissonance giving false impression contributing greater another example singleaction bias house owners live coastal regions likely flooded due sea level rise slr take small actions piling resources making sandbags case flooding bigger actions taking flood insurance elevating homes moving region less risk flooding first smaller action take making sandbags takes away anxiety possible flooding thereby makes less likely take actions might better outcome long run moving another option eliminate singleaction bias group discussions people suggest different ideas find solution would give individual alternatives solve awareness action bias help carefully think consequences inaction versus action certain situation leads process impulsive includes logical thinking facilitates choosing efficient outcome inaction situations enhance patience new contexts encourage making thoughtful decisions checking overview possibilities also medical contexts full disclosure effects action especially negative side effects medication inaction treatment lead lower effect action bias percentage people choosing medication goes even lower doctor actively discourages use
