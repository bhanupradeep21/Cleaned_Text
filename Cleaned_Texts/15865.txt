consumer neuroscience combination consumer research modern neuroscience goal field find neural explanations consumer behaviors individuals without disease consumer research existed century well established combination sociology psychology anthropology popular topics field revolve around consumer decisionmaking advertising branding decades however consumer researchers never able directly record internal mental processes govern consumer behavior always limited designing experiments alter external conditions order view ways changing variables may affect consumer behavior examples include changing packaging changing subject mood integration neuroscience consumer research possible go directly brain discover neural explanations consumer behavior ability record brain activity electrodes advances neural imaging technology make possible determine specific regions brain responsible critical behaviors involved consumer neuroscience similar neuroeconomics neuromarketing subtle yet distinct differences exist neuroeconomics academic field neuromarketing consumer neuroscience applied science neuromarketing focuses study various marketing techniques attempts integrate neuroscience knowledge help improve efficiency effectiveness said marketing strategies consumer neuroscience unique among three main focus consumer various factors affect individual preferences purchasing behavior studies emotion crucial advertising research shown emotion plays significant role ad classically advertising research theory emotion ratio represented different regions neuroscience may able disprove theory showing ventromedial prefrontal cortex striatum play role bilateral emotion attractiveness advertisements correlates specific changes brain activity various brain regions including medial prefrontal cortex posterior cingulate nucleus accumbens higherorder visual may represent interaction perceived attractiveness ad consumer emotions expressed people pictured suggested ads use people positive emotions perceived attractive ads using exclusively text depicting people neutral expressions may generally viewed unattractive ads activate anterior insula plays role processing negative attractive unattractive ads shown memorable ads described ambiguously research needed determine translates overall brand perception eyes consumer may impact future purchasing various studies conducted research question consumers process store information presented advertisements television commercials scene durations lasting longer seconds shown memorable one week later scenes last less seconds scenes produce quickest electrical response left frontal hemisphere shown memorable well suggested transfer visual advertising inputs short term memory long term memory may take place left hemisphere highly memorable ads created producing fastest responses left however theories renounced believe research findings may attributed extraneous unmeasured also evidence suggest front back difference processing speed may influential ad memorization left right research shown certain periods commercials far significant consumer terms establishing advertising effects short segments referred branding moments thought engaging parts commercial moments identified using eeg analyzing alpha waves hz beta waves hz theta waves results may suggest strength commercial regard effect consumer evaluated strength unique branding moments helping brands create engaging effective ar campaigns addition research also found consequence curiosity terms advertising unsatisfied curiosity lead indulgent consumption domain affective advertising using comedy drama suspense etc activates amygdala orbitofrontal cortices brainstem whereas cognitive advertising strict facts mainly activates posterior parietal cortex superior prefrontal ambler burne created memoryaffectcognition mac theory explain processes involved decision making according theory majority decisions habitual require affect cognition require memory remaining decisions require memory affect require main use cognition form rationalization following particular action however occasional instances memory affect cognition used conjunction debate particular findings suggest correlation exists ad memorization degree affective content within advertisement still unclear translates brand much consumer research devoted studying effect brand associations consumer preferences manifest brand memories brand memories defined everything exists minds customers respect brand eg thoughts feelings experiences images perceptions beliefs attitudes several studies indicated designated area brain devoted brand studies shown different areas brain activated exposed brand opposed person decisions regarding evaluation brands different product categories activate area brain responsible semantic object processing rather areas involved judgment two findings suggest brands processed brain manner human personalities indicating personality theory used explain brand study fmri scans loyal less loyal customers found case loyal customers presence particular brand serves reward choice tasks less loyal customers exhibit reward pathway also found loyal customers greater activation brain areas concerned emotion memory retrieval suggesting loyal customers develop affective bond particular brand serves primary motivation repeat brand loyalty shown result changes neural activity striatum part human action reward order become brand loyal brain must make decision brand brand b process relies brain make predictions based upon expected reward evaluate results learn loyalty brain required remember positive negative outcomes previous brand choices order accurately able make predictions regarding

decisions brain learns better predict part establishing larger neural network recentlyformed brand relationships greater selfreported emotional arousal time selfreported emotional arousal decreases inclusion increases tested skin conductance increased emotional arousal recently formed close relationships found already established close brand relationships also association found insula activation brain area connected urging addiction loss aversion interpersonal love established close relationships research shows brand betrayal neurophysiologically different brand dissatisfaction brand betrayal associated feelings psychological loss selfcastigation previous brand support anger indignation rumination thus compared brand dissatisfaction brand betrayal likely harmful brand person relationship brand makes brand betrayal difficult marketers deflect longerlasting consequences attempt model brain learns temporal difference learning algorithm developed takes account expected reward stimuli presence reward evaluation temporal error individual differences yet theoretical equation may solved near brands serve connect consumers products purchasing either establishing emotional connection creating particular image shown consumers forced choose item group familiar brand present choice much easier consumers forced choose group entirely unfamiliar one mri study found significantly increased activation brain reward centers including orbitofrontal cortex ventral striatum anterior cingulate consumers looking sports cars compared sedans presumably status symbol associated sports cars rewarding many corporations conducted similar mri studies investigate effect brand consumers including delta air lines general motors home depot hallmark motorola results made study mcclure et al investigated difference branding cocacola pepsi study found two drinks tasted blind difference consumer preference brands drinks produced equal activation ventromedial prefrontal cortex thought activated taste rewarding subjects informed brand names consumers preferred coke coke activated ventromedial prefrontal cortex suggesting drinking coke brand rewarding beyond simply taste subjects preferred coke knew coke taste testing anonymous demonstrates power branding influence consumer behavior also significant activation hippocampus dorsolateral prefrontal cortex subjects knew drinking coke brain structures known play role memory recollection indicates helping subjects connect present drinking experience previous brand associations study proposes two separate processes contributing consumer decision making ventromedial prefrontal cortex responds sensory inputs hippocampus dorsolateral prefrontal cortex recall previous associations cultural information according results study coke brand much firmly established rewarding consumer neuroscience research also invested firms package goods designers apply principles aesthetics package design consumers neurophysiologically respond packaged goods one finding reaction time consumers choice significantly increased product aesthetic packaging similarly aesthetic packaging also leads product chosen product standard packaging even standardpackaged product wellknown brand less expensive packaging deemed aesthetic increase activation nucleus accumbens ventromedial prefrontal cortex research consumer buying focused identification processes contribute individual making purchase brain contain buy button rather recruits several processes choice tasks studies report prefrontal cortex heavily involved limiting
