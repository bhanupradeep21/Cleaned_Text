sympatric speciation stephanomeria published summarised paper quantum speciation gottlieb believe sympatric speciation required disruptive selection form reproductive isolating barrier defined grant

confirmed sister species relationship using chloroplast dna well nucleotide sequences gene phosphoglucose isomerase gottlieb stated species pair arose quantum similar work done species pairs genus layia widespread progenitor diploid l glandulosa restricted diploid l discoidea obligate outcrossers though former ray flowers latter disc flowers completely interfertile l discoidea restricted serpentine habitats former species pairs gottlieb applied electrophoretic test species found high genetic identity isozymes therefore gottlieb ford concluded two species related progenitor derivative gottlieb proposed l discoidea arose relatively recently adaptation serpentine soils also example quantum review gottlieb summarized general lesson review studies quantum speciation remains important useful concept applied greater variety situations initially envisaged genetic chromosomal changes need radical supposed new species may originate persist even without novel adaptations another species pair gottlieb studied involved gaura longiflora g demareei species annuals diploids highly interfertile obligate study gottlieb demonstrated g demareei genetically highly similar gaura longiflora although use words quantum speciation study gottlieb concluded species pairs represented clarkia stephanomeria speciation annual plants obligately outcrossing occur minimal genetic differentiation accords previous results selfpollinating species speciation annual plants appears consistent orthodox views process eg mayr propose organisms acquire reproductive isolation important byproduct adapting habitats different parental ones process marks substantial genetic reconstitution occurs gradually long periods another subject intrigued gottlieb throughout career polyploidy commemorative

regarding genetic control plant motivated recent controversies central tenet neodarwinian evolution evolution occurs accumulation small genetic changes time opposed involvement fewer genes larger effects concluded many differences particularly presence versus absence changed structure shape architectural orientation frequently governed one two genes discrete phenotypic alternatives common paper resulted rebuttal coyne lande countered gottlieb gottlieb concluded rebuttal stating agree coyne landethat counting gene differences measuring effects form important tests neodarwinism find frequently apparent genes counted proposed test convincing absence developmental evidence identifies ontogenetic anatomical details character divergence gottlieb reviewed literature crop plants reiterated assertion plant architecture controlled series subsequent studies wild plants gottlieb bolstered assertions important evolutionary changes need involve many small genes gottlieb ford reported floral pigmentation clarkia gracilis discovered basal spot allele unique normally unexpressed concluded interesting speculation many loci include alleles normally remain unexpressed segregation following hybridization frequent plants may place alleles well normally expressed alleles new patterns regulation resulting abrupt appearance novel gottlieb concluded floral spot patterns clarkia controlled genes flower complex structure many specialized tissues cell types form distinctive organs precise orderly manner differentiation structures likely independent pigmentation pattern one reason patterns may changed genes although patterns may simple readily modified developmental basis pigment patterns likely complex effects pollination eventual seed ford performed extensive
