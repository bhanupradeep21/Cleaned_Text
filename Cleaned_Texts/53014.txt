olfactory tubercle ot also known tuberculum olfactorium multisensory processing center contained within olfactory cortex ventral striatum plays role reward cognition ot also shown play role locomotor attentional behaviors particularly relation social sensory may necessary behavioral ot interconnected numerous brain regions especially sensory arousal reward centers thus making potentially critical interface processing sensory information subsequent behavioral ot composite structure receives direct input olfactory bulb contains morphological histochemical characteristics ventral pallidum
