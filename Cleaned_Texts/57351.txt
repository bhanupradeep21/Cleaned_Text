tedral medicine formerly used treat respiratory diseases asthma chronic obstructive lung disease copd chronic bronchitis combination drug containing three active ingredients theophylline ephedrine medication relaxes smooth muscle airways making breathing common side effects tedral include gastrointestinal disturbances dizziness headache however high dose may lead cardiac arrhythmias hypertension seizures serious cardiovascular andor central nervous system adverse tedral contraindicated individuals hypersensitivity theophylline ephedrine andor phenobarbital also used caution patients cardiovascular complications ischemic heart disease heart failure andor disease cause lot interactions therefore prescribing patient tedral drug interactions profile carefully checked patient concurrent medications used treatment option respiratory diseases decades tedral withdrawn us market due safety tedral oral bronchodilator contains three active ingredients including theophylline ephedrine indicated symptomatic relief asthmatic bronchitis chronic bronchial asthma copd bronchospastic usually used addedon therapy asthmatic patients inadequate symptomatic control even inhaled bronchodilators inhaled besides could also used prophylactic treatment prevention asthmatic three active ingredients tedral different mechanisms action theophylline relaxes bronchial smooth muscle pulmonary artery smooth muscle addition also reduces airway responsiveness allergens adenosine methacholine histamine two distinct proposed mechanisms action theophylline ephedrine stereoisomer pseudoephedrine acts direct indirect sympathomimetic amine indirect mechanism makes unique sympathomimetic agents example pseudoephedrine directly binds alpha beta receptors however primary mechanism action indirectly achieved inhibition neuronal norepinephrine reuptake displacement norepinephrine storage vesicles actions prolong presence norepinephrine synapse binding postsynaptic alpha beta receptors thereby leading alpha betaadrenergic stimulation receptors vascular smooth muscle cells leads increase systemic vascular resistance thus systolic diastolic blood pressure direct stimulation receptors ephedrine norepinephrine also increases cardiac chronotropy inotropy lastly stimulation receptors lungs results bronchodilation however effect less significant seen cardiovascular phenobarbital prolongs time chloride channels open thereby depressing central nervous system accomplished acting gabaa receptor subunits phenobarbital binds receptors chloride ion gates open remain open allowing ions enter neuronal cells steadily action causes cell membrane hyperpolarize leading raise action potential due presence theophylline tedral common side effects drug however high serum concentrations serious adverse effects may adverse side effects ephedrine alpha betaagonist effects owing sympathomimetic effect common side effects tedral besides ephedrine cause cardiac arrhythmias ephedrine used longterm catecholamine excess bring contraction band necrosis myocardium predisposes heart ventricular phenobarbital also results adverse effects tedral common side effects caused phenobarbital dizziness sedation incoordination impaired balance however adverse effects affect geriatric patients greater concerning adverse effects phenobarbital longterm usage loss appetite depression irritability achiness bones joints muscles liver damage may reported adverse reactions one active ingredients tedral theophylline tedral contraindicated patient owing fact tedral also contains ephrdrine tedral contraindicated patients ephedrine raises chronotropy inotropy increasing myocardial oxygen demand therefore used caution patients ischemic heart disease heart failure also avoided situations tachycardia would undesirable example aortic ephedrines alphaadrenergic stimulation causes contraction smooth muscle base bladder resulting resistance urine output therefore use tedral patients urinary retention prostatic hyperplasia addition due excessive norepinephrine availability synapse could induce hypertensive crisis via indirect sympathomimetic effect ephedrine tedral avoided used caution within days monoamine oxidase inhibitor maoi tedral also composed phenobarbital therefore contraindicated individuals due presence theophylline tedral interacts theophylline cause interactions tedral following diseases presence ephedrine tedral interacts since ephedrine one active ingredients tedral tedral interacts following disease since tedral contains phenobarbital interacts phenobarbital one active ingredients tedral tedral interacts following disease history tedral traced back early century theophylline first isolated tea leaves later found bronchodilator ephedrine introduced treatment asthma respiratory conditions due bronchodilating effect ability increase blood flow combination theophylline ephedrine first used treatment asthma addition barbiturate pentobarbital phenobarbital later added enhance sedative effects medication improve patient tedral first marketed pharmaceutical company eli lilly company treatment asthma respiratory conditions later sold novartis pharmaceuticals widely used throughout popularity declined due development newer effective medications asthma copd inhaled corticosteroids longacting betaagonists leukotriene modifiers tedral withdrawn us market due safety concerns related use ephedrine us food drug administration fda previously issued warnings use ephedrinecontaining products due potential serious side effects including heart attack stroke response many pharmaceutical companies voluntarily removed ephedrinecontaining products market case tedral manufacturer novartis pharmaceuticals corporation voluntarily withdrew medication market fda issued warning letter company citing safety concerns related use httpsenwikipediaorgwikitedral
