since century based morphological criteria initially classified two separate families hyalospheniidae nebelidae later proven synonymous phylogenetic analyses hyalospheniidae testate amoeboid protists generate mineral agglutinated shells characterized ovoid pyriform vase flaskshaped shells laterally shell construction composition varies substantially within family either entirely secreted cells composed organic matrix eg hyalosphenia additional nonorganic siliceous scales mineral scales also selfsecreted eg quadrulella recycled shell plates small euglyphid amoebae similar material diatom frustules eg apodera padaungiella trait recycling shell plates euglyphids known kleptosquamy appears ancestral trait within hyalospheniid amoebae considered important bioindicators environmental

role reconstruction paleoclimate peatlands bogs family includes several common wellstudied lobose testate amoebae members especially diverse abundant oligotrophic wetland ecosystems peatlands dominated sphagnum mosses also found different mosses freshwater habitats soil although multiple hyalospheniid species cosmopolitan distribution many species restricted southern hemisphere tropical range within northern hyalospheniidae family arcellinida order lobose testate amoebae within eukaryotic supergroup amoebozoa contrast filose testate amoebae found within supergroup rhizaria eg
