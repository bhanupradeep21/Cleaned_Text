tietze syndrome benign inflammation one costal cartilages first described german surgeon alexander tietze subsequently named condition characterized tenderness painful swelling anterior front chest wall costochondral rib cartilage sternocostal cartilage sternum sternoclavicular clavicle sternum junctions tietze syndrome affects true ribs predilection ribs commonly affecting single joint environments emergency department estimated noncardiac chest pain due musculoskeletal despite musculoskeletal conditions tietze syndrome common reason visits emergency room frequently misdiagnosed angina pectoris pleurisy serious cardiopulmonary conditions due similar presentation though tietze syndrome misdiagnosed lifethreatening conditions similar symptoms myocardial infarction heart attack ruled prior diagnosis conditions tietze syndrome often confused costochondritis tietze syndrome differentiated costochondritis swelling costal cartilages appear costochondritis additionally costochondritis affects ribs tietze syndrome typically affects rib tietze syndrome typically presents unilaterally single joint anterior chest wall patients tenderness swelling one side usually research described condition gradual varying pain swelling tietze syndrome typically chronic intermittent last days several common symptom tietze syndrome pain primarily chest also radiate shoulder pain described aching gripping neuralgic sharp dull even described gas symptoms tietze syndrome reported exacerbated sneezing coughing deep inhalation overall physical tenderness swelling affected joint important symptoms tietze syndrome differentiate condition also suggested discomfort aggravated due restricted shoulder chest true etiology tietze syndrome established though several theories proposed one popular theory based observations many patients begin developing symptoms following respiratory infection dry cough one study finding patients contracted tietze syndrome either cough respiratory thus hypothesized repetitive mild trauma severe cough respiratory infection may produce small tears ligament called causing tietze however theory disputed account symptoms onset attacks rest well fact swelling sometimes develops respiratory infection also observed accompanying rheumatoid coupled creactive protein elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate suggest infectious rheumatoid factor though evidence many theories chest thought among potential causes since disproven left diagnosis tietze syndrome primarily clinical one though studies suggest use radiologic musculoskeletal conditions estimated account noncardiac related chest pain emergency ruling conditions especially potentially lifethreatening ones myocardial infarction heart attack angina pectoris extremely important present similarly tietze usually ruled diagnostic tools electrocardiogram physical examination showing reproducible chest wall tenderness eliminating possible conditions physical examination considered accurate tool diagnosing tietze syndrome physical examination consists gentle pressure chest wall single finger identify location swelling tenderness upon palpation one costochondral sternocostal sternoclavicular joints distinctive trait tietze syndrome considered positive diagnosis pathological features observed tietze syndrome including degeneration costal cartilage increase vascularity hypertrophic changes enlarged however features identified studies begun exploring defining use radiographic imaging diagnosing tietze syndrome includes computed tomography magnetic resonance imaging bone though case studies methods described yet thoroughly methods plain radiographs better known xray helpful exclusion conditions diagnosis tietze researchers believe ultrasound superior available imaging methods visualize increased volume swelling structural changes costal symptoms tietze syndrome display wide variety conditions making difficult diagnose especially physicians unaware due presentation tietze syndrome misdiagnosed number conditions including myocardial infarction heart attack angina pectoris costochondritis commonly confused tietze syndrome similar symptoms affect costochondral sternocostal joints costochondritis considered common condition associated swelling affected joints defining distinction tietze syndrome commonly affects rib typically occurs among younger age costochondritis affects ribs found occur older individuals usually age addition ultrasound diagnose tietze syndrome whereas costochondritis relies heavily physical examination medical another condition confused tietze syndrome costochondritis slipping rib syndrome srs three conditions associated chest pain well inflammation costal unlike costochondritis tietze syndrome affect true ribs srs affects false ribs srs characterized partial dislocation subluxation joints costal causes inflammation irritated intercostal nerves straining intercostal muscles srs cause abdominal back pain costochondritis tietze syndrome srs present radiating pain shoulder arm conditions diagnosed ultrasound though srs requires complex dynamic vast differential diagnosis also includes tietze syndrome considered selflimiting condition usually resolves within months management tietze syndrome usually consists analgesics nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids ibuprofen aspirin acetaminophen paracetamol methods management include manual therapy local heat intended relieve pain expected treat cure tietze syndrome condition expected resolve nerve block utilized cases symptom management satisfactory relieving usually nerveblocking injection consists combination steroids hydrocortisone anesthetics lidocaine procaine typically administered ultrasound one study used combination triamcinolone hexacetonide lidocaine patients week found average decrease size affected costal cartilage assessing ultrasound well significant improvement symptoms however longterm effectiveness injection disputed multiple researchers describing recurrence symptoms repetitive refractory cases tietze syndrome condition resistant conservative treatment options surgery surgery uncommon cases tietze syndrome many describe tietze syndrome manageable less invasive use surgery context refers resection affected costal cartilages surrounding surgeons resected cartilage matching symptoms tietze syndrome assumption cartilage one study describes case surgeons resected large amount cartilage including minutely hypertrophied tissue previous resection failed relieve symptoms believed due improperly resected limited literature surgical treatment overall research treatment severe chronic forms tietze tietze syndrome named first described german surgeon alexander tietze
