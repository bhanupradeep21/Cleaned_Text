antecedent stimulus cues organism perform learned behavior organism perceives antecedent stimulus behaves way maximizes reinforcing consequences minimizes punishing consequences might part complex interpersonal communication definition antecedent preceding event cause case event causes learned behavior learned behavior one come instincts created practice learned behavior controlled two systems reflective reflexive turn create cognitive learning habitual cognitive learning influenced directly environment evaluates order acquire particular example cognitive learning riding bike environment changing road path weather turns etc constantly changing adjust habitual learning formed conditioning whether voluntary classical conditioning denotes organism creates reflexes based past reflex stimulus response happens due biological response mediated nervous system habitual learning result reflex happening time time get used stimuli antecedent comes habitual learning uses strategies past experiences dictate behave present eg continuing ride bike initially learning learning strategies result antecedent classical conditioning first discovered pavlov studied digestive reflexes dogs results showed different stimuli different types food elicit different reflexes responses different compositions discovered dogs salivated received food due antecedent became bell pavlov rang fed dogs learned behavior became salivation hand operant conditioning respond stimuli another form social learning consequence response makes us respond antecedent stimuli paired reinforcing consequences activate centers brain involved antecedent stimuli paired punishing consequences activate brain centers involved fear antecedents play different role attempting trigger positive negative latter particularly important comes antecedents bad stimuli environment lead behavioral suggested stimuli lead learned behavior described behavioral science reinforcement theory states consequences behavior drives behavior positive behaviors rewarded negative behaviors either ignored scientific papers argue two different types antecedent two types antecedent variables referred discriminative stimuli setting setting events differ discriminative stimuli setting events believed effect stimulusresponse suggested setting events focus three categories stimuli biological physical social discriminative stimuli found present behavior reinforced discriminative stimuli believed identifying event alerting mind reinforcement occur exchange specific another scientific paper states antecedent variables proximal things like financial stressors job satisfaction conducted experiment see stimuli could induce relapse alcohol theory learned behavior continuance drinking performed stimuli could losing antecedent setting event happens due social variables order effect similarly scientific states culture antecedent behavior culture also direct indirect effect direct effect would line theory setting events antecedent culture direct social stimulus causes effect stimulusresponse indirect effect reinforces theory discriminative identifying event one reason behind learned behavior stimuli activate motivation part brain tested areas competition certain categories like example tourism places factors lead competition changes tourism like hospitality food selections cleanliness areas concentration resources facilities etc stimuli would considered second variablesetting events type competitiveness affects tourists planning visiting also affects employees work tourist towns things like gift shops hotels restaurants depend flow tourism keep businesses thriving makes businesses continuously improve change business ways meet consumer demands variables change behavior parties involved number done order prevent past learned behaviors using antecedent variables one intervention talked preventing bad behavior classrooms positive alternative goes reinforcement theory states consequence behavior drives behavior comes behaviors schools antecedent without intervention could number antecedents caused learned behavior unfavourable suggests interventions overcome bad behavior example order override antecedent gain students attention immediately request something eg high five praising providing positive intervention fits idea classical child rewarded positive affirmation complete task different study agrees antecedent interventions work reinforcement aim reduce probability unwanted behavior occurring rather punishing unwanted behavior article similarly agrees another setting events discriminative stimuli two antecedent variables used different ways interventions example behavior happens due discriminative stimuli like hard mathematics test leading student destroying sent principals office likely reoccur child got test performing counter suggests environment rearranged way provoke individual changing antecedent hard maths test easier shorter one warning child prior positive effect behavior still questions surrounding role antecedent interventions within society relatively new lot known applicability however evident potential antecedents used behavioral interventions proven positively influence behaviors like selfinjury psychologyrelated article stub help wikipedia expanding
