arthritis term often used mean disorder affects symptoms generally include joint pain symptoms may include redness warmth swelling decreased range motion affected types arthritis organs also onset gradual types common forms osteoarthritis degenerative joint disease rheumatoid osteoarthritis usually occurs age affects fingers knees rheumatoid arthritis autoimmune disorder often affects hands types include gout lupus fibromyalgia septic types rheumatic treatment may include resting joint alternating applying ice weight loss exercise may also recommended medications may depend form may include pain medications ibuprofen paracetamol circumstances joint replacement may osteoarthritis affects people rheumatoid arthritis affects gout affects western population point australia people affected united states type overall disease becomes common arthritis common reason people miss work result decreased quality term derived arthr meaning joint itis meaning several diseases joint pain primary considered main feature generally person arthritis means one diseases include joint pain also symptom diseases case arthritis considered secondary main disease include undifferentiated arthritis arthritis fit wellknown clinical disease categories possibly early stage definite rheumatic pain vary severity common symptom virtually types symptoms include swelling joint stiffness redness aching around arthritic disorders like lupus rheumatoid arthritis affect organs body leading variety symptoms may common advanced arthritis significant secondary changes occur example arthritic symptoms might make difficult person move around andor exercise lead secondary effects changes addition primary symptoms huge impact quality life arthritis common cause disability united states million individuals arthritis severe limitations function daily absenteeism frequent visits physician common individuals arthritis arthritis make difficult individuals physically active become home boundcitation needed estimated total cost arthritis cases close billion almost lost earnings year arthritis results nearly million hospitalizations close million outpatient visits health care decreased mobility combination symptoms make difficult individual remain physically active contributing increased risk obesity high cholesterol vulnerability heart people arthritis also increased risk depression may response numerous factors including fear worsening common risk factors increase persons chance developing arthritis later adulthood modifiable others smoking linked increased susceptibility developing arthritis particularly rheumatoid diagnosis made clinical examination appropriate health professional may supported tests radiology blood tests depending type suspected arthritides potentially feature pain pain patterns may differ depending arthritides location rheumatoid arthritis generally worse morning associated stiffness lasting however early stages patients may symptoms warm shower osteoarthritis hand tends associated morning stiffness eases relatively quickly movement exercise aged children pain might main presenting feature aged patient simply moves less infantile patient refuses use affected limbcitation needed elements history disorder guide diagnosis important features speed time onset pattern joint involvement symmetry symptoms early morning stiffness tenderness gelling locking inactivity aggravating relieving factors systemic symptoms may include checking joints observing movements examination skin rashes nodules symptoms pulmonary inflammation physical examination may confirm diagnosis may indicate systemic disease radiographs often used follow progression help assess severitycitation needed blood tests xrays affected joints often performed make diagnosis screening blood tests indicated certain arthritides suspected might include rheumatoid factor antinuclear factor anf extractable nuclear antigen specific antibodiescitation needed rheumatoid arthritis patients often high erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr also known sed rate creactive protein crp levels indicates presence inflammatory process body anticyclic citrullinated peptide anticcp antibodies rheumatoid factor rf two common blood tests positive results indicate risk rheumatoid arthritis negative results help rule autoimmune condition imaging tests like xrays mri scans ultrasounds used diagnose monitor arthritis imaging tests rheumatoid arthritis may considered include computed tomography ct scanning positron emission tomography pet scanning bone scanning dualenergy xray absorptiometry osteoarthritis common form affects humans animals notably dogs also occurs cats horses affect larger smaller joints body humans includes hands wrists feet back hip knee dogs includes elbow hip stifle knee shoulder back disease essentially one acquired daily wear tear joint however osteoarthritis also occur result injury osteoarthritis begins cartilage eventually causes two opposing bones erode condition starts minor pain physical activity soon pain continuous even occur state rest pain debilitating prevent one activities dogs pain significantly affect quality life may include difficulty going stairs struggling get lying trouble walking slick floors unable hop vehicles difficulty jumping furniture behavioral changes eg aggression difficulty squatting osteoarthritis typically affects weightbearing joints back knee hip unlike rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis commonly disease elderly strongest predictor osteoarthritis increased age likely due declining ability chondrocytes maintain structural integrity percent women degree osteoarthritis age risk factors osteoarthritis include prior joint trauma obesity sedentary rheumatoid arthritis ra disorder bodys immune system starts attack body attack directed joint many parts body rheumatoid arthritis damage occurs joint lining cartilage eventually results erosion two opposing bones ra often affects joints fingers wrists knees elbows symmetrical appears sides body lead severe deformity years treated ra occurs mostly people aged children disorder present skin rash fever pain disability limitations daily earlier diagnosis aggressive treatment many individuals lead better quality life going undiagnosed long ras risk factors strongest association developing rheumatoid arthritis female sex family history rheumatoid arthritis age obesity previous joint damage injury exposure tobacco bone erosion central feature rheumatoid arthritis bone continuously undergoes remodeling actions bone resorbing osteoclasts bone forming osteoblasts one main triggers bone erosion joints rheumatoid arthritis inflammation synovium caused part production proinflammatory cytokines receptor activator nuclear factor kappa b ligand rankl cell surface protein present cells osteoclast activity directly induced osteoblasts rankrankl lupus common collagen vascular disorder present severe arthritis features lupus include skin rash extreme photosensitivity hair loss kidney problems lung fibrosis constant joint gout caused deposition uric acid crystals joints causing inflammation also uncommon form gouty arthritis caused formation rhomboid crystals calcium pyrophosphate known pseudogout early stages gouty arthritis usually occurs one joint time occur many joints quite crippling joints gout often become swollen lose function gouty arthritis become particularly painful potentially debilitating gout successfully uric acid levels gout symptoms controlled standard gout medicines decrease production uric acid eg allopurinol increase uric acid elimination body kidneys eg probenecid referred refractory chronic infectious arthritis another severe form arthritis presents sudden onset chills fever joint pain condition caused bacteria elsewhere body infectious arthritis must rapidly diagnosed treated promptly prevent irreversible joint psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis psoriatic arthritis individuals develop skin problem first arthritis typical features continuous joint pains stiffness swelling disease recur periods remission cure disorder small percentage develop severely painful destructive form arthritis destroys small joints hands lead permanent disability loss hand known cure arthritis rheumatic diseases treatment options vary depending type arthritis include physical therapy exercise diet orthopedic bracing oral topical joint replacement surgery may required repair damage restore function relieve general studies shown physical exercise affected joint noticeably improve longterm pain relief furthermore exercise arthritic joint encouraged maintain health particular joint overall body individuals arthritis benefit physical occupational therapy arthritis joints become stiff range movement limited physical therapy shown significantly improve function decrease pain delay need surgical intervention advanced exercise prescribed physical therapist shown effective medications treating osteoarthritis knee exercise often focuses improving muscle strength endurance flexibility cases exercises may designed train balance occupational therapy provide assistance activities assistive technology tool used aid persons disability reducing physical barriers improving use damaged body part typically amputation assistive technology devices customized patient bought several types medications used treatment arthritis treatment typically begins medications fewest side effects medications added insufficiently depending type arthritis medications given may different example firstline treatment osteoarthritis acetaminophen paracetamol inflammatory arthritis involves nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids like ibuprofen opioids nsaids may less well however topical nsaids may better safety profiles oral nsaids severe cases osteoarthritis intraarticular corticosteroid injections may also drugs treat rheumatoid arthritis ra range corticosteroids monoclonal antibodies given intravenously due autoimmune nature ra treatments may include pain medications antiinflammatory drugs also another category drugs called diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs dmards csdmards tnf biologics tsdmards specific kinds dmards recommended treatment dmards designed slow
