scientists agree religiosity also called religiousness independent personality trait despite commonality religiosity personality traits relate ones feelings thoughts however unlike personality ones level religiosity often measured presence lack belief relationship higher power certain lifestyles behaviors adopted higher power sense belonging followers ones additionally personality traits tend follow normal distribution majority individuals scores personality trait concentrated towards middle rather extremely high low distributions religiosity however follow nonnormal distribution individuals score particularly high low religiosity examining religiosity relates personality characteristics could provide empirical way study difficult concept time act religious consistent behavior across almost every culture could suggest personality related religiosity use modern empirically tested personality measures researchers look links obtain quantitative results provide insight religion important element however research needed definitively say correlation certain personality characteristics overall research religiosity personality summarized doesnt appear strong link research suggest modest relationship mental ability religiosity mental ability considered aspect appears rather personality religiosity better explained environment upbringing people likely maintain beliefs household grew research religiosity also limited much psychological research biased western populations therefore research religiosity personality may also skewed towards western religions fivefactor model personality currently accepted comprehensive model fivefactor model ffm identifies five broad traits big five underlying many narrower traits together used describe personality identified traits big five good correlating religiosity trait orthogonal completely independent one ability separate essential trait possible study personality characteristic relates religiosity studying psychology religion relates personality new idea however research support refute ability personality traits explain religious spiritual involvement research using eysencks model found religiosity general associated low openness experience well low factor associated inversely agreeableness review studies examined relations ffm measures religiosity spiritual maturity religious fundamentalism extrinsic religion general religiosity mainly related agreeableness conscientiousness big five found second review also noted relationship consistent across different dimensions religiosity different cultures different measures big relationship however appeared weaker young adults rest adult additionally weak positive correlation extraversion small significant relationship low openness study also found two different concepts religiosity spirituality involve overall compassionate attitude towards others positively correlates agreeableness open mature religiosity spirituality associated high openness experience extraversion agreeableness conscientiousness low neuroticism religious fundamentalism associated higher agreeableness lower neuroticism lower openness experience findings higher religiosity scores seemed altruistic well behaved however correlation pretty small known religious people tend better behaved better behaved people attracted extrinsic religiosity associated higher neuroticism unrelated personality factors levels neuroticism among religiousness vary european samples exhibiting higher levels united states speculated due dominance catholicism european previously stated one major strengths using ffm study religiosity people empirically tested considered reliable valid another strength big five laid simply making easier use examining potential links personality religiosity huge strength research argues downfall lies solely personality indicator compatible religious spiritual matters example another study investigated correlation religiosity ffm conclusion drawn religiosity andor spirituality made sixth personality factor order truly make research using model additionally many relationships personality religion small religiousness also correlated personality traits encompassed therefore research needed determine ffm accurate way examine relationships personality religiosity determine significant relationships big five commonly used model personality newer personality research suggests hexaco model may improvement big five however shed light big five hexaco model allows greater way correlate religiosity personality understanding big five likely beneficial addition big five defined openness experience conscientiousness extraversion agreeableness neuroticism trait allows characteristics openness experience reflects degree intellectual curiosity creativity preference novelty variety person conscientiousness tendency organized dependable extraversion one shows positive emotions assertiveness sociability agreeableness one considered compassionate cooperative lastly neuroticism one experiences unpleasant emotions easily anger anxiety depression hexaco model makes slight modification factors big five traits notably adds sixth trait honestyhumility captures individuals tendency towards honesty humility sincerity greedavoidance religiosity positively correlated honestyhumility individuals score higher religiousness also likely score higher unclear however results would replicated studies traits big five hexaco model correlated religiosity models encompass known personality traits traits femininity conservatism linked religiosity scored higher religiousness likely also score higher femininity religiosity negatively correlated traits relating sexual expression eroticism sexiness sensuality individuals scored higher religiosity tended score lower factors humour also negatively correlated religiosity individuals scored higher religiousness tended score lower many links traits religiosity looked larger scale like traits five factor model therefore results may replicate future research may accurate attachment theory another example personality indicator ability help researchers understand religiosity spirituality basic premise attachment theory infants form relationships caregivers type attachment influences individuals personality future thought future relationships could particular god higher power attachment theory four attachment styles identified secure attachment styles believed positive outcomes individuals personality future relationships disrupted attachment styles believed related disordered personalities antisocial behaviors lifecourse persistent criminal attachment theory also thought related religiosity relationship god mirror relationships adult attachment additionally much like attachment theory describes separation caregivers sense separation god reported invoke similar research varies explaining types attachment style might yield particular relationship god example one study secure relationship ones parents associated secure attachment one theory correspondence pathway theory suggests individual differences attachment style lead differences religious beliefs individual insecure attachment could led either agnosticism atheism could develop emotional dependent relationship however research shown compensatory effect individuals feel need make something lacking instance someone insecure attachment style parents may turn secure confident relationship god compensate parents sufficiently provide research suggests could links attachment styles religiosity well attachment styles personality outcomes yet clear precise mechanisms behind either doesnt yet appear general consensus across studies additionally research needed determine links attachment theory religiosity personality object relations theory describes children relate associate different emotions different people objects theory says children associate emotions objects based currently view world around example kids might associate emotion something good mother bad something like criminals relating religious ideals seems natural concept apply ones relationship god theory traced back association theory hypothesized person ends creating idea god according individual needs perceives world view personality religion focus person differs trait wise centers type relationship individual important aspect keep mind object relations theory highly theoretical weakness sense data based concept objectively verified thus may reliable inquiries psychological nature religion difficult find valid reliable measures introspective nature subject said something learn field study analyzing theory personality development correlates ones attachment religious deity hopefully begin understand important association perception religious ideals research shown struggling religion correlates basic personality traits studies big five well factors entitlement selfesteem selfcompassion suggest significant relationship religious uncertainty high neuroticism may hard time trying find purpose life several studies also suggested people higher neuroticism tend negative relationship god correlates divine struggles may encounter distress comes finding meaning life well recognizing divine figures religions agreeableness conscientiousness associated lower levels anger god whereas neuroticism linked higher levels anger god extraversion however found correlate religious struggles little evidence available suggest openness experience linked religious struggles thought high openness experience may carry doubt religion compared lower openness experience even controlling big five evidence suggest entitlement selfesteem selfcompassion might able predict religious struggles reason divine struggles entitled people possibly due tendency feel victimized angry thus may positive relationship god high levels selfesteem selfcompassion may link positive spiritual wellbeing time translate less moral religious struggles however lower levels selfesteem compassion associated religious struggles certain findings indicated personality may predispose individuals religious struggles findings weak also research personality affected religion research done salsman brown brechting carlson showed positive correlation religion life satisfaction shown salsman practice religion generally
