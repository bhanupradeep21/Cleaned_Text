popliteal bypass surgery commonly known femoropopliteal bypass fpb fempop etc generally lower extremity bypass surgery surgical procedure used treat diseased leg arteries used medical intervention salvage limbs risk amputation improve walking ability people severe intermittent claudication leg muscle pain ischemic rest popliteal bypass surgery common type peripheral bypass surgery carries blood femoral artery thigh end popliteal artery behind femoral artery runs along thigh extends become popliteal artery runs posteriorly knee femur smaller arteries carry blood supply popliteal artery calf blockages caused plaque buildup atherosclerosis arteries reduce leg blood circulation causing leg pain may interfere daily standard popliteal bypass surgery involves bypass popliteal surgery incisions made depending location usually healthy vein located sewn blockage bypass narrowed blocked femoral allows blood redirected flow new healthy vessel around blockage cases synthetic graft materials polytetrafluoroethylene used instead vein femoropopliteal bypass surgery mainly used treat cases femoral artery blockage cause severe symptoms restrict completion daily tasks peripheral artery disease claudication cases responded well treatment options surgery considered adjustments made lifestyle habits quitting smoking exercising using medications relieve improve claudication refers pain lower limbs may felt exercising walking simply resting blocked femoral artery reduces blood flow areas thigh calf causing pain leads severe pain caused claudication lead person restricted ability move pain resting often sign condition worsened claudication also considered symptom peripheral artery popliteal bypass surgery may performed people following symptoms generally vein bypass lasts least years percent people however onequarter onethird people need additional procedures followups maintain condition minimise postoperative complications second bypass correct postoperative care surgical techniques must used comparison synthetic grafts likely become occluded future using persons blood synthetic graft remains open people years popliteal bypass surgery carried whereas using veins bypass remains unobstructed moreover particular vein great saphenous vein shown durable years also comparing efficacy using ptfe great saphenous vein people claudication critical limb ischemia latter showed better long term second bypass may required blockage forms bypass graft later time decreasing trend percentage patency likelihood vessel remain open popliteal bypass surgery first year years environmental conditions overall patient health may also affect patency since operation involves multiple cuts made leg relatively high risk surgery involves several risks complications common types leg associated surgery specific popliteal bypass surgery complications include limited following study people carried popliteal bypass surgery overall rate morbidity mortality respectively within days however variations studies mortality one particular study find person preexisting risk factors people affect mortality rates common mortality factors heart failure myocardial infarction diabetes mellitus infection although antibiotics generally given surgery people still susceptible wound infections incidence popliteal bypass surgery associated infection contraction common popliteal bypass surgery poor blood circulation area poor circulation means wounds heal slower incision sites higher chance becoming infected infection vascular graft prosthesis occurs every people circumstance removal graft graft infection strongly associated high morbidity mortality obvious sign graft infection drainage sinus diabetes mellitus redoing bypass graft associated higher chance graft occasionally may leakage fluid blood incision wound study shows percent people affected within days post however normally settles time indicate problem bypass people peripheral artery disease undergoing popliteal bypass surgery also susceptible myocardial infarction abnormal heart rhythms patients requiring popliteal bypass likely higher cholesterol levels higher blood pressure excess strain damage caused hbp high cholesterol level cause atherosclerosis time coronary artery narrows increases patients chance getting heart myocardial infarctions also caused graft failure hypoperfusion risk lymphedema exists percent patients leg swelling typically lasts lymphedema caused blockages lymphatic system leading insufficient lymph drainage fluid buildup leg though incurable swelling leg usually temporary treatment like compression stockings meticulous skin care remedial exercises may help ameliorate symptomsmedical citation needed rare situations blockages severely disrupt stop blood circulation critical limb ischemia occurs cases ischaemia insufficient blood available tissues survive leads gangrene rest pain case amputation major goals amputation remove dead tissues relieve pain promote wound healingmedical citation needed surgery operations popliteal bypass increased probability blood clot formation rare cases part clot leg breaks free travels lungs also known pulmonary embolism blockage blood vessels lung formed pulmonary embolism could cause excess fluid buildup condition also known pulmonary edema excess fluid present lungs specifically accumulation excess fluid air sacs lung leading impairment gas exchange potentially respiratory incidence early graft thrombosis popliteal bypass cause thrombosis commonly due technical errors surgery causes may include stenosis narrow vein grafts low cardiac output compression cases heparin anticoagulant thrombectomy used treat graft surgery generally performed general anaesthesia surgeon makes incision upper leg graft either manmade patients vein sewn ends graft reroutes blood flow around blocked artery allowing adequate supply back parts leg generally preferred possible healthy vein used make graft shown better outcome procedure cases however vein used materials polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe dacron often used make blood vessel grafts often come leg bypass site arteries knee grafts removed prepared surgery time bypass however cases leg vein left place connected artery situ procedure circumstance angioscope flexible medical tube camera used aid mentioned synthetic graft material like ptfe may option surgeon find suitable veins ptfe commonly used bypasses involving arteries cochrane review found moderatequality evidence improved long term success months autologous vein grafts compared prosthetic materials aboveknee lowquality evidence small secondary benefit dacron ptfe aboveknee belowknee bypasses evidence uncertain draw conclusions best graft order reduce risk complications surgery patients refrain smoking decrease blood circulation makes graft likely fail walking also essential early recovery periods may help reduce swelling facilitate wound healing aids collateral artery formation leg improve blood flow around often physiotherapy treatments given patients operation help patients ease walking movements keep leg muscle factors maintaining healthy diet regular exercise may also prevent unnecessary strain leg arteries weight interventions surgery improve blood circulation overall reduce risks getting second bypassmedical citation needed cases blockage severe limb threatening alternative procedures may take place percutaneous transluminal angioplasty endarterectomy procedures used possible considered minimally invasive turn reducing recovery time possible complications historically first incidence using vein bypass femoral artery treat patient suffering foot ulcer although bypass technique new discovery yet widely used known new surgical technique otherwise known situ procedure developed used veins improve bypass works increasing radius vein increase blood flow along blood vessel today proved situ procedure better suited vein
