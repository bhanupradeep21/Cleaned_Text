emotional lateralization asymmetrical representation emotional control processing brain evidence lateralization brain functions well emotions complex involve variety physical cognitive responses many well understood general purpose emotions produce specific response stimulus feelings conscious perception emotions emotion occurs frequently continuously called moodn variety scientific studies found lateralization emotions fmri lesion studies shown asymmetrical activation brain regions thinking emotions responding extreme emotional stimuli viewing emotional situations processing production facial expressions also appear asymmetric nature many theories lateralization proposed specific emotions please keep mind information article theoretical scientists still trying understand emotion emotional lateralization also evidence contradictory many brain regions interconnected input output given region may come go many different regions variations right hemisphere dominance right hemisphere control emotion left hemispheren b right hemisphere dominant emotional expression similar way left hemisphere dominant language c right hemisphere dominant perception facial expression body posture prosody

severely impaired decisionmaking skills especially consider immediate vs future reward punishmentn decisions almost always guided immediate reward punishment disregarded longterm consequences researchers incapable conditioning patient nonverbal stimuli containing emotional meaning reward punishment able condition patient verbal stimuli containing emotional meaning language production processing occur left hemisphere majority emotional processing production emotion speech occurs right hemisphere persons schizophrenia usually difficulty processing prosody patients also show remarkable increase lateralization towards right hemisphere emotionally nonemotional prosody rich also decrease righthandedness led increase right hemisphere lateralization right hemisphere lateralization extends beyond prosody many aspects language speech processing schizophrenic patients two hemispheres complementary specialization control different aspects emotionn left hemisphere primarily process positive emotions right hemisphere primarily process negative emotions large portion regions primarily right hemisphere activated aversive classical conditioningn b divisions specialization model provides neuroanatomical basis emotional control processing peripheral autonomic nervous system symmetrical afferent nerves parasympathetic sympathetic systems autonomic nervous system differently innervate various organs maintain homeostasis heart asymmetrical representation autonomic peripheral nervous system leads asymmetrical representation left hemisphere activated predominantly homeostatic afferents associated parasympathetic functions right hemisphere activated predominantly homeostatic afferents associated sympathetic functions lateralization extremely apparent anterior cingulate cortex acc anterior insular cortex ai associated higher emotions romantic love motivation correlated homeostatic functions left ai acc active feelings romantic love maternal attachment ai acc activated right left sides watching pain inflicted loved one right ai acc elicited subjective feelings pain supports association right ai aroused sympathetic feelings left

insular cortex probably plays significant role phenomena similar lateralization probably involved cardiovascular malfunction patients head injury stroke multiple sclerosis brain tumors meningitis encephalitis migraine cluster headache neurosurgical procedures unlikely brain evolved asymmetrical control emotional behavior rather seems likely although may asymmetry neural control emotion observed asymmetries largely product asymmetrical control functions control movement language processing complex sensory informationn lateralization may evolutionarily lateralization may allow greater variety emotions left temporal cortex involved language processing right temporal cortex involved processing faces lateralization also apparent processing emotions may difference cortical activation men women activity right hemisphere greater women exposed unpleasant images men though men showed activation bilaterally viewing pleasant picturesn another study found women men women greater activation right hemisphere viewing unpleasant faces left hemisphere activation viewing pleasant yet another study found contrasting sex difference recording eeg waves parietal frontal lobes negative

contradict moral teachings generally produce negative emotions watching people behave badly breaking moral codes significantly activates right parahippocampal gyrus right medial frontal gyrus left watching emotionally negative situations significantly activates right amygdala study indicates lateral processing emotions extends beyond basic emotions higher cognitive responses depression previously depressed probably due altered brain structure alters brain structure patients depressed depressed show activation negative stimuli negative stimuli presented patients right hemispheres patients significantly accurate quicker respond stimuli data study shows psychological disorders correlated increased lateralization patients damage left amygdala lesions rated fearful faces less fearful normal subjectsn similar findings showed regional blood flow increased response fear faces decreased euphoric faces left amygdala chimpanzees primates humans produce asymmetrical facial expressions greater expression left side face right hemisphere researchers also subjectively reported left side face expressing emotion using images leftleft chimeric faces emotion processed many different areas brain specific emotion may processed multiple areas regions involved emotional lateralization appear follow general conventions describe rolesfunctions certain brain regions regions structure involved emotional processing show functional lateralization using pet scan researchers found activity left medial lateral prefrontal cortex reciprocally associated decrease activity amygdala findings imply prefrontal cortex modulates amygdala activity left prefrontal cortex plays role approach behaviors positively valenced emotions amygdala plays role withdrawal behaviors negatively valenced emotionsn superior frontal gyrus significantly activated region processing patients inferior frontal lobe damage produce less less intense facial expression presented emotional stimuli also problems reading fear disgust people people left inferior frontal lobe damage produced less facial expression could analyze emotional situations well right frontal lobe damage especially fear disgustn left inferior frontal gyrus ifg plays important role anger right ifg plays larger role patients dorsolateral frontal cortex lesions difficulty discerning propositional attitude patients left lesions show increased impairmentn damage inferior parietal region including anterior supramarginal gyrus posterior angular gyrus regions resulted reduced scr damage right hemisphere regions resulted significant p right superior temporal gyrus significantly activated area processing right superior temporal gyrus increasingly responds increasingly happy stimuli left pulvinar increasingly responds increasingly fearful stimulin right pulvinar activated aversive conditioningn amygdala plays key role emotional processing especially fear amygdala function appears emotionally lateralized people shown fearful faces left amygdala left periamygdaloid cortex increase activation also appears greater increase neural activity left amygdala corresponding increasingly fearful stimulusn recordings singleunit electrodes monkeys shown similar activation left amygdalan man confined damage right amygdala could produce startle responsen activity measured pet scan right amygdala correlated

involved conscious experience emotionn phenomena emotional lateralization may help describe emotions arise persist alter behavior understanding emotional lateralization help scientists understand emotion general emotional lateralization may also play role psychological disorders depression schizophrenia future treatment psychological disorders may targeted neurological treatments rather ingested drugs symptoms arise confined regions damage usually stereotypical emotional behavioral changes diagnosis locating damaged regions process emotion may aided noticeable emotional changes categorized one lateralized emotional control systems diagnosis treatment cardiovascular irregularities arises emotions states could aided understanding physical basis psychological influences instead treating cardiovascular irregularities psychological issues treatment could target lateralized brain regions like human based scientific experiments limitations researchers attempting study emotions especially hard since emotions complex lead subjective response since majority experiments emotional lateralization fear leaves question whether emotions also lateralized two major issues associated many experiments studying emotion require explanation large percent human studies anomalies due accidents tumors attempts cure disease eg seizures using lesioning since cases exist sample size human studies emotional lateralization generally limited may small single person studies may provide good insight certain brain regions functions conclusions definite animal studies may help understanding problem emotions humans generally considered complicated animals several limitations using fmri pet study emotional responses fmri measures changes blood oxygenation using bold effect temporal resolution limited haemodynamic response several seconds pet similar limits offering slightly better temporal resolution slightly worse spatial resolution lesions rarely localized affect large areas brain processing brain generally localized requires many areas brain process furthermore lesioning may interfere pathways span lesion site thus lesions always good way determine specific brain areas therefore degree skepticism kept mind viewing lateralization data lesion studies httpsenwikipediaorgwikiemotionallateralization
