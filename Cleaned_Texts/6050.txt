central dogma molecular biology explanation flow genetic information within biological system often stated dna makes rna rna makes although original meaning first stated francis crick published central dogma states information passed protein get detail transfer information nucleic acid nucleic acid nucleic acid protein may possible transfer protein protein protein nucleic acid impossible information means precise determination sequence either bases nucleic acid amino acid residues protein restated nature paper published central dogma molecular biology deals detailed residuebyresidue transfer sequential information states information transferred back protein either protein nucleic second version central dogma popular incorrect simplistic dna rna protein pathway published james watson first edition molecular biology gene watsons version differs cricks watson describes twostep dna rna rna protein process central dogma originally stated crick remains valid watsons version dogma framework understanding transfer sequence information informationcarrying biopolymers common general case living organisms major classes biopolymers dna rna nucleic acids protein conceivable direct transfers information occur dogma classes groups three general transfers believed occur normally cells two special transfers known occur specific conditions case viruses laboratory four unknown transfers believed never occur general transfers describe normal flow biological information dna copied dna dna replication dna information copied mrna transcription proteins synthesized using

directly dna template without use mrna protein copied protein synthesis rna using primary structure protein template dna synthesis using primary structure protein template thought naturally biopolymers comprise dna rna polypeptides linear polymers ie monomer connected two monomers sequence monomers effectively encodes information transfers information described central dogma ideally faithful deterministic transfers wherein one biopolymers sequence used template construction another biopolymer sequence entirely dependent original biopolymers sequence dna transcribed rna complement

dna replication must occur genetic material provided progeny cell whether somatic reproductive copying dna dna arguably fundamental step information transfer complex group proteins called replisome

additional processing final product emerges one thing correct folding process complex vitally important proteins requires chaperone proteins control form product proteins excise internal segments peptide chains splicing free ends border gap processes inside discarded sections called inteins proteins must split multiple sections without splicing polypeptide chains need crosslinked others must attached cofactors haem heme become functional reverse transcription transfer information rna dna reverse normal transcription known occur case retroviruses hiv well eukaryotes case retrotransposons telomere synthesis process genetic information rna gets transcribed new dna family enzymes involved process called reverse transcriptase rna replication copying one rna another many viruses replicate

direct translation dna protein demonstrated cellfree system ie test tube using extracts e coli contained ribosomes intact cells cell fragments could synthesize proteins singlestranded dna templates
