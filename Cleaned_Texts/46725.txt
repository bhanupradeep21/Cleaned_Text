stem cell fat grafting autotransplantation adiposederived stem cells adscs extracted fatabundant donor sites ie thigh stomach areas face breast hip reconstruct operative areas desirable adscs multipotent stem cells found adipose tissues displaying similar differentiation potentials bone marrowderived mesenchymal stem cells discovery adscs brought great advances field regenerative medicine aesthetic procedureswhilst use embryonic stem cells reconsidered ethical reasons adscs got attention plastic surgeons owing characteristics pluripotent differentiation potential paracrine activities immunomodulatory functions homing regardless numerous benefits side effects oncology safety issues rising investment stem cell cosmetic therapy reflects high expectation demands especially south korea research effectiveness adscs grafting proposed aftermath therapy affected quality stem cells diet fostering adequate conditions stem cell growth sufficient consumption drjames thomson university wisconsin first isolated human embryonic stem cells however due ethical controversies regarding embryonic stem cells induced pluripotent stem cells ipscs proposed substitute remaining oncological concern ipscs eased suggesting adult stem cells primary resource regenerative first isolation mesenchymal stem cells bone marrow done friednstein et al considered primary clinical stem cell source however painful acquisition low cell yield limited research zuk et al isolated adscs found potentials bmmscs although later stem cells identified different parts human body adscs considered safest easiest stem cell isolate require cell expansion thus adscs still used primary source fat transfer concept autologous fat grafting first suggested first report described adipose tissue without changing structure implanted adherent scars osteomyelitis result successful soon widely used different fields aesthetic procedures breast augmentation liposuction procedure invented remove excessive fat depositions later illouz found procedure ideal supplier fat tissue used impurified lipoaspirate transplant fournier proposed reinjection technique aspirated third period starts sr coleman introduced coleman technique uses adipose tissue lipids cell transfer lipoaspirate centrifuged separates stromal vascular fractionsvf including adscs blood tissue fluid yet fat cell retention rate varied first theory explains graft survival cell survival theory suggests transfer viable adipocytes adequate circulation enhances survival rate done developing processing injection techniques minimize recent theory host replacement theory retention rate fat grafting determined adscs replacing adipocytes successful adscs activation replacement adipocytes related early death transferred adipocytes ischemic fang et al proposed adscs widely used due following three characteristics pluripotent differentiation potentials paracrine activity immunomodulatory function adscs one type mesenchymal stem cells mscs exhibit high similarities hence capable multilineage differentiation fats cartilages cardiac muscles nerves skins skeletal muscles also tend survive longer period higher proliferative capacity stem cells adscs secret proangiogenic factors antiapoptotic factors like cytokines chemokines growth factors mrnas micrornas act different systems transplanted regenerate cells transplanted systems moreover adscs resemble bmmscs immunosuppressive characteristics suppressing innate adaptive immune systems however capacity even stronger bmmscs secretion immunosuppressive factors tgfb additionally perform immune tolerators suppress lymphocyte proliferation property suggests possibility adscs homing effect refers engraftment adscs bone marrow endothelium owing arrest adscs within vasculature tissue adscs engrafted bone marrow endothelium circulate across endothelium adhesion interactions activated bone marrow endothelium thus engraftment increases probability longterm survival transferred fats homing effect follows three main processes rolling adhesion transmigration rolling adscs migrate interacts vascular endothelial cells bone marrow shearresistant lowaffinity manners adscs adhere bone marrow endothelium mscs express several different molecules increase adhesion isoforms integrins adscs transmigrate vessels bone marrow interaction signaling
