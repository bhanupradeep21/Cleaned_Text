siblings mediated parents driven direct fitness benefits perpetrator sometimes parents siblicide mainly observed birds word also used unifying term fratricide sororicide human species unlike specific

conditions birds obligate siblicidal behavior results older chick killing facultative siblicidal animals fighting frequent always lead death sibling type behavior often exists patterns different species instance bluefooted booby sibling may hit nest mate day couple weeks attacked random leading death birds facultatively siblicidal obligatory perhaps siblicide takes great amount energy always advantageous siblicide generally occurs resources specifically food sources siblicide advantageous surviving offspring eliminated competition also somewhat advantageous parents surviving offspring likely strongest genes therefore likely highest fitnesscitation needed parents encourage siblicide others prevent itcitation needed resources scarce parents may encourage siblicide offspring survive anyway want strongest offspring survive letting offspring kill saves parents time energy would wasted feeding offspring likely would survive anywayimproper synthesis originally proposed dorward insurance egg hypothesis ieh quickly become widely supported explanation avian siblicide well overproduction eggs siblicidal ieh states extra eggs produced parent serves insurance policy case failure first egg either hatch chick died soon hatching eggs hatch successfully second chick bchick known marginal offspring otherwise stated marginal sense add subtract evolutionary success family increase reproductive evolutionary success two primary ways firstly represents extra unit parental success survives along siblings context hamiltons inclusive fitness theory marginal chick increases total number offspring successfully produced parent therefore adds gene pool parent bird passes next generation secondly serve replacement siblings hatch die prematurelycitation needed inclusive fitness defined animals individual reproductive success plus positive andor negative effects animal siblings reproductive success multiplied animals degree kinship instances siblicide victim usually youngest sibling siblings reproductive value measured much enhances detracts success siblings therefore individual considered marginal marginal sibling act additional element parental success well siblings survive older sibling happens die unexpectedly marginal sibling take place acts insurance death another sibling depends likelihood older sibling dyingcitation needed conflict theory states offspring take actions advance fitness decreasing fitness parents parents increase fitness simultaneously decreasing fitness offspring one driving forces siblicide increases fitness offspring decreasing amount
