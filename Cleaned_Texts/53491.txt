centering issues redshift hubbles law led three start questioning big bang theory originally proposed georges lemaître later advanced george gamow suggested universe expanded extremely dense hot state continues expand today recounted interview physicist historian spencer r weart gold believed reason think creation matter done time none problems fleeting moments arise steady state expansion taking things apart fast new matter comes condenses new two papers published discussing steadystate theory alternative big bang one gold bondi hoyle seminal paper gold bondi asserted although universe expanding nevertheless change look time beginning proposed perfect cosmological principle underpinning theory held universe homogeneous isotropic space time large scale argued nothing outstanding place universe differences exist local significance seen large scale universe however since universe characterized lack evolution distinguishing features recognizable direction time postulated largescale motions universe highlighted two possible types motion largescale expansion reverse largescale estimated within expanding universe hydrogen atoms created vacuum rate one atom per cubic meter per creation matter would keep density universe constant expanded gold bondi also stated issues time scale plagued cosmological theories discrepancy age universe calculated hubble dating radioactive decay terrestrial rocks absent steadystate major problems steadystate theory began emerge observations apparently supported idea universe fact changing quasars radio galaxies found large distances therefore existing distant past closer galaxies whereas big bang theory predicted much steady state predicted objects would found everywhere including close galaxy since evolution would evenly distributed observed great addition proponents theory predicted addition hydrogen atoms antimatter would also produced cosmic gamma ray background annihilation protons antiprotons xray emitting gas creation cosmologists refutation steadystate theory came discovery cosmic microwave background radiation predicted big bang stephen hawking said fact microwave radiation found thought left big bang final nail coffin steadystate bondi conceded theory disproved hoyle gold remained unconvinced number years gold even supported hoyles modified steadystate theory however started express doubts theory maintained despite faults theory helped improve understanding regarding origin gold suggested garbage theory origin life accidental panspermia theory says life earth might spread pile waste products accidentally dumped earth long ago meeting royal astronomical society gold proposed source recent radio signals detected space outside milky way galaxy much derision radio astronomer martin ryle several mathematical cosmologists however year later distant source identified gold announced international astronomical union meeting rome theory proven ryle would later take golds argument
