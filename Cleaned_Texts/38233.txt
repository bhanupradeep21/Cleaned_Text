pulp capping technique used dental restorations prevent dental pulp necrosis exposed nearly exposed cavity preparation traumatic injury deep cavity reaches center tooth causing pulp die dental caries removed tooth infected softened enamel dentin removed lead pulp tooth either exposed nearly exposed causes pulpitis inflammation pulpitis turn become irreversible leading pain pulp necrosis necessitating either root canal treatment ultimate goal pulp capping stepwise caries removal protect healthy dental pulp avoid need root canal therapy prevent pulp deteriorating dental restoration gets near pulp dentist place small amount sedative dressing calcium hydroxide mta materials protect pulp noxious agents heat cold bacteria stimulate cellrich zone pulp lay bridge reparative dentin dentin formation usually starts within days pulp capping delay onset dentin formation odontoblasts pulp injured cavity removal largely completed two different types pulp cap distinguished direct pulp capping protective dressing placed directly exposed pulp indirect pulp capping thin layer softened dentin removed would expose pulp left place protective dressing placed direct pulp cap onestage procedure whereas stepwise caries removal twostage procedure six months technique used pulpal exposure occurs either due caries extending pulp chamber accidentally caries removal feasible exposure made non infected dentin recent history spontaneous pain ie irreversible pulpitis bacteriatight seal exposure made tooth isolated saliva prevent contamination use dental dam already place tooth washed dried protective material placed followed finally dental restoration gives bacteriatight seal prevent infection since pulp capping always successful maintaining vitality pulp dentist usually keep status tooth review year indication direct pulp contraindication direct pulp bodecker introduced stepwise caries excavation swe technique treatment teeth deep caries preservation pulp technique used decay removed deep cavity softened dentin decay remains pulp chamber removed would expose pulp trigger irreversible pulpitis instead dentist intentionally leaves softened dentindecay place uses layer protective temporary material promotes remineralization softened dentin pulp laying new layers tertiary dentin pulp chamber color carious lesion changes light brown dark brown consistency goes soft wet hard dry streptococcus mutans lactobacilli significantly reduced limited number even zero viable organisms radiographs show change even decrease radiolucent temporary filling used keep material place months later cavity reopened hopefully enough sound dentin pulp dentin bridge residual softened dentin removed permanent filling placed method also called stepwise caries difficulty technique estimating rapid carious process much tertiary dentine formed knowing exactly stop excavating avoid pulp following materials studied potential materials direct pulp capping however calcium hydroxide mineral trioxide aggregate mta preferred material choice clinical practice due favourable outcome zinc oxide eugenol zoe commonly used material dentistry use zoe pulp capping material remains controversial due eugenol cytotoxic pulp present large quantity formulation also due nature nonadhesive leads poor coronal seal hence increases microleakage studies demonstrated unfavourable results zoe compared calcium hydroxide direct pulp capping material causes pulpal glass ionomer gi resin modified glass ionomer rmgic widely used lining base material deep cavities pulp close proximity due superior properties good biocompatibility adhesive nature providing coronal seal prevent bacteria infiltration however material choice direct pulp capping use rmgic calcium hydroxide studied direct pulp capping agents rmgic demonstrated increase chronic inflammation pulpal tissues lack reparative dentine bridge materials fall category include adhesives hybridizing dentine bonding agents idea using adhesive materials direct pulp capping explored two decades ago studies demonstrated encourages bleeding due vasodilating properties hence impairing polymerisation material affecting ability provide coronal seal used pulp capping agent addition material triggers chronic inflammation even without presence bacteria makes unfavourable condition pulp healing take place importantly toxicity human pulp cells makes unacceptable material calcium hydroxide caoh organometallic cement introduced dentistry early twentieth since many advantages material described much available literature caoh high antimicrobial activity shown one experiment conducted stuart et al bacteriainoculated root canals extracted human teeth treated caoh hour control group treatment results yielded reductions viable caoh also high ph high solubility thus readily leaches surrounding alkaline environment created around cement suggested give beneficial irritancy pulpal tissues stimulates dentine regeneration one study demonstrated caoh causes release growth factors bioactive molecules dentine matrix induces formation dentine caoh however significant disadvantages set cement low compressive strength withstand support condensation thus good practice place stronger separate lining material eg glass ionomer resinmodified glass ionomer caoh packing final restorative caoh cement adhesive tooth tissues thus provide coronal pulp perfusion studies caoh shown insufficiently seal dentinal tubules presence tunnel defects patent communications within reparative dentine connecting pulp exposure sites indicate potential microleakage caoh suggested adhesive coronal restoration used caoh lining provide adequate coronal seal many advantageous properties longstanding success clinical use used control material multiple experiments pulp capping agents considered gold standard dental material direct pulp capping mineral trioxide aggregate mta recent development initially root canal sealer seen increased interest use direct pulp capping material comprises blend tricalcium silicate dicalcium silicate tricalcium aluminate bismuth oxide added give cement radiopaque properties aid radiological mta shown produce caoh hydration maintains extended duration high ph lab similar caoh alkalinity potentially provides beneficial irritancy stimulates dentine repair mta also demonstrated reliable favourable healing outcomes human teeth used pulp cap teeth diagnosed nothing severe reversible also less coronal microleakage mta one experiment comparing thus suggesting tooth adhesion properties mta also comes white grey may aid visual identification clinically disadvantages also described mta grey mta preparations potentially cause tooth mta also takes long time hours minutes set thus preventing immediate restoration placement without mechanical disruption underlying mta suggested pulp capped mta temporised allow complete setting patient present second visit placement permanent mta also difficult handling properties expensive material thus less cost effective compared although mta shows great promise possibly attributed adhesive properties ability act source caoh available literature experimental studies mta limited due recency studies compare pulp capping abilities mta caoh human teeth yielded generally equal similarly successful healing outcomes histological level several studies conducted success rates direct indirect pulp capping using range different materials one study indirect pulp capping recorded success rates using bioactive tricalcium silicate dentin substitute lightactivated calcium hydroxide liner results show significant difference results indirect pulp capping experiment comparing calcium silicate cement biodentine glass ionomer cement
