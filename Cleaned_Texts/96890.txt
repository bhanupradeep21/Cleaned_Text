surname lacour earliest publications la cour married anne wilkes couple children portrait photography gardening among retirement moved eastbourne died stroke november la cour become skilled making chromosomal preparations light microscopy plants skill microscopic preparation techniques quickly became asset john innes first paper fixatives use plant cytology published nature improved formulation existing fixatives developing three new ones widely used embedding sectioning method preparing samples abandoned favour squash technique improved latter using orcein acetic acid stain fixative subsequent work c fabergé extended technique carboxylic acids produce widely used staining early career la cour assisted various researchers including brenhilda schafer margaret upcott c l huskins f w sansome survey aconitum species chromosomes coauthored schafer employed sidebyside presentation chromosome pairs later became standard way presenting information late la cour started research whether different treatments growing plant taking samples affected appearance chromosomal preparations found cold treatment paris polyphylla resulted differentially stained chromosomes parts chromosome appearing lightly stained c darlington went show differential staining correlated highly condensed heterochromatin recently identified emil results published first ten research papers la cour coauthored darlington long attempts hypothesising basis difference staining density hampered lack knowledge chromosomal structure la cour continued research coldinduced light staining chromosomes trillium species work published showing regions usually found near centromere plants animals including amblystoma returned topic university east anglia studying heterochromatin fritillaria species light studied chromosomal abnormalities induced xrays darlington later alone rutishauser working alone la cour found hyacinthus cells additional nucleolus resistant xray damage demonstrated luzula chromosomes unusual multiple separate centromeres termed polycentric rutishauser also studied spontaneous occurrence chromosomal abnormalities plant endosperm showing generally unusual hybrids two genera paris trillium chromosome breaks common restricted trillium also conducted studies human chromosomes bone collaboration henry harris used radiolabelling show rna synthesised cytoplasm rather nucleus interpreted resulting mitochondrial dna also pinpointed rna synthesis within institute relocated norwich la cour started transmission electron microscopy studies nuclear structure collaboration b wells focusing nucleolus nuclear pores synaptonemal complex structures involved pairing homologous chromosomes meiosis demonstrated fibrils previously identified nucleolus loops hypothesised represented dna used durum wheat strain unable pair chromosomes dissect role different parts synaptonemal complex revealing mutant form cross fibrils later phaedranassa viridiflora pollen
