started separate lines investigations research threads tied recent decades within study allosteric mechanisms basis involvement nicotinic receptors cognitive functions phd studies laboratory jacques monod françois jacob changeux studied allosteric regulations enzymes modulation activity compounds different work led development model concerted transitions allosteric main ideas behind theory proteins exist various conformations thermal equilibrium absence regulators allosteric regulators merely shift equilibrium conformations stabilizing ones display highest affinity subunits symmetrical multimeric protein exist conformation transition taking place concerted fashion resulting model explains observed cooperativity without progressive change biophysical parameters conceptual framework still principal model used explain function cooperative proteins hemoglobin phd thesis changeux suggested recognition transmission signals membrane particular synapses could use mechanisms allosteric regulation enzymes forty years research would follow mainly focussed nicotinic acetylcholine receptors see changeux extended mwc model bidimensional lattice idea would also developed three decades afterward dennis applied idea postsynaptic membrane electric organs analog striated team demonstrated existence several interconvertible states nicotinic receptor resting open desensitized displaying different affinities ligands endogenous agonist transitions states followed different kinetics kinetics plus differential affinities sufficed explain shape postsynaptic potential full mechanistic model nicotinic receptor striated muscle electric organ provided much later changeux collaborated stuart edelstein another specialist allostery worked decades addition allosteric modulation channel
