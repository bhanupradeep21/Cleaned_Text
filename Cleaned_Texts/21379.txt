recombineering recombinationmediated genetic genetic molecular biology technique based homologous recombination systems opposed oldermore common method using restriction enzymes ligases combine dna sequences specified order recombineering widely used bacterial genetics generation target vectors making conditional mouse knockout modifying dna source often contained bacterial artificial chromosome bac among applications although developed bacteria much inspiration recombineering techniques came methods first developed saccharomyces linear plasmid used target genes clone genes chromosome addition recombination singlestrand oligonucleotides oligos first shown saccharomyces recombination observed take place oligonucleotides short bases recombineering based homologous recombination escherichia coli mediated bacteriophage proteins either recerect rac prophage redαβδ bacteriophage lambda red recombination system commonly used first demonstrations red vivo genetic engineering

singlestranded ssdna commonly dsdna recombineering used create gene replacements deletions insertions inversions gene geneprotein tagging tags etc see also common gene replacements deletions usually cassette encoding drugresistance gene made pcr using bipartite primers primers consist bases homology target region cassette inserted followed bases prime drug resistant cassette exact junction sequence final construct determined primer events typically occur frequency approximately survive electroporation electroporation method used transform linear substrate recombining cell cases one desires deletion marker left behind make gene fusion make point mutant gene done two rounds first stage recombineering selection marker cassette introduced replace region modified second stage second counterselection marker eg sacb cassette selected following introduction target fragment containing desired modification alternatively target fragment could flanked loxp frt sites could removed later simply expression cre flp recombinases respectively novel selection marker mfabi also developed increase recombineering recombineering ssdna provided breakthrough efficiency reaction ease making point technique enhanced discovery avoiding methyldirected mismatch repair system frequency obtaining recombinants increased viable frequency high enough alterations made without selection optimized

enterica pseudotuberculosis cerevisiae year demonstrated ssdna recombination occur absence known recombination recombinants found viable cells redindependent activity demonstrated p syringae e coli enterica serovar typhimurium flexneria biggest advantage recombineering obviates need conveniently positioned restriction sites whereas conventional genetic engineering dna modification often compromised availability unique restriction sites engineering large constructs kb bacterial artificial chromosomes bacs chromosomes recombineering become necessity recombineering generate desired
