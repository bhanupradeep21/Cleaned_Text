embolus described freefloating mass located inside blood vessels travel one site blood stream another embolus made solid like blood clot liquid like amniotic fluid gas like air masses get stuck different blood vessel known embolism embolism cause organ lack paradoxical embolism specific type embolism embolus travels right side heart venous circulation left side heart arterial circulation lodges blood vessel known thus termed paradoxical embolus lands artery rather vein embolism may made one numerous materials may find blood vessel including piece thrombus known thromboembolism air intravenous catheter fat globules bone marrow amniotic fluid order embolus become paradoxical embolus must traverse venous circulation veins arterial circulation arteries many routes embolism traverse right venous side heart left arterial side heart routes include moving patent foramen ovale congenital hole connecting right left atria heart ventricular septal defect congenital hole connecting ventricles pulmonary arteriovenous fistula arteries lungs connect directly veins without capillaries although many routes embolism may take enter arterial circulation term paradoxical embolism commonly refers clot passing patent foramen ovale formen ovale open development heart developing fetus normally closes soon birth studies found patent foramen ovale present significant portion population embolus enters arterial circulation continually travels arteries smaller vessels lodging vessels stopping blood flow tissues supplied blood vessels often embolus reach brain cause permanent stoppage blood flow region brain feared complication paradoxical embolism stoppage blood flow brain ischemia called cerebral infarct also known although aging data suggested paradoxical emboli may cause strokes per difficult measure actual rates paradoxical emboli remains challenging definitively diagnose disease many strokes known cause individual embolic event often stroke found patent foramen ovale righttoleft shunt speculative diagnosis paradoxical embolism given although conclusive evidence reported true prevalence disease data suggests presence patent foramen ovales intercardiac shunts associated large increase prevalence strokes unknown etiology suggesting paradoxical embolism may regardless true disease prevalence difficulties surrounding diagnosis may lead underrecognized etiology strokes symptoms experienced individual paradoxical embolism original site thrombus location emboli lodges believed common origin site thrombus deep vein thrombosis dvt however patients suspected paradoxical embolism evidence dvt symptoms dvt include unilateral leg swelling pain warmth redness affected due blockage blood attempting return heart venous system additional findings patient paradoxical embolism dependent upon emboli lodges disrupts blood flow three important clinical manifestations may caused paradoxical embolism include stroke migraine acute myocardial infarction also known heart stroke migraine setting paradoxical embolism caused emboli disrupting blood flow cerebral artery myocardial infarction setting paradoxical embolism caused emboli disrupting blood flow coronary artery physical findings evaluated include comprehensive neurological examination evaluation stroke symptoms weakness gait changes slurred speech facial additionally paradoxical embolism suspected patient findings consistent congenital heart defect may lead righttoleft shunting evaluated include digital clubbing due chronic hypoxemia distal extremities widelysplit pathological heartbeat pattern second heart sound two resources suggest paradoxical embolism expected three findings present simultaneously deep vein thrombosis thrombus occurring large vein usually leg passageway righttoleft shunt allows emboli across heart evidence arterial suspicion raised paradoxical embolism battery tests may ordered patient discussion regarding past medical history family history useful identifying contributing risk factors essential discuss patient personal family history patent foramen ovale congenital heart disease may allowed embolus arterial circulation additionally patients may asked history deep vein thrombosis factors contribute dvt including high blood pressure high cholesterol prior heart attacks diabetes use substance make blood clots likely tobacco estrogen may also specific blood tests known coagulation studies may ordered tests measure quickly blood clot form may include pt ptt inr protein c levels complete blood count cbc also ordered test low ekg may started evaluate abnormal heart rhythms especially atrial fibrillation often cause traditional emboli form heart arterial blood gas measurements metabolic panels may also drawn purpose supportive imaging done various reasons suspected paradoxical embolism including scanning dvt may caused emboli evaluating brain ischemic changes secondary embolism evaluate heart defect could cause emboli enter systemic circulation ultrasound mri imaging ct scans lower extremities help identify possible dvt provides evidence emboli may come venous although imaging modalities used evaluate venous thromboembolism use detecting heart defects limited use mri detect cardiac shunts controversial use ct recommended due exposure ionizing radiation lack functional reported transesophageal echocardiography tee best noninvasive option diagnosing intracardiac shunts like patent foramen ovale additionally need color flow doppler study injection agitated salinecontrast medium followed valsalva maneuver visualize flow blood lower pressure venous system higher pressure arterial similar tee transcranial doppler sonography study also described helping evaluate righttoleft shunts heart however also used detect forms righttoleft shunts including pulmonary arteriovenous malformations needs agitated salinecontrast injected rather imaging heart observes microemboli appear middle cerebral artery artery brain following valsalva ear oximetry also described fairly accurate screening tool shunt measures oxygen saturation blood passes ear following valsalva maneuver pressure increases right heart deoxygenated blood shunted arterial circulation decrease oxygen saturation measured capillaries current recommendation suggest two major goals treatment include medical management thrombotic event help prevent thrombusembolus formation closure patent foramen ovale route let pardoxical paradoxical emboli medically managed similar thromboembolism medical anticoagulation prevent new worsening blood clot formation may occlude vessels cause organ sources suggest anticoagulation heparin performed others give list reasonable drug options including anticoagulants like heparin warfarin antiplatelet therapy like aspirin clopidogrel thrombolytic therapy like alteplase embolus causing life limbthreatening ischemia located reasonable location first visualized fluoroscopy catheter embolectomy performed retrieve clot surgical closure patent foramen ovale atrial septal defects often done outpatient percutaneous surgery although closure patent foramen ovale atrial septal defect theoretically removes pathway arterial embolus enter venous circulation cause paradoxical embolism data suggests closing intracardiac shunts effective medical management alone preventing httpsenwikipediaorgwikiparadoxicalembolism
