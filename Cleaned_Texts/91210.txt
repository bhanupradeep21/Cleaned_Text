male reproductive system consists number sex organs play role process human reproduction organs located outside body within pelvis main male sex organs penis scrotum contains testicles produce semen sperm part sexual intercourse fertilize ovum females body fertilized ovum zygote develops fetus later born infant corresponding system females female reproductive system penis intromittent organ long shaft enlarged bulbousshaped tip called glans foreskin protection inside penis urethra used ejaculate semen excrete urine substances exit meatus male becomes sexually aroused penis becomes erect ready sexual activity erection occurs sinuses within erectile tissues penis corpora cavernosa corpus spongiosum become filled blood arteries penis dilated veins compressed blood flows erectile cartilage pressure penis supplied pudendal artery scrotum sac skin hangs behind penis holds protects testicles also contains numerous nerves blood vessels times lower temperatures cremaster muscle contracts pulls scrotum closer body dartos muscle gives wrinkled appearance temperature increases cremaster dartos muscles relax bring scrotum away body remove wrinkles respectively scrotum remains connected

germ cells within seminiferous synthesize secrete androgens regulate male reproductive functions site production androgens leydig cells located interstitium seminiferous epididymis long whitish mass tightly coiled tube sperm produced seminiferous tubules flow epididymis passage via epididymis sperm undergo maturation concentrated action ion channels located apical membrane vas deferens also known sperm duct thin tube approximately centimetres ft long starts epididymis pelvic cavity carries spermatozoa epididymis ejaculatory duct three accessory glands provide fluids lubricate duct system
