cauliflower ear irreversible condition occurs external portion ear hit develops blood clot collection fluid perichondrium separates cartilage overlying perichondrium supplies nutrients causing die resulting formation fibrous tissue overlying skin result outer ear becomes permanently swollen deformed resembling cauliflower hence name condition common martial arts brazilian jiujitsu wrestling boxing kickboxing judo sumo mixed martial arts fullcontact sports rugby league rugby union people presenting possible auricular hematoma often additional injuries example headneck lacerations due frequently traumatic causes auricular hematoma ear often tense fluctuant tender throbbing pain however potentially remarkable injuries often associated auricular hematoma auricular hematoma easily overlooked without directed common cause cauliflower ear blunt trauma ear leading hematoma left untreated eventually heals give distinct appearance cauliflower ear commonly coming participating grappling combat sports brazilian jiujitsu mixed martial arts structure ear supported cartilaginous scaffold consisting following distinct components helix antihelix concha tragus skin covers cartilage extremely thin virtually subcutaneous fat also strongly attached perichondrium richly vascularized supply avascular cauliflower ear also present setting nontraumatic inflammatory injury auricular connective tissue relapsing polychondritis rp rare rheumatologic disorder recurrent episodes inflammation result destruction cartilage ears joints eyes audiovestibular system cardiovascular system respiratory tract also components ear involved cauliflower ear outer skin perichondrium outer ear skin tightly adherent perichondrium almost subcutaneous fat anterior leaves perichondrium relatively exposed damage direct trauma shear forces created force pushing across ear like punch increasing risk hematoma auricular hematoma blood accumulates perichondrium cartilage hematoma mechanically obstructs blood flow perichondrium avascular lack perfusion puts cartilage risk becoming necrotic andor left untreated disorganized fibrosis cartilage formation occur around aforementioned cartilaginous consequently concave pinna fills disorganized connective cartilage deforms kinks resulting distinctive appearance somewhat resembling rapid evacuation hematoma restores close contact cartilage perichondrium thereby reducing likelihood deformity minimizing ischemia would otherwise result remaining auricular hematoma often occurs potential space helix antihelix scapha extends anteriorly fossa less frequently hematoma may form concha area around external auditory importantly auricular hematoma also occur posterior ear surface even risk necrotic tissue greatest posterior anterior surfaces involved although posterior surface involvement less likely given increased quantity impactdampening subcutaneous perichondral hematoma consequently cauliflower ear diagnosed clinically means medical provider make diagnosis using elements history injury examples participation contact sports trauma ear previous similar episodes combine findings physical exam examples tenderness area bruising deformation ear contours confirm diagnosis decide appropriate treatment assist settling best form treatment cauliflower ear yotsuyanagi et al created classification system deciding surgery needed guide best headgear called scrum cap rugby simply headgear ear guard wrestling martial arts protects ears worn help prevent condition specialty ear splint also made keep ear compressed damaged ear unable fill thus preventing cauliflower ear athletes however cauliflower ear considered badge courage many types treatment perichondral hematoma lead cauliflower ear current body research unable identify single best treatment definitive evidence drainage hematoma better prevention cauliflower deformity compared conservative treatment use bandages andor splinting drainage requires acute hematoma lead cauliflower ear prompt evacuation blood prevent permanent many described techniques drainage blood acute stage prevent hematoma including aspiration continuous suction devices placing wick incision blood drained prevention reaccumulation becomes pressing issue achieved many techniques including direct pressure dressings mattress sutures buttons placed sutures thermoplastic splints sutured cotton balls absorbable mattress use simple drainage becomes less useful six hours injury recurrent trauma cases suggested open surgical treatment effective returning cosmetic appearance prevention outer ear prone infections antibiotics usually pressure applied bandaging helps skin cartilage reconnect clothes pegs magnets custom molded ear also used ensure adequate pressure applied damaged without medical intervention ear sustain serious damage disruption ear canal possible outer ear may wrinkle become slightly pale due reduced blood flow hence common term cauliflower cosmetic procedures available possibly improve appearance presentation cauliflower ear recorded ancient hong kong opium dens opium users would develop cauliflower ear long periods sleeping
