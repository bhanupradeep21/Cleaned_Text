assessment kidney function occurs different ways using presence symptoms signs well measurements using urine tests blood tests medical imaging functions healthy kidney include maintaining persons fluid balance maintaining acidbase balance regulating electrolytes including sodium potassium electrolytes clearing toxins regulating blood pressure regulating hormones erythropoietin activation vitamin dcitation needed functions kidney include maintenance acidbase balance regulation fluid balance regulation sodium potassium electrolytes clearance toxins absorption glucose amino acids small molecules regulation blood pressure production various hormones erythropoietin activation vitamin gfr regarded best overall measure kidneys ability carry numerous functions estimate gfr used clinically determine degree kidney impairment track progression disease gfr however reveal source kidney disease accomplished urinalysis measurement urine protein excretion kidney imaging necessary kidney much renal physiology studied level nephron smallest functional unit kidney nephron begins filtration component filters blood entering kidney filtrate flows along length nephron tubular structure lined single layer specialized cells surrounded capillaries major functions lining cells reabsorption water small molecules filtrate blood secretion wastes blood urinecitation needed proper function kidney requires receives adequately filters blood performed microscopic level many hundreds thousands filtration units called renal corpuscles composed glomerulus bowmans capsule global assessment renal function often ascertained estimating rate filtration called glomerular filtration rate gfr clinical assessment used assess function kidneys person abnormally functioning kidneys may symptoms develop example person chronic kidney disease may develop oedema due failure kidneys regulate water balance may develop evidence chronic kidney disease used assess severity example high blood pressure osteoporosis anaemia kidneys unable excrete urea person may develop widespread itch confusioncitation needed part assessment kidney function includes measurement urine contents abnormal kidney function may cause much little urine produced ability kidneys filter protein often measured urine albumin urine protein measured either single instance variation throughout day urine testscitation needed blood tests also used assess kidney function include tests intended directly measure function kidneys well tests assess function kidneys looking evidence problems associated abnormal function one measures kidney function glomerular filtration rate gfr tests assess function kidneys include assessment electrolyte levels potassium phosphate assessment acidbase status measurement bicarbonate levels vein assessment full blood count anaemiacitation needed glomerular filtration rate gfr describes volume fluid filtered renal kidney glomerular capillaries bowmans capsule per unit creatinine clearance volume blood plasma cleared creatinine per unit time useful measure approximating gfr creatinine clearance exceeds gfr due creatinine blocked cimetidine gfr ccr may accurately calculated comparative measurements substances blood urine estimated formulas using blood test result egfr eccr results tests used assess excretory function kidneys staging chronic kidney disease based categories gfr well albuminuria cause kidney central physiologic maintenance gfr differential basal tone afferent efferent arterioles see diagram words filtration rate dependent difference higher blood pressure created vasoconstriction input afferent arteriole versus lower blood pressure created lesser vasoconstriction output efferent arteriole gfr equal renal clearance ratio solute freely filtered neither reabsorbed secreted kidneys rate therefore measured quantity substance urine originated calculable volume blood relating principle equation substance used product urine concentration urine flow equals mass substance excreted time urine collected mass equals mass filtered glomerulus nothing added removed nephron dividing mass plasma concentration gives volume plasma mass must originally come thus volume plasma fluid entered bowmans capsule within aforementioned period time gfr typically recorded units volume per time eg milliliters per minute mlmin compare filtration fractioncitation needed several different techniques used calculate estimate glomerular filtration rate gfr egfr formula applies gfr calculation equal clearance rate normal range gfr adjusted body surface area average men women younger age children gfr measured inulin clearance years age sexes progressively decreases age gfr decreases progressively age mlmin per yearcitation needed estimated gfr egfr recommended clinical practice guidelines regulatory agencies routine evaluation gfr whereas measured gfr mgfr recommended confirmatory test accurate assessment kidney function also assessed medical imaging forms imaging kidney ultrasound ct scans may assess kidney function indicating chronic disease impact function showing small shrivelled kidneycitation needed tests nuclear medicine tests directly assess function kidney measuring perfusion excretion radioactive substances kidneyscitation needed decreased renal function caused many types kidney disease upon presentation decreased renal function recommended perform history physical examination well performing renal ultrasound urinalysiscitation needed relevant items history medications edema nocturia gross hematuria family history kidney disease diabetes polyuria important items physical examination signs vasculitis lupus erythematosus diabetes endocarditis hypertensioncitation needed urinalysis helpful even showing pathology finding suggests extrarenal etiology proteinuria andor urinary sediment usually indicates presence glomerular disease hematuria may caused glomerular disease disease along urinary tractcitation needed relevant assessments renal ultrasound renal sizes echogenicity signs hydronephrosis renal enlargement usually indicates diabetic nephropathy focal segmental glomerular sclerosis myeloma renal atrophy suggests longstanding chronic renal diseasecitation needed risk factors kidney disease include diabetes high blood pressure family history older age ethnic group smoking patients gfr adequate significant decline gfr previous test result early indicator kidney disease requiring medical intervention sooner kidney dysfunction diagnosed treated greater odds preserving remaining nephrons preventing need dialysis severity chronic kidney disease ckd described six stages severe three defined mdrdegfr value first three also depend whether evidence kidney
