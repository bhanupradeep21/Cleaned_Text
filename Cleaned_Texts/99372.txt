birth order refers order child born family firstborn secondborn examples birth order often believed profound lasting effect psychological development assertion repeatedly recent research consistently found earlier born children score slightly higher average measures intelligence found zero almost zero robust effect birth order nevertheless notion birthorder significantly influences personality continues strong presence pop psychology popular alfred adler austrian psychiatrist contemporary sigmund freud carl jung one first theorists suggest birth order influences personality argued birth order leave indelible impression individuals style life ones habitual way dealing tasks friendship love work according adler firstborns dethroned second child comes along loss perceived privilege primacy may lasting influence middle children may feel ignored overlooked causing develop socalled middle child syndrome younger children may pampered spoiled suggested affect later assumes adler believed typical family situation eg nuclear family living apart extended family without children orphaned average spacing births without twins multiples surviving children severe physical intellectual psychiatric disabilities since adlers time influence birth order development personality become controversial issue psychology among general public widely believed personality strongly influenced birth order many psychologists dispute one modern theory personality states big five personality traits openness conscientiousness extraversion agreeableness neuroticism represent important elements personality measured contemporary empirical research shows birth order influence big five personality book born rebel frank sulloway suggested birth order powerful effects big five personality traits argued firstborns much conscientious socially dominant less agreeable less open new ideas compared however critics fred townsend toni falbo judith rich harris argue sulloways theories full issue politics life sciences dated september published due legal threats sulloway contains carefully rigorously researched criticisms sulloways theories data subsequent large independent multicohort studies revealed approximately zero effect birth order book sibling relationships nature significance across lifespan michael e lamb brian suttonsmith argue individuals continually adjust competing demands socialization agents biological tendencies effects birth order may eliminated reinforced altered later within investigating effects birth order personality selfesteem satisfaction life age study presented sharon johnson determined firstborn children presented initial opportunity find personal niche family due first arrive firstborn children tend form strongest bond parents likely attempt please wanting responsible sibling middleborn children tend show lack attachment parents whole family unit reports showing middleborn children less likely state felt loved childhood due lack attachment middleborn children also prove selfsufficient also less likely turn parent need lastborn children show remarkable similarities firstborn siblings personality exception lastborn children attempt please parents nearly much firstborns claims birth order effects personality received much attention scientific research national academy sciences usa concluding effects near research challenge difficulty controlling variables statistically related birth order family size number social demographic variables associated birth order serve potential confounds example large families generally lower socioeconomic status small families hence thirdborn children third birth order also likely come larger poorer families firstborn children thirdborn children particular trait may due birth order may due family size number variables consequently large number published studies birth order confounded literature reviews examined many studies attempted control confounding variables tend find minimal effects birth order ernst angst reviewed research published also study representative sample young men switzerland found substantial effects birth order concluded birth order research waste recent research analyzed data national sample subjects big five personality traits extraversion neuroticism agreeableness conscientiousness openness experience contrary sulloways predictions found significant correlation birth order selfreported personality however tendency people perceive birth order effects aware birth order smaller studies partially supported sulloways claims paulhus colleagues reported first borns scored higher conservatism conscientiousness achievement orientation later borns higher rebelliousness openness agreeableness authors argued effect emerges clearly studies within families results weak best individuals different families compared reason genetic effects stronger birth order recent studies also support claim children markedly different peers siblings scientists found share many characteristics firstborn children including conscientious well review research judith rich harris suggests birth order effects may exist within context family origin enduring aspects personality people parents siblings firstborns behave differently laterborns even adulthood however people dont spend adult lives childhood home harris provides evidence patterns behavior acquired childhood home dont affect way people behave outside home even childhood harris concludes birth order effects keep turning people keep looking keep analyzing reanalyzing data find several studies found first borns slightly higher iq later data however confounded family turn correlated iq confounds social status robert zajonc argued confluence model lack siblings experienced first borns exposes intellectual adult family environment predicts similar increases iq siblings nextoldest sibling least five years senior children considered functional firstborns theory predicts firstborns intelligent children latter benefit tutor effect ie teaching younger metanalysis polit falbo found firstborns children children one sibling score higher tests verbal ability laterborns children multiple supports conclusion parents smaller families also children higher iqs resource dilution theory rdt suggests siblings divert resources metanalysis however found effect additional claims made instance siblings compete parental affection resources via academic achievement balancing confluence effects claim firstborns higher iq scores disputed data national longitudinal survey youth show relationship birth order likewise data national child development study united kingdom failed support hypothesis states analyses support admixture hypothesis avers apparent birthorder effect intelligence artifact family fraternal birth order effect name given theory older brothers man greater probability homosexual orientation fraternal birth order effect said strongest known predictor sexual orientation older brother increasing mans odds gay approximately one largest studies date however suggests smaller effect higher even fraternal birth order effect accounts maximum one seventh prevalence homosexuality men seems effect sexual orientation women effect number older sisters homosexuality birth order evolution toward equilibrium reproductive economics homosexuality edward miller suggests birth order effect homosexuality may byproduct evolved mechanism shifts personality away heterosexuality laterborn according miller would consequence reducing probability sons engaging unproductive competition evolution may favored biological mechanisms prompting human parents exert affirmative pressure toward heterosexual behavior earlierborn

benefits encouraging heterosexuality weigh less strongly risk psychological damage strongly heteronormative environment poses child predisposed toward homosexuality recently birth order effect
