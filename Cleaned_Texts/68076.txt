ruby maser redesign project us army signal corps reducing cryogenic device pounds kg improving result success maiman persuaded hughes management use company funds support laser project beginning total budget maiman turned development laser based design synthetic ruby crystal scientists seeking make laser felt would may hughes malibu california laboratories maimans solidstate pink ruby laser emitted mankinds first coherent light rays wavelength fully maiman documented invention august two rejections samuel goudsmit physical review besides published scholarly articles describing science technology underlying maiman begun conceptualizing solidstate laser design even undertook maser project moving microwave frequency masers electromagnetic spectrum frequency light would require finding feasible lasing medium excitation source designing major research groups ibm bell labs mit westinghouse rca columbia university among others also pursuing projects develop work stimulated paper arthur l schawlow charles h townes offering theoretical analysis proposal gaseous system using potassium vapor excited potassium however maiman identified multiple flaws schawlowtownes proposal reason rejection solidstate design including significant difference bandgap nature pink rubies red rubies pursued one analyzed ruby enough detail confidence stick successful design used synthetic pink ruby crystal grown linde division union active laser medium helical xenon flash lamp excitation townes later wrote maimans laser several aspects considered theoretical paper discussed others ruby one piece

time magazine cited maimans invention laser among twenty important technological developments many universities granted maiman honorary degrees last simon fraser university recognition maiman laser invention continued posthumously obituary testimonial maser coinventor charles h townes described maimans nature article laser probably important per word papers published nature past annual theodore maiman student paper competition established endowed major laser groups administered osa numerous events staged worldwide major scientific industry photonics organizations celebrate anniversary maimans first laser subsequent lasers umbrella us congress passed resolution celebrating invention laser citing also maimans laser achievement recognized ieee american physical society presented hughes research laboratories plaque commemorate historic site worlds first maiman recognized stanford university stanford engineering hero citing rare blend advanced training physics engineering combined significant laboratory national academy sciences published biographical memoir maiman including tribute nick holonyak unesco declared may international day light celebrated every year
