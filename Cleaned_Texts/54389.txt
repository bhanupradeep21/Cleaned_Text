reinforcement theory argued human behavior result contingent consequences human publicationwhich pushes forward idea get means behavior given right types reinforcers changed better negative behavior reinforced away model selfregulation three main aspects human behavior selfawareness selfreflection selfregulation reinforcements traditionally align selfregulation behavior influenced consequence behavior also antecedents four types behavior management positive reinforcement negative reinforcement positive punishment negative punishment behavioral terms positive means addition negative means removal reinforcement anything increases behavior punishment anything decreases behavior positive reinforcement addition stimulus increases behavior like paycheck negative reinforcement removal aversive stimulus increases behavior like tylenol removes headache positive punishment imposition aversive stimulus decrease behavior negative punishment removal desired stimulus negative punishment commonly occurs removing benefit following poor performance reinforcement punishment require individual consciously perceive effect elicited stimulus still requires conscious effort work towards desired goal extinction involves discontinuing removing reinforcer previously maintained behavior behavior longer contacting reinforcement extinguish rewarding stimuli associated wanting liking desire pleasure respectively appetitive behavior function positive converse statement also true positive reinforcers provide desirable reinforcement require individual consciously perceive effect elicited thus reinforcement occurs observable strengthening behavior however also negative reinforcement characterized taking away undesirable stimulus changing someones job might serve negative reinforcer someone back problems eg changing laborers job office position generally term reinforcement refers enhancement behavior term also sometimes used denote enhancement memory example posttraining reinforcement refers provision stimulus food learning session attempt increase retained breadth detail duration individual memories overall memory memoryenhancing stimulus also one whose effects

significant stimulus people appropriate age able remember learned assassination john f kennedy september terrorist reinforcement important part operant instrumental conditioning behavioral sciences terms positive negative refer used strict technical sense nature action performed conditioner rather responding operants evaluation action consequences positive actions add factor pleasant unpleasant environment whereas negative actions remove withhold environment factor either type turn strict sense reinforcement refers rewardbased conditioning introduction unpleasant factors removal withholding pleasant factors instead referred punishment used strict sense thus stands contradistinction reinforcement thus positive reinforcement refers addition pleasant factor positive punishment refers addition unpleasant factor negative reinforcement refers removal withholding unpleasant factor negative punishment refers removal withholding pleasant factor usage odds nontechnical usages four term combinations especially case term negative reinforcement often used denote technical parlance would describe positive punishment nontechnical usage interprets reinforcement subsuming reward punishment negative referring responding operants evaluation factor introduced contrast technical parlance would use term negative reinforcement describe encouragement given behavior creating scenario unpleasant

wellknown influential researcher articulated many theoretical constructs reinforcement behaviorism skinner defined reinforcers according change response strength response rate rather subjective criteria pleasurable valuable someone accordingly activities foods items considered pleasant enjoyable may necessarily reinforcing produce increase response preceding stimuli settings activities fit definition reinforcers behavior immediately precedes potential reinforcer increases similar situations future example child receives cookie asks one frequency cookierequesting behavior increases cookie seen reinforcing cookierequesting behavior however cookierequesting behavior increase cookie considered reinforcing sole criterion determines stimulus reinforcing change probability behavior

number others continued research notably bf skinner published seminal work topic behavior organisms elaborated research many subsequent notably skinner argued positive reinforcement superior punishment shaping though punishment may seem opposite reinforcement skinner claimed differ immensely saying positive reinforcement results lasting behavioral modification longterm whereas punishment changes behavior temporarily shortterm many detrimental sideeffects great many researchers subsequently expanded understanding reinforcement challenged skinners conclusions example azrin holz defined punishment consequence behavior reduces future probability behavior studies shown positive reinforcement punishment equally effective modifying behavior research effects positive reinforcement

happening negative reinforcement punishment manager wants stop ineffective behavior punishing individual retribution behavioral strategy coercion builds negative effects depression aggression thorndikes law effect says behavior followed negative consequence tend decrease extinction happens given behavior ignored ie followed consequence disappear time behavior continuously receives reaction behavior extinction spikes first declines extinction deliberate order effect subjects behavior following examples demonstrate scenarios intentionally unintentionally applied reinforcers serve increase behaviors whereas punishers serve decrease behaviors thus positive reinforcers stimuli subject work attain negative reinforcers stimuli subject work rid table illustrates adding subtracting stimuli pleasant aversive relation reinforcement vs punishment example offering child candy cleans room positive reinforcement spanking child breaks window positive punishment taking away childs toys misbehaving negative punishment giving child break chores performs well test negative reinforcement positive negative carry meaning good bad usage primary reinforcer sometimes called unconditioned reinforcer stimulus require pairing different stimulus order function reinforcer likely obtained function evolution role species examples primary reinforcers include food water sex primary reinforcers certain drugs may mimic effects primary reinforcers primary reinforcers fairly stable life across individuals reinforcing value different primary reinforcers varies due multiple factors eg genetics experience thus one person may prefer one type food another avoids one person may eat much food another eats little even though food primary reinforcer individuals value food reinforcer differs secondary reinforcer sometimes called conditioned reinforcer stimulus situation acquired function reinforcer pairing stimulus functions reinforcer stimulus may primary reinforcer another conditioned reinforcer money example secondary reinforcer would sound clicker used clicker training sound clicker associated praise treats subsequently sound clicker may function reinforcer another common example sound people clapping nothing inherently positive hearing sound learned associated praise rewards trying distinguish primary secondary reinforcers human examples use caveman test stimulus something
