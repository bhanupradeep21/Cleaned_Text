foreskin fused remains non retractable early childhood continues tight skin begins loosen significantly puberty allowing glans completely exposed needed age eighteen boys fully retractable cases cultural medical prophylactic reasons men undergo circumcision procedure foreskin partially completely removed glans circumcised men remains fully exposed dry several studies suggested glans generally equally sensitive circumcised uncircumcised glans develops terminal end phallic structure called genital tubercle forms embryo regardless sex early weeks initially undifferentiated tubercle develops penis development reproductive system depending exposure male hormones androgens mammals sexual differentiation determined sperm carries either x male chromosome contains sexdetermining gene sry
