chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia cpeo type eye disorder characterized slowly progressive inability move eyes often feature mitochondrial disease case term cpeo may given diagnosis people suffering mitochondrial disease cpeo occurs part syndrome involving one part body syndrome occasionally cpeo may caused conditions mitochondrial diseases cpeo rare disease may affect ages typically manifests young adult years cpeo common manifestation mitochondrial myopathy occurring estimated twothirds cases mitochondrial myopathy patients typically present ptosis drooping eyelids diseases like graves disease myasthenia gravis glioma may cause external ophthalmoplegia must ruled outcitation needed cpeo slowly progressing disease may begin age progresses period first presenting symptom ptosis often unnoticed patient lids droop point producing visual field defect often patients tilt head backwards adjust slowly progressing ptosis lids addition ptosis becomes complete patients use frontalis forehead muscle help elevate lids ptosis typically bilateral may unilateral period months years fellow lid becomes involvedcitation needed ophthalmoplegia inability difficulty move eye usually symmetrical therefore patients affected diplopia double vision progressive ophthalmoplegia often unnoticed till decreased ocular motility limits peripheral vision often someone else point ocular disturbance patient patients move heads adjust loss peripheral vision caused inability abduct adduct eye directions gaze affected however downward gaze appears best spared contrast progressive supranuclear palsy psp typically affects vertical gaze spares horizontal gazecitation needed mitochondrial retinopathy described cpeo presents spectrum distinct retinal phenotypes includes mild focal pigmentary abnormalities funduscopy widespread granular pigmented fundus alterations mild asymptomatic retinopathy might underreported severe retinopathy may associated significant vision loss weakness extraocular muscle groups including orbicularis oculi muscle well facial limb muscles may present patients cpeo result orbicularis oculi weakness patients may suffer exposure keratopathy damage cornea inability close eyes tightly frontalis muscle weakness may exacerbate ptotic lids inability compensate ptosis facial muscles may involved lead atrophy facial muscle groups producing thin expressionless face difficulty chewing neck shoulder extremity weakness atrophy may affect patients mild severecitation needed mild visual impairment seen patients evaluated using visual function index ciliary muscles control lens shape iris muscles often unaffected cpeocitation needed additional symptoms variable may include exercise intolerance cataracts hearing loss sensory axonal neuropathy ataxia clinical depression hypogonadism parkinsonismcitation needed syndrome characterized onset years age cpeo heart block pigmentary mitochondrial dna transmitted mother encodes proteins critical respiratory chain required produce adenosine triphosphate atp deletions mutations segments mtdna lead defective function oxidative phosphorylation may made evident highly oxidative tissues like skeletal muscle heart tissue however extraocular muscles contain volume mitochondria several times greater muscle group results preferential ocular symptoms cpeocitation needed multiple mtdna abnormalities exist cause cpeo one mutation located conserved region mitochondrial trna nucleotide g nucleotide transition mutation associated cpeo mitochondrial encephalomyopathy lactic acidosis strokelike episodes common deletion found onethird cpeo patients base pair segment found base pair repeatcitation needed mtdna affected maybe single multiple point deletion associated nuclear dna deletions one study showed mtdna deletion seen cpeo patients also associated nuclear dna deletion twinkle gene encodes specific mitochondrial protein whether tissue affected correlated amount oxidative demands relation amount mtdna deletioncitation neededin cases peo occurs due sporadic deletion duplication within mitochondrial however transmission mother progeny appears cases autosomal dominant autosomal recessive inheritance occur autosomal recessive inheritance severe dominant recessive forms peo caused genetic mutations polg important differentiate cpeo pathologies may cause ophthalmoplegia specific therapies used pathologiescitation needed cpeo diagnosed via muscle biopsy examination muscle fibers stained gömöri trichrome stain one see accumulation enlarged mitochondria produces dark red staining muscle fibers given name ragged red fibers ragged red fibers seen normal aging amounts excess normal aging give diagnosis mitochondrial myopathycitation needed polymerase chain reaction pcr sample blood muscle tissue determine mutation mtdnacitation needed elevated acetylcholine receptor antibody level typically seen myasthenia gravis seen certain patients mitochondrial associated important dilated eye exam determine pigmentary retinopathy may signify syndrome associated cardiac abnormalitiescitation needed mri may helpful diagnosis one study volumes medial rectus lateral rectus inferior rectus muscles cpeo smaller normal contrast profound atrophy typical neurogenic paralysis although volumes superior rectus musclelevator complex superior oblique significantly currently defined treatment ameliorate muscle weakness cpeo treatments used treat pathologies causing ophthalmoplegia shown effectivecitation needed experimental treatment tetracycline used improve ocular motility one coenzyme also used treat however neuroophthalmologists ascribe treatmentcitation needed ptosis associated cpeo may corrected surgery raise however due weakness orbicularis oculi muscles care must taken raise lids excess causing inability close lids results exposure keratopathy therefore rarely lid surgery performed neuroophthalmologist familiar diseasecitation needed common strabismus finding large angle exotropia treated maximal bilateral eye surgery due progressive nature disease strabismus may diplopia result asymmetric ophthalmoplegia may corrected prisms surgery create better alignment eyescitation needed httpsenwikipediaorgwikichronicprogressiveexternalophthalmoplegia
