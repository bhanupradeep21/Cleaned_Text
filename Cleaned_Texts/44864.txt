well interviewers judge participant yet adequately trained des holds observing experience difficult sustained efforts participant interviewer coinvestigators required follows example admissible des sample researchers compile based participants interview steven pacing around condo engaged mental argument beep innerly saying word whatever voice directed person mentally arguing also aware sense

example could coded containing inner speaking whatever element feeling sense frustration sensory awareness restless energy coding intrasubject intersubject intergroup analysis also performed interview procedure detailed books like exploring inner experience descriptive experience sampling also available interactive video des interviews follow rigorous guidelines core component bracketing presuppositions interviewers must leave behind notions think experience like participants experience may different participants also trained bracket presuppositions might first preconceived notions experience prevent careful observation des literature contains examples participants originally mistaken experience example one participant donald prior des described experience mostly consisting anxiety des sampling revealed good deal samples angry specifically donald denied theme shown samples hurlburt interprets retrospective selfaccounts often incorrect presuppositions difficult overcome order reach accurate descriptions without biasing participants des uses hurlburt calls openbeginninged probes one question could anything experience moment beep phrasings like thinking moment beep could bias example suggesting need report something qualifies thinking interviews avoid generalizations guide participants toward concrete example participant might answer always talking admissible des goal find experience specifically instance beep questions arent contentneutral interviewers give multiple options example participant describes mental image next step could eliciting greater precision questioning could proceed borders around image borders sure opportunities given participants revise story change completely interviewers pay attention subjunctification includes hesitation

discuss potential limitations method another line criticism des doesnt go far enough uncovering certain aspects experience example narrow temporal scope might leave certain temporally extended lack directing participants awareness could mean misses certain nuances hurlburt acknowledges des samples incomplete may miss elements confident reported elements important capturing possible elements experience key insight des research variable individual experience different participants different kinds conscious experience hurlburt writes sampled people whose inner experience characterized almost exclusively inner speech others whose inner experience characterized almost exclusively images sensory awareness unsymbolized thinking feelings others whose inner experience characterized combination whose inner experience characterized many simultaneous events others whose inner experience characterized almost exclusively one event time yes think people importantly different comes inner des used form generalizations groups example regarding various mental disorders researchers emphasize beyond generalizations retain importance individual experience researchers call idiographic focus hurlburt gives example participant rd described thoughts solid light goal interviewing determine whether distinction represented salient aspect rds experience merely quirk descriptions questioning hurlburt concluded division indeed salient feature light thought meant rd deeply focused thought working thought solid thought contrast heavily concentrated deeply focused division experience solid light common particularities individual experience emerge sampling doesnt however preclude sampling participants revealing similarities interviewers recognize primary focus individual experience build understanding consistent features across participants example research identified five particularly frequent phenomena sensory awareness inner speaking images feelings unsymbolized thinking one study looked inner experience college students estimate frequencies frequency varied substantially individual instance nine participants samples sensory awareness throughout ten samples one participant sensory awareness samples follows description five frequent phenomena examples studies denotes paying particular attention sensory aspects world ones body example participant might notice shiny blueness feel coldness iced drink hear feature friend voice feel muscle twinge coded sensory awareness participant focused merely passive background hurlburt gives example someone skillfully driving car without attention directed surroundings compares someone driving car attention particular yellow color yellow line latter would coded sensory awareness noted great intrasubject variability sensory awareness participants hardly ever attuned sensory aspects environment participants sensory awareness nearly every sample multiple different instances one variations sensory awareness may play role psychopathology one study people autism could sensory awareness occupy samples exclusion people schizophrenia distortions sensory scratched warped inner speaking denotes might call selftalk voice head whereas use phrases metaphorically quite literal inner speaking take different often participants voice although take characteristics people know sometimes tone pitch auditory characteristics clear sometimes sometimes voice occupies specific regions often participants heads sometimes localization metaphorical sometimes localization inner speaking sometimes fully express thoughts times may emphasize certain called partially worded speech aforementioned study frequent phenomena experience presence inner speaking correlated decrease psychological inner speaking might role lessening psychological distress sometimes called inner seeing refers mental images different participants observing world front participant could instance physically office mental image palm tree beach des researchers observed good deal variability regarding mental images samples sometimes images clear sometimes vague illdefined sometimes appear borders around like photograph sometimes appear participant present scene sometimes color sometimes black white hurlburt heavey speculate inner seeing skill take time acquire also lost illustrate example boy moment beep mental image hole digging real life asked like real hole boy replied yes except real hole toys beeped couple minutes would time finish picture authors infer creating detailed mental images skill adults might take granted takes practice develop compare sampling women whose mental images entirely blackandwhite brownand speculate detailed colored inner seeing skill declined age code denotes awareness emotional experiences like sadness happiness worry frustration des feelings refer physical sensations coded sensory awareness also distinguished emotions emotional processes may ongoing always direct experience samples example participants behavioral manifestations anger angry exact codes great deal variability participants study college students five instances feelings one feelings samples contrary feelings always present experience least ability des discern sometimes feelings clear sometimes sometimes multiple feelings mixed together example happiness tinge sometimes feelings clear bodily location sometimes similarly mental images hurlburt speculates experience feelings may also skill takes time develop uses example sample watched show one favorite tv characters died moment right beep repeating sad sad actually feeling sad moment verbal repetition may served coordinate skillful ability feeling sadness code refers thoughts clear differentiated content discernible features carry content images words kinds example one sample abigail wondering whether friend pick car pickup content clear words images accompanying merely content consciousness scholars deny existence unsymbolized thinking often based selfinitiated selfdirected introspection without defined many des participants unsymbolized thinking without beforehand recognizing feature experience since content clear unsymbolized thinking might first mistaken phenomena like inner speaking even decades research hurlburt unable recognize unsymbolized thinking experience des sampling revealed common dess focus first individual samples individual people commonalities may however emerge certain groups includes people psychiatric diagnoses many studies small sample sizes could considered exploratory clearer findings replications example regarding bulimia nervosa bulimic participants multiple des studies found researchers termed fragmented multiplicity means bulimic individuals multiple elements experience time could simultaneous images feelings kinds experience may dozen simultaneous elements depending participant proportion samples multiple fragmented inner experience ranged simultaneous elements may may focused body image issues shows bulimia may characterized process experience content example sample showing fragmented multiplicity sample jessica looking digital camera display seeing photo boyfriend taken recent trip chicago seeing photo also innerly seeing least five separate simultaneous overlapping visual scenes places visited chicago inner seeings fuzzy indistinct apprehended looking snapshots scenes edges example simultaneously innerly seeing boyfriend standing close together kitchen sink seeing somewhat clearer chicago scenes jessica left boyfriend right seen back recreation event actually taken place viewed behind obviously impossible perspective taken reality simultaneous feeling happy apprehended volleyballsized sensation deep stomach also one sample jessica multiple instance inner seeing simultaneous feeling elements didnt occur sequentially lengthy period time present another feature bulimic experience elements leaving direct consciousness still lingering might reoccur participants different terms example calling elements tails visible tails fish hiding regarding fragmented multiplicity tails participants generally unaware features sampling features also described elsewhere literature show valid des may able uncover features methods miss features could potentially useful diagnosing treating mental illnesses one small study looked three adults aspergers syndrome diagnosis recognized belonging autism spectrum one participant experience unclear remaining two visual images dominant feature experience mental images visual sensory awareness occupied participant samples cognitive processes like problem solving manifested images one participant also described images forming shape thoughts example one sample looking brick wall visually focused three four bricks described thoughts taken shape bricks awareness completely occupied nothing small sample five individuals characteristics compared individuals without psychiatric diagnoses anxiety disorder relatively high frequency indeterminate visual images samples indeterminate images images little clarity color detail another feature relatively high frequency worded present without innerly spoken heard participants also commonly repetitive rumination critical critical participant others another feature hurlburt calls understanding happening speaking understanding others required effort concentration speaking simply occurred undirected effortless people without anxiety often opposite true speaking take effort understanding sampling schizophrenic participants revealed images experientially important color images images could exist concretely nonschizophrenic participants images visual sensory awareness could often goofed warped otherwise distorted hurlburt speculates schizophrenia may disorder distorted perception disorganized association another inference based interview analysis decompensating schizophrenics midst severe episodes may sometimes inner experience des sampling results depressed people inconsistent one study found depressed people much greater frequency unsymbolized thinking nondepressed clarity thinking decreases depression another study replicate study also find statistically significant differences depressive symptomology depressed nondepressed people means depressed group significant increase samples depression anxiety fatigue body discomfort negative feelings negative content reduced positive feelings one study looked different response styles vs rumination response style cope negative content repeatedly mulling distraction response style cope distracting thoughts people rumination response style higher frequency unsymbolized thinking feelings reasons unclear findings could depression broad symptom cluster making difficult commonalities emerge division different subtypes response style study could useful psychopathology another reason could identification depression depend selfschemas may reflect experiential depression questionnaires rely memory retrospection participants selfschema could influence answer questionnaires des samples minimize memory demands give different picture experience another reason unclear findings could des narrow temporal scope may uncover aspects depression des used combination neuroimaging pursuit bridging understanding mind physical substrate one study found des revealed samples inner speaking mri scanner classical language areas brain study showed language areas activated spontaneous inner speaking different areas active participants scanned resting given particular instruction collected samples included inner speaking analyzed brain activation inner speaking different inner speaking typically elicited fmri studies participants follow instructions specific tasks authors conclude wary extrapolating taskbased fmri infer natural experience another study analyzed des samples say resting state des samples collected participants default mode network active default mode network commonly seen responsible resting state study found variety experience participants could different frequencies five frequent phenomena described counter scientific literature describing resting state consciousness unified phenomenon authors also proffer accurately describe resting state unconstrained activity another study researchers rated des samples scanner either internally externally directed internally directed samples correlated default mode network activity model able predict raters choices based neural data demonstrates step towards able describe consciousness based neuroimaging study lefthanded participants number salient features emerged including words experienced without semantic significance verbal content could present experience without accompanying meaning participants could either looking words visually imagining innerly speaking focus visual auditory aspects words rather represented may lefthanders differing lateralization brain function quite des samples participants appear experience experience defined broadest ways best recollection thoughts emotions sensation anything else could constitute experience example one sample participant ben experience describes like void within many philosophers consciousness argue impossible always type hurlburt argues process questioning leading conclusion absent experience thorough still des completely rule minimal experience des research hypothesized absence near absence experience example one participant autism shizophrenic participants symptoms become study found contrary beliefs
