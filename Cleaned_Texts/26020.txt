archaeoniscus ˌɑːrkiːˈoʊnɪskəs genus prehistoric isopods first appeared bajocian stage middle jurassic widespread genus paleogeographic distribution encompassing continental margin environments central atlantic ocean western tethys ocean fossils archaeoniscus suggest genus lived diverse aquatic habitats including marine paralic freshwater environments earlier descriptions suggested may ectoparasitic association fishes researchers argue least two species aranguthyorum coreaensis lived benthic freeliving lifestyle based morphological characteristics either unsuitable unrelated parasitic behavior six species named two species known jurassic period rocks europe four known cretaceous period rocks europe north america east asia species taxonomic position late cretaceous species texanus uncertain researchers claim species neglected significant morphological differences comparison species within genus specimens completely known species aranguthyorum suggest female individuals species possibly brood pouches indicating genus may sexual dimorphism alternative interpretation suggests brood pouches may actually impressions hindgut anus additionally two unnamed indeterminate species known early cretaceous rocks mexico egypt reverend peter bellinger brodie first discovered crustacean fossils purbeck group vale wardour england asked henri milneedwards examine specimens formally describe specimens sent milneedwards measured cm length though descriptions indicate lengths cm brodie claimed also found larger specimens size small trilobites milneedwards identified specimens belong order isopoda suggested may belong within range family cymothoidae possibly intermediate species serolis cymothoa milneedwards proposed genus name archaeoniscus species name brodiei honor discoverer rev p b lithostratigraphic group charles willcox collected various insect fossils sent john westwood upon examination westwood found several isopod specimens varied size either equal larger brodiei westwood considered new species archaeoniscus designated specimens new species name edwardsii honor brodiei discovered late jurassic oxfordiantithonian strata england france germany edwardsii discovered early cretaceous berriasian strata wilhelm haack erected monotypic family archaeoniscidae claimed distinct suborder oniscidea based large pleotelson shapes antennulae antennae robert w wieder rodney feldmann examined various isopod fossils austin chalk texas united states fossils wieder feldmann considered specimens known posterior exuviae belong archaeoniscus based raised axial node pleotelson claim distinct almost every known isopod species although tentatively referred specimens new species name texanus acknowledged taxonomic placement specimens difficult still considered placement prudent enough better erecting new genus name establishing taxonomic affinities stratigraphic age austin chalk late cretaceous coniaciansantonian texanus youngest known species feldmann colleagues described new species aranguthyorum discovered tlayúa formation park colleagues described new freshwaterliving species coreaensis discovered jinju formation south korea species aranguthyorum coreaensis lived early cretaceous new species italiensis discovered plattenkalk beds monte fallano italy within genus italiensis oldest known species lived middle jurassic unnamed early cretaceous species discovered valanginianhauterivian stage rocks mexico albian stage rocks archaeoniscus generally ovalshaped body dorsoventrally compressed lateral margins pereion thorax crustaceans consist broad overlapping coxal plates distinguishable sutures head embedded first pereonite first segment pereion also possesses mandibles positioned transversely broad incisor process globular eyes lateral margin four anterior pleonites parts abdomen crustaceans called pleon long wide fifth pleonite relatively reduced extend lateral margin archaeoniscus lacks marginal spines broad semicircular pleotelson structure formed fusion last abdominal segment arthropod telson unmodified ambulatory pereiopods distinct coxal dorsal articulations distinguishable modern cymothoids suggesting genus suited ectoparasitic behavior antennulae large multiarticulate spinelike uropodal rami narrow parallelsided texanus significant morphological differences comparison species within genus including presence long fifth pleonite triangular epimeres shorter pleotelson robust archaeoniscus initially described possible cymothoid contained monotypic family archaeoniscidae unclear phylogenetic position within order isopoda controversial classification may occurred earlier studies misinterpreted anatomical characteristics archaeoniscus reconstructions provided haack vega colleagues morphological data genus insufficient definitive suprafamilial robert r hessler argued features genus resemble suborder oniscidea acknowledged features noted haack distinguish genus although commonly placed within suborder flabellifera view disputed since johann wolfgang feldmann colleagues claimed possible brood pouches found specimens aranguthyorum may indicate archaeoniscus might belong suborder sphaeromatidea assumed presence brood pouch characteristic observed female sphaeromatid following suggestion vega colleagues placed genus within superfamily sphaeromatoidea suborder however brandt colleagues consider genus within suborder sphaeromatidea considered ancestral taxon terrestrial isopods without specific reasoning behind park colleagues argued feldmann colleagues mistaken impressions hindgut anus aranguthyorum possible brood pouches female isopods brood pouches thus taxonomic position genus still unclear also argued texanus removed genus significantly differs species possessing flat limbs five subequal pleonites fifth longest contrast species archaeoniscus possess narrow rodlike limbs four free subequal pleonites fifth vega colleagues also advocated view texanus morphologically different species new genus name erected species also considered latest occurrence archaeoniscus may likely albian stage early earlier descriptions genus indicated taxonomic association cymothoids feldmann colleagues considered archaeoniscus may ectoparasites fishes like modern park colleagues disagreed view claiming morphological characteristics aranguthyorum coreaensis suggest otherwise researchers pointed anterior limbs archaeoniscus unmodified ambulatory contrary modern cymothoids resemble hooks also stated shape limbs flattened body resemble serolids sphaeromatids live benthic zones interpretation suggests least two species archaeoniscus aranguthyorum coreaensis likely lived benthic lifestyle without parasitic association additionally feldmann colleagues suggested archaeoniscus sexual dimorphism based possible existence brood park colleagues also disagreed claim arguing feldmann colleagues misidentified impressions hindgut
