periodontal ligament commonly abbreviated pdl group specialized connective tissue fibers essentially attach tooth alveolar bone within inserts root cementum one side onto alveolar bone pdl consists principal fibres loose connective tissue blast clast cells oxytalan fibres cell rest main principal fiber group alveolodental ligament consists five fiber subgroups alveolar crest horizontal oblique apical interradicular multirooted teeth principal fibers alveolodental ligament transseptal fibers fibers help tooth withstand naturally substantial compressive forces occur chewing remain embedded bone ends principal fibers within either cementum alveolar bone proper considered sharpey fibers transseptal fibers h extend interproximally alveolar bone crest embedded cementum adjacent teeth form interdental ligament fibers keep teeth aligned fibers may considered belonging gingival tissue osseous fibres consistent reconstructed even destruction alveolar bone loose connective tissue contains fibres extracellular matrix cells nerves blood vessels extracellular compartment consists type collagen fibers bundles embedded intercellular substance pdl collagen fibers categorized according orientation location along tooth cells include fibroblast defence cells undifferentiated mesenchymal cells groups epithelial cells become located mature pdl disintegration hertwig epithelial root sheath formation form plexus surrounds tooth cell rests malassez might proliferate inflammation may lead radicular cyst formation later life oxytalan fibres unique pdl elastic nature inserts cementum

norepinephrine release causes vasoconstriction limits tissue perfusion nicotine jeopardises bone formation inhibiting neovascularization osteoblastic ankylosis condition cementum tooths root fuses bone around tooth osseous tissue replaces periodontal ligament causes tooth fixed undergo eruptive change ankylosis usually occurs primary molars however also take place primary teeth well secondary dentition ankylosis common anterior tooth trauma referred replacement resorption process pdl cells destroyed result cells alveolar bone perform healing radiographic examination patient ankylosis may
