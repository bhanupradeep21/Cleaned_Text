dermatomyositis dm longterm inflammatory disorder affects skin symptoms generally skin rash worsening muscle weakness may occur suddenly develop symptoms may include weight loss fever lung inflammation light complications may include calcium deposits muscles cause theories include autoimmune disease result viral dermatomyositis may develop paraneoplastic syndrome associated several forms type inflammatory diagnosis typically based combination symptoms blood tests electromyography muscle eighty percent adults adultonset dermatomyositis myositisspecific antibody sixty percent children juvenile dermatomyositis myositisspecific antibody although cure condition known treatments generally improve treatments may include medication physical therapy exercise heat therapy orthotics assistive devices medications corticosteroids family typically used agents methotrexate azathioprine recommended steroids working intravenous immunoglobulin may also improve people improve treatment condition resolves one per people per year newly condition usually occurs women affected often people age however may condition first described main symptoms include several kinds skin rash along muscle weakness upper arms one form rashes take called heliotrope purplish color lilac may also red occur around eyes along swelling also occurs upper chest back called shawl around neck vsign breasts may also occur face upper arms thighs another form rash takes called gottrons sign red violet sometimes scaly slightly raised papules erupt finger joints metacarpophalangeal joints interphalangeal gottrons papules may also found bony prominences including elbows knees feet rashes made worse exposure sunlight often itchy painful may person exhibits skin findings characteristic dm

standard treatment dermatomyositis corticosteroid drug given either pill form intravenously immunosuppressant drugs azathioprine methotrexate may reduce inflammation people respond well prednisone periodic treatment using intravenous immunoglobulin also improve recovery immunosuppressive agents used treat inflammation associated dermatomyositis include cyclosporine cyclophosphamide physical therapy usually recommended prevent muscle atrophy regain muscle strength range motion many individuals dermatomyositis may need topical ointment topical corticosteroids skin disorder wear highprotection sunscreen protective clothing surgery may required remove calcium deposits cause nerve pain recurrent antimalarial medications especially hydroxychloroquine chloroquine used treat
