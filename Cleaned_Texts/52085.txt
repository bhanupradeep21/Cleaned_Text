animal psychopathology study mental behavioral disorders nonhuman animals historically anthropocentric tendency emphasize study animal psychopathologies models human mental animal psychopathologies evolutionary point view properly regarded nonadaptive behaviors due sort cognitive disability emotional impairment distress article provides nonexhaustive list animal psychopathologies animals wild appear relatively free eating disorders although body composition fluctuates depending seasonal reproductive cycles however domesticated animals including farm laboratory pet animals prone disorders evolutionary fitness drives feeding behavior wild animals expectation farm animals also display behavior questions arise principles apply laboratory pet animals activity anorexia aa condition rats begin exercise excessively simultaneously cutting food intake similar human anorexia nervosa hypergymnasia given free access food exercise wheel rats normally develop balanced routine exercise food intake turns fit rats however food intake restricted wheel access unrestricted rats begin exercise eat less resulting excessive weight loss ultimately death running cycles shift running done hours feeding scheduled conditions aa develop unrestricted food access restricted wheel access cause significant change either feeding exercise routine also rats restricted food intake wheel access adjust accordingly fact rats first trained feeding schedule given unrestricted access running wheel develop aa behavior results support notion running interferes adaptation new feeding schedule associated reward system one theory running simulates foraging natural behavior wild rats laboratory rats therefore run forage response food shortages effect semistarvation activity also studied primates rhesus macaque males become hyperactive response longterm chronic food thin sow syndrome tss behavior observed stalled sows similar aa sows early pregnancy extremely active eat little waste away resulting often death experience emaciation hypothermia depraved appetite restlessness syndrome may mainly related social environmental stressors stress stalled sows often perceived consequence restraint animals happens intensive production units sows experience restraining conditions lactating pregnant little room move around kept barred gestation crates tethered weeks pregnancy prevents natural social however increased movement freedom also stressful adult sows usually case weaning placed groups fight vigorously one dominant sow emerging eats voraciously also likely two subordinate sows make part group actively avoid competitive feeding situations bullied dominant sow affected sows poor appetite often show pica excessive water intake polydipsia studies effects overcrowding conducted placing pregnant norway rats room plenty water food observing population growth population reached number individuals grow thereafter overcrowding produced stress psychopathologies even though plenty water food rats stopped eating similar effects also observed dense populations beetles overcrowding occurs female beetles destroy eggs turn cannibalistic eating male beetles lose interest females although plenty water food population growth similar effects observed overcrowded situations jack rabbits pica ingestion nonnutritive substances far poorly documented nonhuman animals laboratory examined ingestion kaolin clay mineral rats rats induced intake kaolin administering various emetic stimuli copper sulfate apomorphine cisplatin motion rats unable vomit ingest substance harmful thus pica rats analogous vomiting species way rats relieve digestive animals pica seems adaptive trait others seems true psychopathology like case chickens chickens display type pica feeddeprived feeding restriction adopted egg industry induce molting increase nonnutritive pecking pecking structural features environment like wood wire fences feathers birds typical response occurs feeding restricted completely withdrawn nonnutritive pecking may due redirection foraging related another animal displayed complex pica example cattle cattle eat bones phosphorus deficiency however cases persist eating bones even phosphorus levels stabilized getting adequate doses phosphorus diet case evidence supports physical psychological adaptive response cattle continue eat bones phosphorus levels adequate psychological reinforcer persistence pica seeming absence physiological cause might due fortuitous acquisition conditioned illness period physiological cats also display pica behavior natural environments evidence support behavior psychological aspect breeds siamese cat predisposed showing type behavior breeds several types breeds documented show pica cats observed start chewing sucking nonnutritive substances like wool cotton rubber plastic even cardboard progress ingestion substances type behavior occurs first four years cats life primarily observed first two months life cats introduced new homes theories explaining behavior becomes active time suggest early weaning stress consequence separation mother littermates exposure new environment blame eating wool substances may soothing mechanism cats develops cope changes pica also observed predominately months cats life territorial sexual behaviors emerge pica may induced social theories contemplated include pica redirection preycatchingingestion behavior result indoor confinement especially common among oriental breeds due risk natural environments pica observed parrots macaws birds mammals charles munn

used native cultures andes mountains peru pica also affects domesticated animals drugs like prozac often able diminish troublesome behaviors pet dogs dont seem help eating disorder following story
