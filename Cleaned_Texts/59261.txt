meiosis maɪˈoʊsɪs ancient greek μείωσις meíōsis lessening since reductional special type cell division germ cells apicomplexans sexuallyreproducing organisms produces gametes sperm egg cells involves two rounds division ultimately result four cells one copy chromosome haploid additionally prior division genetic material paternal maternal copies chromosome crossed creating new combinations code later fertilisation haploid cells produced meiosis male female fuse create cell two copies chromosome zygote errors meiosis resulting aneuploidy abnormal number chromosomes leading known cause miscarriage frequent genetic cause developmental meiosis dna replication followed two rounds cell division produce four daughter cells half number chromosomes original parent two meiotic divisions known meiosis meiosis ii meiosis begins phase cell cycle dna chromosome replicated consists two identical sister chromatids remain held together sister chromatid cohesion sphase referred premeiotic sphase meiotic sphase immediately following dna replication meiotic cells enter prolonged stage known meiotic prophase time homologous chromosomes pair undergo genetic recombination programmed process dna may cut repaired allows exchange genetic information subset recombination events results crossovers create physical links known chiasmata singular chiasma greek letter chi χ homologous chromosomes organisms links help direct pair homologous chromosomes segregate away meiosis resulting two haploid cells half number chromosomes parent cell meiosis ii cohesion sister chromatids released segregate one another mitosis cases four meiotic products form gametes sperm spores pollen female animals three four meiotic products typically eliminated extrusion polar bodies one cell develops produce ovum number chromosomes halved meiosis gametes fuse ie fertilization form diploid zygote contains two copies chromosome one parent thus alternating cycles meiosis fertilization enable sexual reproduction successive generations maintaining number chromosomes example diploid human cells contain pairs chromosomes including pair sex chromosomes total half maternal origin half paternal origin meiosis produces haploid gametes ova sperm contain one set chromosomes two gametes egg sperm fuse resulting zygote diploid mother father contributing chromosomes pattern number chromosomes occurs organisms utilize meiosis meiosis occurs sexuallyreproducing singlecelled multicellular organisms eukaryotes including animals plants essential process oogenesis spermatogenesis although process meiosis related general cell division process mitosis differs two important respects usually occurs identical sister chromatids result genetic changes meiosis begins diploid cell contains two copies chromosome termed homologs first cell undergoes dna replication homolog consists two identical sister chromatids set homologs pair exchange genetic information homologous recombination often leading physical connections crossovers homologs first meiotic division homologs segregated separate daughter cells spindle apparatus cells proceed second division without intervening round dna replication sister chromatids segregated separate daughter cells produce total four haploid cells female animals employ slight variation pattern produce one large ovum two small polar bodies recombination individual chromatid consist new combination maternal paternal genetic information resulting offspring genetically distinct either parent furthermore individual gamete include assortment maternal paternal recombinant chromatids genetic diversity resulting sexual reproduction contributes variation traits upon natural selection act meiosis uses many mechanisms mitosis type cell division used eukaryotes divide one cell two identical daughter cells plants fungi protists meiosis results formation spores haploid cells divide vegetatively without undergoing fertilization eukaryotes like bdelloid rotifers ability carry meiosis acquired ability reproduce parthenogenesis meiosis occur archaea bacteria generally reproduce asexually via binary fission however sexual process known horizontal gene transfer

replicated chromosomes called bivalents two chromosomes tetrads four chromatids one chromosome coming parent prophase divided series substages named according appearance chromosomes first stage prophase leptotene stage also known leptonema greek words meaning thin stage prophase individual consisting two replicated sister individualized form visible strands within chromosomes form linear array loops mediated cohesin lateral elements synaptonemal complex assemble forming axial element loops recombination initiated stage enzyme creates programmed double strand breaks around per meiosis process generates single stranded dna filaments coated invade homologous chromosomes forming interaxis bridges resulting pairingcoalignment homologues distance nm leptotene followed zygotene stage
