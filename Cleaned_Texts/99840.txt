prostatectomy greek προστάτης prostátēs prostate ἐκτομή ektomē excision surgical removal part prostate gland operation done benign conditions cause urinary retention well prostate cancer cancers pelvis two main types prostatectomies simple prostatectomy also known subtotal prostatectomy involves removal part prostate surgeons typically carry simple prostatectomies benign radical prostatectomy removal entire prostate gland seminal vesicles vas deferens performed multiple ways operation done open surgery via large incision lower abdomen laparoscopically help robot type minimally invasive surgery urethra perineum terms used describe prostatectomy include indications removal prostate benign setting include acute urinary retention recurrent urinary tract infections uncontrollable hematuria bladder stones secondary bladder outlet obstruction significant symptoms bladder outlet obstruction refractory medical minimally invasive therapy chronic kidney disease secondary chronic bladder outlet radical prostatectomy performed due malignant cancer prostate cancer best treatment often depends risk level presented disease prostate cancers classified low risk low risk radical prostatectomy one several treatment options others include radiation watchful waiting active surveillance intermediate high risk prostate cancers radical prostatectomy often recommended addition treatment options radical prostatectomy recommended setting known metastases cancer spread prostate lymph nodes parts prior deciding best treatment option higher risk cancers imaging studies using ct mri bone scans done make sure cancer spread outside prostate would contraindications surgery several ways prostatectomy done open prostatectomy prostate accessed large single incision either lower abdomen perineum descriptive terms describe prostate accessed anatomically incision retropubic vs suprapubic vs perineal retropubic prostatectomy describes procedure accesses prostate going lower abdomen behind pubic bone suprapubic prostatectomy describes procedure cuts lower abdomen bladder access prostate perineal prostatectomy done making incision rectum scrotum underside abdomen roboticassisted instruments inserted several small abdominal incisions controlled surgeon use term robotic short place term computerassisted however procedures performed computerassisted device performed surgeon robot computerassisted device gives surgeon dexterity better vision tactile feedback compared conventional laparoscopy performed surgeon specifically trained well experienced computerassisted laparoscopy calp similar advantages open prostatectomy including smaller incisions less pain less bleeding less risk infection faster healing time shorter hospital cost procedure higher longterm functional oncological superiority yet complications occur period right surgical procedure including prostatectomy include risk bleeding risk infection site incision throughout whole body risk blood clot occurring leg lung risk heart attack stroke risk death severe irritation takes place latex catheter inserted urinary tract person allergic latex especially severe case radical prostatectomy due open wound exposure lasting eg two weeks intense pain may indicate men experience changes sexual responses radical prostatectomy including impairments sexual desire penile morphology orgasmic article medical journal reviews urology listed incidence several complications following radical prostatectomy mortality ejaculatory dysfunction orgasmic dysfunction incontinence pulmonary embolism rectal injury urethral stricture transfusion surgical removal prostate contains increased likelihood patients experience erectile dysfunction radical prostatectomy associated greater decrease sexual function external beam radiotherapy nervesparing surgery reduces risk patients experience erectile dysfunction however experience skill nervesparing surgeon critical determinants likelihood positive erectile function source needed following prostatectomy patients able ejaculate semen due nature procedure resulting permanent necessity assisted reproductive techniques case desires future
