systemic research project designed search data extrasolar planets using amateur project utilizes downloaded console provided systemic website allowing users sort data sets search characteristics may reveal presence planet within planetary system volunteers choose search simulated actual planetary systems simulations used help systemic gain deeper understanding real extrasolar planets real solar system galilean moons jupiters natural satellites hidden among challenge data sets among data sets real simulated star systems systemic program programmed java ease running multiple operating systems program available online applet download run home program presents data set system tools help analyze data feedback goodness fit long term stability currently defined system data set radial velocity derived doppler measurements star similar object time data sets look like sinusoidal curve others seem far complex radial velocity presumed gravitational tugs possibly multiple bodies combine create specific data curve reason program manipulated user complexities multibody orbits solvable unique answers star systems could resolved simple pair bodies systemic software implements several ways calculating orbital mechanics simplistic keplerian laws implementation methods results one obtains uploaded analyzed independently goodness fit stability posted among proposed solutions system result found unstable removed list candidate solutions though possible particular system really period transition instability presumed rare condition great planets would ejected system default system systemic software opens herculis unique posted possible solutions general idea goodness fit help decide favored solutions best solution posted far user ericfdiaz threeplanet system explain curve velocities star time must understood results using systemic discovery possible fit data could correct partially correct even ballpark whatever anything eventually found systemic designed run
