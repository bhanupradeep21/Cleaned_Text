feathers anchored upper foot bones well upper lower leg though apparent fossils natural light due obstruction decayed soft tissue feather bases extended close contact bones modern birds providing strong anchor originally thought microraptor glider probably lived mainly trees hindwings anchored feet microraptor would hindered ability run paleontologists suggested feathered dinosaurs used wings parachute trees possibly attack ambush prey ground precursor gliding true study chatterjee templin tested hypothesis well found combined wing surface microraptor narrow successfully parachute ground without injury significant height however authors leave open possibility microraptor could parachuted short distances closely spaced tree wind tunnel experiments demonstrated sustaining highlift

describing specimens originally referenced distinctive species cryptovolans pauli paleontologist stephen czerkas argued microraptor may powered flier indeed possibly better flyer archaeopteryx noted microraptors fused sternum asymmetrical feathers features shoulder girdle indicated could fly power rather merely gliding today scientists agree microraptor anatomical features expected flying animal though would less advanced form flight compared birds example studies suggest shoulder joint primitive allow full flapping flight stroke ancestral anatomy theropod dinosaurs shoulder socket faced downward slightly backward making impossible animals raise arms vertically prerequisite flapping flight stroke birds studies maniraptoran anatomy suggested shoulder socket shift birdlike position high upward orientation close vertebral column relatively advanced avialans like enantiornithes however scientists argued shoulder girdle paravian theropods including microraptor curved way shoulder joint could positioned high back allowing nearly vertical upstroke wing possibly advanced shoulder anatomy combined presence propatagium linking wrist shoulder fills space front flexed wing may support wing drag modern birds alula much like thumblike form leading edge slot may indicate microraptor capable true powered studies demonstrated wings microraptor large enough generate lift necessary powered launching flight even without fully vertical flight stroke study incipient flight ability paravians demonstrated microraptor capable wingassisted incline running well wingassisted leaping even groundbased stephen czerkas gregory paul others argued fact microraptor could fly yet also clearly dromaeosaurid suggests dromaeosauridae including later larger species deinonychus secondarily flightless work xu colleagues also suggested ancestors dromaeosaurids probably small arboreal capable gliding although later discoveries primitive dromaeosaurids short forelimbs unsuitable gliding cast doubt work done question flight ability paravians however showed probably would able achieve enough lift powered flight given limited flight strokes relatively smaller wings studies concluded microraptor probably evolved flight associated features fused sternum alula etc independently ancestors sankar chatterjee suggested order microraptor glide fly forewings hindwings must different levels biplane overlaid dragonfly latter posture would anatomically impossible using biplane model chatterjee able calculate possible methods gliding determined microraptor likely employed phugoid style gliding launching perch animal would swooped downward deep ushaped curve lifted land another tree feathers directly employed biplane wing structure like tibia tail could used control drag alter flight path trajectory etc orientation hindwings would also helped animal control gliding flight chatterjee also used computer algorithms test animal flight capacity test whether microraptor capable true powered flight opposed addition passive gliding resulting data showed microraptor requirements sustain level powered flight theoretically possible animal flew opposed paleontologists doubted biplane hypothesis proposed configurations study alexander et al described construction lightweight threedimensional physical model used perform glide tests using several hindleg configurations model found biplane model unreasonable structurally deficient needed heavyheaded weight distribution stable gliding deemed unlikely study indicated laterally abducted hindwing structure represented biologically aerodynamically consistent configuration analysis brougham brusatte however concluded alexanders model reconstruction consistent available data microraptor argued study insufficient determining likely flight pattern microraptor brougham brusatte criticized anatomy model used alexander team noting hip anatomy consistent dromaeosaurs dromaeosaurids features hip bone prevent legs splaying horizontally instead locked vertical position body alexanders team used specimen microraptor crushed flat make model brougham brusatte argued reflect actual later alexanders team responded criticisms noting related dromaeosaur hesperonychus known complete hip bones preserved three dimensions also shows hip sockets directed partially upward possibly allowing legs splay due extent hindwings onto animals foot many scientists suggested microraptor would awkward normal ground movement running front wing feathers would also hindered microraptor ground due limited range motion wrist extreme length wing feathers study corwin sullivan colleagues showed even wing folded far possible feathers would still dragged along ground arms held neutral position extended forward predatory strike keeping wings elevated upper arm extended fully backward could microraptor avoided damaging wing feathers therefore may anatomically impossible microraptor used clawed forelimbs capturing prey manipulating unique wing arrangement found microraptor raised question whether evolution flight modern birds went fourwinged stage whether fourwinged gliders like microraptor evolutionary sidebranch left descendants early naturalist william beebe argued evolution bird flight may gone fourwinged tetrapteryx chatterjee templin take strong stance possibility noting conventional interpretation tetrapteryx stage equally possible however based presence unusually long leg feathers various feathered dinosaurs archaeopteryx modern birds raptors well discovery dinosaurs long primary feathers feet pedopenna authors argued current body evidence morphology phylogeny suggests bird flight shift point shared limb dominance frontlimb dominance modern birds may evolved fourwinged ancestors least
