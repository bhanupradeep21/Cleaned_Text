waste products initially conventional schedules since blood levels toxins initial hour dialysis higher subsequent hours patients treating daily daytime hemodialysis use session lengths hours longer session lengths give benefit terms fluid especially phosphate removal however unless sessions prolonged beyond hours almost patients still require phosphate binders fluid phosphate removal daily dialysis made difficult patients often feel better increase protein thus also phosphate well fluid intake nocturnal dialysis given times every night per week total weekly duration dialysis markedly prolonged since session typically lasts hours compared hours conventional dialysis gives benefits terms fluid removal phosphate removal although patients receiving kind treatment still require
