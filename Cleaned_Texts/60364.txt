caterpillars ˈkætərpɪlər katərpilər larval stage members order lepidoptera insect order comprising butterflies moths common names application word arbitrary since larvae sawflies suborder symphyta commonly called caterpillars lepidopteran symphytan larvae eruciform body shapes caterpillars species eat plant material often leaves eat insects even cannibalistic feed animal products example clothes moths feed wool horn moths feed hooves horns dead ungulates caterpillars typically voracious feeders many among serious agricultural pests fact many moth species best known caterpillar stages damage cause fruits agricultural produce whereas moths obscure direct harm conversely various species caterpillar valued sources silk human animal food biological control pest plants origins word caterpillar date early century derive middle english catirpel catirpeller probably alteration old north french catepelose cate cat latin cattus pelose hairy latin inchworm looper caterpillars family geometridae named way move appearing measure earth word geometrid means earthmeasurer primary reason unusual locomotion elimination nearly prolegs except clasper terminal segment caterpillars soft bodies grow rapidly moults size varies species instars moults small millimetre centimetres larvae order hymenoptera ants bees wasps appear like caterpillars lepidoptera larvae mainly seen sawfly suborder however larvae superficially resemble caterpillars distinguished presence prolegs every abdominal segment absence crochets hooks prolegs present lepidopteran caterpillars one pair prominent ocelli head capsule absence upsidedown yshaped suture front lepidopteran caterpillars differentiated sawfly larvae geometrid moth caterpillar dating back eocene epoch approximately million years ago found preserved baltic amber described eogeometer previously another fossil dating back approximately million years found lebanese many animals feed caterpillars rich protein result caterpillars evolved various means defense caterpillars evolved defenses physical conditions cold hot dry environmental conditions arctic species like gynaephora groenlandica special basking aggregation apart physiological adaptations remain dormant appearance caterpillar often repel predator markings certain body parts make seem poisonous bigger size thus threatening nonedible types caterpillars indeed poisonous distasteful bright coloring warns predators others may mimic dangerous caterpillars animals dangerous many caterpillars cryptically colored resemble plants feed example caterpillars use camouflage defense species nemoria arizonaria caterpillars hatch spring feed oak catkins appear green hatch summer appear dark colored like oak twigs differential development linked tannin content caterpillars may even spines growths resemble plant parts thorns look like objects environment bird droppings geometridae cover plant parts bagworms construct live bag covered sand pebbles plant material aggressive selfdefense measures evolved caterpillars measures include spiny bristles long fine hairlike setae detachable tips irritate lodging skin mucous however birds cuckoos swallow even hairiest caterpillars caterpillars acquire toxins host plants render unpalatable predators instance ornate moth caterpillars utilize pyrrolizidine alkaloids obtain food plants deter aggressive caterpillar defenses bristles associated venom glands bristles called urticating hairs venom among potent defensive chemicals animal produced south american silk moth genus lonomia venom anticoagulant powerful enough cause human hemorrhage death see chemical investigated potential medical applications urticating hairs range effect mild irritation dermatitis example browntail moth plants contain toxins protect herbivores caterpillars evolved countermeasures enable eat leaves toxic plants addition unaffected poison caterpillars sequester body making highly toxic predators chemicals also carried adult stages toxic species cinnabar moth tyria jacobaeae monarch danaus plexippus caterpillars usually advertise danger colors red yellow black often bright stripes see aposematism predator attempts eat caterpillar aggressive defense mechanism learn avoid future attempts caterpillars regurgitate acidic digestive juices attacking enemies many papilionid larvae produce bad smells extrudable glands called osmeteria many caterpillars display feeding behaviors allow caterpillar remain hidden potential predators many feed protected environments enclosed inside silk galleries rolled leaves mining leaf surfaces caterpillars like early instars tomato hornworm tobacco hornworm long whiplike organs attached ends body caterpillar wiggles organs frighten away flies predatory caterpillars evade predators using silk line dropping branches disturbed many species thrash violently disturbed scare away potential predators one species amorpha juglandis even makes high pitched whistles scare away caterpillars obtain protection associating ants lycaenid butterflies particularly well known communicate ant protectors vibrations well chemical means typically provide food caterpillars gregarious large aggregations believed help reducing levels parasitization clusters amplify signal aposematic coloration individuals may participate group regurgitation displays pine processionary thaumetopoea pityocampa caterpillars often link long train move trees ground head lead caterpillar visible heads appear forest tent caterpillars cluster periods cold weather caterpillars eaten many animals european pied flycatcher one species preys upon caterpillars flycatcher typically finds caterpillars among oak foliage paper wasps including genus polistes polybia catch caterpillars feed young caterpillars called eating machines eat leaves voraciously species shed skin four five times bodies grow eventually enter pupal stage becoming caterpillars grow quickly instance tobacco hornworm increase weight tenthousandfold less twenty days adaptation enables eat much mechanism specialized midgut quickly transports ions lumen midgut cavity keep potassium level higher midgut cavity caterpillars solely herbivorous many restricted feeding one species plant others polyphagous including clothes moth feed detritus predatory may prey species caterpillars eg hawaiian eupithecia others feed eggs insects aphids scale insects ant larvae parasitic cicadas leaf hoppers hawaiian caterpillars hyposmocoma molluscivora use silk traps capture many caterpillars nocturnal example cutworms family noctuidae hide base plants day feed others spongy moth lymantria dispar larvae change activity patterns depending density larval stage diurnal feeding early instars high caterpillars cause much damage mainly eating leaves propensity damage enhanced monocultural farming practices especially caterpillar specifically adapted host plant cultivation cotton bollworm causes enormous losses species eat food crops caterpillars target pest control use pesticides biological control agronomic practices many species become resistant pesticides bacterial toxins bacillus thuringiensis evolved affect gut lepidoptera used sprays bacterial spores toxin extracts also incorporating genes produce within host plants approaches defeated time evolution resistance mechanisms plants evolve mechanisms resistance eaten caterpillars including evolution chemical toxins physical barriers hairs incorporating host plant resistance hpr plant breeding another approach used reducing impact caterpillars crop caterpillars used industry silk industry based silkworm caterpillar caterpillar hair cause human health problems caterpillar hairs sometimes venoms species approximately families moths butterflies worldwide inflict serious human injuries ranging urticarial dermatitis atopic asthma osteochondritis consumption coagulopathy kidney failure brain skin rashes common lonomia frequent cause envenomation brazil cases reported lethality ranging death caused often intracranial caterpillar hair also known cause keratoconjunctivitis sharp barbs end caterpillar hairs get lodged soft tissues mucous membranes eyes enter tissues difficult extract often exacerbating problem migrate across becomes particular problem indoor setting hair easily enter buildings ventilation systems accumulate indoor environments small size makes difficult vented accumulation increases risk human contact indoor caterpillars food source cultures example south africa mopane worms eaten bushmen
