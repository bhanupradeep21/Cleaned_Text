arrest may occur propranolol overdose due sudden ventricular arrhythmias cardiogenic shock may ultimately culminate bradycardic since beta blockers known relax cardiac muscle constrict smooth muscle betaadrenergic antagonists including propranolol additive effect drugs decrease blood pressure decrease cardiac contractility conductivity clinically significant interactions particularly occur propranolol classified competitive noncardioselective sympatholytic beta blocker crosses barrier lipid soluble also sodium channel blocking effects propranolol nonselective βadrenergic receptor antagonist beta blocks action epinephrine adrenaline norepinephrine noradrenaline receptors little intrinsic sympathomimetic activity strong membrane stabilizing activity high blood concentrations eg propranolol able cross barrier exert effects central nervous system addition peripheral addition blockade adrenergic receptors propranolol weak inhibitory effects norepinephrine transporter andor weakly stimulates norepinephrine release ie concentration norepinephrine increased since propranolol blocks βadrenoceptors increase synaptic norepinephrine results αadrenoceptor activation particularly important effects observed animal therefore looked upon weak indirect agonist addition potent βadrenoceptor addition effects adrenergic system evidence indicates propranolol may act weak antagonist certain serotonin receptors namely latter may involved effectiveness propranolol treatment migraine high enantiomers propranolol local anesthetic topical effect normally mediated blockade voltagegated sodium channels studies demonstrated propranolols ability block cardiac neuronal skeletal voltagegated sodium channels accounting known membrane stabilizing effect antiarrhythmic central nervous system propranolol nonselective beta receptor means preference receptors competes sympathomimetic neurotransmitters binding receptors inhibits sympathetic stimulation heart blockage neurotransmitter binding receptors cardiac myocytes inhibits activation adenylate cyclase turn inhibits camp synthesis leading reduced pka protein kinase activation results less calcium influx cardiac myocytes voltage gated ltype calcium channels meaning decreased sympathetic effect cardiac cells resulting antihypertensive effects including reduced heart rate lower arterial blood blockage neurotransmitter binding receptors smooth muscle cells increase contraction increase hypertension propranolol rapidly completely absorbed peak plasma levels achieved hours ingestion drug found bound plasma protein coadministration food appears enhance despite complete absorption propranolol variable bioavailability due extensive firstpass metabolism hepatic impairment therefore increases
