kongonaphon extinct genus lagerpetid avemetatarsalians middle late triassic madagascar contains single species kongonaphon kely known fragmentary partial skeleton fossil hails late ladinian early carnianage basal isalo ii beds first lagerpetid found africa kongonaphon extends range family significantly possessed combination features various lagerpetids developed particularly long slender leg bones kongonaphon also first lagerpetid fossils snout teeth known likely insectivore based shape texture kongonaphon notable minuscule size even compared small early avemetatarsalians proportionally elongated femur cm inches long total height animal estimated around cm inches alongside miniaturized archosaurs scleromochlus suggests avemetatarsalians experienced abrupt reduction size early evolution may explain poor preservation scarcity early middle triassic avemetatarsalian fossils small size also may helped exploit variety new ecological niches successful avemetatarsalian subgroups pterosaurs dinosaurs may evolved result abrupt size reduction miniaturization correlated evolution flight defining feature pterosaurs acquisition bipedalism utilized many dinosaurs would also lead poor heat retention encouraging evolution feathers filamentous structures although kongonaphon clearly ornithodiran uncertainty whether closer pterosaurs dinosaurs placed phylogenetic analysis without scleromochlus lagerpetids found basal dinosauromorphs closer dinosaurs however inclusion scleromochlus leads analysis tentatively supporting lagerpetids pterosauromorphs closer fossil remains
