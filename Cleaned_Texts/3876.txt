organism changes shape growth surface area proportional cases volume surface area proportional length reason concept important context dynamic energy budget theory food substrate uptake proportional surface area maintenance volume surface area importance part involved substrate uptake since uptake proportional maintenance size control organism grows exponentially constant food substrate availability filaments fungi form hyphae growing length diameter examples sheets extend change thickness like colonial bacteria algae another example important property distinction individual population level disappears single long filament grows fast many small ones diameter total length
