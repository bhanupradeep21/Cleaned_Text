brain ischemia condition insufficient bloodflow brain meet metabolic leads poor oxygen supply cerebral hypoxia thus leads death brain tissue cerebral infarctionischemic subtype stroke along subarachnoid hemorrhage intracerebral ischemia leads alterations brain metabolism reduction metabolic rates energy two types ischemia focal ischemia confined specific region brain global ischemia encompasses wide areas brain tissue main symptoms brain ischemia involve impairments vision body movement speaking causes brain ischemia vary sickle cell anemia congenital heart defects symptoms brain

multiple cerebral ischemic events may lead subcortical ischemic depression also known vascular depression condition commonly seen elderly depressed patientscitation needed late onset depression increasingly seen distinct subtype depression detected brain ischemia linked variety diseases abnormalities individuals sickle cell anemia compressed blood vessels ventricular tachycardia plaque buildup arteries blood clots extremely low blood pressure result heart attack congenital heart defects higher predisposition brain ischemia comparison average population sickle cell anemia may cause brain ischemia associated irregularly shaped blood cells sickle shaped blood cells clot easily normal blood cells impeding blood flow braincitation needed compression blood vessels may also lead brain ischemia blocking arteries carry oxygen brain tumors one cause blood vessel compressioncitation needed ventricular tachycardia represents series irregular heartbeats may cause heart completely shut resulting cessation oxygen flow irregular heartbeats may result formation blood clots thus leading oxygen deprivation organscitation needed blockage arteries due plaque buildup may also result ischemia even small amount plaque build result narrowing passageways causing area become prone blood clotscitation needed large blood clots also cause ischemia blocking blood flowcitation needed heart attack also cause brain ischemia due correlation exists heart attack low blood pressure extremely low blood pressure usually represents inadequate oxygenation tissues untreated heart attacks may slow blood flow enough blood may start clot prevent flow blood brain major organs extremely low blood pressure also result drug overdose reactions drugs therefore brain ischemia result events heart
