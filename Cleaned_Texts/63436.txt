nipple reconstruction specifically nippleareola complex nac reconstruction procedure commonly done patients part nipple removed due medical example nac reconstruction apply breast cancer patients underwent mastectomy surgical removal nac reconstruction also applied patients trauma burn injuries congenital pathological abnormalities nipple visual appearance nac including relative position size color shape texture vary hence aesthetics important consideration surgeons reconstructing nac appear natural pleasing patient different methods nac reconstruction however general procedure safe conducted local throughout history different methods nac reconstruction proposed implicated adams used composite graft labia minora skin surrounding create first reconstructed millard described new method called nipple method splitskin graft patients contralateral nipple used reconstruct new nipple method commonly used often successful achieving matching pigment texture reconstructed nipple contralateral nipple however still risks infection pain numbness scarring depigmentation nipple sharing may still conducted today patients nipples taller cm flapbased techniques reconstruction became increasingly techniques involve incising small flap skin patients breast raising flap forms shape resembles nipple general reconstructed nipple tends gradually shrink time however advantage flapbased techniques surgeons construct nipple slightly taller normal counteract inevitable shrinking reconstructed century advancements tissue engineering regenerative medicine hold potential developing techniques nipple reconstruction instance tissue engineering regenerative medicine help researchers develop suitable safe nipple regardless technique used nac reconstruction main goal recreate normal appearance breasts therefore bring satisfaction patient therefore ultimate aim nac reconstruction benefit wellbeing nac reconstruction shown positive psychological effects patients especially undergone mastectomy patients get breast glandular tissue completely removed resulting surgical removal postprocedure patients might suffer body image issues sexual dysfunction low selfesteem nac reconstruction shown reduce psychological impacts patients might face following especially case female patients breasts play key role female nac reconstruction reportedly empowered female patients improving body image helping overcome psychological challenges breast moreover nac reconstruction shown positively influence patients body image study indicated patients nac reconstruction breast reconstruction saw improvements overall appearance sensation similar breast nac unique anatomy nac differs size texture color different ethnicities oftentimes patient may two areolas different nipple defined protruded structure containing abundance sensory nerve endings smooth muscle bundles facilitating erection located center pigmented patch breast known although standard dimension nac approximately nipple protrude cm typically diameter within areola gross anatomy includes lactiferous ducts drain mammary gland lobes extending depths areolas cellular composition includes assortment cells specific tissues support primary function mammary glands secretion drainage breast milk nac supported stratified keratinized squamous epithelium extend towards surface nipple pathway facilitates metastasis carcinomas syringomatous adenomas throughout areola allow cancer cells subareolar ducts travel nipple surface areola bumps denoted morgagni tubercles connect montgomery montgomery glands modified sebaceous glands connected premature mammary glands connection facilitates secretion milk lactation areolar support structures within nac vascularization mainly depends dermal subdermal networks blood vessels include internal external mammary arteries subcutaneous tissue primarily provide blood nac alongside thoracoacromial arteries intercostal perforator provision blood base nipple accomplished branching vessels mammary however breast would different vasculature affected breast nac reconstruction purpose nac reconstruction often performed months breast related operations create structure template breast time techniques several procedures nac reconstruction category mainstream options flap based construction augmentation grafting nipple sharing nipple sharing one pioneers nac first introduced mainly applied nipples contralateral height cm nipple sharing utilizes anterior part donor native nipple wedge donor nipple surgically removed used within branch two techniques longitudinal splitting decapitation least donors nipple preserved ensure nipple erection transplant donor nipple sutured onto patient area treatment undergoes removal epithelial procedure forms anterior part nac areola typically tattooing recommended patients undergo surgery due risk tattooartists imitate morphological features nipple detail shading creating optical illusion nipple despite surface many types flap based construction common one local flaps subcategories subcategories include centrally based flaps subdermal pedicled flaps pursestring terms shape star flap skate flap sflap hflap cv flap arrow flap cylindrical flap common weakness local flap based construction techniques loss projection technique mainly involves suturing different skin flaps known dermal fat flaps together form shape augmented grafting often additional procedure refine structure reconstructed nipple experienced flattening adverse due loss smooth connective tissue support wound procedure aims increase nipple projection autologous heterologous autologous tissues include structural supporters dermis cartilage ribs rim ear adipose fat tissue mucosa oral procedures facilitate attainment costal cartilage internal mammary vessel dissection flap based breast reconstruction heterologous materials allogeneic natural materials synthetic foreign bodies synthetic foreign bodies mainly act scaffolding allow hosts cells recellularize affected nac due foreign body response alloplastic materials come higher risk complications compared autologous grafts complications include protruding implants necrosis dyschromia loss sensation wound postoperative care relatively short dressing typically maintained common dressings include covering area operation antibiotic cream petroleum jelly dressing stacking gauze nipple addition protection reconstructed nipple analgesic painkillers prescribed flap reconstruction cases sensation yet weeks postoperation sutures removed may result longer pointier nipple projection month elongated cflap used recovery quite quick patients regular routines disrupted unless complications risks involved nipple reconstruction upon completion procedure patients risk flap necrosis local infections separation tissue due improper wound healing accumulation fluid orifice breast flap necrosis common adverse effect accompanies breast augmentation surgeries including mastectomies systematic reviews shown reduced application nitroglycerin direct side effect nipple reconstruction longterm loss nipple sign procedure failed preprocedure projection lost time loss projection often mental burden patients receive nac currently techniques prevent loss projection time loss projection similar mechanisms inverted nipple fibrous muscle bands base nipple unable retract erection nipple dependent sympathetic nervous system smooth muscles within thus nipple receives damage would loss projection specifically procedures cause loss projection due scar contracture surrounding skin causing retraction lack blood perfusion within although existing procedures prevent loss nipple projection augmentation grafting repetition local flaps done recover
