sliding filament theory explains mechanism muscle contraction based muscle proteins slide past generate according sliding filament theory myosin thick filaments muscle fibers slide past actin thin filaments muscle contraction two groups filaments remain relatively constant length theory independently introduced two research teams one consisting andrew huxley rolf niedergerke university cambridge consisting hugh huxley jean hanson massachusetts institute originally conceived hugh huxley andrew huxley niedergerke introduced attractive several competing theories muscle contraction including electrical attraction protein folding protein novel theory directly introduced new concept called crossbridge theory classically swinging crossbridge mostly referred crossbridge cycle explains molecular mechanism sliding filament crossbridge theory states actin myosin form protein complex classically called actomyosin attachment myosin head actin filament thereby forming sort crossbridge two filaments sliding filament theory widely accepted explanation mechanism underlies muscle first muscle protein discovered myosin german scientist willy kühne extracted named russian husband wife team vladimir alexandrovich engelhardt militsa nikolaevna lyubimova discovered myosin enzymatic called atpase property breakdown atp release albert szentgyörgyi hungarian physiologist turned focus muscle physiology winning nobel prize physiology medicine works vitamin c fumaric acid demonstrated atp source energy muscle contraction actually observed muscle fibres containing myosin b shortened presence atp myosin experience later described perhaps thrilling moment brunó ferenc straub soon found myosin b associated another protein called actin myosin straub purified actin szentgyörgyi purified myosin became apparent myosin b combination myosin actin myosin retained original name whereas renamed myosin b actomyosin end szentgyörgyis team postulated evidence contraction actomyosin equivalent muscle contraction notion generally opposed even likes nobel laureates otto fritz meyerhof archibald hill adhered prevailing dogma myosin structural protein functional however one last contributions muscle research szentgyörgyi demonstrated actomyosin driven atp basic principle muscle time hugh huxley earned phd university cambridge research structure muscle szentgyörgyi turned career cancer huxley went francis schmitts laboratory massachusetts institute technology postdoctoral fellowship september joined another english postdoctoral fellow jean hanson january hanson phd muscle structure kings college london huxley used xray diffraction speculate muscle proteins particularly myosin form structured filaments giving rise sarcomere segment muscle fibre main aim use electron microscopy study details filaments never done soon discovered confirmed filament nature muscle proteins myosin actin form overlapping filaments myosin filaments mainly constituting band dark region sarcomere actin filaments traverse light region huxley first suggest sliding filament theory stating postulated stretching muscle takes place extension filaments process two sets filaments slide emphasis added past extensibility inhibited myosin actin linked later huxley regretted included hanson formulation theory based collaborative andrew huxley alan hodgkin described wizard scientific apparatus discovered mechanism nerve impulse action potential transmission hodgkin later nobel prize physiology medicine using design voltage clamp looking associate could properly dissect muscle upon recommendation close friend robert stämpfli german physician rolf niedergerke joined university cambridge realised conventionally used phasecontrast microscope suitable fine structures muscle fibres thus developed interference microscope march january executed huxley recollected time person ever thought sliding filaments dorothy hodgkin later winner nobel prize spent summer marine biological laboratory woods hole massachusetts use electron microscope met hugh huxley hanson shared data information works parted agreement would keep touch aim achieved would publish together ever reached similar sliding filament theory born two consecutive papers published may issue nature common theme structural changes muscle contraction though conclusions fundamentally similar underlying experimental data propositions different first paper written andrew huxley rolf niedergerke titled interference microscopy living muscle fibres based study frog muscle using interference microscope andrew huxley developed purpose according second paper hugh huxley jean hanson titled changes crossstriations muscle contraction stretch structural interpretation elaborate based study rabbit muscle using phase contrast electron microscopes according spite strong evidence sliding filament theory gain support several years szentgyörgyi refused believe myosin filaments confined thick filament fo schmitt whose electron microscope provided best data also remained sceptical original also immediate arguments organisation filaments whether two sets myosin actin filaments merely overlapping continuous new electron microscope hugh huxley confirmed overlapping nature filaments also publication existence actinmyosin linkage called crossbridge clearly shown took another five years provide evidence crossbridge dynamic interaction actin myosin obtained actual molecular arrangement filaments using xray crystallography teaming kenneth holmes trained rosalind franklin conference cold spring harbor laboratory theory evidence deliberated became generally conference koscak maruyama later recalled hanson answer criticisms shouting know explain mechanism yet sliding factual proofs came early could demonstrated actual sliding motion using novel sophisticated tools different substantial evidence hugh huxley formally proposed mechanism sliding filament variously called swinging crossbridge model crossbridge theory crossbridge preferred name swinging crossbridge model recalled discovery published theory june issue science title mechanism muscular according theory filament sliding occurs cyclic attachment detachment myosin actin filaments contraction occurs myosin pulls actin filament towards centre band detaches actin creates force stroke bind next actin idea subsequently proven
