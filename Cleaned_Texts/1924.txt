neuroprivacy brain privacy concept refers rights people regarding imaging extraction analysis neural data concept highly related fields like neuroethics neurosecurity neurolaw become increasingly relevant development advancement various neuroimaging technologies neuroprivacy aspect neuroethics specifically regarding use neural information legal cases neuromarketing surveillance external purposes well corresponding social ethical implications neuroethical concepts neuroprivacy developed initially initial invention development neuroimaging techniques positron emission tomography pet electroencephalography eeg functional magnetic resonance imaging neuroimaging became highly studied popularized also started entering commercial market entrepreneurs sought market practical

processing real stimuli mental suppression recognition simply cooperating concerns potential use memory dampening drugs propranolol beat brain however studies shown propranolol actually dampens emotional arousal associated memory instead memory could even improve recollection comparable eeg technique brain electrical oscillation signature profiling beos similar brain fingerprinting detects

directly creates new ethical debates define acceptable limits mental manipulation avoid targeting vulnerablereceptive demographics sense could seen necessarily brand new debates rather added dimensions previously existing discussions main scientific arguments regarding neuroprivacy mainly revolve around limits current understanding neurodata many arguments using neuroimaging legal surveillance contexts based lack solid scientific basis meaning potential error misinterpretation brain fingerprinting one popularized forms neuroanalysis promoted creator lawrence farwell despite lack scientific agreement currently even lack scientific understanding interpreted neurodata makes limiting categorizing different types neurodata difficult thus complicating another complication neurodata highly personal essentially inseparable subject making extremely sensitive difficult anonymize another issue conflation scientific knowledge beliefs regarding relations philosophical neural

neuroprivacy constitutes international issue international consensus may required establish necessary legal ethical bringing neuroscience legal contexts argued certain benefits current types legal
