biology syntrophy synthrophy crossfeeding greek syn meaning together trophe meaning nourishment phenomenon one species feeding metabolic products another species cope energy limitations electron type biological interaction metabolite transfer happens two metabolically diverse microbial species live close proximity growth one partner depends nutrients growth factors substrates provided partner thus considered obligatory interdependency mutualistic metabolism two different bacterial syntrophy often used synonymously mutualistic symbiosis especially least two different bacterial species syntrophy differs symbiosis way syntrophic relationship primarily based closely linked metabolic interactions maintain thermodynamically favorable lifestyle given syntrophy plays important role large number microbial processes especially oxygen limited environments methanogenic environments anaerobic anoxic methanogenic environments wetlands swamps paddy fields landfills digestive tract ruminants
