pleistocene park russian плейстоценовый парк romanized pleystotsenovyy park nature reserve kolyma river south chersky sakha republic russia northeastern siberia attempt made recreate northern subarctic steppe grassland ecosystem flourished area last glacial project led russian scientists sergey zimov nikita testing hypothesis repopulating large herbivores predators restore rich grasslands ecosystems expected overhunting climate change primarily responsible extinction wildlife disappearance grasslands end pleistocene aim project research climatic effects expected changes ecosystem hypothesis change tundra grassland result raised ratio energy emission energy absorption area leading less thawing permafrost thereby less emission greenhouse also thought removal snow large herbivores reduce permafrosts insulation study large herbivores released effect local fauna monitored preliminary results point ecologically lowgrade tundra biome converted productive grassland biome energy emission area primary aim pleistocene park recreate mammoth steppe ancient taigatundra grasslands widespread region last ice age key concept animals rather climate maintained ecosystem reintroducing large herbivores siberia would initiate positive feedback loop promoting reestablishment grassland ecosystems argument basis rewilding pleistocene parks landscape megafauna previously abundant area evidenced fossil grasslandsteppe ecosystem dominated siberia pleistocene disappeared years ago replaced mossy forested tundra taiga concurrently large herbivores roamed siberia pleistocene vanished mainstream explanation used beginning holocene arid steppe climate changed humid one steppe vanished steppes sergei zimov points contradiction scenario zimov colleagues argue reversed order environmental change mammoth steppe humans constantly improving technology overhunted large herbivores led extinction without herbivores grazing trampling land mosses shrubs trees able take replace grassland grasslands destroyed herbivore populations decimated human hunting stands reason landscapes reconstituted judicious return appropriate herbivore secondary aim research climatic effects expected changes ecosystem key concept effects large herbivores eradicating trees shrubs trampling snow result stronger cooling ground winter leading less thawing permafrost summer thereby less emission greenhouse permafrost large global carbon reservoir remained frozen throughout much due recent climate change permafrost beginning thaw releasing stored carbon forming thermokarst thawed permafrost enters thermokarst lakes carbon converted carbon dioxide methane released methane potent greenhouse gas methane emissions thermokarst lakes potential initiate positive feedback cycle increased atmospheric methane concentrations lead amplified global climate change turn leads permafrost thaw methane carbon dioxide combined carbon stored worlds permafrost equals twice amount carbon currently released atmosphere setting motion positive feedback cycle could potentially lead runaway climate change scenario even ecological situation arctic years ago ie grasslands instead tundra global temperature rise relative preindustrial level would enough start thawing permafrost increased cooling ground winter would raise current tipping point potentially delaying scenario proposed introduction variety large herbivores recreate ancient ecological niches siberia regenerate pleistocene terrain different ecological habitats taiga tundra steppe alpine terrain main objective however recreate extensive grasslands covered beringia region late pleistocene presentday siberia former species megafauna left population density extremely low low affect environment reach desired effects density raised artificially fencing concentrating existing large herbivores large variety species important species affects environment differently overall stability ecosystem increases variety compare biodiversity ecological services numbers raised reintroducing species became locally extinct eg muskoxen species became completely extinct suitable replacements introduced possible eg wild bactrian camels extinct pleistocene camels genus paracamelus number herbivores increases enclosure taking place effects monitored concerns example effects flora mosses replaced grasses etc effects atmosphere changes levels methane carbon dioxide water vapor effects finally high density herbivores vast area reached predators larger wolves introduced keep megafauna first grazing experiments began northeast science station chersky yakutian ha acre enclosure built pleistocene first step recreating ancient landscape yakutian horses introduced horses abundant ungulates northeastern siberian mammoth first horses killed predators died eating poisonous plants horses imported learned cope approximately horses lived horses born annually number risen moose already present region also effects large animals mammoths wisents nature artificially created using engineering tank wheel drive argo allterrain vehicle crush pathways willow vegetation park started change areas horses grazed soil mosses weeds willow shrub replaced flat grassland dominating landscape inside permafrost also influenced grazers air temperature sank winter temperature ground found intact cover snow animals trampled snow grazers thus help keep permafrost intact thereby lessening amount methane released years new fence erected creating enclosure sq new enclosure finally allowed rapid development fence completed reindeer brought park herds region numerous ungulates increase moose density park special constructions added fence several places allow animals outside fenced area enter park allowing leave besides wild moose calves caught regions transported meter foot high tower erected park constantly monitors levels methane carbon dioxide water vapor parks september male muskox wrangel island muskoxen died

farm denmark later year fourteen musk oxen brought park criticswho admonish introducing alien species could damage fragile ecosystem existing tundra criticism sergey zimov replied tundra ecosystem systems existed planet disappearance megafauna nothing cherish tundra course would silly create desert instead tundra site would evolve steppe certainly would improve environment deer foxes bovines abundant nature would benefit people however danger still exists course careful revival steppes example small animals really dangerous release without control large herbivores danger easy remove another point concern doubt majority species introduced harsh conditions example according critics yakutian horses although living park several generations would survived without human intervention normally tolerate said cope poorly abundance snow possibly would died starvation first snowy winter however horses much less primitive stock abandoned japanese army living feral uninhabited kuril islands since despite deep snows two three times deeper yakutia successfully survived winters without feeding pleistocene park yakutian horses accept supplementary feeding others keep away survive
