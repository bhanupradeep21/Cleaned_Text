identifiable victim effect tendency individuals offer greater aid specific identifiable person victim observed hardship compared large vaguely defined group identifiable victim effect two components people inclined help identified victim unidentified one people inclined help single identified victim group identified victims although helping identified victim may commendable identifiable victim

metaanalysis identifying victim messaging meaningful effect prohealth behaviors handwashing maskwearing staying hand extremely subtle experimental manipulations may yield significant effects example small found victim identified number subjects inclined help victim know victims number decide whether help learn number later found statistical significance enhanced effect size increased following circumstances information identifies victim may include vivid details photographs video description victims predicament victim may portrayed innocent helpless details evoke emotional responses provide sense familiarity social closeness therefore identified victims may elicit greater support statistical studies found people respond concrete graphic information abstract statistical bohnet frey kogut ritov found vividness contributes identifiable victim effect another study kogut ritov found donations benefit needy child increased name picture child provided jenni loewenstein observe effect vividness deborah small george loewenstein conducted experiment showing identifiable victim effect result vividness alone victims identified number participants selected victim could donate picking victims number bag participants donated significantly money picked victims number donating rather afterward donated already identified victim even though victims identity hidden identifiable victim effect disappears group victims rather single victim group two victims identifying every victim makes difference example study kogut asked participants much would willing donate either critically ill child group eight critically ill children although identifying individual child increased donations identifying every child group eight paul argued compassion fades number victims increases eventually collapses colleagues found experimental subjects donated less help two starving children help research suggests individual seen responsible plight people offer less help victim research dedicated identifiable victim effect avoids topic blame using explicitly blameless individuals children suffering however realworld situations victims may seen blame current situation example study kogut individuals less likely offer help aids victim victim contracted aids sexual contact individual born aids words individuals less likely offer help victims seen least partially responsible plight metastudy conducted supports findings reporting charitable donations highest victim showed little responsibility cases victim blaming possible identification individuals may induce sympathy may actually increase negative perception reduction help even pronounced individual believes world hypothesis tendency people blame victim happened pattern blame results desire believe world predictable orderly suffer must done something deserve suffering proposed various underlying causes identifiable victim effect may work together produce effect possible causes given experimental tests cited according affect heuristic people make decisions based emotions rather objective analysis single identified victim may trigger stronger emotional response group unidentified victims several studies found identifying victim evokes victim victims plight along willingness help kogut example asked participants much would donate help critically ill child identified child feelings distress childs plight increased along donations supports idea altruistic acts may serve coping mechanisms alleviate negative emotions distress risk concentrated perceived greater risk dispersed wider population identifiable victims reference group receive aid entire reference group example fetherstonhaugh et found intervention saving fixed number lives considered less beneficial total lives risk jenni experimental subjects showed significantly support riskreducing actions higher proportion reference group risk effect striking jenni loewenstein suggested identifiable victim effect could instead called percentage reference group saved effect people tend feel responsibility victims psychologically closer people may feel closer identified victim indeed several studies found individuals feel responsibility identified victims identified statistical example know whose lives would saved population vaccinated disease several theoretical reasons suspect identified victims likely helped statistical ones indeed researchers generally found identified victims likely helped statistical example small loewenstein found subjects donated much money help single starving girl named rokia relieve famine described statistically preference helping single individual rather group sometimes called singularity indifference number individuals helped called scope neglect scope insensitivity identifiable victim effect mirror image sometimes called identifiable perpetrator research shown individuals inclined mete punishment even expense punishing specific identified perpetrator also exert severe punishments express stronger feelings blame anger even perpetrator identified number subjects inclined punish know perpetrator number decide whether punish learn number effect also called goldstein effect fictional emmanuel goldstein vilified supposed enemy state george orwell novel two effects identifiable victims identifiable perpetrators suggest general identifiable effect
