corticosteroids class steroid hormones produced adrenal cortex vertebrates well synthetic analogues hormones two main classes corticosteroids glucocorticoids mineralocorticoids involved wide range physiological processes including stress response immune response regulation inflammation carbohydrate metabolism protein catabolism blood electrolyte levels common naturally occurring steroid hormones cortisol corticosterone cortisone aldosterone cortisone aldosterone isomers main corticosteroids produced adrenal cortex cortisol synthetic pharmaceutical drugs corticosteroidlike effects used variety conditions ranging hematological brain tumors skin diseases dexamethasone derivatives almost pure glucocorticoids prednisone derivatives mineralocorticoid action addition glucocorticoid effect fludrocortisone florinef synthetic mineralocorticoid hydrocortisone cortisol typically used replacement therapy eg adrenal insufficiency congenital adrenal hyperplasia medical conditions treated systemic topical formulations also available skin eyes uveitis lungs asthma nose rhinitis bowels corticosteroids also used supportively prevent nausea often combination antagonists eg ondansetron typical undesired effects glucocorticoids present quite uniformly druginduced cushings syndrome typical mineralocorticoid sideeffects hypertension abnormally high blood pressure steroid induced diabetes mellitus psychosis poor sleep hypokalemia low potassium levels blood hypernatremia high sodium levels blood without causing peripheral edema metabolic alkalosis connective tissue wound healing ulcer formation may inhibited immunosuppressive effects clinical experimental evidence indicates corticosteroids cause permanent eye damage inducing central serous retinopathy csr also

identified randomised controlled trials included participants compared patients received corticosteroids patients received treatment authors recommended people traumatic head injury routinely treated corticosteroids act agonists glucocorticoid receptor andor mineralocorticoid receptor addition corticosteroid activity corticosteroids may progestogenic activity may produce sexrelated side patients response inhaled corticosteroids basis genetic variations two genes interest corticotropinreleasing hormone receptor transcription factor tbet genes display degree polymorphic variation humans may explain patients respond better inhaled corticosteroid therapy however asthma patients respond corticosteroids large sub groups asthma patients corticosteroid study funded patientcentered outcomes

steroidogenic reactions catalysed enzymes cytochrome family located within mitochondria require adrenodoxin cofactor except aldosterone corticosterone share first part biosynthetic pathway last part mediated either aldosterone synthase aldosterone corticosterone enzymes nearly identical share functions aldosterone synthase also able perform moreover aldosterone synthase found within zona glomerulosa outer edge adrenal cortex found zona fasciculata zona glomerulosa general corticosteroids grouped four classes based chemical structure allergic reactions one member class typically
