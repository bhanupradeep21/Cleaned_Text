defines data carries means client application need concerned specifics every possible biometric type eg face finger iris etc encoding format eg xml tlv encoded simple byte encoded etc rather needs know two things access data interested motivation selfdescribing data format reduces burden client applications dealing multitude biometric types encodings strategy permits application effectively
