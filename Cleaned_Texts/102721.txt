secondary hypertension less commonly inessential hypertension type hypertension definition caused identifiable underlying primary cause much less common type called essential hypertension affecting hypertensive patients many different causes including endocrine diseases kidney diseases tumors also side effect many medications two main causes fibromuscular dysplasia atherosclerosis renal artery resulting stenosiscitation needed well known causes include diseases kidney includes diseases polycystic kidney disease cystic genetic disorder kidneys pkd characterized presence multiple cysts hence polycystic kidneys also damage liver pancreas rarely heart autosomal dominant autosomal recessive autosomal dominant form common characterized progressive cyst development bilaterally enlarged kidneys multiple cysts concurrent development hypertension chronic kidney disease kidney chronic glomerulonephritis disease characterized inflammation glomeruli small blood vessels hypertension also produced diseases renal arteries supplying kidney known renovascular hypertension thought decreased perfusion renal tissue due stenosis main branch renal artery activates also renal tumors cause hypertension differential diagnosis renal tumor young patient hypertension includes juxtaglomerular cell tumor wilms tumor renal cell carcinoma may produce however increased co solve structural problems causing renal artery hypotension result co remains chronically elevatedcitation needed variety adrenal cortical abnormalities cause hypertension primary aldosteronism clear relationship aldosteroneinduced sodium retention congenital adrenal hyperplasia group autosomal recessive disorders enzymes responsible steroid hormone production lead secondary hypertension creating atypically high levels mineralocorticoid steroid hormones mineralocorticoids crossreact aldosterone receptor activating raising blood pressurecitation needed yet another related disorder causing hypertension glucocorticoid remediable aldosteronism autosomal dominant disorder increase aldosterone secretion produced acth longer transient causing primary hyperaldosteronism gene mutated result aldosterone synthase acthsensitive normally gra appears common monogenic form human compare effects seen conns disease adrenocortical tumor causes excess release leads another adrenal related cause cushings syndrome disorder caused high levels cortisol cortisol hormone secreted cortex adrenal glands cushings syndrome caused taking glucocorticoid drugs tumors produce cortisol adrenocorticotropic hormone patients cushings syndrome develop accompanied distinct symptoms syndrome central obesity lipodystrophy moon face sweating hirsutism neuroendocrine tumors also well known cause secondary hypertension often located adrenal medulla increases secretion catecholamines epinephrine norepinephrine causing excessive stimulation adrenergic receptors results peripheral vasoconstriction cardiac stimulation diagnosis confirmed demonstrating increased urinary excretion epinephrine norepinephrine andor metabolites vanillylmandelic acidcitation needed certain medications including nsaids ibuprofenmotrin steroids cause medications include estrogens found oral contraceptives high estrogenic activity certain antidepressants venlafaxine buspirone carbamazepine bromocriptine clozapine high blood pressure associated sudden withdrawal various antihypertensive medications called rebound increases blood pressure may result blood pressures greater medication initiated depending severity increase blood pressure rebound hypertension may result hypertensive emergency rebound hypertension avoided gradually reducing dose also known dose tapering thereby giving body enough time adjust reduction dose medications commonly associated rebound hypertension include centrallyacting antihypertensive agents herbal natural products associated hypertension include ephedra st johns wort women childbearing age high blood pressure develop hypertension generally benign may herald three complications pregnancy preeclampsia hellp syndrome eclampsia followup control medication therefore often another common underrecognized cause hypertension sleep often best treated nocturnal nasal continuous positive airway pressure cpap approaches include mandibular advancement splint mas uppp tonsillectomy adenoidectomy septoplasty weight loss another cause exceptionally rare neurological disease called binswangers disease causing dementia rare form multiinfarct dementia one neurological syndromes
