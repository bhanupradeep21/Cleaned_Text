psychological egoism view humans always motivated selfinterest selfishness even seem acts altruism claims people choose help others ultimately personal benefits expect obtain directly indirectly descriptive rather normative view since makes claims things ought according however related several normative forms egoism ethical egoism rational egoism specific form psychological egoism psychological hedonism view ultimate motive voluntary human action desire experience pleasure avoid pain immediate gratification sacrificed chance greater future humans motivated strictly avoid pain pursue pleasure instead humans endure pain achieve greatest net pleasure accordingly actions tools increasing pleasure decreasing pain even defined altruistic cause immediate change satisfaction levels famous psychological egoists sextus empiricus pierre bayle bernard mandeville theorists explain behavior motivated selfinterest without using pleasure pain final causes beginning ancient philosophy epicureanism claims humans live maximize epicurus argued theory human behavior motivated pleasure alone evidenced infancy adulthood humanity performs altruistic honorable virtuous acts sake another moral code rather increase wellbeing self modern philosophy jeremy bentham asserted like epicurus human behavior governed need increase pleasure decrease bentham explicitly described types qualities pain pleasure exist human motives singularly explained using psychological hedonism bentham attempted quantify psychological hedonism bentham endeavored find ideal human behavior based hedonic calculus measurement relative gains losses pain pleasure determine pleasurable action human could choose situation evolutionary perspective herbert spencer psychological egoist argued animals primarily seek survive protect lineage essentially need individual individuals immediate family live supersedes others need species attempt maximize chances survival therefore wellbeing spencer asserted best adapted creatures pleasure levels outweigh pain levels environments thus pleasure meant animal fulfilling egoist goal self survival pleasure would always pursued species constantly strive survival whether sigmund freud psychological egoist concept pleasure principle borrowed much psychological egoism psychological hedonism pleasure principle rules behavior id unconscious force driving humans release tension unfulfilled desires freud introduced thanatos opposing force eros pleasure principle emanating psychological hedonism became aligned eros drives person satiate sexual reproductive alternatively thanatos seeks cessation pain death end pursuit pleasure thus hedonism rules thanatos centers complete avoidance pain rather psychological hedonist function pursues pleasure avoids pain therefore freud believed qualitatively different hedonisms total avoidance pain hedonism achievement greatest net pleasure hedonism separate associated distinct functions drives human although eros thanatos ruled qualitatively different types hedonism eros remains rule jeremy benthams quantitative psychological hedonism eros seeks greatest net pleasure traditional behaviorism dictates human behavior explained classical conditioning operant conditioning operant conditioning works reinforcement punishment adds removes pleasure pain manipulate behavior using pleasure pain control behavior means behaviorists assumed principles psychological hedonism could applied predicting human behavior example thorndikes law effect states behaviors associated pleasantness learned associated pain often behaviorist experiments using humans animals built around assumption subjects pursue pleasure avoid although psychological hedonism incorporated fundamental principles experimental designs behaviorism behaviorism explains interprets observable behavior therefore theorize ultimate cause human behavior thus behaviorism uses strictly support psychological hedonism understandings ultimate drive human behavior psychological egoism controversial proponents cite evidence introspection reflection ones actions may reveal motives intended results based selfinterest psychological hedonists found numerous observations natural human behavior behavior manipulated reward punishment direct effects pain also work social scientists empirically supported claim psychological egoism posits theory parsimonious explanation competing opponents argued psychological egoism parsimonious theories example theory claims altruism occurs sake altruism explains altruism less complexity egoistic approach psychological egoist asserts humans act altruistically selfish reasons even cost altruistic action far outweighed reward acting selfishly altruism performed fulfill desire person act critics argue false either oversimplified interpretation exists empirical evidence altruistic recently argued evolutionary theory provides evidence critics stated proponents psychological egoism often confuse satisfaction desires satisfaction selfregarding desires even though true every human seeks satisfaction sometimes may achieved via wellbeing neighbor example situation could phoning ambulance car accident happened case caller desires wellbeing victim even though desire callers counter critique psychological egoism asserts desires wellbeing others ultimately derived selfinterest example german philosopher friedrich nietzsche psychological egoist career though said repudiated later campaign morality argues dawn cases compassionate impulses arise projection identity unto object feeling gives hypothetical examples illustrations thesis person feeling horrified witnessing personal feud coughing blood impulse felt save person drowning water cases according nietzsche comes play unconscious fears regarding safety suffering another person felt threat happiness sense safety reveals vulnerability misfortunes thus relieving one could also ameliorate personal sentiments essentially proponents argue altruism rooted selfinterest whereas opponents claim altruism occurs altruisms sake caused nonselfish david hume wrote interest fond mother view loses

close view la perhaps according psychological hedonism ultimate egoistic motive gain good feelings pleasure avoid bad feelings pain less restricted forms psychological egoism may allow ultimate goal person include things avoiding punishments oneself others guilt shame attaining rewards pride selfworth power reciprocal beneficial action psychologists explain empathy terms psychological hedonism according merge others hypothesis empathy increases individual feels like one another person decreases oneness therefore altruistic actions emanating empathy empathy caused making others interests satisfaction desires becomes cognitive studies neuropsychological experiments provided evidence theory humans increase oneness others empathy increases empathy increases inclination act altruistically neuropsychological studies linked mirror neurons humans experiencing empathy mirror neurons activated human animal performs action observe another human animal perform action researchers found mirror neurons fire human subjects report empathy neurological perspective scientists argue human empathizes another brain operates human actually participating actions person thus performing altruistic actions motivated empathy humans experience someone elses pleasure helped therefore performing acts altruism people act self interests even neurological level even accepting theory universal positivity difficult explain example actions soldier sacrifices life jumping grenade order save comrades case simply time experience positivity toward ones actions although psychological egoist may argue soldier experiences moral positivity knowing sacrificing life ensure survival comrades avoiding negativity associated thought comrades psychological egoists argue although actions may clearly cause physical social positivity avoid negativity ones current contemplation reactionary mental expectation main factor decision dog first taught sit given biscuit repeated finally dog sits without

discomfort basic theory conditioning behaviour applied seemingly ineffective positive actions used explain moral responses instantaneous instinctive soldier jumping grenade psychological egoism accused circular person willingly performs act means derives personal enjoyment therefore people perform acts give personal enjoyment particular seemingly altruistic acts must performed people derive
