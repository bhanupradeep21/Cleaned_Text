early career gould colleague niles eldredge developed theory punctuated equilibrium describes rate speciation fossil record occurring relatively rapidly alternates longer period evolutionary gould coined term punctuated equilibria though theory originally presented eldredge doctoral dissertation devonian trilobites article published previous year allopatric according gould punctuated equilibrium revised key pillar central logic darwinian evolutionary biologists argued punctuated equilibrium great interest biology merely modified neodarwinism manner fully compatible known biologists emphasize theoretical novelty punctuated equilibrium argued evolutionary stasis unexpected evolutionary biologists major impact paleontology evolutionary comparisons made george gaylord simpsons work tempo mode evolution also illustrated relatively sudden changes along evolutionary lines simpson describes paleontological record characterized predominantly gradual change termed
