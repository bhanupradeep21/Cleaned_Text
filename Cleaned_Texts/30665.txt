vulcanodon meaning volcano tooth extinct genus sauropod dinosaur early jurassic southern africa known species v karibaensis discovered zimbabwe regarded earliestknown sauropod decades still one primitive sauropods discovered quadrupedal grounddwelling herbivore vulcanodon already showed typical sauropod body plan columnlike legs long neck tail smaller sauropods measuring approximately eleven metres ft length vulcanodon known fragmentary skeleton including much pelvic girdle hindlimbs forearms tail lacking trunk neck vertebrae well skull originally genus believed prosauropod knifeshaped teeth found near fossils fit idea prosauropods omnivorous scientists know teeth belonged unidentified theropod may scavenged vulcanodon carcass vulcanodon known true sauropod upon discovery related tazoudasaurus animals unified family vulcanodontidae though universally accepted vulcanodon initially thought small sauropod gregory paul estimated length eleven metres weight books mention lower estimates approximately however researchers estimated greater body mass metric tons short thighbone centimetres one earliest basalmost sauropods important understanding early evolution group sauropods descend basal sauropodomorphs informally called prosauropods primitively bipedal vulcanodon already fully quadrupedal fourlegged limb proportions intermediate prosauropod ancestors later derived forelimbs much similar later sauropods basal sauropodomorphs straight much gracile proximal end ulna unfortunately skull neck vulcanodon known although otherwise well vulcanodons limbs sturdy forelimbs already proportionally long reaching hindlimb lower leg metatarsus toes shortened comparison bipedal ancestors still short later sacrum made four fused sacral vertebrae prosauropods

perforated pockets called contrasting many sauropodlike features skeleton pelvis relatively primitive reminiscent prosauropod one feature brevis shelf ilium fossa found derived hallux first toe foot showed large claw flattened laterally seen however claws second third toe unusual naillike broader feature also found probably closely related tazoudasaurus absent feet vulcanodon semiplantigrade later sauropods digits part metatarsals contact derived feature found basal sauropods like isanosaurus however also retained primitive features like fact phalanges many features found sauropods basal sauropodomorphs lack related change body size greatest regions affected hind limbs pelvis example elongating ilium size reduction lesser trochanter shelf semiplantigrade posture features indicate

originally michael raath described vulcanodon sauropod advanced specialized prosauropod possibly family according raath sauropodlike limb proportions vulcanodon evolved independently true sauropods convergent evolution argued primitive features pelvis well knifeshaped teeth preclude classification within teeth however known belong theropod arthur cruickshank first show vulcanodon indeed sauropod arguing fifth metatarsal bone equally long remaining metatarsals condition seen sauropods today vulcanodon universally accepted one basal primitive members michael cooper erected new family vulcanodontidae regarded rootstock later sauropod originally vulcanodontidae included vulcanodon indian barapasaurus subsequent studies attributed number much fragmentary early sauropod genera family including ohmdenosaurus paul upchurch showed barapasaurus closely related later advanced sauropods vulcanodon rendering vulcanodontidae polyphyletic therefore exact relationships basal sauropod genera remain unclear ronan allain colleagues found vulcanodon closely related tazoudasaurus newly discovered sauropod genus morocco researchers suggested reintroducing name vulcanodontidae name clade containing vulcanodon however sibling relationship tazoudasaurus vulcanodon could confirmed adam yates described single sauropod tail vertebra upper elliot formation south africa may belong genus closely related vulcanodon upper elliot formation famous abundant fossils prosauropod later part lower jurassic southern africa scene massive volcanism resulting extensive lava flows called flood basalts covered much southern africa antarctica basalt formations known karooferrar large igneous province vulcanodon comes vulcanodon beds fossilbearing sediment unit within batoka formation composed primarily flood skeleton found near top ft bedded layer sand siltstone underlain flood long assumed vulcanodon lived lowermost earliest part jurassic hettangian stage boundary approximately million years therefore regarded earliest sauropod known discovery even older late triassic isanosaurus announced adam yates recently shown vulcanodon actually much younger previously thought dating uppermost latest part lower jurassic toarcian stage approximately million years thus contemporary closely related although locality vulcanodon dated radiometrically weathering lavas would roughly contemporary karoo lavas localities entire sequence volcanic eruptions finished within one million vulcanodon named dinosaur vulcanodon cooper noted habitat desertlike indicated aeolian windblown sands forest
