token economy system contingency management based systematic reinforcement target behavior reinforcers symbols tokens exchanged token economy based principles operant conditioning behavioral economics situated within applied behavior analysis applied settings token economies used children adults however successfully modeled pigeons lab three requirements basic token economy tokens backup reinforcers specified target tokens must used reinforcers effective token object symbol exchanged material reinforcers services privileges backup reinforcers applied settings wide range tokens used coins checkmarks images small suns stars points counter checkmarks poster symbols objects comparably worthless outside patientclinician teacherstudent relationship value lies fact exchanged things technically speaking tokens primary reinforcers secondary learned reinforcers much research conducted token reinforcement including animal tokens intrinsic value exchanged valued reinforcing events backup reinforcers act rewards token economies offer choice differing backup reinforcers virtually anything possible reinforcers might backup reinforcers chosen function individual group token economy set depending upon possibilities available staff prior starting staff decides many tokens paid backup reinforcer often price lists exposed given clients backup reinforcers bought anytime exchange times limited eg opening times token shopcitation needed broad range possible target behaviors selfcare washing attending scheduled activities good academic behavior avoiding disruptive behavior token economy using exchangeable token economy work criteria specified clear staff member giving tokens client judge behaving positively part token economy done systematic way sometimes client manuals specifications many tokens earned target behavior instance making bed target behavior staff clients know wellmade bed looks like however often specifications hard make behavior eating politely positive cooperation hard specify planning many tokens earned target behavior factors considered one hand clients able earn minimal amount tokens minimal effort hand clients earn much soon making effort useless sometimes possibility punishment token loss included technically called response disruptive behavior fined loss tokens also clearly specified application starts clients involved specifying contingencies besides three basic requirements features often present social reinforcement shaping immediacy reinforcement forward planning token reinforcement always accompanied social reinforcement tokens intended make reinforcement explicit immediate strengthen behavior end social reinforcement sufficient maintain whats learnedcitation needed shaping implies clients arent expected everything perfectly behavior acquired steps initially clients reinforced behavior approaches target target behavior keeping attention minutes session clients initially already get perhaps smaller reinforcement minutes attentioncitation needed reinforcement likely influence behavior given shortly response emitted longer people wait reward less effect less learn principle delay discounting immediate token reinforcement bridge later sometimes clients earn larger rewards like permission spend weekend home going movie class excursion rewards would given one instance target behavior scarce resources would soon depleted consequently incentives would lost one advantage tokens used divide larger rewards parts clients save tokens buy expensive rewards later implies shouldnt immediately spend earned tokens attractive smaller rewards instead learn plan ahead way acquire selfcontrol see delayed gratificationcitation needed many token economies designed groups system running whole ward class within group contingency specific individual goals reinforcers added though sometimes token economy designed one specific individualcitation needed power token economy largely depends consistency application achieve thorough staff training essential token economies failed exactly token economies imply rights duties clients well staff according system client deserves tokens get even staff member judges doesnt deserve impolite day family education involvement also aspect support system undermine instance secretly giving undeserved rewards often token economies leveled programs clients pass different levels reach highest level point behaviors performed without token reinforcement higher levels require complex behaviors incentive progress one level next availability increasingly desirable reinforcers early century long knowledge operant learning precursors token economies schools prisons systems points could earned exchanged many different items privileges first real token economies arose psychiatric hospitals teodoro ayllon nathan azrin leonard krasner important pioneers early first token economy bearing name founded ayllon azrin anna state hospital illinois token economies came peak became widespread major study randomized controlled trial still considered landmark study showed superiority token economy compared standard treatment specialized milieu therapy despite success token economies declined application token economies especially adults became matter criticism addition impediments evolution mental health care caused troublescitation needed token economies proven effectiveness utility chronic psychiatric patients despite requiring months even years achieve optimal results causes problems insurance government policies increasingly require shortest possible hospital stays emphasis shifted communitybased treatment outpatient homebased care often preferred choice institutionalization decentralization patient care methods makes difficult study develop token economies scientific researchoriented methodcitation needed token economies present issues concern patient rights right personal properties basic comfort freedom choice treatment constrains possibilities token economies addition ethical personal concerns staff members arose ethics using certain reinforcers ethics operant conditioning lack sincerity emphasis material goodscitation needed application token economy adults sometimes triggers client problems maintaining whats learned generalization toward new situations also signaled token programs stops acquired behavior might disappear againcitation needed rewarding behavior could increase extrinsic motivation time decrease intrinsic motivation activitiescitation needed last years much research conducted token economy despite controversy lack implementation token programs still exist several settingscitation needed adult settings token economies mostly applied mental health care offered choice vast majority clients past studies voluntarily chose stay program researchcitation needed shows effects token economies less divided three categories first token economies designed chronic treatmentresistant psychotic inpatients even token economies applied clients schizophrenia often resistant common behavioral treatment approaches sometimes token economy used lasting sometimes used help clients reach resocialization token economy combination interventions succeeded community reintegration clients within average period days seven years uninterrupted hospital research shows clients experience token economy positive several recent reviews psychosocial treatment schizophrenia explicitly mention token economy effective evidencebased one systematic review specifically examined token economy token economy approach may effects symptoms apathy poverty thought unclear results reproducible clinically meaningful maintained beyond treatment application token economies extended psychiatric rehabilitation services acute psychiatric units token economy successful decreasing aggression ward clients average stayed less three result ethical criticism token economies developed negative stigma result systems sometimes introduced aliases especially case substance abuse treatment settings although systems smoking cessation continue use term token time systems derived token economies used name contingency management initially broadly defined referred direct coupling consequences reinforcements punishments behavior example staying clean later referred specifically one kind token economy community reinforcement approach combined contingency tokens used whereas contingency management employs term vouchers related terms research shows kind token economy easily applied outside hospitals effective allowing less hospitalbased treatment although contingency management used treatment drug abuse inpatient outpatient settings token economy also applied settings adults developmental disabilities target behaviors vary types social behavior self care decreasing inappropriate andor disruptive token economies applied children adolescents developmental disabilities well schoolscitation needed token economy proven effective increasing attentiveness motivation completion tasks children developmental disabilities research shows help diminish disruptive behavior promote social token economies applied schools particularly special education programs well programs positive results imply increased attention decreased disruptive educational settings token
