vertebrate maternal behavior form parental care specifically given young animals mother order ensure survival parental care form altruism means behaviors involved often require sacrifice could put survival encompasses behaviors aid evolutionary success offspring parental investment measure expenditure time energy etc exerted parent attempt provide evolutionary benefits therefore measure benefits versus costs engaging parental behaviors commonly exhibited maternal parent include feeding either lactating gathering food grooming young keeping young another important aspect parental care whether care provided offspring parent relatively equal manner whether provided predominantly entirely one several species exhibit biparental care behaviors andor investment offspring divided equally amongst parenting strategy common however even species exhibit biparental care maternal role essential since females responsible incubation andor delivery although maternal care essential many classes vertebrates prevalent mammals since care mother essential feeding nourishing care exhibited mother plays large role mammals role male often maternal care begins fertilization pregnancy however prominent array maternal behaviors exhibited mother birth offspring offspring capable duration offspring stays mother receives care types care behavior displayed mother varies amongst different species forms reproduction level development offspring mammals class vertebrates contain mammary glands secrete milk nourishes offspring maternal behavior unique vertebrate classes basic maternal care patterns mammals involve internal incubation gestation delivery young maternal care young way female mammal cares young depends level maturation offspring three main categories newborn maturation different species mammals exhibit altricial young marsupials rodents completely helpless dependent mothers precocial young elephants cattle highly developed sensory motor functions birth primates semihelpless young intermediate level maturation variation maturation birth requires different maternal care altricial young born deaf blind almost completely hairless limited motor maternal behavior species primarily focussed providing warmth young since unable achieved utilization pouches marsupial species kangaroos construction nests rodents altricial young capable locomotion many maternal behaviors take place nest well including feeding nursing grooming licking members species unable recognize young therefore care young nest equally regardless whether young reach point sensory motor development longer require nutrients mothers milk leave nest mother discontinue maternal care behaviors precocial young born highly developed sensory motor birth able see hear walk learn walk within first days females species adapted able recognize young allows selective choose care reject young try nurse primary focus species develop exclusive relationship young allows resources energy expenditure mother optimized offspring wasted essential success fitness primates born intermediate maturation altricial precocial species newborns limited motor functioning highly developed sensory systems ability thermoregulate unique characteristic maternal behavior primates mothers carry young locomotive abilities mother either carry young arms young attach mother cling known amphibians oviparous lay eggs water though adapted lay also species viviparous giving birth live eggs fertilized either internally externally depending many amphibians exhibit maternal behaviors egg young brooding transport well varying methods feeding frogs developed many different maternal behaviors across varying species common maternal behavior among frogs egg attendance wherein mother remain near eggs develop protect mother may also stay clutch order prevent desiccation rehydrate positioning eggs behavior known ventral species also observed oxygenating eggs moving around frogs genus hemiphractus carry eggs around back species genus develop dorsal pouch carry young inside leave frogs poison dart frogs lay unfertilized eggs clutch caecilians reproduce either oviparity viviparity young aquatic larval stage develop live land oviparous females build nests land keep clutch hatch regardless aquatic stage young aquatic stage hatch able survive water without maternal care however young altricial hatch rely mother look develop enough live fully mother feeds altricial young process known maternal dermatophagy feed pieces skin viviparous caecilians also give birth altricial young may fed maternal dermatophagy way oviparous species fed may fed specialized version young eat mothers hypertrophied oviduct drink cloacal reptiles large diversity maternal behaviors dependent species type reproduction reptiles viviparous although oviparous reptiles exist oviparous reptiles often display little maternal behavior eggs hatched viviparous reptiles typically exhibit extensive maternal nile crocodiles however exception females exhibit maternal care behaviors involve transporting young mouths shortly hatched waters edge remain young reached development birds belong class vertebrates oviparous exhibit extensive parental behaviors behaviors called brooding behaviors include incubation unhatched eggs care chicks incubation mother sits eggs keeps warm unhatched chicks developing eggs eggs hatch mother care feed chicks reach maturation biparental care common birds role male involves finding food defending nest maternal behaviors involve caring chicks many cases male regurgitate partially digested food mouth female female distribute food equally amongst chicks regurgitating second time mouths majority fish oviparous though many ovoviviparous many oviparous fish display maternal behaviors aside laying eggs mothers stay clutch defend eggs fry predators behavior common among many cichlid species cichla ocellaris also remove underdeveloped eggs clutch behavior performed many female cichlids also fan eggs fins especially slower moving water order increase oxygenation get rid build undesired materials around lot cichlid species commonly known mouthbrooders carry eggs young mouth extended period time hatch behavior often displayed mother though species parents father maternal mouthbrooders eggs laid mother scoops mouth keeps sometimes multiple weeks brooding period eat put energy caring ovoviviparous viviparous fish female incubates young inside body giving birth live young major difference young get nutrition ovoviviparous fish embryos mostly get nutrients yolk eggs viviparous fish embryos mostly get nutrients directly gestation period usually maternal care provided fish developed brood parasitism reproductive strategy exhibited birds one species fish wherein parasite lay eggs nest clutch host host provide care invasive parasitic birds evolved ways ensure success offspring raised host allowing longer invest energy maternal care result offspring receive maternal care host bird cause natural maternal behaviors affected results often neglecting care although behavior performed occasionally many different birds bird species worldwide considered obligate brood vertebrate species practice brood parasitism birds cuckoo fish prey specifically mouthbrooding cichlids female cichlid lays eggs ground cuckoo catfish lay eggs among clutch male fertilize cichlid picks eggs mouth causing also pick cuckoo catfishs cuckoo catfish eggs hatch cichlid eggs cuckoo catfish able eat cichlid eggs reside within protection cichlids mouth spit mammals
