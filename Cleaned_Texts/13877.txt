natural selectioncitation needed addressing origin species two key issues since charles darwins time efforts understand nature species primarily focused first aspect widely agreed critical factor behind origin new species reproductive origin species darwin interpreted biological evolution terms natural selection perplexed clustering organisms chapter darwins book entitled difficulties theory

existed wondered find embedded countless numbers crust earth clearly defined species actually exist nature space time implies fundamental feature natural selection operates generate maintain argued resolution darwins first dilemma lies fact outcrossing sexual reproduction intrinsic cost cost rarity arises follows resource gradient large number separate species evolve exquisitely adapted narrow band gradient species necessity consist members finding mate circumstances may present difficulties many individuals neighborhood belong species circumstances species population size happens chance increase expense one neighboring species environment saturated immediately make easier members find sexual partners members neighboring species whose population sizes decreased experience greater difficulty finding mates therefore form pairs less frequently larger species snowball effect large species growing expense smaller rarer species eventually driving extinction eventually species remain distinctly different cost rarity involves costs failure find mate also indirect costs cost communication seeking partner low population densities rarity brings costs rare unusual features seldom advantageous instances indicate nonsilent mutation almost certain deleterious therefore behooves sexual creatures avoid mates sporting rare unusual features sexual populations therefore rapidly shed rare peripheral phenotypic features thus canalizing entire external appearance illustrated accompanying illustration african pygmy kingfisher ispidina picta uniformity adult members sexual species stimulated proliferation field guides birds mammals reptiles insects many taxa species described single illustration two case sexual dimorphism population become homogeneous appearance typical species illustrated photograph african pygmy kingfisher members avoid mating members populations look different thus avoidance mates displaying rare unusual phenotypic features inevitably leads reproductive isolation one hallmarks contrasting case organisms reproduce asexually cost rarity consequently benefits finescale adaptation thus asexual organisms frequently show continuous variation form often

reproductive may occur two populations species separated come back contact reproductive isolation complete already developed two separate incompatible species reproductive isolation incomplete mating populations produce hybrids may may fertile hybrids infertile fertile less fit ancestors reproductive isolation speciation essentially occurred horses one reasoning behind parents hybrid offspring naturally selected traits certain environments hybrid offspring bear traits therefore would fit either ecological niche well either parent ecological speciation low fitness hybrids would cause selection favor assortative mating would control hybridization sometimes called wallace effect evolutionary biologist alfred russel wallace suggested late century might important factor conversely

plant animal species undergone event polyploidization evolutionary reproduction successful polyploid species sometimes asexual parthenogenesis apomixis unknown reasons many asexual organisms polyploid rare instances polyploid mammals known often result prenatal deathcitation needed hybridization two different species sometimes leads distinct phenotype phenotype also fitter parental lineage natural selection may favor individuals eventually reproductive isolation achieved may lead separate species however reproductive isolation hybrids parents particularly difficult achieve thus hybrid speciation considered extremely rare event mariana mallard thought arisen hybrid speciationcitation needed hybridization important means speciation plants since polyploidy two copies chromosome tolerated plants readily polyploidy important hybrids allows reproduction two different sets chromosomes able pair identical partner polyploids also genetic diversity allows avoid inbreeding depression small hybridization without change chromosome number called homoploid hybrid speciation considered rare shown heliconius sunflowers polyploid speciation involves changes chromosome number common phenomenon especially plant speciescitation needed theodosius dobzhansky studied fruit flies early days genetic research speculated parts chromosomes switch one location another might cause species split two different species mapped might possible sections chromosomes relocate genome mobile sections cause sterility interspecies hybrids act speciation pressure theory idea sound scientists
