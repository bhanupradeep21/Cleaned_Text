intracerebral hemorrhage ich also known hemorrhagic stroke sudden bleeding tissues brain ie parenchyma ventricles ich type bleeding within skull one kind stroke ischemic stroke symptoms vary dramatically depending severity much blood acuity timeframe location anatomically include headache onesided weakness numbness tingling paralysis speech problems vision hearing problems memory loss

effective diagnosing intracranial vascular malformations frequently ct angiogram performed order exclude secondary cause detect spot sign intraparenchymal hemorrhage recognized ct scans blood appears brighter tissue separated inner table skull brain tissue tissue surrounding bleed often less dense rest brain edema therefore shows darker ct oedema surrounding haemorrhage would rapidly increase size first hours reached maximum extent day bigger size haematoma larger surrounding brain oedema formation due breakdown red blood cells haemoglobin contents red blood cells released release red blood cells contents causes toxic effect brain causes brain oedema besides breaking bloodbrain barrier also contributes odema apart ct scans haematoma progression intracerebral haemorrhage monitored using transcranial ultrasound ultrasound probe placed temporal lobe estimate volume haematoma within brain thus identifying active bleeding intervention stop bleeding using ultrasound also reduces radiation
