earwax also known medical term cerumen waxy substance secreted ear canal humans mammals earwax many colors including brown orange red yellowish gray earwax protects skin human ear canal assists cleaning lubrication provides protection bacteria fungi particulate matter major components earwax include cerumen produced type modified sweat gland sebum oily substance components made glands located ear canal chemical composition earwax includes long chain fatty acids saturated unsaturated alcohols squalene cholesterol earwax also contains dead skin cells excess compacted cerumen buildup

saturated fatty acids lysozyme especially slight acidity cerumen ph typically around average conversely research found cerumen support microbial growth cerumen samples found bacterial counts high

curette physically dislodges earwax scoops ear west use ear picks usually done health professionals curetting earwax using ear pick common ancient europe still practised east asia since earwax asians
