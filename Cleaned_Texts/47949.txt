psychology centration tendency focus one salient aspect situation neglect possibly relevant introduced swiss psychologist jean piaget cognitivedevelopmental stage theory centration behaviour often demonstrated preoperational piaget claimed egocentrism common element responsible preoperational childrens unsystematic thinking causal research centration primarily made piaget shown conservation tasks contemporary researchers expanded ideas piaget used number tasks test childrens scientific thinking reasoning many specifically tested conservation conservation refers ability determine certain quantity remain despite adjustment container shape apparent conservation tasks include conservation number substance weight volume length perhaps famous task indicative centration conservation liquids task one child shown two glasses filled height child asked two glasses contain amount liquid child almost always agrees next experimenter pours liquid glass p lower wider child asked amount liquid still preoperational stage children respond amount either taller glass wider glass containing liquid child reached concrete operational stage however child conclude amount liquid still centration demonstrated fact child pays attention one aspect liquid either height width unable conserve achievement concrete operational stage child able reason two dimensions simultaneously recognize change one dimension cancels change conservation numbers task piaget gave children row egg cups bunch eggs placing rows equal length equal piaget asked children take enough eggs fill cups children attempted surprised find many eggs centration present child pays attention length rows numbers within row children demonstrated conservation weight length similar task one children shown two balls playdoh equal asked whether children answered yes afterwards piaget rolled one balls longer string asked question one bigger children centrated focused length newly shaped playdoh width old playdoh often said one bigger children able focus dimensions length width able say clumps playdoh still size piaget believed period development deficit cognitive thinking could attributed concept egocentrism refers inability distinguish ones perspective others necessarily imply selfishness speech children egocentric consider matters perspective example young egocentric boy might want buy mother toy car birthday would selfish act would getting present would action take account fact mother might like car child would assume mother would thinking thing would therefore love receive toy car animism attribution life physical objects also stems egocentrism children assumed everything functions long children egocentric fail realize extent person private subjective experiences terms moral reasoning young children regard rules one perspective absolutes handed adults authority egocentric child views things single perspective child fails conserves focuses one aspect problem example water poured one glass shorter broader one child centers single striking dimension difference height child decenter consider two aspects situation centration essentially seen form egocentrism specific tasks involving scientific centration general tendency children within various cognitive tasks perseveration hand centration excess perseveration defined continual repetition particular response word phrase gesture despite absence cessation stimulus usually caused brain injury organic broader sense perseveration used describe wide range functionless behaviours arise failure brain either inhibit prepotent responses allow usual progress different behavior includes impairment set shifting task switching social perseveration centration connected centration basis perseveration perseveration seen symptom injury perseveration issue seen adults centration deficit childrens thinking overcome easily typical developmental gains children generally achieve conservation liquids years entering stage concrete operations overcoming centration seen three main forms first child might use identity argument havent added take away second argument compensation might used child states tallness one glass wideness glass cancel third inversion reasoning possible child might suggest still pour water wide glass back tall glass create two equal looking glasses underlying arguments logical operations mental actions reversible since mental actions child actually need perform seen transformations talking piaget argued children master centration conservation spontaneously crucial moment comes child state internal shown child first says one glass taller says wider becomes confused internal contradiction resolved child taking account multiple aspects problem decenter move onto concrete operational stage multitasking seen cognitive flexibility setshifting requires decentration attention may shifted multiple salient objects situations well decentration essential reading math skills order children move beyond individual letters words meanings shown earlier aspect quantitative understanding interested piaget childs ability conserve quantities face perceptual change later studies disproved piagets contention full understanding conservation concrete operational achievement recent work suggest however may earlier partial forms understanding missed investigators simplified conservation tasks various ways reduced usual verbal demands example allowing child pick candies eat juice drink rather answer questions made context question natural familiar embedding task within ongoing game although changes eliminate nonconservation error completely often result improved performance supposedly preoperational indeed simple situations even demonstrate knowledge invariance number study rochel gelman provides nice example study participants first played game learned series trials plate three toy mice affixed winner plate two toy mice loser critical test trial threemice plate surreptitiously transformed hidden cases length row changed cases one mice removed children unfazed change length continuing treat plate winner actual change number however responded quite differently eliciting search behaviours various attempt explanation children thus showed recognition number least situation remain invariant one note however studies purporting show earlier competence conservation tasks particular critiques suggest methodological changes early competence studies may bias younger children conserve due lower level mechanisms childrens complete tasks therefore may due perceptual mechanisms rather cognitive mechanisms true conservation understanding invariance thus children may simply sensitive discriminating delete addition information rather conserving information across
