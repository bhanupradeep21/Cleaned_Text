mcdonald criteria diagnostic criteria multiple sclerosis ms criteria named neurologist w ian mcdonald directed international panel association national multiple sclerosis society nmss america recommended revised diagnostic criteria ms april new criteria intended replace poser criteria older schumacher criteria undergone revisions maintain poser requirement demonstrate dissemination lesions space time dis discourage previously used poser terms clinically definite probable ms propose diagnostic either ms possible ms mcdonald criteria maintained scheme diagnosing ms based solely clinical grounds also proposed first time clinical evidence lacking magnetic resonance imaging mri findings serve surrogates dissemination space dis andor time dit diagnose criteria try prove existence demyelinating lesions image effects showing occur different areas nervous system dis accumulate time dit mcdonald criteria facilitate diagnosis ms patients present first demyelinating attack significantly increase sensitivity diagnosing ms without compromising mcdonald criteria diagnosis multiple sclerosis revised first clarify exactly meant attack dissemination positive mri later revised mcdonald criteria standard clinical case definition ms version regarded gold standard test ms diagnosiscitation needed two following discourage previously used terms clinically definite probable ms propose diagnostic variants like ms possible ms though terms change revisions revision term possible ms added people typical clinically isolated syndrome meet pathology generally regarded gold standard defining different forms inflammatory demyelinating specificity mcdonald criteria low due fact nature lesions considered dissemination none criteria msspecific order reduce false positives mcdonald et al propose criteria applied disease ruled consensus developed differential another criticism mcdonald criteria definition lesions typical ms unclear review identified following characteristics specific cell morphology shown hematoxylin demyelination shown luxol fast blue macrophage appearance damage axons shown bielschowsky stain astrocytopathy shown glial fibrillary acidic protein different lymphocyte subtypes reacting sensitivity mcdonald criteria low regard pathologically defined ms around ms cases silent ms mcdonald criteria shown low sensitivity specificity respect pathological presence lesions asiatic good predictive quality respect cis clinically isolated syndrome cdms clinically definite multiple sclerosis conversion evaluated nonselected currently much information comparing sensibility specificity different mcdonald versions autopsy reports used poser cdms delayed diagnosis twoyear followup milestone evaluate parameters seems revision higher sensitivity vs vs lower specificity vs vs compared revisions poser two years followup international panel diagnosis ms met dublin ireland third time discuss revise mcdonald diagnostic reasons revisions criteria included simplification demonstration cns lesions space time via imaging address criticisms previous criteria appropriately apply asian one study suggested new criteria allow faster diagnosis slight sacrifice nonenhancing lesions time new andor gadoliniumenhancing lesions followup mri irrespective timing reference baseline scan await second clinical attack allows quicker diagnosis without sacrificing specificity improving sensitivity dis lesion least mstypical regions cns periventricular juxtacortical infratentorial spinal cord await second clinical attack implicating

revision predicted positives followup using reference criteria followup reduction specificity reported revision tries accelerate diagnosis without risking specificity new recommendations european group magnims periodically publishes guidelines using mri diagnosis ms updated mri technology source needed moreover new mri techniques double inversion recovery imaging phase sensitive inversion recovery used identify lesions ms validated could included future criteria another promising mri technique magnetic transfer imaging allow detection damage normalappearing brain tissue away focal lesions finally high resolution spectral domain optical coherence tomography could prove promising sensitive way identifying optic neuritis four biomarkers identified study revisions mcdonald criteria

subclinical disease patients incidentally found brain lesions appearance location consistent ms classified radiologically isolated syndrome ris people develop ms even several years early initiation ms diseasemodifying therapy associated better clinical outcomes important identify individuals subclinical stage disease determine initiation treatment stage beneficial research currently conducted
