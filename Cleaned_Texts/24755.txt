modern food industry industry wheat goes back neolithic period people process grain berries corns singly hand early phase cultivation wheats selected harvestability growability various climate conditions resulting first cultivars industry spread many areas western eurasia neolithization carrying primitive cultivars grains capable used soups speltoids tediously ground simple flours baked goods second phase emmer wheat produced alloquadraploid species contained gluten making baking efficient also spread neolithization places cultivars minority one variant emmer wheat called durum wheat source semolina flour used making pastas food pastes comparable varieties found throughout eurasia finally emmers wheat combined goat grass aegilops tauschii form allohexaploid bread wheat soft fine
