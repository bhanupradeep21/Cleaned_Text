astasis lack motor coordination marked inability stand walk even sit without assistance due disruption muscle coordination term astasia interchangeable astasis commonly referred astasia literature describing astasis inability stand sit without assistance absence motor weakness sensory loss although inclusion lack motor weakness debated physicians categorized symptom actual disease describes disruption muscle coordination resulting deficit disturbance differs cerebellar ataxia astasis gait relatively normal balance significantly impaired transition seated standing position balance impairment similar patients vestibulocerebellar syndrome progressive neurological disease many symptoms effects astasis seen patients diverse thalamic lesions predominantly affecting posterior lateral region frequently accompanied abasia although always abasia symptom similar inability walk two commonly seen astasiaabasia also called blocqs disease common astasia abasia seen together see either one since astasis symptom disease often seen associated signs symptoms people astasis often one study described patient astasis lying bed normal body posture patient sitting tilted body left asked stand patient rotated trunk axis left left shoulder going backwards tilted body side showing resistance passive correction posture planes unable stand fell backwards towards many speculations main cause astasis combination weakness triceps surae muscle peripheral neuropathy irregular postural movements leading theories thus far diabetes spinal root spinal cord lesions traumas injuries motor cortex brain also cause similar symptoms seen patients astasis however none proven definite many scientists also believe conversion disorder patients exhibit symptoms without neurological damage peripheral nerves coming legs somatosensory area leading candidate cause damaged nerves prevent feedback stabilization posture patients astasis causes disturbance postural movements swaying around legs hip joints swaying may seen patient standing still may disappear walking indicating patients exhibit astasia without abasia impairment sensation always required sensation develop however impairment often worsens weakness triceps surae muscle seen many patients diagnosed astasis weakness caused myopathy muscle group bilateral triceps surae muscle made gastrocnemius soleus essential maintain straight posture standing indicates weakness muscle cause swaying impaired posture patients astasis weakness seen regardless whether somatosensory feedback legs impaired suggesting one main causes astasia without many patients suffer diabetes damage single nerve groups nerves body patients experience damage nerves coming somatosensory area controlling postural stability cause symptoms similar seen patients patients exhibit trouble standing hip swaying damage caused wide array things high blood glucose levels decreased blood flow lesions spinal cord spinal root cause damage nerve nerve root depending abnormality patient experience wide range symptoms including found patients astasis seen patients spinal atrophy astasia without abasia neither sensory disturbances lower limbs weakness hip extensor flexor muscles helps indicate one main causes astasia without abasia weakness triceps surae many causes astasia reported temporal hypoperfusion left hemisphere posterior cingulate infarction however one two cases causes also one case reported patient showing hemorrhage right thalamomesencephalic junction region involves important structures control postural stability motor control ocular movements vestibuloocular integration region brain yet well understood according current knowledge first reported case simultaneous combination astasis pretectal syndrome asymmetrical effective treatment astasia seems removal stress inducing stimuli allowing patient rest regain strength despite lack direct prescribable cure effect astasia motor system legs almost documented cases physical rehabilitation relief mental stressors led full recovery although astasia expressly associated neurological disorders due efficacy stressor removal treatment believed mental illnesses depression anxiety well acute stressors potential factors development condition therefore isolation patient current stressors shown efficient way rid disabling motor symptoms another method treatment patients experience astasia therapy triceps surae muscle therapy help strengthen muscles help maintain upright posture also suggested anklefoot orthoses prescribed patients would help patients astasia maintain balance preventing ankle currently physical therapy rehabilitation widely accepted best treatments symptoms astasia however evidence suggest regulation patients social situation behavioral influences influence effectiveness rehabilitation study shows patient given direct encouragement social distractions physical recovery proceeds much faster basic instructions provided paul oscar blocq first
