emotion classification means one may distinguish contrast one emotion another contested issue emotion research affective science researchers approached classification emotions one two fundamental viewpointscitation needed discrete emotion theory humans thought innate set basic emotions crossculturally recognizable basic emotions described discrete believed distinguishable individuals facial expression biological theorists conducted studies determine emotions basic popular example paul ekman colleagues crosscultural study concluded six basic emotions anger disgust fear happiness sadness ekman explains particular characteristics attached emotions allowing expressed varying degrees nonverbal emotion acts discrete category rather individual emotional humans subjective experience emotions clearly recognizable others apparent ease recognition led identification number emotions said basic universal among people however debate among experts questioned understanding emotions

languages differ categorize emotions based different components may categorize event types whereas others categorize action readiness furthermore emotion taxonomies vary due differing implications
