derived dinosauromorphs silesaurus basal saurischians like twenty one autapomorphic characters identified l chanarensis include anterior inclination posterior dorsal neural spines hookshaped femoral head length digit iv metatarsal iv greater digit iii metatarsal l chanarensis lacks many dinosaurian characters anterior trochanter placing basal within even outside group early late olenekian

radiometric dating volcanic material formation narrowed formation entire fossil assemblage found million years suggested extant analogues similar l chanarensis small bipedal mammals often saltators three morphological characteristics l chanarensis fossils putatively cited evidence saltation taxon inclined neural spines small pelvic girdle neural spines posterior dorsal vertebrae inclined anteriorly character observed archosaur common saltatory mammals feature suggested allow greater vertebral flexibility correlated leaping bounding locomotor styles relative hindlimb length pelvic girdle remarkably small distance pelvic girdle femur therefore also small archosaurs apart closely related taxa reduction distance may increase force production hip extension extant small mammals narrow functionally didactyl pes similarity modern saltators condensing single unit metatarsus gains strength without drawback increased weight also appears likely consequently reduction digit ii
