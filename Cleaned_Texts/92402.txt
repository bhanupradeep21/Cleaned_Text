meters ft wide broadest sauropod vertebra known twothirds width made huge transverse processes structures projecting side vertebra heavily expanded deep bases forming winglike structures viewed front titanosaurs dreadnoughtus far less wide puertasaurus processes perpendicular axial plane craniocaudally front back however vertebra rather short shorter average among titanosaurs centrum especially opisthocoelous convex front concave rear laminae neural arch robust although reduced hyposphenehypantrum articulation two structures two vertebrae fit form extra joint present like titanosaurs pre postspinal fossae especially deep broad pre postspinal laminae structures upper half vertebra robust neural spine oriented vertically perpendicular centrum dorsoventrally top bottom low although extremely transversely side side expanded orientation unlike derived titanosaurs instead similar basal ones argentinosaurus sauropods cervical vertebra also notably large transverse width centimeters inches including cervical ribs thought ninth vertebra neck cervical ribs fused centrum centrum especially dorsoventrally compressed pre postspinal fossae neural spine wide deep along expanded distal front end vertebra provide evidence powerful neck ligaments muscles features also known titanosaurs extremely prominent puertasaurus neural spine especially tall laterally sideways expanded point would exceed length centrum would make one proportionately largest neural spines titanosaur apex neural spine positioned posterior side vertebral spinoprezygapophyseal laminae spikelike projection front neural spine separated touch middle neural zygapophyseal articulations connect two adjacent vertebrae located lower part neural arch diapophyses parapophyses processes side vertebra strongly laterally projected cervical vertebra lacks pleurocoels large cavities pneumatic length restored centrum estimated centimeters inches long based two caudal vertebrae middle tail also preserved

several large titanosaurs including futalognkosaurus patagotitan argentinosaurus notocolossus mendozasaurus quetecsaurus many animals argentinosaurus patagotitan especially massive puertasaurus generally recovered stable firm member group lognkosaur although carballido found along quetecsaurus least stable members following cladogram shows position puertasaurus lognkosauria according gonzalez riga colleagues mendozasaurus futalognkosaurus argentinosaurus notocolossus patagotitan puertasaurus puertasaurus late cretaceous period southern patagonia however formation derived geological age disputed inconsistent stratigraphic nomenclature southern patagonia originally reported pari aike formation maastrichtian age pari aike formation subsequently reassigned mata amarilla formation reinterpreted cenomanian recent studies stated deposits pertain cerro fortaleza formation dated campanian maastrichtian approximately million years rocks formation mostly consist sandstone beds along layers mudstone lignitic cerro fortaleza formation represents terrestrial ecosystem presence paleosols lignite suggests humid environment high amounts rainfall high water table avulsion surfaces histosols carbonaceous fossil roots silicified wood provide evidence lowlying forested landscape poor dinosaurs locality include ornithopod talenkauen theropods orkoraptor austrocheirus
