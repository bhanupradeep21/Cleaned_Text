cognition number sense animals ability creatures represent discriminate quantities relative sizes number sense observed various species fish primates animals believed approximate number system system number representation demonstrated humans precise smaller quantities less larger values exact representation numbers higher three attested wild demonstrated period training captive animals order distinguish number sense animals symbolic verbal number system humans researchers use term rather number refer concept supports approximate estimation support exact representation number quality number sense animals includes recognition comparison number quantities numerical operations addition demonstrated many species including rats great apes representing fractions fraction addition observed chimpanzees wide range species approximate number system suggests early evolutionary origin mechanism multiple convergent evolution events like humans chicks lefttoright mental number line associate left space smaller numbers right space larger beginning century wilhelm von osten famously prematurely claimed humanlike counting abilities animals example horse named hans claim widely rejected today attributed methodological fallacy received name clever hans phenomenon case von osten claimed horse could perform arithmetic operations presented horse writing verbally upon horse would knock ground hoof number times corresponded answer apparent ability demonstrated numerous times presence horses owner wider audience also observed owner absent however upon rigorous investigation oskar pfungst first decade century hans ability shown arithmetic nature ability interpret minimal unconscious changes body language people correct answer approaching today arithmetic abilities clever hans commonly rejected case serves reminder scientific community necessity rigorous control experimenter expectation however early reliable studies number sense animals prominent example work otto koehler conducted number studies number sense animals one showed raven named jacob could reliably distinguish number across different tasks study remarkable koehler provided systematic control

numerical ability numerosity represented two separate systems animals similarly humans first system approximate number system imprecise system used estimations quantities system distinguished distance magnitude effects means comparison numbers easier precise distance smaller values numbers smaller second system representing numerosities parallel individuation system supports exact representation

fairly imprecise relies heavily cognitive estimation comparison system give numbers individual value compares quantities based relative size efficiency ans depends weber law states ability distinguish quantities dictated ratio two numbers absolute difference words accuracy ans depends size difference two quantities compared since larger quantities difficult comprehend smaller quantities accuracy ans also decreases numerosity found rhesus macaques macaca mulatta given certain images objects multiple properties ie colors shapes numbers quick match image another number items regardless result

power numbers least comparative evidence ans found chimpanzees successfully identifying different quantities food container chimpanzees listened items food unable see thrown individually separate containers chose container eat based contained higher amount food fairly successful task indicating chimps capability compare quantities also keep track quantities within experiment however break certain similar numbers individual food items according webers number skill thoroughly supported primates ordinality ability recognize sequential symbols rather merely determining value greater less another like ans ordinality requires nuanced recognition specific order numbers items webers law longer applicable since values increasing incrementally often primates displayed ordinality arrays items well arabic numerals presented arrays items rhesus macaques capable consistently touching arrays ascending order test presented arrays containing higher numbers items able extrapolate task touching new arrays also ascending sequential order moreover rate monkeys performed task comparable human primates also recognize sequences given arabic numerals one experiment known colloquially
