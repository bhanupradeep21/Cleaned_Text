blood vessel disorder generally refers narrowing hardening enlargement arteries veins often due buildup fatty deposits lumen blood vessels infection vessel wall occur various locations coronary blood vessels peripheral arteries veins narrowed arteries would block blood supply different organs severe conditions may develop critical health problems like myocardial infarction stroke heart failure major reasons many causes contributing blood vessel disorder including high blood cholesterol calcium levels blood clot formation inflammation arteries found age sedentary lifestyle diets rich lipids smoking diabetes family history cardiovascular diseases common risk mild degree blood vessel disorder may blood tests cholesterol calcium level performed monitor risk disorder additionally techniques angiography ultrasound imaging useful tools treated medication surgery depending type blood vessel disordercitation needed atherosclerosis developmental disease large arteries defined accumulation lipids macrophages fibrous materials endothelial cell blood vessel damaged loses ability regulate results inflammation macrophages irrupt vessel macrophages take lipoprotein form foam cells release growth factor cytokines attract macrophages smooth muscle plaque formed proliferate larger size gradually occluding blood importantly causes different complications affect whole aneurysm localized enlargement arteries characterized balloonlike results abnormal weakening blood vessel common types aneurysm include abdominal aortic aneurysm thoracic aortic aneurysm intracranial types aneurysm except intracranial aneurysm mainly caused raynaud disease rare peripheral vascular syndrome narrows blood vessels generally hands feet due cold stressful recognized reduction blood flow fingers toes periodic spasm results drastic color change white disease may develop ischaemic pain necrosis fingers pathology raynauds disease starts activation sympathetic nervous system triggered cold feeling venous thromboembolism vte common peripheral venous disease defined occlusion venous blood vessels blood clots two major types vte deepvein thrombosis dvt pulmonary dvt often found calf accompanies swelling limbs along deep vein pulmonary embolism causes chronic pulmonary vte third deadliest cardiovascular disease haemostasis rapid development blood clots purpose reducing blood contrary venous clots formed much slower terms several days even weeks abnormality coagulation haemostasis change blood flow endothelial failure may trigger erythromelalgia rare clinical disorder causing redness burning sensation intense pain common found lower limbs upper erythromelalgia initiated dysfunction peripheral nerves thickens blood vessel walls resulting hyperaemic flow stroke serious condition blood vessel disorder caused stop blood supply brain brain cells ceased oxygen supply blood die millions per one major causes death around world also cause permanent disability two major types stroke include ischemic stroke caused atherosclerosis brain hemorrhagic stroke bleeding brain due weakened blood vessel wall inside braincitation needed often asymptomatic early stages blood vessel disease develops variety signs observed different body parts instance patients may pale skin cold hands feet numb fingertips mainly due reduction blood flow limbs resulting decrease heat distribution areas ulcers wounds would also take much longer time heal impairment blood clot formation process muscle weakness cramping may occur well especially legs insufficient oxygen supply muscle cells metabolismcitation needed vascular system strongly influences condition heart also vital rest body blood vessels charge carrying nutrients discard metabolic wastes therefore blood vessel disorder cause serious complications whole bodycitation needed coronary arteries blood vessels supply heart normal function blood vessel disorders occur coronary arteries would affect cardiac activity instance due atherosclerosis plaque would obstruct causes ischaemia reduction blood flow arteries ischaemia would result decrease oxygen supply heart hence weaken heart causes vicious cycle weakened heart contraction would decrease blood supply body including cardiac muscle muscle heart moreover plaque suddenly ruptures heart cause heart attackcitation needed various factors may affect ones susceptibility blood vessel disorders including behavioural eg smoking demographic eg age genetic family history factors risk factors first promote increase blood pressure followed symptoms signscitation needed rise blood pressure correlated arterial compliance amount tension produced per stretch arteries decreases age stiffness arteries increases structural change blood vessels causes elderly susceptible hypertension leads complications arteries heart even braincitation needed obesity would increase risk highfat highcholesterol diet would result elevation lipoprotein level one constituents plaque lipoprotein level mgdl considered susceptible blood vessel blood vessel disorders inherited instance erythromelalgia caused mutation gene alters neural pathway blood genetic disorders affect circulatory immune neural system may contribute hereditary blood vessel disorder one family history shows records vascular disorders likely inherit diseasecitation needed active passive smoking may bring harm vascular instance cigarette smoking cannabinoids smokeless tobacco use found raise blood pressure increase risk moreover cigar cigarette smoking may also cause arterial medications may side effect increasing blood pressure may even suppress effect antiinflammatory drugs pain antiinflammatory drugs like indomethacin nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs piroxicam would retain water systemic circulation raising blood types medications like antidepressant hormone caffeine would also increase blood pressurecitation needed doctors may look signs narrowed enlarged hardened arteries performing physical blood vessel disorder present weak even absent pulse narrowed area artery blood pressure affected limb would lowered whooshing sounds heard affected arteries using following tests could adapted locate point narrowing enlargement blood vesselscitation needed angiography medical imaging technique used visualize lumen blood catheter long thin tube inserted large artery arm groin area guided along artery targeted blood vessel examined imaging dye loaded blood vessel catheter movement dye blood vessel recorded doctors could determine abnormalities blood vessel using fluoroscopy computed tomography ct angiography magnetic resonance mr angiography catheter removed pressure applied incision site minutes prevent excessive bleedingcitation needed vascular ultrasound noninvasive imaging method examine circulation inside blood vessels sound waves transmitted tissues targeted area reflect blood cells moving within blood waves recorded displayed image blood vessel speed waves detected used calculate speed blood flow inside rate blood flow low may blockage vessel evaluating blood flow vessels severity specific location blood vessel disorder different kinds treatment adopted according type severity blood vessel disorder medications usually prescribed relieve specific symptoms arisen disease surgery like angioplasty performed provide longlasting effectcitation needed angioplasty procedure used widen narrowed blood vessels especially coronary arteries long thin tube called catheter inserted large artery incision wrist arm groin area catheter guided affected artery using realtime xray video thin wire introduced blood vessel delivering small balloon affected area balloon inflated stretch blood vessel compress fatty deposits wall hence vessel widened blood flow freely maintain adequate blood supply different tissues finally balloon deflated removed stent may also placed provide support vessel wall prevent beta blockers medications inhibit sympathetic nervous system blocking beta adrenergic receptors used slow heart rate decrease blood pressure inhibiting beta receptors medications also induce vasodilation relaxing smooth muscle blood vessels examples beta blockers include carvedilol metoprolol bisoprololcitation needed calcium channel blockers medications prevent movement calcium ions across calcium channels used relieve hypertension causing vascular smooth muscle also reduce heart rate contractility lower cardiac output turn lower blood pressure amlodipine hydralazine dihydropyridine examples calcium channel blockerscitation needed medications angiotensinconverting enzyme ace inhibitors diuretics used relieve statins fibrates also prescribed lower blood cholesterol level hence reducing risk plaque formation blood antiplatelet medications eg aspirin help reducing blood clot formation vessels well httpsenwikipediaorgwikibloodvesseldisorder
