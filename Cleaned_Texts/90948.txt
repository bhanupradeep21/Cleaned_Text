piscivory frugivory durophagy insectivory case related istiodactylus scavenging dentition mimodactylus differs kellner colleagues suggested probably different feeding habits insectivorous species often slim teeth easily break arthropods among pterosaurs anurognathids thought adapted wellspaced isodont equal length teeth though mimodactylus wider teeth may otherwise fit mode feeding able break exoskeletons extant vertebrate animals feed insects flying short wings low aspect ratios make highly manoeuvrable air unlike mimodactylus long wings high aspect ratio ability manoeuvre flight appears limited mimodactylus opensea fliers probably highly stable flying like albatrosses birds dynamic soaring flying little flapping may also mode flying large pterosaurs anhanguerians istiodactylids pteranodontians kellner colleagues therefore suggested instead insectivorous mimodactylus relatives may foraged decapod crustaceans water surfaces similar albatrosses feed broad rostrum widely spaced
