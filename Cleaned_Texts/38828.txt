development reproductive system part embryonic growth results sex organs contributes sexual differentiation due large overlap development urinary system two systems typically described together urogenital genitourinary system reproductive organs develop intermediate mesoderm preceded primitive structures superseded birth embryonic structures mesonephric ducts also known wolffian ducts paramesonephric ducts also known müllerian ducts mesonephric duct gives rise male seminal vesicles epididymises vas deferens paramesonephric duct gives rise female fallopian tubes uterus cervix upper part mesonephric duct originates part pronephric duct outer part intermediate mesoderm immediately ectoderm region fifth cervical segment third thoracic segment series short evaginations segment grows dorsally extends caudally fusing successively backward form pronephric duct continues grow caudally opens ventral part cloaca beyond pronephros termed mesonephric duct thus mesonephric duct remains atrophy pronephros duct male duct persists forms tube epididymis vas deferens ejaculatory duct seminal vesicle arises third month lateral diverticulum hinder end large part head end mesonephros atrophies disappears remainder anterior tubules form efferent ducts testicle posterior tubules represented ductuli aberrantes paradidymis sometimes found front spermatic cord head epididymis female mesonephric bodies ducts atrophy nonfunctional remains mesonephric tubules represented epoophoron paroöphoron two small collections rudimentary blind tubules situated mesosalpinx lower part mesonephric duct disappears upper part persists longitudinal duct epoöphoron called gartners duct also developments tissues mesonephric duct persist eg development suspensory ligament ovary shortly formation mesonephric ducts second pair ducts developed paramesonephric ducts arises lateral aspect corresponding mesonephric duct tubular invagination cells lining abdominal cavity orifice invagination remains open undergoes enlargement modification form distal tubal opening abdominal ostium fallopian tube ducts pass backward lateral mesonephric ducts toward posterior end embryo cross medial side ducts thus come lie side side behind four ducts forming termed common genital cordcitation needed distinguish genital cords germinal epitheliumcitation needed seen later article mesonephric ducts end epithelial elevation sinus tubercle ventral part cloaca orifices mesonephric ducts later stage sinus tubercle opens middle connecting paramesonephric ducts cloaca male paramesonephric ducts atrophy traces anterior ends represented appendix testis male terminal fused portions form prostatic utricle floor prostatic urethra due production antimüllerian hormone sertoli cells testes female paramesonephric ducts persist undergo development portions lie genital cordcitation needed fuse form uterus vagina fusion paramesonephric ducts begins third month septum formed fused medial walls disappears upward parts outside cord remain separate forms corresponding fallopian tube ostium fallopian tube remains anterior extremity original tubular invagination abdominal cavity fifth month ringlike constriction marks position cervix uterus sixth month walls uterus begin thicken time vagina represented solid rod epithelial cells ringlike outgrowth epithelium occurs lower end uterus marks future vaginal fornix fifth sixth month lumen vagina produced breaking central cells epithelium hymen represents remains sinus tubercle gonads precursors testes males ovaries females initially develop mesothelial layer peritoneum ovary differentiated central part medulla ovary covered surface layer germinal epithelium immature ova originate cells dorsal endoderm yolk sac reached gonadal ridge called oogonia development proceeds oogonia become fully surrounded layer connective tissue cells pregranulosa cells way rudiments ovarian follicles formed embryological origin granulosa cells hand remains controversial male gubernaculum female pulls downward albeit much males gubernaculum later becomes proper ovarian ligament round ligament uterus periphery testicles converted tunica albuginea cords central mass run together form network becomes rete testis another network develops seminiferous tubules via rete testis seminiferous tubules become connected outgrowths mesonephros form efferent ducts testicle short descent testicles consists opening connection testicle final location anterior abdominal wall followed development gubernaculum subsequently pulls translocates testicle developing scrotum ultimately passageway closes behind testicle failure process cause indirect inguinal hernia infantile hydrocoele separation rectum dorsal part cloaca ventral part becomes primary urogenital urogenital sinus turn divides superficial definitive urogenital sinus deeper anterior vesicourethral portion definitive urogenital sinus consists caudal cephalic portion intermediate narrow channel pelvic portion vesicourethral portion deepest portion continuous allantois absorbs ends mesonephric ducts associated ends renal diverticula give rise trigone urinary bladder part prostatic urethra remainder vesicourethral portion forms body bladder part prostatic urethra apex prolonged umbilicus narrow canal urachus later obliterated becomes median umbilical ligament adult prostate originally consists two separate portions arises series diverticular buds epithelial lining urogenital sinus vesicourethral part cloaca third fourth months buds become tubular form glandular substance two lobes ultimately meet fuse behind urethra also extend ventral aspect median lobe prostate formed extension lateral lobes common ejaculatory ducts bladder skenes glands female urethra regarded homologues prostatic glands bulbourethral glands male bartholins gland female also arise diverticula epithelial lining urogenital sinus ninth week gestational external genitalia males females look follow common development includes development genital tubercle membrane dorsally covering developing urogenital opening development labioscrotal fold urogenital folds become penile raphe male labia minora even differentiation seen sexes stages common eg disappearing membrane hand sexdependent development include protrusion genital tubercle male form glans shaft penis female glans body labioscrotal swelling evolves scrotum males labia majora initially cloacal membrane composed ectoderm endoderm reaching umbilical cord tail separating cloaca exterior separation rectum dorsal part cloaca ventral part cloacal membrane becomes urogenital membrane mesoderm extends midventral line distance behind umbilical cord forms lower part abdominal wall ends prominent swelling cloacal tubercle separation rectum becomes genital tubercle dorsally tubercle sides really fused rather urogenital part cloacal membrane separates ingrowing sheets mesoderm genital tubercle develops primordial phallus first rudiment penis terminal part phallus representing future glans becomes solid remainder phallus remains hollow converted longitudinal groove absorption urogenital membrane term genital tubercle still remains refers future glans sexes phallic portion urogenital sinus extends surface cloacal tubercle far forward apex apex walls phallic portion come together fuse obliterating urogenital opening instead solid plate urethral plate formed remainder phallic portion time tubular absorption urogenital membrane establishes communication exterior opening primitive urogenital opening extends forward corona glandis following developments occur males females although difference development sexes already seen female deep groove forms around phallus sides grow dorsalward labioscrotal folds ultimately form labia majora females labia minora contrast arise continued growth lips groove surface phallus remainder phallus forms clitoral labioscrotal folds extend around pelvic portion anus form scrotal area changes associated descent testes scrotal area drawn form scrotal sacs penis developed phallus female urogenital membrane undergoes absorption forming channel surface phallus channel extends far forward corona glandis later opening located dorsal side closes behind forward meanwhile urethral plate glans breaks centrally form median groove continuous primitive ostium groove also closes behind forward leaving small pipe running middle penis thus urogenital opening shifted forward end glans primitive urogenital organs embryo previous
