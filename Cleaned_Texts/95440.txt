working memory training intended improve persons working memory working memory central intellectual faculty linked iq ageing mental health claimed working memory training programs effective means treating specific medical conditions associated working memory deficit general increase cognitive capacity among healthy neurotypical adults individual studies topic show different sometime contradictory results one meta study puts asking question cognitive training improve intelligence inappropriate asking medicine cure disease since none specify particular intervention medicine working memory training program evaluated alleviating condition applied adhd stroke general cognitive improvement etc circumstances administered selection criteria adherence rate outcome variables etc influential metastudy highly critical cognitive training analysed studies group comparisons concluded clinical memory training programs produce reliable shortterm improvements working memory skills children adults adhd also evidence effects maintained longterm without additional followup three years later another metastudy reached opposite conclusion working memory training consistent useful effects type working memory tests practiced also non trained tasks everyday since range additional clinical experiments completed larger sample sizes clearly defined control groups uniform treatment outcome variables evidence still far unanimous several experimental studies working memory training shown beneficial effects people suffered stroke traumatic brain children undergone cancer well normally developing working memory wm system holds multiple pieces transitory information mind information needed different tasks right working memory differs shortterm memory storage manipulation
