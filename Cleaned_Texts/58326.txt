blood vessels components circulatory system transport blood throughout human vessels transport blood cells nutrients oxygen tissues body also take waste carbon dioxide away tissues blood vessels needed sustain life bodys tissues rely five types blood vessels arteries carry blood away heart arterioles capillaries exchange water chemicals blood tissues occurs venules veins carry blood capillaries back towards heart word vascular meaning relating blood vessels derived latin vas meaning vessel structures cartilage epithelium lens cornea eye contain blood vessels labeled avascular arteries veins three layers middle layer thicker arteries veinscitation needed capillaries consist single layer endothelial cells supporting subendothelium consisting basement membrane connective tissue blood vessels connect form region diffuse vascular supply called anastomosis anastomoses provide critical alternative routes blood flow case blockages leg veins valves prevent backflow blood pumped gravity surrounding various kinds blood vesselscitation needed roughly grouped arterial venous determined whether blood flowing away arterial toward venous heart term arterial blood nevertheless used indicate blood high oxygen although pulmonary artery carries venous blood blood flowing pulmonary vein rich oxygen carrying blood lungs respectively oxygenated blood vessels function transport blood general arteries arterioles transport oxygenated blood lungs body organs veins venules transport deoxygenated blood body lungs blood vessels also circulate blood throughout circulatory system oxygen bound hemoglobin red blood cells critical nutrient carried blood arteries apart pulmonary artery hemoglobin highly saturated oxygen veins apart pulmonary vein saturation hemoglobin values reversed pulmonary circulation addition carrying oxygen blood also carries hormones waste products nutrients cells bodycitation needed blood vessels actively engage transport blood appreciable peristalsis blood propelled arteries arterioles pressure generated blood vessels also transport red blood cells contain oxygen necessary daily activities amount red blood cells present vessels effect health hematocrit tests performed calculate proportion red blood cells blood higher proportions result conditions dehydration heart disease lower proportions could lead anemia longterm blood permeability endothelium pivotal release nutrients tissue also increased inflammation response histamine prostaglandins interleukins leads symptoms inflammation swelling redness warmth paincitation needed veins regulate inner diameter contraction muscular layer changes blood flow downstream organs determined autonomic nervous system vasodilation vasoconstriction also used antagonistically methods size blood vessels different ranges diameter millimeters aorta micrometers capillaries comes vasoconstriction constriction blood vessels narrowing becoming smaller crosssectional area contracting vascular smooth muscle vessel walls regulated vasoconstrictors agents cause vasoconstriction include paracrine factors eg prostaglandins number hormones eg vasopressin angiotensin neurotransmitters eg epinephrine nervous system vasodilation similar process mediated antagonistically acting mediators prominent vasodilator nitric oxide termed endotheliumderived relaxing factor reason circulatory system uses channel blood vessels deliver blood parts body result left right side heart working together allow blood flow continuously lungs parts body oxygenpoor blood enters right side heart two large veins oxygenrich blood lungs enters pulmonary veins left side heart aorta reaches rest body capillaries responsible allowing blood receive oxygen tiny air sacs lungs also site carbon dioxide exits blood occurs lungs blood blood pressure blood vessels traditionally expressed millimetres mercury mmhg pa arterial system usually around mmhg systolic high pressure wave due contraction heart mmhg diastolic low pressure wave contrast pressures venous system constant rarely exceed mmhg vascular resistance occurs vessels away heart oppose flow blood resistance accumulation three different factors blood viscosity blood vessel length vessel blood viscosity thickness blood resistance flow result different components blood blood water weight rest blood composed protein nutrients electrolytes wastes dissolved gases depending health individual blood viscosity vary ie anemia causing relatively lower concentrations protein high blood pressure increase dissolved salts lipids vessel length total length vessel measured distance away heart total length vessel increases total resistance result friction vessel radius also affects total resistance result contact vessel wall radius wall gets smaller proportion blood making contact wall increase greater amount contact wall increase total resistance blood blood vessels play huge role virtually every medical condition cancer example progress unless tumor causes angiogenesis formation new blood vessels supply malignant cells metabolic atherosclerosis narrowing blood vessels due buildup plaque coronary artery disease often follows cause heart attacks cardiac arrest leading cause death worldwide resulting million deaths blood vessel permeability increased inflammation damage due trauma spontaneously may lead hemorrhage due mechanical damage vessel endothelium contrast occlusion blood vessel atherosclerotic plaque embolised blood clot foreign body leads downstream ischemia insufficient blood supply possibly infarction necrosis due lack blood supply vessel occlusion tends positive feedback system occluded vessel creates eddies normally laminar flow plug flow blood currents eddies create abnormal fluid velocity gradients push blood elements cholesterol chylomicron bodies endothelium deposit onto arterial walls already partially occluded build upon common disease blood vessels hypertension high blood pressure caused increase pressure blood flowing vessels hypertension lead serious conditions heart failure stroke prevent diseases common treatment option medication opposed surgery aspirin helps prevent blood clots also help limit vasculitis inflammation vessel wall due autoimmune disease infection another blood vessel disease called broken blood vessel broken blood vessels also known spider veins telangiectasias small damaged blood vessels appear red purple blue lines skins surface commonly found face legs chest unsightly blemishes caused various factors appearance may cause
