holotype specimen ditsong national museum natural history pretoria south africa formerly known transvaal museum due limited fossil records study platycraniellus briefly described handful platycraniellus recognized basal cynodonts characterized broad temporal region skull short snout based phylogenetic position platycraniellus variety morphologies similar sister taxon thrinaxodon relatively wellstudied platycraniellus elegans discovered lystrosaurus assemblage zone free state province south africa holotype first described van hoepen originally named platycranion elegans potentially printing error first publication following year van hoepen renamed specimens platycraniellus originally platycraniellus elegans classified member galesauridae family contained species incomplete complete osseous secondary palates hoposon kitching later feature used classify taxon two families galesauridae thrinaxodontidae galesauridae name given taxon incomplete secondary palates whereas thrinaxodontidae name given taxon complete secondary palates platycraniellus elegans considered larger specimen nmqr originally referred platycraniellus elegans however recent studies considered specimen galesaurus planiceps hopson well therefore holotype specimen fossil record platycraniellus moment holotype specimen generally great condition however significant damages caused immature preparation techniques back dorsal view skull broad shape wide temporal region two large lateral temporal fenestrae relative orbits short snout one main characteristics group premaxilla anterior premaxillary foramen developed ascending process damaged dorsally narrow septomaxilla present nasal region less developed species thrinaxodon maxilla region contains series nutritive foramina infraorbital foramen anterior ventral orientation nasal bone wider contacts lacrimal prefrontal bones orbits face forward outward parietal foramen extends back along parietal bar center sagittal crest robust zygomatic arch main reason skull wide similar thrinaxodon progalesaurus chiniquodon squamosal zygomatic portion extends anteriorly base postorbital bar jugal extends back along zygomatic ventral view platycraniellus complete osseous secondary palate similar thrinaxodon palate extends penultimate postcanine length snout shows remarkably broad short palatal process palatine posterior margin huge incisive foramen present reaches posterior margin upper canine base pterygoid process tiny quadrangular ectopterygoid present quadrate slightly convex anteriorly contacts quadrate ramus pterygoid reaches posteriorly epipterygoid feature also appears basal cynodonts thrinaxodon galesaurids quadrate lateral condyle less developed medial condyle group similarities skull morphology thrinaxodon development quadrate quadratojugal epipterygoid greatly enlarged anteroposteriorly welldeveloped interorbital vacuity large trigeminal foramen present frontal distinguished dorsally lacks

mature overall angle dentary slightly prominent lateral crest right side low angular lateral view welldeveloped well concave laterally right reflected lamina sturdy strong base preserved holotype specimen unfortunately almost dentition holotype damaged grinding based roots upper dentition appear four incisors one canine roughly six seven postcanines eight teeth present dentary crowns preserved four upper right postcanines one lower postcanine compared postcanines smooth canine exhibits faint longitudinal striations relatively simple first second postcanine groups progalesaurus galesaurus platycraniellus dentition exhibits prominent curved tip convex front edge solitary cusp apart skull small portion humerus preserved attached skull diaphysis bottom part bone therefore dorsal view element described deltopectoral crest clearly defined perpendicular long axis bone bottom part bone notably wide laterally expanded entepicondyle trochlea create triangular groove visible striations scars infer muscle attachment points epicondyles large entepicondylar foramen observed platycraniellus sister group eucynodontia belongs epicynodontia clade subdivision larger cynodontia clade thrinaxodon placed successive outgroup two groups notably cynodontia clade platycraniellus member crucial evolution mammals including morganucodon cynodontia considered third radiation synapsids includes mammals living procynosuchus dvinia cynosaurus galesaurus progalesaurus thrinaxodon platycraniellus cynognathia probainognathia masseteric fossa dentary preserved represents higher bite force since feature allows masseteric muscle attaches lower jaw provides greater strength biting chewing feature also allows efficient powerful jaw together multicusps dentition platycraniellus suggested carnivore predominantly meateating animal similar thrinaxodon complete osseous secondary palate divides nasal cavity rest mouth would given platycraniellus ability breathe processing food feature allows platycraniellus maximize time processing food reduce digestion time eventually gain energy mobile activity therefore platycraniellus suggested highly mobile lifestyle required active metabolic based phylogeny close relationship thrinaxodon platycraniellus potentially contains diaphragm due separation dorsal vertebrae thoracic lumbar regions seen diaphragm would allow platycraniellus overcome carriers constraint whereby reptiles breathe running adaptation could support highspeed movements required high metabolic rate therefore considering cranial postcranial morphologies
