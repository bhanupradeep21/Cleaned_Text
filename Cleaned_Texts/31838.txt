lowgrade myofibroblastic sarcoma lgms subtype malignant currently recognized lgms first described rare atypical myofibroblastic tumor ie tumor consisting cells microscopic features fibroblasts smooth muscle cells mentzel et al myofibroblastic sarcomas divided lowgrade myofibroblastic sarcomas myofibroblasic sarcomas ie igms myofibroblasic sarcomas ie hgms also termed undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma pleomorphic myofibrosarcoma formerly termed malignant fibrous based microscopic morphological immunophenotypic malignancy lgms igms classified world health organization category intermediate rarely metastasizing fibroblastic myofibroblastic classifies hgms preferred name undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma soft tissue tumor category tumors uncertain article follows classification lgms includes igms hgms aggressive metastasizing tumor consists cells uncertain lgms tumors typically painless lesions develop subcutaneous tissues ie lowermost layer submucosa ie thin layer tissue lying mucous membranes line passageways gastrointestinal respiratory genitourinary muscles often develop middleaged adults average years old diagnosed tumors often recur sites surgical removal may metastasize nearby lymph nodes distant lgmss commonly treated surgical removal tumor along cells removed increase probability tumor recur site lgms tumors typically show little sensitivity radiotherapy chemotherapy lgms present single tumors ranged size cm three literature review another study individuals diagnosed lgms aged years median years years old eightytwo percent lgms tumors located soft tissues mucous membranes muscle skin soft tissues bone overall tumors head neck areas commonly tongue followed larynx gums mandible face skull ear canal trunk arm leg bone tumors located femurs mandible maxilla tibias one case hard palate reports tumors occurred oral mucosa groin small intestine greater omentum lesser omentum omentum eye socket month old chest typically presenting slow growing painless masses individuals presented increasingly painful subcutaneous submucosal masses individuals reported pain one retrospective rare cases submucosal lgms tumors presented serious symptoms partial bowel obstructions due intrabdominal lgms shortness breath palpitations due lgms tumor difficulty swallowing breathing due laryngeal lgms abdominal pain due pancreas lgms study individuals presenting first time lgms found local disease regional disease metastases local lymph nodes distant study individuals distant metastasis rate metastasis reported develop various sites including pleura lymph nodes bones thoracic cavity abdominal cavity brain spinal microscopic histopathological analyses hematoxylin eosin stained lgms tissues generally show bundles atypical spindleshaped cells variably hyalinized ie glassy appearing stromal background containing collagen tumors encapsulated commonly infiltrate adjacent fibrous fat skeletal muscle tumors spindleshaped cells may infiltrate individual skeletal muscle create characteristic checkerboard lgms tissues commonly small extensive foci epithelioid ie epitheliallike cells polygonal minority cases tumor tissues scattered mast cells sites numerous areas necrosis ie dead dying immunohistochemical analyses find lgms tumors spindleshaped cells commonly express also known αsmooth muscle actin desmin ie intermediate filament protein found muscle forms including smooth muscle tumors composed cells expressing proteins tumors composed cells expressing one tumor cells often express vimentin also termed proteins typically fail express cytokeratin erg βcatenin myogenin epithelioid polygonalshaped cells express cytokeratin various chromosome abnormalities found tumor cells lgms cases ring chromosome andor giant marker chromosome commonly occur cells various mesenchymal found one case addition tumor cells may rare cases contain copy number variations gains genetic material short ie p arm chromosomes losses genetic material long ie q arm chromosome chromosome abnormalities considered analysis lgms tumor cells chromosome gene abnormalities yet helpful understanding diagnosing lgms suspected cases presenting nodular masses composed spindleshaped cells combining fibroblast smooth muscle cell features arranged bundles express αsmooth muscle andor desmin vimentin marker proteins cited previous section spindleshaped cell infiltrations individual skeletal muscle fibers form checkerboard presence foci containing epithelioid polygonal cells express cytokeratin also indicative lgms tumor past treatments lgms including surgery radiotherapy chemotherapy systematically investigated currently primary common treatment nonmetastatic lgms surgical resection possible removal tumor cells order reduce tumors recurrence rate eg two different following surgery individuals undergo longterm observation check postsurgical recurrences uncommon instances one study suggested tumor cells high rates proliferation tumors containing areas necrosis tumor sizes cm largest diameters deepseated tumors higher risks radiotherapy chemotherapy used without surgical resections treat cases tumor resections later found leave tumor cells behind tumors could safely resected metastases study individuals presenting lgms tumors first time received surgical treatment received radiation treatment received chemotherapy study concluded radiotherapy chemotherapy limited effects survival therefore routinely used lgms especially cases tumor cells results conclusions agree previous reports finding lgms tumors insensitive radiotherapy nonetheless case reports local radiotherapy may allow longer survival may select cases useful treating similar situation exists chemotherapy reports recommend chemotherapy potential treatment strategy particularly complete excision tumor possible tumor highly invasive andor tumor spread lymph nodes andor distant case reports chemotherapy following surgical excision may useful prolonging progressionfree survival example individual pancreatic lgms tumor treatment regimen ifosfamide pirarubicin studies needed define usefulness radiation therapy chemotherapy majority studies prognosis patients treated lgms focused shortterm ie oneyear followup one study patients age range average age years median age years treated lgfs reported overall survival percentages years respectively diseasespecific survival ie excluding deaths causes unrelated lgms years treatment respectively patients treated surgery cases radiotherapy cases patients lymph node metastasis case distant metastases presence lymph node distant tissue metastasis unknown study individuals treated lfms reported diseasespecific survival percentages respectively patient age years factor clearly reduced survival times study disease specific survival times patients years old younger years months httpsenwikipediaorgwikilowgrademyofibroblasticsarcoma
