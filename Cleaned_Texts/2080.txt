oligokyphus cusps extinct genus herbivorous tritylodontid cynodont known late triassic early jurassic europe asia north america oligokyphus named edwin hennig basis two teeth württemberg germany name genus derived greek ὀλιγος κυφος hump calque paucituberculata group oligokyphus initially classified latin like tritylodon oligokyphus originally classified mammal hennig initially recognized two species named oligokyphus triserialis oligokyphus biserialis based number rows cusps though acknowledged distinction next discoveries oligokyphus made united kingdom german paleontologist walter georg kühne traveled united kingdom goal collecting early mammal specimens outbreak world war ii led kühnes internment isle man time prepared studied collected kühne initially identified specimens tritylodon discovery specimens lacked dentarysquamosal jaw joint time viewed defining characteristic mammals led conclude tritylodontids mammallike reptiles though recognized close origin kühnes detailed description material published made oligokyphus bestknown tritylodontid kühne regarded two different size classes adult present though acknowledged differences could due sexual dimorphism proposed represented two distinct species named oligokyphus major oligokyphus genus reported early jurassic kayenta formation united species lufengensis described lower jurassic lufeng formation indeterminate remains genus described mccoy brook formation eastern canada dating latest triassic oligokyphus relatively small tritylodontids skull mm long estimated body mass may sexual dimorphism teeth upper lower jaw contain bump rows fit together perfectly order maintain accurate bite oligokyphus face similar modern mammals although differences cheekbones eye sockets bony secondary palate doublerooted cheek teeth unlike mammals teeth oligokyphus occlude jaw double jointed neck flexible atlas axis double occipital condyle teeth different related cynodonts canine teeth unusually large rodentlike incisors large gap diastema separating cheek teeth incisors lower jaw animals moved back forth mouth shut food could chopped oligokyphus premaxilla lateral extension maxilla postcanines nonmammalians oligokyphus difficult differentiate canines lower postcanines oligokyphus also considered premolars defining tritylodonts lower postcanine teeth trityldonts two cusps found per row however oligokyphus two rows three cusps cusps specific oligokyphus tritylodonts allowed wellfitting bite particularly good shredding plant material dense fiber foremost incisors similar todays rodents extremely intensified enlarged typical location canine teeth left empty oligokyphus instead gap inserted area jaw oligokyphus lack teeth commonly known oligokyphus family tritylodontidae family named shape teeth tritylodontidae means three knob teeth members family small mediumsized advanced synapsids combined specialized structures herbivorous eating first tritylodont found south africa upper jurassic rocks first thought one earliest mammals classification since adjusted nonmammals became progressively mammallike classified closest relatives mammals supported high flat crested jaw large zygomatic arches well developed secondary palate specialized dentition also comparisons cranial nerves tritylodonts mammals shoulder girdle forelimb structures suggestive digging animals animals extremely active burrowed leaf litter dirt suggests characteristics rodents rabbits naturally metabolism partially completely endothermic thought driven relatives mammals competing ecological nichescitation needed another reason animal could gone extinct due new plant development flowering plants angiosperms could detrimental animals since may used eating new plantscitation needed oligokyphus small tetrapod terrestrial animals long considered mammaliomorphs link earlier synapsids modern mammals believed animals primarily land dwelling living amongst small shrubs bushes also thought oligokyphus fed seeds nuts teeth resemble modern animals also feed seeds rather difficult estimate social behaviors oligokyphus preserve fossil record however considering conditions planet times oligokyphus alive thriving late triassic early jurassic also locations fossils animals found educated predictions made metabolism feeding habits oligokyphus conveniently placed leg hip structures likely quickmoving fed lowlying plant life long weasellike body may even possible oligokyphus reach higher vegetation simply standing hind legs probably good use hands manipulate seeds digestively pleasing foods support showing oligokyphus ability climb vertically rodents capable today definitive radiometric dating area preserved formation oligokyphus lived yet made available stratigraphic correlation based combination radiometric dates vertebrate fossils magnetostratigraphy pollen surmised kayenta formation deposited sinemurian pliensbachian stages early jurassic period

rivers early jurassic period land kayenta formation experienced rainy summers dry winters middle jurassic period encroached upon north sandy dune field would become navajo animals adapted seasonal climate abundant water could found streams ponds lakes oligokyphus lived beneath feet dinosaurs theropods dilophosaurus coelophysis kayentakatae basal sauropodomorph heterodontosaurids armored dinosaur scutellosaurus kayenta formation produced remains three coelophysoid taxa different body size represents diverse ceratosaur fauna yet kayenta formation yielded small growing assemblage
