doctorscientist character served protagonist previous versions secondary replacement male protagonist female one reflected trend towards female protagonists horror films often known final girl many ways film tells especially vicious comingofage narrative martis family destroyed end left boyfriend knöppler noted martis family highly dysfunctional begin killing pod versions family members reflected tendency towards rejecting family already present even encountered pod knöppler noted despite strong female protagonist noticeable undercurrent monstrous femininity sexuality film carol housewives army base replaced first carol acts primary way pod version carol almost replaces steve trying seduce suggests fear meg tillys performance carol evokes many stereotypes associated malevolent another example female antagonist shortlived pod version marti appears nude tim notably hesitates moment killing save real marti scene knöppler sees expression male sexual insecurity

broken dysfunctional families presented fact carol replaced first literalizes resentment felt marti towards stepmother already invaded critics see character steve beleaguered male archetype popular films trying hold together family fractured first martis rebellion carol however fact marti likeable protagonist steve notably fails protecting family undercuts knöppler also noted first film set idealized small town california second film set san francisco fairly general representations american life third film chosen focus subculture moving story us army base argued change settling film moved critique american life general critique army base closed community fixed hierarchy highly conformist culture film seems suggest military mentality makes impossible distinguish professional soldiers one critic sums films attitude perhaps oversimplification say body snatchers treats americas armed forces complete total contempt deserve large degree exceptions major collins bases doctor tim slightly nonconformist helicopter tim killed people gulf war portrayed sensitive type entirely comfortable throughout film soldiers base appear conformist generally threatening faces usually obscured dim lighting limiting likewise scene pod version general platt confronts dr collins former promotes version world without individuality best way end conflict pod people say chorus race thats important emphasis collective race subtly evokes way collins shouts back individual always important shoots elevates question collectivism vs individualism existential unlike previous versions
