transmission involves cyst form extent humanhuman humananimal animalhuman transmission occurs still unknown genomic studies provide evidence three routes though experimental studies yet provide conclusive proof existence conclusively stating blastocystis animal reservoir depends upon unraveling true nature transmission noël et al deem likely based upon molecular work review literature animaltohuman transmission possible animals pigs dogs could fact acting large reservoir capable human epidemiological studies finding infection common people living proximity farm animals supports notion blastocystis various morphological forms four commonly described forms vacuolar otherwise known central body granular amoeboid cyst forms appearance organism largely dependent upon environmental conditions extremely sensitive oxygen whether forms exist host intestine unclear vacuolar form typical cell form blastocystis seen culture often used identification organism vacuolar forms vary greatly size diameters ranging µm µm vacuolar form otherwise known central body form large central vacuole surrounded thin band peripheral cytoplasm contains organelles flocculent material described scattered unevenly throughout vacuole function vacuole still unclear however suggested like many eukaryotic cells storage purposes functions cell division reproduction deposition apoptotic bodies proposed although tests need done validate roles granular form somewhere somewhat morphologically similar vacuolar forms except distinct granules observed central vacuole cytoplasm within central vacuole granules appear different forms three types suggested metabolic lipid reproductive granules metabolic granules play role chemical processes necessary maintenance life organism also put forward reproductive granules involved development progeny cells hypotheses made based microscopy alone may deemed misleading hence need done making definite conclusion also suggested granules may indication cell dying form exists amoeboid form amoeboid form blastocystis nonmotile strongly adhesive research study reported amoeboid forms produced cultures taken symptomatic individuals asymptomatic individuals producing exclusively vacuolar forms study suggested method could used diagnosing symptomatic infection additionally suggested symptoms could due accumulation strongly adhesive amoeboid forms hosts intestinal wall detailed ultrastructural study amoeboid forms published blastocystis cyst form recent discovery helped advancement understanding way infection transmitted compared forms generally smaller size thick multilayered cyst wall lacks central vacuole nuclei multiple vacuoles food storage deposits observed cyst form resistant form parasite able survive harsh conditions thick multilayered cyst wall experiments carried show ability withstand acidic gastric juices besides cysts lyse placed distilled water could survive well room temperature days indicating strong supposed life cycle begins ingestion cyst form ingestion cyst develops forms may turn redevelop cyst forms human faeces cyst forms enter external environment transmitted humans animals via route repeating entire cycle atcc maintains collection blastocystis isolates records show whether isolates obtained symptomatic asymptomatic carriers yet publication identified subtypes atcc isolates
