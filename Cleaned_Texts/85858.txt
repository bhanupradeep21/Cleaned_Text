enantiopure drug pharmaceutical available one specific enantiomeric form biological molecules proteins sugars etc present one many chiral forms different enantiomers chiral drug molecule bind differently target receptors chirality observed geometric properties object superimposable mirror image two forms molecule formed mirror images chiral carbon two forms called enantiomers one enantiomer drug may desired beneficial effect may cause serious undesired side effects sometimes even beneficial entirely different desired enantiomer known eutomer undesired enantiomer known equal amounts enantiomers found mixture mixture known racemic mixture mixture drug ratio enantiomers candidate enantiopure drug advances industrial chemical processes made economical pharmaceutical manufacturers take drugs originally marketed racemic mixture market individual enantiomers either specifically manufacturing desired enantiomer resolving racemic mixture casebycase basis us food drug administration fda allowed single enantiomers certain drugs marketed different name racemic also casebycase united states patent office granted patents single enantiomers certain drugs regulatory review marketing approval safety efficacy patenting proprietary rights independent differs country country louis pasteur became first scientist discover chirality enantiomers working tartaric acid experiments noticed two crystal structures produced structures looked nonsuperimposable mirror images observation isomers nonsuperimposable mirror images became known enantiomers couple years later pasteur discovered enantioselectivity noticed two enantiomer structures previously discovered metabolized much different speeds suggested one configuration preferred vivo organic chemistry knowledge became advanced discovery enantioselectivity used creation enantiopure formation enantiopure drug results separation enantiomers chiral drug separation prompted found enantiomer molecule different effects used drugs body chiral selective reacting enantiomer differently therefore producing different pharmaceutical effects use drug single enantiomer makes drug effective drug pure enantiomer formed two enantiomers must first separated tested three main techniques used separation capillary gas chromatography high performance liquid chromatography capillary electrophoresis technique chiral crystallization enzymebased kinetic separation enantioselective synthesis also body living organisms composed many enantiopure chiral substances example amino acids make proteins body configuration labsolute configuration specificity vital processes constructing proteins rely stereoselectivity ensure potential enantiomers available body utilizing correct enantiopure selectivity important part organic synthesis scientific papers regarding synthesis selectivity often listed data tables alongside percent yield reaction conditions selectivity deemed important scientific literature challenging effectively implement selectivity drug development production major issue selectivity pharmaceuticals large percentage drug syntheses nature selective reactions racemic mixtures formed products separating racemic mixtures respective enantiomers takes extra time money energy one way separate enantiomers chemically convert species separated diastereomers diastereomers unlike enantiomers entirely different physical points melting points nmr shifts separated conventional means chromatography recrystallization whole extra step synthesis process desirable manufacturing result number pharmaceuticals synthesized marketed racemic mixture enantiomers cases lesseffective enantiomer benign however identifying specifically purifying enantiomer effectively binds respective binding site body less drug would needed achieve desired improvement chiral technology rich repertoire enantioselective chromatographic methods become available separation drug enantiomers industrial according fda stereoisomeric composition chiral drug known effects wellcharacterized pharmacologic toxicologic clinical standpoints order profile different stereoisomers enantiopure drugs manufacturers urged develop quantitative assays individual enantiomers vivo samples early development stage ideally main pharmacologic activities isomers compared vitro systems animals instances toxic findings present beyond natural extensions pharmacologic effects drug toxicologic evaluation individual isomers question must drugs covered patent protection pharmaceutical company holds patent allowed manufacture market eventually profit lifetime patent varies countries also drugs united states drug patents last twenty patent expired drug manufactured sold companies point referred generic drug availability market generic drug removes monopoly patent holder thereby encouraging competition causing significant drop drug prices ensures lifesaving important drugs reach general population fair prices however company holding initial patent may get new patent forming new version drug significantly changed compared original patentability different isomers controversial past ten years number related legal issues making determinations courts looked factors including whether racemate known prior art ii difficulty resolving enantiomers iii stereoselectivity relevant receptor iv secondary considerations nonobviousness commercial success unexpected results satisfaction longfelt needs art decisions made regarding issues varied clear answer legality patenting stereoisomers issues resolved casebycase number current pharmaceuticals currently marketed racemic mixtures likely patentability continue debated near future examples common drugs like ibuprofen use chiral switching caused controversy ibuprofen racemic mixture senantiomer known play major role reducing inflammation inhibits cooxygenase compared renantiomer fact senantiomer stronger led chiral switching racemic ibuprofen enters body little half renantiomers experience chiral inversion transform favored senantiomer observation led conclusion racemic senantiomer potentially biologically equivalent recent evidence suggesting renantiomer may actually contribute inhibition well slower rate still debate whether chiral switching seen ibuprofen really advantageous give patent protections manufacturers following table lists pharmaceuticals available racemic singleenantiomer form singleenantiomer drug switched respective racemic drug referred chiral switch following cases individual enantiomers markedly different effects
