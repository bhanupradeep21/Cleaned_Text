amplified musculoskeletal pain syndrome amps longterm condition characterized amplified pain without identifiable physical common symptoms include changes skin texture color temperature changes hair nail growth skin sensitivity touch also known allodynia dizziness especially going standing position cases symptoms caused psychological trauma psychological amps also commonly caused physical injury possible causes amps include ehlersdanlos syndrome myositis arthritis rheumatologic due nature condition amps often diagnosed first presents amps diagnosed review patients medical history well multiple tests rule diagnosis conditions bone amps treated various methods cure condition pain management treatment potential causes psychological stress used include psychotherapy physical therapy pain management treatments prognosis condition positive ability majority effected individuals recover completely management condition gradual improvement time leave many individuals feeling lack motivation progress amps management anyone affected amps though commonly affected individuals children adolescents affected individuals amplified musculoskeletal pain syndrome characterized various symptoms includes chronic pain allodynia abdominal pain dysphagia dizziness fatigue headache joint pain movement issues stiffness shakiness coordination difficulty swelling fast heart rate skin texture color temperature changes paresthesia changes nail hair growth common symptoms symptoms also cause various complications mainly mental symptoms still heavy impact effected individual include anxiety depression psychological trauma psychological chronic pain one main symptoms amps pain associated disorder either constant intermittent also distinguishable based whether pain isolated one region body felt throughout body matter type pain felt amps kinds equally debilitating heavy impacts quality life effected individual mechanics amps individuals condition visual changes affected area mainly seen complex regional pain syndrome visual changes amps include swelling skin texture color temperature changes changes nail hair symptoms present forms cases amps individuals effected condition often receive diagnosis condition first presents often given diagnoses accurate physiological cause mechanism amps condition often result complications result presented symptoms include various physical symptoms including muscle atrophy physical conditions possible result amps mental health conditions frequent including anxiety depression psychological trauma psychological stress various events cause amps three main causes include psychological stress physical injury various conditions risk factors causes disease including arthritis myositis ehlersdanlos syndrome autoimmune diseases psychological trauma main cause amps evidence shows capable causing reported amps often target treatment amps includes psychotherapy occupational therapy one reasons selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors used management physical injury bone fracture surgery second common cause often resulting complex regional pain syndrome type amps isolated one region body hand foot amps little research dedicated evidence showed mutual cause condition amplified pain believed caused pain signals sent brain also incorrectly sent sympathetic nervous system also known fight flight nerves causes involuntary response pain including vein constriction causes increased heart rate increase muscle tone increased respiratory rate reduce blood flow muscles bone resulting increase waste products lactic buildup waste products well depletion oxygen results amplified pain associated common theory cause health care professionals researchers complete evidence cause amps largely lack research associated disorder lack awareness amps classified four different types may divided multiple subtypes includes complex regional pain syndrome diffuse idiopathic pain intermittent amplified pain localized amplified complex regional pain syndrome term amount spontaneous regional pain lasting longer expected recovery time observed physical trauma injury includes two separate types type type ii type crps formerly known reflex sympathetic dystrophy rsd sudecks atrophy refers crps without observed nerve damage type ii formerly known causalgia refers crps observed nerve damage form similarly forms amps known able spread one limb new limb people effected crps report fullbody impacts condition common symptoms crps include musculoskeletal pain swelling changes skin texture color temperature limited range type amps includes fullbody pain also known juvenile fibromyalgia type amps refers amplified pain varies intensity time refers localized amplified pain without symptoms type include symptoms swelling skin texture color temperature changes perspiration observation symptoms implies diagnosis complex regional pain syndrome little awareness amps condition frequently diagnosed symptoms first present often multiple diagnoses physical conditions diagnosis condition diagnosed observation various patient traits full overview patients medical history well rule potention physical causes bone fracture physical causes observed diagnosis amps likely common steps taken may include bone scans detect possible signs reduced blood flow magnetic resonance imaging mri detect possible edema muscle atrophy nerve testing used look pain sensitivity issues xrays detect osteoporosis result tests detect possible signs amps better outcomes usually made less tests immediate treatment amps without looking possible differential amps disease one specific cure management condition process patients learning manage abnormal amplified pain include combination treating causes condition well managing symptoms condition psychological stress accounts cases amps medication often involves typical antidepressants also often prescribed chronic pain impact serotonin impact muscular pain many providers also use injectable medication treatment amps opioid use recommended amps cases worsen recovery rare cases make condition physical treatment amps common shown long term benefit includes physical therapy message therapy aerobic exercise physical therapy involves training use affected limb training use body purpose retraining muscles muscle atrophy retraining use affected muscles less amplified pain message therapy used desensitize affected area body build tolerance pain help symptoms allodynia hyperalgesia amps well indirectly help common symptoms relieving patient pain could cause psychological stress depression anxiety well number physiological conditions including headaches httpsenwikipediaorgwikiamplifiedmusculoskeletalpainsyndrome
