major causative factors peptic ulcer disease secretes urease create alkaline environment suitable survival expresses blood group antigenbinding adhesin baba outer inflammatory protein adhesin oipa

unclear stomach mucosal inflammation associated hyperchlorhydria increased stomach acid secretion hypochlorhydria reduced stomach acid secretion inflammatory cytokines inhibit parietal cell acid secretion h pylori also secretes certain products inhibit hydrogen potassium atpase activate calcitonin generelated peptide sensory neurons increases somatostatin secretion inhibit acid production parietal cells inhibit gastrin secretion reduction acid production causes gastric hand increased acid production pyloric antrum associated duodenal ulcers h pylori infection cases case somatostatin production reduced gastrin production increased leading increased histamine secretion enterochromaffin cells thus increasing acid production acidic environment antrum causes metaplasia duodenal cells causing duodenal human immune response toward bacteria also determines emergence peptic ulcer disease human gene encodes interleukin beta genes encode tumour necrosis factor tnf lymphotoxin alpha also play role gastric taking nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids increase risk peptic ulcer disease four times compared nonusers risk getting peptic ulcer two times aspirin users risk bleeding
