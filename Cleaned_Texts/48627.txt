evolutionary genetics mullers ratchet named hermann joseph muller analogy ratchet effect process absence recombination especially asexual population results accumulation irreversible deleterious happens absence recombination assuming reverse mutations rare offspring bear least much mutational load muller proposed mechanism one reason sexual reproduction may favored asexual reproduction sexual organisms benefit recombination consequent elimination deleterious mutations negative effect accumulating irreversible deleterious mutations may prevalent organisms reproduce asexually also undergo forms recombination effect also observed regions genomes sexual organisms undergo recombination although muller discussed advantages sexual reproduction talk contain word ratchet muller first introduced term ratchet phrase mullers ratchet coined joe felsenstein paper evolutionary advantage asexual reproduction compels genomes inherited indivisible blocks least mutated genomes asexual population begin carry least one deleterious mutation genomes fewer mutations expected found future generations except result back mutation results eventual accumulation mutations known genetic load theory genetic load carried asexual populations eventually becomes great population goes also laboratory experiments confirmed existence ratchet consequent extinction populations many organisms intense drift recombinations allowed including rna viruses bacteria sexual populations process genetic recombination allows genomes offspring different genomes parents particular progeny offspring genomes fewer mutations generated highly mutated parental genomes putting together mutationfree portions parental chromosomes also purifying selection extent unburdens loaded population recombination results different combinations among protists prokaryotes plethora supposedly asexual organisms exists shown exchange genetic information variety mechanisms contrast genomes mitochondria chloroplasts recombine would undergo mullers ratchet small see birdsell wills pp indeed probability least mutated genomes asexual population end carrying least one additional mutation depends heavily genomic mutation rate increases less linearly size genome accurately number base pairs present active genes however reductions genome size especially parasites symbionts also caused direct selection get rid genes become unnecessary therefore smaller genome sure indication action mullers sexually reproducing organisms nonrecombining chromosomes chromosomal regions mammalian chromosome exception multicopy sequences engage intrachromosomal recombination gene also subject effects mullers ratchet nonrecombining sequences tend shrink evolve quickly however fast evolution might also due sequences inability repair dna damage via templateassisted repair equivalent increase mutation rate sequences ascribing cases genome shrinkage fast evolution mullers ratchet alone easy mullers ratchet relies genetic drift turns faster smaller populations populations deleterious mutations better chance fixation therefore sets limits maximum size asexual genomes longterm evolutionary continuity asexual however asexual lineages thought quite ancient bdelloid rotifers example appear asexual nearly million however rotifers found possess substantial number foreign genes possible horizontal gene transfer furthermore vertebrate fish poecilia formosa seems defy ratchet effect existed generations explained maintenance genomic diversity parental introgression high level heterozygosity resulting hybrid

accumulation deleterious mutation would increase ultimately results extinction population argued recombination evolutionary development ancient life early rna replicators capable recombination may ancestral sexual source asexual lineages could periodically recombination early sexual lineages may provided means coping genome mullers ratchet ancient conditions would likely impeded evolutionary persistence asexual lineages unable undergo since deleterious mutations harmful definition accumulation would result loss individuals smaller population size small populations susceptible ratchet effect deleterious mutations would fixed result genetic drift creates positive feedback loop accelerates extinction small asexual populations phenomenon called mutational
