development urinary system begins prenatal development relates development urogenital system organs urinary system sex organs reproductive system development continues part sexual differentiation urinary reproductive organs developed intermediate mesoderm permanent organs adult preceded set structures purely embryonic exception ducts disappear almost entirely birth embryonic structures either side pronephros mesonephros metanephros kidney wolffian müllerian ducts sex organ pronephros disappears early structural elements mesonephros mostly degenerate gonad developed place wolffian duct remains duct males müllerian female tubules mesonephros form part permanent kidney outer part intermediate mesoderm immediately ectoderm region fifth cervical segment third thoracic segment series short evaginations segment grows dorsally extends caudally fusing successively backward form pronephric duct continues grow caudally opens ventral part cloaca beyond pronephros termed wolffian duct thus wolffian duct remains pronephric duct atrophy pronephros original evaginations form series transverse tubules communicates means funnelshaped ciliated opening abdominal cavity course duct glomerulus also developed secondary glomerulus formed ventral complete group constitutes pronephros humans pronephros rudimentary undergoes rapid atrophy disappears medial side wolffian duct sixth cervical third lumbar segments series tubules wolffian tubules develops increase number outgrowths original tubules change solid masses cells instead become hollowed center one end grows toward finally opens wolffian duct dilates invaginated tuft capillary bloodvessels form glomerulus tubules collectively constitute mesonephros mesonephros persists form permanent kidneys fish amphibians reptiles birds mammals atrophies part disappears rapidly permanent kidney metanephros develops beginning sixth seventh week beginning fifth month ducts tubules mesonephros remain male wolffian duct persists forms example epididymis ductus deferens ejaculatory duct seminal vesicle efferent ducts female hand wolffian bodies ducts atrophy leaving behind remnants adult involving eg development suspensory ligament ovary shortly formation wolffian ducts second pair ducts developed müllerian ducts arises lateral aspect corresponding wolffian duct tubular invagination cells lining abdominal cavity orifice invagination remains open undergoes enlargement modification form abdominal ostium fallopian tube ducts pass backward lateral wolffian ducts toward posterior end embryo cross medial side ducts thus come lie side side behind four ducts forming termed common genital cord distinguish genital cords germinal epithelium seen later article müllerian ducts end epithelial elevation müllerian eminence ventral part cloaca orifices wolffian ducts later stage eminence opens middle connecting müllerian ducts cloaca male müllerian ducts atrophy traces anterior ends represented appendices testis hydatids morgagni male terminal fused portions form utriculus floor prostatic urethra female müllerian ducts persist undergo development portions lie genital cord fuse form uterus vagina fusion müllerian ducts begins third month septum formed fused medial walls disappears upward parts outside cord remain separate forms corresponding fallopian tube ostium fallopian tube remains anterior extremity original tubular invagination abdominal cavity fifth month ringlike constriction marks position cervix uterus sixth month walls uterus begin thicken time vagina represented solid rod epithelial cells ringlike outgrowth epithelium occurs lower end uterus marks future vaginal fornix fifth sixth month lumen vagina produced breaking central cells epithelium hymen represents remains müllerian metanephros definite permanent yet immature kidney arises two directions one hand precursor ureter buds wolffian duct hand precursor renal tubules develop metanephrogenic blastema ureteric bud subsequently grows latter mass forming parts nephron changes include eg translocation ureteric opening directly cloaca rudiments permanent kidneys make appearance end first beginning second month kidney originates ureteric bud caudal end wolffian duct turn originates intermediate mesoderm ureteric bud starts close wolffian duct opens cloaca grows dorsalward rostralward along posterior abdominal wall blind extremity expands subsequently divides several buds form rudiments renal pelvis renal calyces continued growth subdivision gives rise collecting duct system kidney superficial portion diverticulum hand becomes ureter renal corpuscles renal tubules contrast developed metanephrogenic blastema instead ureteric bud metanephrogenic blastema moulded growing end latter becomes part metanephros way renal tubules metanephros unlike pronephros mesonephros open wolffian duct instead tubules rapidly elongate form parts nephron proximal tubules loops henle distal convoluted tubules last join establish communications collecting duct system derived ultimate ramifications ureteric bud end renal tubules give rise bowmans capsules glomeruli mesoderm around tubules becomes condensed form connective tissue kidney ureter opens first hindend wolffian duct sixth week separates wolffian duct opens independently part cloaca ultimately becomes urinary bladder renal tubules become arranged renal pyramids lobulated condition kidneys exists time birth traces may found even adult kidney ox many animals hand remains lobulated throughout life urinary bladder formed partly endodermal cloaca partly ends wolffian ducts words allantois takes share formation separation rectum dorsal part cloaca ventral part becomes primary urogenital urogenital sinus turn divides superficial definitive urogenital sinus deeper anterior vesicourethral portion definitive urogenital sinus consists caudal phallic portion intermediate narrow channel pelvic portion vesicourethral portion deepest continuous allantois absorbs ends wolffian ducts associated ends renal diverticula give rise trigone urinary bladder part prostatic urethra remainder vesicourethral portion forms body bladder part prostatic urethra apex prolonged umbilicus narrow canal urachus later obliterated becomes median umbilical ligament adult ninth week gestational sex organs males females look follow common development includes development genital tubercle membrane dorsally covering developing urogenital opening development labioscrotal folds even differentiation seen sexes stages common eg
