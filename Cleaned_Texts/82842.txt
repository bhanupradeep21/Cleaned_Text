asphyxia asphyxiation condition deficient supply oxygen body arises abnormal breathing asphyxia causes generalized hypoxia affects primarily tissues organs many circumstances induce asphyxia characterized inability person acquire sufficient oxygen breathing extended period time asphyxia cause coma death million cases unintentional suffocation occurred resulted word asphyxia ancient greek α without σφύξις sphyxis squeeze throb situations cause asphyxia include limited airway obstruction constriction obstruction airways asthma laryngospasm simple blockage presence foreign materials environments oxygen readily accessible underwater low oxygen atmosphere vacuum environments sufficiently oxygenated air present adequately breathed air contamination excessive smoke causes oxygen deficiency include limited smothering mechanical obstruction flow air environment mouth andor nostrils instance covering mouth nose hand pillow plastic smothering either partial complete partial
