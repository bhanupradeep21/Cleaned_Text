ascending cholangitis also known acute cholangitis simply cholangitis inflammation bile duct usually caused bacteria ascending junction duodenum first part small intestine tends occur bile duct already partially obstructed cholangitis lifethreatening regarded medical characteristic symptoms include yellow discoloration skin whites eyes fever abdominal pain severe cases low blood pressure confusion initial treatment intravenous fluids antibiotics often underlying problem gallstones narrowing bile duct tests treatments may necessary usually form endoscopy relieve obstruction bile word greek chol bile ang vessel itis inflammation person cholangitis may complain abdominal pain particularly right upper quadrant abdomen fever rigors uncontrollable shaking feeling uneasiness malaise may report jaundice yellow discoloration skin whites physical examination findings typically include jaundice right upper quadrant charcots triad set three common findings cholangitis abdominal pain jaundice assumed past present cases although recently frequency reported reynolds pentad includes findings charcots triad presence septic shock mental combination symptoms indicates worsening condition development sepsis seen less commonly elderly presentation may atypical may directly collapse due sepsis without first showing typical indwelling stent bile duct see may develop bile duct obstruction usually present acute cholangitis generally due gallstones cases however due causes benign stricturing narrowing bile duct without underlying tumor postoperative damage altered structure bile ducts narrowing site anastomosis surgical connection various tumors cancer bile duct gallbladder cancer cancer ampulla vater pancreatic cancer cancer duodenum anaerobic organisms clostridium bacteroides especially elderly undergone previous surgery biliary parasites may infect liver bile ducts may cause cholangitis include roundworm ascaris lumbricoides liver flukes clonorchis sinensis opisthorchis viverrini opisthorchis people aids large number opportunistic organisms known cause aids cholangiopathy risk rapidly diminished since introduction effective aids cholangitis may also complicate medical procedures involving bile duct especially ercp prevent recommended undergoing ercp indication receive prophylactic preventative presence permanent biliary stent eg pancreatic cancer slightly increases risk cholangitis stents type often needed keep bile duct patent outside bile produced liver serves eliminate cholesterol bilirubin body well emulsifying fats make soluble water aid digestion bile formed liver hepatocytes liver cells excreted common hepatic duct part bile stored gall bladder back pressure exerted sphincter oddi may released time digestion gallbladder also concentrates bile absorbing water dissolved salts bile reaches duodenum first part small intestine common bile duct ampulla vater sphincter oddi located junction ampulla vater duodenum circular muscle controls release bile pancreatic secretions digestive biliary tree normally relatively free bacteria certain protective mechanisms sphincter oddi acts mechanical barrier biliary system normally low pressure allows bile flow freely continuous forward flow bile duct flushes bacteria present duodenum allow establishment infection constitution secreted epithelium bile duct also protective role bacterial contamination alone absence obstruction usually result however increased pressure within biliary system resulting obstruction bile duct widens spaces cells lining duct bringing bacterially contaminated bile contact blood stream also adversely affects function kupffer cells specialized macrophage cells assist preventing bacteria entering biliary system finally increased biliary pressure decreases production iga immunoglobulins results bacteremia bacteria blood stream gives rise systemic inflammatory response syndrome sirs comprising fever often rigors tachycardia increased respiratory rate increased white blood cell count sirs presence suspected confirmed infection called biliary obstruction disadvantages immune system impairs capability fight infection impairing function certain immune system cells neutrophil granulocytes modifying levels immune hormones ascending cholangitis assumed organisms migrate backwards bile duct result partial obstruction decreased function sphincter theories origin bacteria portal vein transmigration colon considered less routine blood tests show features acute inflammation raised white blood cell count elevated creactive protein level usually abnormal liver function tests lfts cases lfts consistent obstruction raised bilirubin alkaline phosphatase Î³glutamyl transpeptidase early stages however pressure liver cells may main feature tests resemble hepatitis elevations alanine transaminase aspartate blood cultures often performed people fever evidence acute infection yield bacteria causing infection usually hours incubation bile may sent culture ercp see common bacteria linked ascending cholangitis gramnegative bacilli escherichia coli klebsiella enterobacter grampositive cocci enterococcus causes given ascending cholangitis usually occurs setting bile duct obstruction various forms medical imaging may employed identify site nature obstruction first investigation usually ultrasound easily ultrasound may show dilation bile duct identifies bile duct stones relatively poor identifying stones farther bile duct ultrasound help distinguish cholangitis cholecystitis inflammation gallbladder similar symptoms cholangitis appears differently better test magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography mrcp uses magnetic resonance imaging mri comparable sensitivity smaller stones however still missed mrcp depending quality hospitals gold standard test biliary obstruction still endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ercp involves use endoscopy passing tube mouth esophagus stomach thence duodenum pass small cannula bile duct point radiocontrast injected opacify duct xrays taken get visual impression biliary system endoscopic image ampulla one sometimes see protuberant ampulla impacted gallstone common bile duct frank extrusion pus common bile duct orifice xray images known cholangiograms gallstones visible nonopacified areas contour duct diagnostic purposes ercp generally replaced mrcp ercp used firstline critically ill patients delay diagnostic tests acceptable however index suspicion cholangitis high ercp typically done achieve drainage obstructed common bile causes rather gallstones suspected tumor computed tomography endoscopic ultrasound eus may performed identify nature obstruction eus may used obtain biopsy tissue sample suspicious eus may also replace diagnostic ercp stone disease although depends local cholangitis requires admission hospital intravenous fluids administered especially blood pressure low antibiotics commenced empirical treatment broadspectrum antibiotics usually necessary known certain pathogen causing infection antibiotics sensitive combinations penicillins aminoglycosides widely used although ciprofloxacin shown effective cases may preferred aminoglycosides fewer side effects metronidazole often added specifically treat anaerobic pathogens especially ill risk anaerobic infections antibiotics continued drugs increase blood pressure vasopressors may also required counter low blood definitive treatment cholangitis relief underlying biliary usually deferred hours admission patient stable shown improvement antibiotics may need happen emergency case ongoing deterioration despite adequate antibiotics effective reducing signs infection happens endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ercp common approach unblocking bile duct involves endoscopy passing fiberoptic tube stomach duodenum identification ampulla vater insertion small tube bile duct sphincterotomy making cut sphincter oddi typically done ease flow bile duct allow insertion instruments extract gallstones obstructing common bile duct alternatively additionally common bile duct orifice dilated stones may removed either direct suction using various instruments including balloons baskets trawl bile duct order pull stones duodenum obstructions caused larger stones may require use instrument known mechanical lithotriptor order crush stone prior obstructing stones large removed broken mechanically ercp may managed extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy technique uses acoustic shock waves administered outside body break alternative technique remove large obstructing stones electrohydraulic lithotripsy small endoscope known cholangioscope inserted ercp directly visualize stone probe uses electricity generate shock waves break obstructing rarely surgical exploration common bile duct termed choledochotomy performed laparoscopy required remove narrowed areas may bridged stent hollow tube keeps duct open removable plastic stents used uncomplicated gallstone disease permanent selfexpanding metal stents longer lifespan used obstruction due pressure tumor pancreatic cancer nasobiliary drain may left behind plastic tube passes bile duct stomach nose allows continuous drainage bile receptible similar nasogastric tube passes common bile duct directly allows serial xray cholangiograms done identify improvement obstruction decision aforementioned treatments apply generally based severity obstruction findings imaging studies whether patient improved antibiotic certain treatments may unsafe blood clotting impaired risk bleeding especially sphincterotomy increased use medication clopidogrel inhibits platelet aggregation prothrombin time significantly prolonged prolonged prothrombin time vitamin k fresh frozen plasma may administered reduce bleeding cases person ill tolerate endoscopy retrograde endoscopic approach fails access obstruction percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram ptc may performed evaluate biliary system placement percutaneous biliary drain often necessary case proximal stricture bilioenteric anastomosis surgical connection bile duct small bowel duodenum access across stricture obtained balloon dilation performed stones swept forward due potential complications percutaneous biliary drain placement necessity regular drain retrograde approach via ercp remains firstline gallstones implicated ascending cholangitis actually originate gallbladder cholecystectomy surgical removal gallbladder generally recommended people treated cholangitis due gallstone disease typically delayed symptoms
