three treatment modalities also aim improving lems symptoms namely pyridostigmine amifampridine guanidine work improve neuromuscular transmission tentative evidence supports least base watersoluble phosphate may formulations delay repolarization nerve terminals discharge thereby allowing calcium accumulate nerve pyridostigmine decreases degradation acetylcholine release synaptic cleft thereby
