affective events theory aet industrial organizational psychology model developed organizational psychologists howard weiss georgia institute technology russell cropanzano university colorado explain emotions moods influence job performance job model explains linkages employees internal influences eg cognitions emotions mental states reactions incidents occur work environment affect performance organizational commitment job satisfaction theory proposes affective work behaviors explained employee mood emotions cognitivebased behaviors best predictors job theory proposes positiveinducing eg uplifts well negativeinducing eg hassles emotional incidents work distinguishable significant psychological impact upon workers job results lasting internal eg cognition emotions mental states external affective reactions exhibited job performance job satisfaction organizational alternatively research suggests job satisfaction mediates relationship various antecedent variables dispositions workplace events job characteristics job opportunities employee behavior exhibited job eg organizational citizenship behaviors counterproductive work behaviors job end workers experience uplifts eg completing goal receiving award hassles eg dealing difficult client reacting updated deadline intention continue quit depends upon emotions moods thoughts associated satisfaction derive research demonstrated relationship job satisfaction turnover fully mediated intention quit workers report low job satisfaction likely engage planned however relationship account employees report high job satisfaction quit unexpectedly although extrinsic rewards better job offers outside current organization may influence decisions employees personality factors may also impact decisions exit early otherwise ideal jobs ideal working recipients often refer specific events exit interviews voluntarily leaving current jobs minor events subtle emotional effects also cumulative impact job satisfaction particularly occur acutely high example perceived stressful events work often positively associated high job strain day occur negatively associated strain day resulting accumulation perceived jobrelated stress consistent general understanding vocational psychology job satisfaction distal longterm outcome mediated perceived job relationships components associated work eg tasks autonomy job demands emotional labor impact job outcomes support tasks considered challenging rewarding provide opportunity develop new skills induce positive affect increase job alternatively tasks rated routine boring overwhelming associated negative affect eg low selfesteem low selfconfidence concerns job may lead workers engage planned quitting degree autonomy workers jobs affects productivity satisfaction intention research shows ability make decisions influence happens job greatest impact job satisfaction particularly among young male job autonomy even trumps incomes effect job alternatively work overload significantly reduces job satisfaction among middleaged women men significantly impact job satisfaction among young male differences age gender workers indicate differences career phase young male workers likely put expect work overload middleaged workers tend approaching peak may expect concessions eg based track record merit currency likewise work flexibility affects job fact flexibility decide work performed ranks number one among women number two three among men determining characteristics satisfying similar job autonomy job flexibility important income evaluating job flexibility determine ones work schedule important contributor job satisfaction across spectrum low highincome work flexibility empowers employees reducing incidence workfamily conflicts engagement planned quitting improve overall quality positive affect fringe benefit work flexibility pays rich dividends employees employers empowering former improving ability latter retain past research suggested workplace affect stateoriented construct like emotions mood depended upon work environment situations encountered however recent research describes affect dispositional trait dependent upon although workplace events significant impact employees mood largely determines intensity reaction events experienced emotional response intensity tends affect job performance employment variables like effort leaving deviance commitment citizenship also affected positive negative perceptions events experienced general cognitive ability also known g personality also influence job emotion cognition help explain organizational citizenship behaviours ocb example emotions one job ie job affect strongly associated ocbs directed individuals one thoughts job cognitions reportedly strongly associated ocbs directed outcome satisfied individual employee herhis job within organization may depend upon perceives incident experienced job satisfaction also depends upon emotions thoughts associated perception well social support provided coworkers organization personality research five factor model ffm supports aet ffm parsimonious model distinguishes differences among individuals dispositions done basis five factors contains six underlying facets selfreported measures conscientiousness agreeableness neuroticism openness experience extraversion consistently predict affect outcome events experienced evidence personality factors predict explain describe employees may react affective events experienced work instance maladaptive traits derived diagnostic statistical manual correlate workrelated affect incremental validity traits explain minimal beyond general conscientiousness concerns delayed gratification personality trait conscientiousness involves regulating impulsiveness following methodically determined plans achieve nonimmediate five factors conscientiousness considered best predictor training job performance occupational conscientiousness demonstrated employee industriousness selfinitiative selfdiscipline orderliness time positively predicts intrinsic ie job satisfaction extrinsic ie compensation benefit career accomplishment complex tasks correlated high conscientiousness general cognitive intention leave organization less influenced extrinsic reward perceived procedural fairness highly important conscientious perceptions conscientiousness others may also influence intention provide assistance work investigations examining impact interaction low performing members g conscientiousness teamlevel prosocial behavior demonstrates team members likely exhibit high prosocial behavior poor performer perceived low g high conscientiousness high g high conscientiousness team members exhibit moderate levels prosocial behavior poor performer exhibits low g low conscientiousness poor performer perceived high g low conscientiousness team members exhibit least amount prosocial conscientiousness emotional stability predict low employee turnover high job performance indicating personality traits robust assessed personnel selection subsequent validation utility conscientiousness considered account possible moral ethical contractual obligations may lead employee mental state employees high conscientiousness may decide demonstrate high organizational commitment due transactional fairness accordance norms reciprocity long perceived debt highly religious conscientious workers may believe quitting goes workoriented beliefs eg protestant work ethic volition carry quitting sign poor individuals high agreeableness exhibit prosocial behaviors cooperative compassionate polite show sincere concern welfare rights research links agreeableness empathy theory mind explain emotions intentions mental states agreeable workers valued employees agreeableness key factor maintaining social tendency strive toward integration inclusion solidarity others supports group tend helpful concerned welfare agreeable workers also tend experience high job satisfaction compared less agreeable workers high agreeableness tend rate high intrinsic motivation particularly work performed behalf others organization heterogeneity personality important team productivity particularly agreeableness involved complete agreeableness among members team negatively related performance tends lead relationship agreeableness job satisfaction apparent exchangeoriented transactional work workers low agreeableness satisfied work environment required interact likely engage prosocial organizational citizenship behaviors lowagreeable workers likely disengage behaviors find work environment less favourable highly agreeable workers hand likely engage prosocial organizational citizenship behaviors regardless work climate environment disposition others required work since tend focus needs others organization opposed keeping track transactions deviant behavior higher among workers low agreeableness particularly organizational support agreeableness conscientiousness often linked organizational citizenship behavior however relationship recent research suggests agreeableness acts moderator affects workers experienced states citizenship behavior two personality traits also negatively correlated employee workers selfreport low agreeableness likely engage unplanned quitting leading condition known hobo syndrome ie habitual job individual sensitivity punishment core numerous findings show neuroticism related tendency experience negative affect work social neurotic individuals exhibit irritability anxiety impulsiveness selfconsciousness seems underlie general sensitivity threat authors neopir indicate poor emotion regulation low selfesteem excessive rumination common among neurotic underlying anxiety implied neuroticism linked emotional instability typically important predicting employees intentions low emotional stability also linked intention quit reasons job dissatisfaction poor job neuroticism best predictor among big five personality traits negative job example neuroticism negatively predicts extrinsic ie compensation benefit conscientiousness great predictor positive job performance job satisfaction neuroticism best predictor negative job satisfaction regularly used personnel selection personnel neuroticism explains significant variation mood job satisfaction among openness experience exhibited mental abstraction flexibility nonlinear thinking enabled use imagination intellectual curiosity appreciation aesthetics core facets personality employees assessed high openness experience generally score high tests general cognitive ability demonstrate high abilities information processing working memory abstract reasoning focused workers high openness experience likely engage unplanned however finding may little affect derived events experienced work individuals selfreport high openness experience may impulsive decisions suddenly quit may due value placed job diversity need change exploration interests intolerance routine boredom underlying sense openness experience appear predict explain job extraversion considered responsible individual sensitivity extraversions underlying facets assertiveness sociability talkativeness reported related approach tendencies within individuals toward either intrinsic extrinsic like human activity currency world work involves rewards high sensitivity reward seems synonymous extraversion making workers exhibit high extraversion likely highly motivated highly productive independent collaborative work particularly heightened work involves supervision others management resources extraverts tend experience positive affect perceive positively recall positive negative work events compared intention quit among extraverts less dependent upon procedural fairness within organization particularly opportunity social rewards work perceived conscientiousness extraversion best predictors positive job workers mood influences job performance job hedonic tone explains variation event work affects workers internal state ie mood state expressed even though positive events reported three five times often negative events approximately five times impact inverse relationship exists hedonic tone work affect hedonic tone negatively related work performance positively related work workers likely selfless altruistic positive events occur compliments open acknowledgement job welldone promotions turn seem improve job performance negative events work however likely cause negative mood employees resulting negative work behaviours work slowdowns work withdrawal mood may moderated organizational commitment turn may affect workers decisions stay quit example workers may suppress true feelings choose dissociate mood work high continuance organizational commitment ie committed due social economic costs may true workers high affective organizational commitment typically case workers highly affiliated organizations eg workers family history working organization believe deeply organizations values similarly workers high normative organizational commitment feel put lessthanfavourable work environmental conditions contractual research demonstrates employee mood strong predictor job neuroticism extraversion explain lot variation individual differences job satisfaction variation mood job satisfaction accurately predicting individual workers level also indication individuals may predisposed perceive events occur work either negative effect positive events job satisfaction weaker among workers high negative mood predisposition low negative mood predisposition either optimistic pessimistic job satisfaction may frame job even positive negative events occur workcitation needed rule possibility hiring personnel come job negative outlook personality potential employees evaluated use standardized selfreport personality inventories eg neopir hiring highly conscientious agreeable extraverted personnel tend satisfied jobs extension tend stay longer alternatively organizations may develop structured interview questions behaviorally anchored rating scales bars provide convergent validity critical predictors job performance eg neuroticism inventories interviews tests must reliable valid order demonstrate utility legal defensibility support selection hiring process intensity negative affect experienced work often leads work withdrawal absenteeism vandalism early organizations continually seek select train retain employees incentives compensation benefits advancement mechanisms influence organizational commitment demonstrated organizational commitment suggests employees selfidentify employers individuals identify employing organizations likely support organization act best three components organizational commitment ie affective continuance normative affective organizational commitment correlated experiencing positive affect organizational commitment style greater impact affect individual personality factors finding supports organizational psychological findings indicating employee identification organization based upon affective fact stronger correlation positive emotions affective commitment positive emotions job decision continue working organization however seem dependent upon negative affect factors debt pension implications future job prospects outside organization must also considered negative affect experienced events work may related changes work performance work withdrawal absenteeism well job satisfaction seem deciding factor whether employee leave research suggests poor physical mental emotional health result negative emotions experienced may due perfectionist dispositional tendencies interact daily hassels manifested psychosomatic workers experience frequent thoughts needing perfect tend report psychosomatic psychosomatic complaint may also occur response emotional dissonance caused need suppress ones true feelings toward coworkers toward patients students customers emotional labour emotion work required achieve effect required consequence workers may act opposed feel positive negative emotions work remain compliant organizational code conduct however adherence organizational norms may belie true internal state individual worker authenticity emotional harmony situations may yield dissonance negatively impact workers health resulting emotional dissonance may lead increased stress symptoms general decrease overall job satisfaction negatively correlated need suppress negative emotions emotions play important role coworkers respond poor emotions stronger influence either expectancies attributions predicting behavioral intentions toward poor performing team members work turn could spread affect emotions team members toward poor performance emotional outcomes shown depend upon whether workers promotion protectionfocused promotionfocused workers tend exhibit eager risktaking toward opportunities demonstrate competence order accumulate gains whereas protectionfocused workers inclined show emotions vigilant toward defending erosion perceived feeling good ones job strongly associated overall job satisfaction need work function ones continuance performance feedback important influence employee affect regular performance reviews wellestablished occurrence medium largescale type performance feedback provided supervisors managers affect subsequent employee performance job employees tend rate leaders effectiveness low leaders provide failure feedback negative
