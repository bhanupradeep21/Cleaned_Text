kidney disease renal disease technically referred nephropathy damage disease kidney nephritis inflammatory kidney disease several types according location inflammation inflammation diagnosed blood tests nephrosis noninflammatory kidney disease nephritis nephrosis give rise nephritic syndrome nephrotic syndrome respectively kidney disease usually causes loss kidney function degree result kidney failure complete loss kidney function kidney failure known endstage kidney disease dialysis kidney transplant treatment option chronic kidney disease defined prolonged kidney abnormalities functional andor structural nature last three acute kidney disease termed acute kidney injury marked sudden reduction kidney function seven days one eight americans chronic kidney rate increasing americans estimated ckd causes kidney disease include deposition immunoglobulin antibodies glomerulus administration analgesics xanthine oxidase deficiency toxicity chemotherapy agents longterm exposure lead salts chronic conditions produce nephropathy include systemic lupus erythematosus diabetes mellitus high blood pressure hypertension lead diabetic nephropathy hypertensive nephropathy respectively one cause nephropathy long term usage pain medications known analgesics pain medicines cause kidney problems include aspirin acetaminophen nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids form nephropathy chronic analgesic nephritis chronic inflammatory change characterized loss atrophy tubules interstitial fibrosis inflammation brs pathology edition specifically longterm use analgesic phenacetin linked renal papillary necrosis necrotizing papillitis diabetic nephropathy progressive kidney disease caused angiopathy capillaries glomeruli characterized nephrotic syndrome diffuse scarring glomeruli particularly associated poorly managed diabetes mellitus primary reason dialysis many developed countries classified small blood vessel complication gabow talks autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease disease genetic go say autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease adpkd common genetic disease affecting half million americans clinical phenotype result least two different gene defects one gene cause adpkd located short arm chromosome article also goes say millions americans effected disease common yende parikh talk effects covid person preexisting health issue regarding kidney diseases frailty chronic diseases disability immunodeficiency increased risk kidney disease progression kidney failure infection increase risk long covid kidney disease higher dietary intake animal protein animal fat cholesterol may increase risk microalbuminuria sign kidney function generally diets higher fruits vegetables whole grains lower meat sweets may protective kidney function may sources animal protein animal fat cholesterol sweets acidproducing fruits vegetables legumes whole grains iga nephropathy common glomerulonephritis throughout world primary iga nephropathy characterized deposition iga antibody glomerulus classic presentation cases episodic frank hematuria usually starts within day two nonspecific upper respiratory tract infection hence synpharyngitic opposed poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis occurs time weeks initial infection less commonly gastrointestinal urinary infection inciting agent infections common activation mucosal defenses hence iga antibody production kidney disease induced iodinated contrast media icm called cin contrast induced nephropathy contrastinduced aki acute kidney injury currently underlying mechanisms unclear body evidence several factors including apoptosisinduction seem play lithium medication commonly used treat bipolar disorder schizoaffective disorders cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus longterm use lead despite expensive treatments lupus nephritis remains major cause morbidity mortality people relapsing refractory lupus another possible cause kidney disease due decreased function xanthine oxidase purine degradation pathway xanthine oxidase degrade hypoxanthine xanthine uric acid xanthine soluble water therefore increase xanthine forms crystals lead kidney stones result damage kidney xanthine oxidase inhibitors like allopurinol cause nephropathy additional possible cause nephropathy due formation cysts pockets containing fluid within kidneys cysts become enlarged progression aging causing renal failure cysts may also form organs including liver brain ovaries polycystic kidney disease genetic disease caused mutations genes disease affects half million people us polycystic kidneys susceptible infections cancer nephropathy associated therapies used treat cancer common form kidney disease cancer patients acute kidney injury aki usually due volume depletion vomiting diarrhea occur following chemotherapy occasionally due kidney toxicities chemotherapeutic agents kidney failure break cancer cells usually chemotherapy unique onconephrology several chemotherapeutic agents example cisplatin associated acute chronic kidney newer agents anti vascular endothelial growth factor anti vegf also associated similar injuries well proteinuria hypertension thrombotic standard diagnostic workup suspected kidney disease includes medical history physical examination urine test ultrasound kidneys renal ultrasonography ultrasound essential diagnosis management kidney treatment approaches kidney disease focus managing symptoms controlling progression also treating comorbidities person may millions people across world kidney disease millions several thousand need dialysis kidney transplant united states people needed kidney died waiting currently shortage donors kidney transplants shortage donors causing countries place monetary value kidneys countries iran singapore eliminating lists paying citizens donate also black market accounts percent transplants occur act buying organ black market illegal united put waiting list kidney transplant patients must first referred physician must choose contact donor hospital choose donor hospital patients must receive evaluation make sure sustainable receive transplant order match kidney transplant patients must match blood type human leukocyte antigen factors donors must also reactions antibodies donors kidney disease serious consequences controlled effectively generally progression kidney disease mild serious
