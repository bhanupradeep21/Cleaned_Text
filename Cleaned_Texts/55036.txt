caninemys extinct genus large freshwater sidenecked turtle belonging family podocnemididae fossils found rocks dating back middle late miocene type specimen caninemys well preserved skull dnpmmct found acre state brazil llewellyn ivor price originally mentioned lapparent de broin alongside several shell fragments similar stupendemys concluded data sufficient enough refer skull massive podocnemid especially light similarly sized turtle remains miocene south america meylan gaffney de almeida campos described caninemys basis skull alone including shell fragments mentioned de broin due

derives tridentate three toothed appearance skull easily observed viewed skull caninemys robust roughly triangular shape thick massive premaxilla eyes dorsally oriented facing slightly upward nasal bones present members pelomedusoides instead prefrontals make anterior portion skull including area nares prefrontals extend past maxilla giving somewhat stubnosed appearance paired prefrontals frontals parietals contact respective second bone midline frontals lack groove characteristic podocnemis scales preserved skull roof especially parietals based caninemys triangular interparietal scales similar modern podocnemis species premaxilla paired make small portion jaws nares triturating grinding surface caninemys notably complex modern podocnemidids sharp labial ridge forms small distinct toothlike process midline contact premaxilla premaxilla also form large recess accommodate hooked lower jaw seen modern alligator snapping turtle maxilla caninemys noticeably enlarged give animal superficially bulldoglike appearance maxilla also stands large toothlike processes formed labial ridge flanking premaxilla sides processes superficially resembling canine teeth seen mammals noticeable skull viewed headon two processes alongside premaxillary process account tridentate condition gives caninemys tridentata species name even without processes labial ridge pronounced caninemys thick extending downward centimeters flattened edge ridge curves upwards close maxilla creating ushaped notch however caninemys possess secondary palate like bairdemys stereogenys lower jaw lacm may represent taxon caninemys holotype lower jaw possesses pronounced symphyseal hook similar seen modern alligator snapping musk turtles although jaw slightly large belong exact specimen holotype jaws line well direct link two fossils match closely enough suggest belong least closely related taxa species would suggest caninemys besides pronounced maxilla also robust hooked lower jaw
