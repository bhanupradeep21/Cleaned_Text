conjugate gaze palsies neurological disorders affecting ability move eyes direction palsies affect gaze horizontal upward downward entities overlap ophthalmoparesis ophthalmoplegia symptoms conjugate gaze palsies include impairment gaze various directions different types movement depending type gaze palsy signs person gaze palsy may frequent movement head instead example person horizontal saccadic palsy may jerk head around watching movie high action event instead keeping head steady moving eyes usually goes unnoticed someone nonselective horizontal gaze palsy may slowly rotate head back forth reading book instead slowly scanning eyes across pagecitation needed lesion abnormality tissue due injury disease disrupt transmission signals brain eye almost conjugate gaze palsies originate lesion somewhere brain stem usually midbrain pons lesions caused stroke conditions koerbersaluselschnig syndrome progressive supranuclear palsy olivopontocerebellar syndrome niemannpick disease type c envenomation scorpion location lesion determines type palsy nonselective horizontal gaze palsies caused lesions abducens nucleus cranial nerve vi leaves way lateral rectus muscle controls eye movement horizontally away midline body cranial nerve vi also interneurons connecting medial rectus controls horizontal eye movement towards midline since lateral rectus controls movement away center body lesion abducens nucleus disrupts pathways controlling outward movements allowing right eye move right left eye move left nerve vi longest subarachnoid distance target tissue making susceptible lesions anywhere abducens nucleus cranial nerve vi neurons interneurons affect eye movement towards side lesion lesions sides abducens nucleus cause total loss horizontal eye one type gaze palsy horizontal saccadic palsy saccades quick intermittent eye paramedian pontine reticular formationpprf also pons responsible saccadic movement relaying signals abducens lesions pprf cause would saccadic horizontal eye movements much slower case severe lesions horizontal gaze palsies known linked progressive occurs pathways controlling saccadic movements disrupted lesion slow movements controlled different motor pathway unaffected lesions midbrain interfere efferent motor signals arrive pons also cause slowed horizontal saccadic movements failure eye reach target location saccades damage normally happens oculomotor nucleus midbrain horizontal saccadic palsy saccades stopped slowed disrupted pathway case signal disrupted reaches pprf oneandahalf syndrome associated damage paramedian pontine reticular formation medial longitudinal combined damages cause complete gaze impairment ipsilateral side half gaze impairment contralateral seen horizontal saccadic palsy impairment contralateral side gaze caused disrupted pathways coming pprf half impairment signal passing medial longitudinal fascicles able reach target oneandahalf syndrome normally associated horizontal gaze although rare horizontal oneandahalf syndrome damage paramedian pontine reticular formation medial longitudinal fasciculus shown affect vertical gaze cause impairment vertical gaze allowing one eye move patient may diagnosed conjugate gaze palsy physician performing number tests examine patients eye movement abilities cases gaze palsy simply seen inability move eyes one direction however sometimes patient exhibits abduction nystagmus eyes indicating evidence conjugate gaze nystagmus back forth jerk eye attempting hold gaze one conjugate gaze palsies classified palsies affecting horizontal gaze vertical

progressive scoliosis hgpps rare form conjugate gaze palsy appearing dozen families worldwide hgpps prevents horizontal movement eyes causing people condition move head see moving objects addition eye movement impairment hgpps coupled progressive scoliosis although eye symptoms usually appear scoliosis hgpps caused mutation gene important crossover motor sensory signals preventing horizontal eye movement addition mutation lesions midbrain pons common also include complete absence formation pons facial colliculus responsible facial cause progressive scoliosis hgpps hgpps affect vertical gaze unclear progressive scoliosis normally treated vertical gaze palsies affect movement one eyes either upward direction direction rarely downward direction rarely movement one eye one direction affected vertical gaze palsies often caused lesions midbrain due stroke tumor case downward gaze affected cause normally progressive supranuclear treatment conjugate gaze palsy disease condition causing gaze palsy must treated likely stated causes section gaze palsy may due lesion caused stroke condition conditions progressive supra nuclear palsy treatment includes therapy regain tasks including gaze control conditions niemannpick disease type c limited drug therapeutic stroke victims conjugate gaze palsies may treated intravenous therapy patent presents early enough surgical procedure prognosis
