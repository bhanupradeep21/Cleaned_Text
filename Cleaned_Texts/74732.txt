right ventricular hypertrophy rvh condition defined abnormal enlargement cardiac muscle surrounding right ventricle right ventricle one four chambers heart located towards lowerend heart receives blood right atrium pumps blood lungs since rvh enlargement muscle arises muscle required work harder therefore main causes rvh pathologies systems related right ventricle pulmonary artery tricuspid valve airways rvh benign little impact daytoday life lead conditions heart failure poor prognosis although presentations vary individuals right ventricular hypertrophy experience symptoms associated pulmonary hypertension heart failure andor reduced cardiac output people may rarely present symptoms ortners syndrome include cough haemoptysis hoarsenesscitation needed physical examination prominent features due development rightsided heart failure include raised jugular venous pressure ascites left parasternal heave tender enlarged liver inspection patients may chronically ill cyanotic cachectic occasionally jaundicedcitation needed auscultation accentuated second pulmonary sound third heart sound termed right ventricular gallop well systolic murmur tricuspid area accentuated inspiration may present occasion systolic murmur transmitted auscultated liver less typically diastolic murmur may also heard result pulmonary rvh usually occurs due chronic lung disease structural defects heart one common causes rvh pulmonary hypertension defined increased blood pressure vessels supplying blood lungs ph leads increased pulmonary artery pressure right ventricle tries compensate increased pressure changing shape size hypertrophy individual myocytes results increase right ventricular wall worldwide incidence ph per million rvh occurs approximately casescitation needed ph broadly split five categories world health organization based underlying cause incidence rvh varies groups common causes ph include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd pulmonary embolism restrictive lung diseases rvh often occurs result disorders rvh seen patients advanced copd patients restrictive lung rvh also occurs response structural defects heart one common cause tricuspid insufficiency disorder tricuspid valve fails close properly allowing backward flow blood structural defects lead rvh include tetralogy fallot ventricular septal defects pulmonary valve stenosis atrial septal defectsmedical

include smoking sleep apnea strenuous activity increase risk heart lung disease hence right ventricular hypertrophy physiological pathophysiological process becomes pathophysiological damaging excessive hypertrophy pathophysiological process mainly occurs aberrant signalling neuroendocrine hormones angiotensin ii catecholamines eg noradrenalinecitation needed angiotensinii hormones bind angiotensin endothelin et receptors gprotein coupled receptors act via internal signalling pathways several intermediates pathways directly indirectly increase reactive oxygen species ros production causing accumulation myocardial cells subsequently induce necrotic cell death fibrosis mitochondrial demonstrated animal studies protein kinase c pkc intermediate molecule signalling pathway mice lacking pkc shown resistance heart failure compared mice overexpressing pkc shown heart targeting raas system using angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors angiotensinreceptor blockers wellrecognized clinical approach reversing maladaptive cardiac hypertrophy independently blood pressurecitation needed catecholamines levels increase due increased sympathetic nervous system activity catecholamines act alphaadrenergic receptors betaadrenergic receptors gprotein coupled receptors binding initiates intracellular signalling pathways angiotensin endothelin also activation camp increase intracellular leads contractile dysfunction hormones cause rvh hypertrophy also caused mechanical forces mtor pathways nitric oxide immune cells immune cells cause hypertrophy inducing two main diagnostic tests used confirm right ventricular hypertrophy electrocardiography echocardiographycitation needed use electrocardiogram ecg measure cardiac chamber hypertrophy well established since left ventricular activity dominant ecg large degree rvh often required detectable changes nonetheless ecg used assist diagnosis rvh post mortem study adult male patients concluded anatomical rvh may diagnosed using one following ecg however american heart association recommended use additional diagnostic tests diagnose rvh single criteria set criteria considered sufficiently echocardiography used directly visualise right ventricular wall thickness preferred technique transoesophageal approach giving view chambers normal thickness right ventricular free wall ranges millimetres value mm considered important understand right ventricular hypertrophy main issue right ventricular hypertrophy represents right ventricular hypertrophy intermediate stage increased right ventricular pressure early stages right ventricle failure later management right ventricular hypertrophy either preventing development right ventricular hypertrophy first place preventing progression towards right ventricle failure right ventricular hypertrophy pharmacological since main causes right ventricular hypertrophy tricuspid regurgitation pulmonary hypertension discussed management involves treatment tricuspid regurgitation typically treated conservatively aiming treat underlying cause following patient surgery considered serious situations patient severely symptomatic surgical options include either replacement valve repair valve termed comes replacement choice bioprosthetic valve mechanical valve depending upon specific patient characteristics mechanical valve greater durability requires anticoagulation reduce risk treatment pulmonary hypertension depend specific cause pulmonary hypertension top following may also considered diuretic oxygen anticoagulant prolonged period right ventricle fails adapt sufficiently pump increased right ventricle pressure termed right ventricular failure right ventricular failure main complication right ventricular hypertrophy mechanisms underlying progression hypertrophy failure well best management approach involves reducingminimising risk factors progression lifestyle changes often help reduce risk progression lifestyle changes include eating less salty food salt consumption leads greater fluid retention body smoking cessation avoiding excessive alcohol consumption alcohol reduces force heart contractions right ventricular
