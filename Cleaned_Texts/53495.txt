browning process food turning brown due chemical reactions take place within process browning one chemical reactions take place food chemistry represents interesting research topic regarding health nutrition food technology though many different ways food chemically changes time browning particular falls two main categories enzymatic versus nonenzymatic browning processes browning many important implications food industry relating nutrition technology economic researchers especially interested studying control inhibition browning different methods employed maximize inhibition ultimately prolong shelf life enzymatic browning one important reactions takes place fruits vegetables well processes affect taste color value generally chemical reaction involving polyphenol oxidase ppo catechol oxidase enzymes create melanins benzoquinone natural phenols enzymatic browning also called oxidation foods requires exposure oxygen begins oxidation phenols polyphenol oxidase whose strong electrophilic state causes high susceptibility nucleophilic attack quinones polymerized series reactions eventually resulting formation brown pigments melanosis surface rate enzymatic browning reflected amount active polyphenol oxidases present hence research methods preventing enzymatic browning directed towards inhibiting polyphenol oxidase however browning food produces negative examples beneficial enzymatic browning examples nonbeneficial enzymatic browning control enzymatic browning always challenge food industry variety approaches used prevent slow enzymatic browning foods method aimed targeting specific steps chemical reaction different types enzymatic browning control classified two large groups physical chemical usually multiple methods used use sulfites powerful antibrowning chemicals reconsidered due potential hazards causes along much research conducted regarding exact types control mechanisms take place confronted enzymatic process besides prevention control browning also includes measures intended recover food color browning instance ion exchange filtration ultrafiltration used winemaking remove brown color sediments second type browning nonenzymatic browning process also produces brown pigmentation foods without activity enzymes two main forms nonenzymatic browning caramelization maillard reaction vary reaction rate function water activity food chemistry standard state water activity often defined partial vapor pressure pure water temperature caramelization process involving pyrolysis sugar used extensively cooking desired nutty flavor brown color process occurs volatile chemicals released producing characteristic caramel flavor nonenzymatic reaction maillard reaction reaction responsible production flavor foods cooked examples foods undergo maillard reaction include breads steaks potatoes chemical reaction takes place amine group free amino acid carbonyl group reducing usually addition heat sugar interacts amino acid producing variety odors flavors maillard reaction basis producing artificial flavors processed foods flavoring since type amino acid involved determines resulting flavor melanoidins brown high molecular weight heterogeneous polymers formed sugars amino acids combine maillard reaction high temperatures low water activity melanoidins commonly present foods undergone form nonenzymatic browning barley malts vienna munich bread crust bakery products coffee also present wastewater sugar refineries necessitating treatment order avoid contamination around outflow refineries like fruit grapes vary number phenolic compounds characteristic used parameter judging quality general process winemaking initiated enzymatic oxidation phenolic compounds polyphenol contact phenolic compounds vacuole grape cell polyphenol oxidase enzyme located cytoplasm triggers oxidation grape thus initial browning grapes occurs result compartmentalization modification cells enzymatic browning affects color flavor nutritional value foods causing huge economic loss sold consumers estimated produce lost result enzymatic increase human population consequential depletion natural resources prompted many biochemists food engineers alike find new improved techniques preserve food longer using methods inhibit browning reaction effectively increases shelf life foods solving part waste problem better understanding enzymatic browning mechanisms specifically understanding properties enzymes substrates involved reaction may help food technologists control certain stages mechanism ultimately apply knowledge inhibit browning apples fruits commonly studied researchers due high phenolic content make highly susceptible enzymatic accordance findings regarding apples browning activity correlation found higher phenolic quantities increased enzymatic activity provides potential target thus hope food industries wishing genetically modify foods decrease polyphenol oxidase activity thus decrease browning example accomplishments food engineering production arctic apples apples engineered okanagan specialty fruits inc result applying gene splicing laboratory technique allowed reduction polyphenol oxidase another type issue closely studied browning seafood particular shrimp staple consumed people world browning shrimp actually referred melanosis creates great concern food handlers consumers melanosis mainly occurs postmortem handling refrigerated recent studies found plant extract acts antimelatonin polyphenol oxidase inhibitor serves function sulfites without health
