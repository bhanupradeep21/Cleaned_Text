lentiarenium early sea cow late oligocene chattian linzmelk formation austria known since mid century lentiarenium long considered species halitherium analysis showed distinct earliest discoveries lentiarenium date early century mandible ribs vertebrae molars found sandpits city linz following communication several researchers across multiple austrian institutions remains correctly identified belonging extinct species seacow paleontologist leopold fitzinger would go describe material fitzinger believed bones belong sirenian halitherium described johann jakob kaup four years time description thought sirenian area surrounding linz however additional finds upper austria made following discoveries several new species named hermann von meyer later included material linz genus halianassa creating species halianassa franz toula erected species metaxytherium pergense based skull roof discovered around perg species particular would fluctuate placed h cristolii othenio abel raised distinct species h pergense franz yet another revision followed daryl p domning suggested three species represent single taxon light seniority halitherium however assignment material halitherium became increasingly problematic due nature genus long complex history time halitherium become wastebasket taxon many otherwise unrelated sirenians thrived sea covered europe throughout neogene additionally stability halitherium questionable type species h schinzii based single isolated tooth found diagnostic value thus rendering genus nomen led rash reexaminations halitherium
