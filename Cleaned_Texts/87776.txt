krüppellike factor also known lung krüppellike factor lklf protein humans encoded gene chromosome krüppellike factor family zinc finger transcription factors implicated variety biochemical processes human body including lung development embryonic erythropoiesis epithelial integrity tcell viability erythroid krüppellike factor eklf first krüppellike factor discovered vital embryonic erythropoiesis

researchers began searching krüppellike initially called lung krüppellike factor due high expression adult mouse lung first isolated using zinc finger domain eklf hybridization transactivation assay mouse fibroblasts also noticed bind βglobin gene promoter containing caccc sequence shown binding site eklf confirming member krüppellike factor since many klf proteins discovered main feature klf family presence three highly conserved zinc fingers either amino acid residues length located cterminus protein amino acid sequences chelate single zinc ion coordinated two cysteine two histidine residues zinc fingers joined conserved sevenamino acid sequence tgekpyfx zinc fingers enable klf proteins bind caccc gene promoters although may complete varied functions due lack homology away zinc
