physiological developments impact observed results unfamiliar changes researcher could wrongly make interpretation fmri use functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri developmental populations increased significantly past two decades developmental fmri research uses crosssectional sections examining differences similarities children adolescents adults although use crosssectional study limited ability provide information brain function matures within population therefore use longitudinal fmri studies offer advantage studying developmental processes removing intersubject variability
