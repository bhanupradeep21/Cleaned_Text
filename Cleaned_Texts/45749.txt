autonomic drugs either inhibit enhance functions parasympathetic sympathetic nervous systems type drug used treat wide range diseases glaucoma asthma urinary gastrointestinal cardiopulmonary parasympathetic nervous system one targets autonomic drugs inhibiting stimulating nervous system therapeutic effects achieved activation parasympathetic nervous system bring major physiological effects rise glandular secretion increase contraction smooth muscle reduction heart contractility heart rate achieve physiological effects two types receptors involved neurotransmission namely nicotinic receptors muscarinic receptors two groups receptors bind neurotransmitter acetylcholine relay neurotransmission synapse acetylcholine released presynaptic neuron acetylcholine either bind receptors postsynaptic neuron continue transmission nerve signals bind receptors tissues organ cause physiological binding receptors acetylcholine degraded choline acetate acetylcholinesterase terminate action acetylcholine acting receptors acetylcholinesterase involved transmission nerve signals autonomic drugs adopted stimulate inhibit parasympathetic nervous system achieve therapeutic effects promoting stimulation parasympathetic nervous system attained using muscarinic agonists anticholinesterase drugs muscarinic agonists bind muscarinic receptors hence promote transmission nerve impulses facilitating physiological effects brought parasympathetic nervous system anticholinesterase drugs interact acetylcholinesterase prevent acetylcholine binding acetylcholinesterase hinders decomposition acetylcholine maintaining neurotransmission also resulting physiological effects inhibition parasympathetic nervous system achieved utilizing muscarinic antagonists inhibitors acetylcholine release muscarinic antagonists bind muscarinic receptors block acetylcholine interact muscarinic receptors transmission nerve impulses passed neurons organs bring original physiological response inhibitors acetylcholine release impede release acetylcholine presynaptic nerve fibre way decline neurotransmission corresponding physiological effect diminished autonomic drugs used clinically treat diseases related parasympathetic nervous system bethanechol muscarinic agonist included therapy underactive bladder poor contraction detrusor since contraction detrusor muscle bladder controlled parasympathetic nervous system bethanechol bind muscarinic receptors stimulate activation parasympathetic nervous system restore contraction detrusor muscle low dose bethanechol often used treatment increasing dose cause side effects like nausea diarrhea physostigmine anticholinesterase drug used treating patients glaucoma rise intraocular pressure usually physostigmine block action acetylcholinesterase reducing disintegration acetylcholine higher availability acetylcholine supporting neurotransmission parasympathetic nervous system promotes contraction smooth muscle ciliary body results increase outflow aqueous humor widening schlemms canal trabecular meshwork lowering intraocular pressure patients use physostigmine may bring several adverse effects increased spasm accommodation cramps patients bradycardia treated atropine muscarinic antagonist obstruct muscarinic receptor acetylcholine bind receptor sustaining transmission nerve signals heart parasympathetic nervous system allows increase heart rate hyperthermia dilated pupils dry mouth side effects associated use botulinum toxin example inhibitors acetylcholine release drug treating overactive blocks release acetylcholine presynaptic neuron therefore acetylcholine interact receptors postsynaptic neuron carry neurotransmission parasympathetic nervous system results decline contraction detrusor muscle bladder brings back normal activity bladder adopting therapy treat overactive bladder raise risk urinary retention hematuria infections lower urinary sympathetic nervous system another target autonomic drugs stimulating inhibiting sympathetic nervous system therapeutic effects achieved sympathetic nervous system involved stimulating fightorflight response body activating sympathetic pathway results physiological effects including acceleration heart beat increase force heart contraction secretion adrenaline noradrenaline adrenal gland bronchi relaxation inhibition peristalsis gastrointestinal neurotransmitters used relay neurotransmission order bring physiological effects acetylcholine type neurotransmitter released preganglionic nerve binds nicotinic receptors autonomic ganglion noradrenaline another type neurotransmitter released postganglionic nerve binds adrenergic receptors target tissues organs cause physiological adrenergic receptors target many autonomic drugs act sympathetic nervous system adrenergic receptors mainly classified types known adrenergic receptors located different tissues stimulate different physiological responses receptors mainly located smooth muscles activating result constriction smooth receptors mainly located nerve endings presynaptic nerve activating result decreased presynaptic noradrenaline release hence serving negative feedback receptors mainly located heart activating result increased contractility heart increased heart receptors mainly located smooth muscles activating result vasodilation relaxation smooth muscles produces opposing effect receptors mainly located adipocytes detrusor muscles bladder activating result relaxation detrusor muscle also stimulation lipolysis process breakdown fat molecules fatty acids source drugs affecting sympathetic nervous system divided main categories sympathomimetic drugs mimics action sympathetic nervous system activation sympatholytic drugs reduce interrupt action sympathetic nervous system sympathomimetic drugs stimulant compounds mimic effects endogenous agonists sympathetic nervous action sympathomimetic drugs classified direct indirect action direct mode activating adrenergic receptors involve mimicking endogenous molecules agonist molecules indirect mode action involve mechanisms increasing release decreasing breakdown removal sympatholytic drugs produce opposing effect sympathomimetic drugs reduce inhibit sympathetic nervous system action mode action sympatholytic drugs includes direct mode blocking activation adrenoreceptors receptor antagonist blocker indirect mode inhibiting noradrenaline synthesis storage major medical use autonomic drugs acting sympathetic nervous system includes treatment hypertension hypotension asthma heart failure terbutaline type sympathomimetic drug terbutaline selective receptor agonist clinically used treat since terbutaline agonist selective receptors activates receptors smooth muscles stimulates sympathetic responses including increased relaxation smooth muscles relaxation smooth muscles bronchi trachea provides effect airway widening hence served bronchodilator asthma treatment terbutaline selective receptors relatively less effect heart preventing heartrelated side side effects terbutaline includes peripheral vasodilation tremor due stimulation receptors skeletal muscle tachycardia due slight effect therefore terbutaline mostly administered inhalation produce localized effect lungs hence reduces side effects terbutaline also used prevent premature labour relaxation uterine smooth atenolol type sympatholytic drug atenolol selective antagonist clinically used treat hypertension angina cardiac since atenolol selective receptor acts receptors located antagonist opposes effect sympathetic nervous system activation actions atenolol include reduction myocardial contractility heart rate hence producing effect lowering blood pressure cardiac side effects atenolol include cold extremities exacerbation cardiac failure hence drug suitable patients heart since atenolol act receptors cause bronchoconstriction therefore allowing asthma patients use
