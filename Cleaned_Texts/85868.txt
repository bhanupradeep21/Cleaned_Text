gastroenteritis also known infectious diarrhea simply gastro inflammation gastrointestinal tract including stomach symptoms may include diarrhea vomiting abdominal fever lack energy dehydration may also typically lasts less two although related influenza us sometimes called stomach gastroenteritis usually caused however gut bacteria parasites fungi also cause children rotavirus common cause severe adults norovirus campylobacter common eating improperly prepared food drinking contaminated water close contact person infected spread treatment generally without definitive diagnosis testing confirm usually young children impoverished countries prevention includes hand washing soap drinking clean water breastfeeding babies instead using proper disposal human waste rotavirus vaccine recommended prevention treatment involves getting enough mild moderate cases typically achieved drinking oral rehydration solution combination water salts breastfed continued breastfeeding severe cases intravenous fluids may fluids may also given nasogastric zinc supplementation recommended antibiotics generally however antibiotics recommended young children fever bloody two billion cases gastroenteritis resulting million deaths children developing world affected billion cases resulting deaths children age developing world children less two years age frequently get six infections less common adults partly due development gastroenteritis usually involves diarrhea sometimes one may accompanied abdominal signs symptoms usually begin hours contracting infectious due virus condition usually resolves within one viral infections also involve fever fatigue headache muscle stool bloody cause less likely likely bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain may persist several children infected rotavirus usually make full recovery within three eight however poor countries treatment severe infections often reach persistent diarrhea dehydration common complication severe dehydration children may recognized skin color position returns slowly called prolonged capillary refill poor skin abnormal breathing another sign severe repeat infections typically seen areas poor sanitation stunted growth longterm cognitive delays reactive arthritis occurs people following infections campylobacter syndrome occurs hemolytic uremic syndrome hus may occur due infection shiga toxinproducing escherichia coli shigella hus causes low platelet counts poor kidney function low red blood cell count due children predisposed getting hus viral infections may produce benign infantile viruses particularly rotavirus children norovirus adults bacteria escherichia coli campylobacter species primary causes however many infectious agents cause syndrome including parasites noninfectious causes seen occasion less likely viral bacterial risk infection higher children due lack children also higher risk less likely practice good hygiene children living areas without easy access water soap especially rotaviruses noroviruses adenoviruses astroviruses known cause viral rotavirus common cause gastroenteritis produces similar rates developed developing viruses cause episodes infectious diarrhea pediatric age rotavirus less common cause adults due acquired norovirus cause generally speaking viral gastroenteritis accounts cases infectious diarrhea developed norovirus leading cause gastroenteritis among adults america accounting viral gastroenteritis localized epidemics typically occur groups people spend time proximate cruise hospitals people may remain infectious even diarrhea norovirus cause cases countries campylobacter jejuni primary cause bacterial gastroenteritis half cases associated exposure children bacteria cause cases common types escherichia coli salmonella shigella campylobacter food becomes contaminated bacteria remains room temperature period several hours bacteria multiply increase risk infection consume foods commonly associated illness include raw undercooked meat poultry seafood eggs raw sprouts unpasteurized milk soft cheeses fruit vegetable developing world especially subsaharan africa asia cholera common cause gastroenteritis infection usually transmitted contaminated water toxigenic clostridium difficile important cause diarrhea occurs often infants carry bacteria without developing common cause diarrhea hospitalized frequently associated antibiotic staphylococcus aureus infectious diarrhea may also occur used acute travelers diarrhea usually type bacterial gastroenteritis persistent form usually acidsuppressing medication appears increase risk significant infection exposure number organisms including clostridium difficile salmonella campylobacter risk greater taking proton pump inhibitors number parasites cause giardia lamblia common entamoeba histolytica cryptosporidium spp species also group agents comprise cases giardia occurs commonly developing world type illness occur nearly occurs commonly persons traveled areas high prevalence children attend day care men sex men following transmission may occur drinking contaminated water people share personal water quality typically worsens rainy season outbreaks common areas four seasons infections common worldwide bottlefeeding babies improperly sanitized bottles significant transmission rates also related poor hygiene especially among crowded poor nutritional adults developed immunities might still carry certain organisms without exhibiting thus adults become natural reservoirs certain agents shigella occur primates others giardia may occur wide variety number noninfectious causes inflammation gastrointestinal common include medications like nsaids certain foods lactose intolerant gluten celiac disease crohns disease also noninfectious cause often severe disease secondary toxins may also occur foodrelated conditions associated nausea vomiting diarrhea include ciguatera poisoning due consumption contaminated predatory fish scombroid associated consumption certain types spoiled fish tetrodotoxin poisoning consumption puffer fish among others botulism typically due improperly preserved united states rates emergency department use noninfectious gastroenteritis dropped twenty common conditions seen emergency department rates noninfectious gastroenteritis largest decrease visits time gastroenteritis defined vomiting diarrhea due inflammation small large bowel often due changes small bowel typically noninflammatory ones large bowel number pathogens required cause infection varies one cryptosporidium many vibrio gastroenteritis typically diagnosed clinically based persons signs determining exact cause usually needed alter management however stool cultures performed blood stool might exposed food poisoning recently traveled developing may also appropriate children younger old people poor immune diagnostic testing may also done hypoglycemia occurs approximately infants young children measuring serum glucose population electrolytes kidney function also checked concern severe determination whether person dehydration important part assessment dehydration typically divided mild moderate severe children accurate signs moderate severe dehydration prolonged capillary refill poor skin turgor abnormal useful findings used combination include sunken eyes decreased activity lack tears dry normal urinary output oral fluid intake laboratory testing little clinical benefit determining degree thus use urine testing ultrasounds generally potential causes signs symptoms mimic seen gastroenteritis need ruled include appendicitis volvulus inflammatory bowel disease urinary tract infections diabetes pancreatic insufficiency short bowel syndrome whipples disease coeliac disease laxative abuse also differential diagnosis complicated somewhat person exhibits vomiting diarrhea rather appendicitis may present vomiting abdominal pain small amount diarrhea contrast large amount diarrhea typical infections lungs urinary tract children may also cause vomiting classical diabetic ketoacidosis dka presents abdominal pain nausea vomiting without one study found children dka initially diagnosed supply easily accessible uncontaminated water good sanitation practices important reducing rates infection clinically significant personal hygiene measures hand washing soap found decrease rates gastroenteritis developing developed world much alcoholbased gels may also food drink thought contaminated breastfeeding important especially places poor hygiene improvement hygiene breast milk reduces frequency infections due effectiveness safety world health organization recommended rotavirus vaccine offered children two commercial rotavirus vaccines exist several africa asia vaccines reduced severe disease among countries put place national immunization programs seen decline rates severity vaccine may also prevent illness nonvaccinated children reducing number circulating since implementation rotavirus vaccination program united states substantially decreased number cases diarrhea much first dose vaccine given infants weeks oral cholera vaccine found effective two number vaccines gastroenteritis development example vaccines shigella enterotoxigenic escherichia coli etec two leading bacterial causes gastroenteritis gastroenteritis usually acute selflimiting disease require preferred treatment mild moderate dehydration oral rehydration therapy children risk dehydration vomiting taking single dose anti vomiting medication metoclopramide ondansetron may butylscopolamine useful treating abdominal primary treatment gastroenteritis children adults rehydration preferably achieved drinking rehydration solution although intravenous delivery may required decreased level consciousness dehydration drinking replacement therapy products made complex carbohydrates ie made wheat rice may superior based simple drinks especially high simple sugars soft drinks fruit juices recommended children five years age may increase plain water may used specific ort preparations unavailable person willing drink nasogastric tube used young children administer fluids require intravenous fluids one four hours worth often recommended breastfed infants continue nursed usual fashion formulafed infants continue formula immediately rehydration lactosefree lactosereduced formulas usually children continue usual diet episodes diarrhea exception foods high simple sugars brat diet bananas rice applesauce toast tea longer recommended contains insufficient nutrients benefit normal cochrane review concludes probiotics make little difference people diarrhea lasting days longer proof reduce may useful preventing treating antibiotic associated fermented milk products yogurt similarly zinc supplementation appears effective treating preventing diarrhea among children developing antiemetic medications may helpful treating vomiting children ondansetron utility single dose associated less need intravenous fluids fewer hospitalizations decreased metoclopramide might also however use ondansetron might possibly linked increased rate return hospital intravenous preparation ondansetron may given orally clinical judgment dimenhydrinate reducing vomiting appear significant clinical antibiotics usually used gastroenteritis although sometimes recommended symptoms particularly susceptible bacterial cause isolated antibiotics employed macrolide azithromycin preferred fluoroquinolone due higher rates resistance pseudomembranous colitis usually caused antibiotic use managed discontinuing causative agent treating either metronidazole bacteria protozoans amenable treatment include salmonella giardia giardia species entamoeba histolytica tinidazole treatment recommended superior world health organization recommends use antibiotics young children bloody diarrhea antimotility medication theoretical risk causing complications although clinical experience shown drugs discouraged people bloody diarrhea diarrhea complicated loperamide opioid analogue commonly used symptomatic treatment loperamide recommended children however may cross immature barrier cause toxicity bismuth subsalicylate insoluble complex trivalent bismuth salicylate used mild moderate salicylate toxicity theoretically estimated two billion cases gastroenteritis resulted million deaths globally children
