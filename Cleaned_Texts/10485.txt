paramyxoviridae greek para side myxa mucus family negativestrand rna viruses order vertebrates serve natural diseases associated family include measles mumps respiratory tract family four subfamilies genera three unassigned subfamily virions enveloped spherical pleomorphic capable producing filamentous virions diameter around nm genomes linear around fusion proteins attachment proteins appear spikes virion surface matrix proteins inside envelope stabilise virus structure nucleocapsid core composed genomic rna nucleocapsid proteins phosphoproteins polymerase proteins genome nonsegmented negativesense rna kilobases length contains six genes extracistronic noncoding regions include gene contains transcription startstop signals beginning end transcribed part gene gene sequence within genome conserved across family due phenomenon known transcriptional polarity see mononegavirales genes closest end genome transcribed greater abundance towards end result structure genome gene transcribed rnadependent rna polymerase pauses release new mrna encounters intergenic sequence rna polymerase paused chance exists dissociate rna genome dissociates must reenter genome leader sequence rather continuing transcribe length genome result downstream genes leader sequence less transcribed rna polymerase evidence single promoter model verified viruses exposed uv light uv radiation cause dimerization rna prevents transcription rna polymerase viral genome follows multiple promoter model level inhibition transcription correlate length rna gene however genome best described single promoter model paramyxovirus genome exposed uv light level inhibition transcription proportional distance leader sequence gene leader sequence greater chance rna dimerization inhibiting rna polymerase virus takes advantage single promoter model genes arranged relative order protein needed successful infection example nucleocapsid protein n needed greater amounts rna polymerase l viruses paramyxoviridae family also antigenically stable meaning glycoproteins viruses consistent different strains type two reasons phenomenon posited first genome nonsegmented thus undergo genetic reassortment process occur segments needed reassortment happen segments different strains mixed together create new strain segments nothing mixed one another antigenic shift occurs second reason relates idea antigenic drift since rnadependent rna polymerase errorchecking function many mutations made rna processed mutations build eventually new strains created due concept one would expect paramyxoviruses antigenically stable however opposite seen true main hypothesis behind viruses antigenically stable protein amino acid important function thus mutation would lead decrease total loss function would turn cause new virus less efficient viruses would able survive long compared virulent strains would die many paramyxovirus genomes follow rule six total length genome almost always multiple six probably due advantage rna bound n protein since n binds hexamers rna rna left exposed virus replicate efficiently gene sequence viral replication cytoplasmic entry host cell achieved viral attachment host cell replication transcription follow negativestranded rna virus translation takes place leaky scanning ribosomal shunting rna terminationreinitiation virus exits host cell budding vertebrates including humans birds serve natural hosts transmission route airborne paramyxoviridae able undergo mrna editing produces different proteins mrna transcript slipping back one base read different open reading frame orf due presence secondary structures pseudoknots paramyxoviridae also undergo transcriptional stuttering produce poly tail end mrna transcripts repeatedly moving
