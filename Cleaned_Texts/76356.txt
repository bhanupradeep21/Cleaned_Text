behavioraltering parasites parasites two hosts capable causing changes behavior one hosts enhance transmission sometimes directly affecting hosts decisionmaking behavior control mechanisms making intermediate host may reproduce asexually likely eaten predator higher trophic becomes definitive host parasite reproduces sexually mechanism therefore sometimes called parasite increased trophic parasite increased trophic examples found bacteria protozoa viruses animals parasites may also alter host behaviour increase protection parasites offspring term bodyguard manipulation used among behavioral changes caused parasites carelessness making hosts easier protozoan toxoplasma gondii example infects small rodents causes become careless may even cause become attracted smell feline urine increase risk predation parasites chance infecting cat definitive host parasites may alter hosts behavior infecting hosts central nervous system altering neurochemical communication studied parasite manipulations either direct indirect indirect manipulation frequent method used behavioraltering direct approach far less common direct manipulation parasite affects host induces behavioral response example creating neuroactive compounds stimulate response hosts central nervous system cns method mostly practiced parasites reside within affecting hosts neural system complicated manipulation includes initiating immune cascades however determination causative factor difficult especially whether behavioral change result direct manipulation parasite indirect response hosts immune direct approach behavioral manipulation often costly results tradeoff benefits manipulation eg fitness increase energy costs common approach parasites indirectly induce behavioral responses interacting hosts immune create necessary neuroactive compounds induce desired behavioral parasites also indirectly affect behavior hosts disturbing metabolism development parasitic castrators drastically modify hosts metabolism reproduction sometimes secreting castrating hormones changing behavior physiology benefit parasites may alter hosts behaviors ways increase likelihood transmission eg host ingested predator
