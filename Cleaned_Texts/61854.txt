mangrove restoration regeneration mangrove forest ecosystems areas previously existed restoration defined process assisting recovery ecosystem degraded damaged mangroves found throughout coastal wetlands tropical subtropical environments mangroves provide essential ecosystem services water filtration aquatic nurseries medicinal materials food additionally mangroves play vital role climate change mitigation carbon sequestration protection coastal erosion sea level rise storm surges mangrove habitat declining due human activities clearing land industry climate mangrove restoration critical mangrove habitat continues rapidly decline different methods used restore mangrove habitat looking historical topography mass seed fostering longterm success mangrove restoration attainable involving local communities stakeholder historically mangroves identified two different ways species trees shrubs tolerate brackish water conditions species fall mangrove family rhizophoraceae well trees genus majority mangrove genera families closely related however share adaptive commonalities unique qualities allow mangroves thrive aversive conditions pneumatophoric roots stilt roots

mitigation tool climate change issue restoration critical today since mangrove forests lost quickly even faster rate tropical rainforests mangroves occupied much encompassing approximately worlds
