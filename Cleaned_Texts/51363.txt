challenging hapa designed sequence two continuous selfregulatory processes goalsetting phase motivation goalpursuit phase volition second phase subdivided preaction phase action phase thus one superimpose three phases stages continuum mediator model second layer regard stages moderators twolayer architecture allows switch continuum model stage model depending given research question hapa five major principles make distinct principle motivation volition first principle suggests one divide health behavior change process two phases switch mindsets people move deliberation action first comes motivation phase people develop intentions afterwards enter volition phase principle two volitional phases volition phase two groups individuals yet translated intentions action inactive well active persons phase words volitional phase one finds intenders well actors characterized different psychological states thus addition health behavior change continuous process one also create three categories people different mindsets depending current point residence within course health behavior change preintenders intenders actors assessment stages done behaviorspecific stage principle postintentional planning intenders volitional preactional stage motivated change act might lack right skills translate intention action planning key strategy point planning serves operative mediator intentions behavior principle two kinds mental simulation planning divided action planning coping planning action planning pertains intended action coping planning includes anticipation barriers design alternative actions help attain ones goals spite impediments separation planning construct two constructs action planning coping planning found useful studies confirmed discriminant validity action planning seems important initiation health behaviors whereas coping planning required initiation maintenance actions principle phasespecific selfefficacy perceived selfefficacy required throughout entire process however nature selfefficacy differs phase phase difference relates fact different challenges people progress one phase next one goal setting planning initiation action maintenance pose challenges nature therefore one distinguish preactional selfefficacy coping selfefficacy recovery sometimes terms task selfefficacy instead preaction selfefficacy maintenance selfefficacy instead coping recovery selfefficacy preferred comes design interventions one consider identifying individuals reside either motivational stage volitional group becomes target specific treatment tailored group moreover theoretically meaningful found useful subdivide volitional group perform intend perform postintentional preactional stage individuals labeled intenders whereas actional stage labeled actors thus suitable subdivision within health behavior change process yields three groups nonintenders intenders term stage context chosen allude stage theories strict definition includes irreversibility invariance terms phase mindset may equally suitable distinction basic idea individuals pass different mindsets way behavior change thus interventions may efficient tailored particular mindsets example nonintenders supposed benefit confrontation outcome expectancies level risk need learn new behavior eg becoming physically active positive outcomes eg wellbeing weight loss fun opposed negative outcomes accompany current sedentary behavior developing illness unattractive contrast intenders benefit treatment setting goal already moved beyond mindset rather benefit planning translate intentions finally actors need treatment unless one wants improve relapse prevention skills prepared particular highrisk situations lapses imminent preparation exercised
