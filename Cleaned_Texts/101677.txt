environmental epigenetics branch epigenetics studies influence external environmental factors gene expression developing way genes expressed may passed parent offspring epigenetic modifications although environmental influences alter genome embryonic development epigenetic modifications determine genes expressed turn determines embryos phenotype offspring still developing genes turned depending exposure certain environmental factors certain genes turned increase risk developmental diseases abnormal phenotypes also possibility phenotype environmental influence epigenetics highly

information carried histone proteins bound dna process cell division half histones present replication chromatin found parent dna thus carry parents epigenetic epigenetic marks play critical role determining chromatin structure thus gene expression newly synthesized dna half histones present replication newly synthesized major formative mechanism epigenetic modification dna methylation dna methylation process adding methyl group cytosine base dna strand via covalent bond process carried specific methyl additions reversed process known demethylation presence absence methyl groups attract proteins involved gene repression inhibit binding certain transcription factors thus preventing methylated genes transcribed ultimately affecting phenotypic acetylation reaction introduces acetyl
