either come plants collected building plants pests commonly treated two different methods integrated pest management program costeffective time best preventive measure pests primary risk factor fungal attack incomplete drying specimens caused either specimen preparation process afterwards collections become wet later flood water damage improper storage conditions especially tropics properly dried plant specimens suffer fungal attack stored correct conditions drying process specimens particularly risk dry slowly happens poor drying conditions specimens wet pressed waterretaining succulent parts specimens sugary exudations large quantities nectar also particularly attractive fungi need special care drying ensure dry fast enough prevent mold growth fungal growth occurs specimens brushed

cleaned wellsealed cabinet provide stable microclimate ensuring every specimen individual accession number reduce risk disassociation accession number relates number identifiable object object moved location updated ensuring object never disassociated data herbaria utilize standard system organizing specimens herbarium cases specimen sheets stacked groups species belong placed large lightweight folder labeled bottom edge groups species folders placed together larger folders genus genus folders sorted taxonomic family according standard system selected use herbarium placed pigeonholes herbarium locating specimen filed herbarium requires knowing nomenclature classification used herbarium also requires familiarity possible name changes occurred since specimen collected since specimen may filed older name modern herbaria often maintain electronic databases collections many herbaria initiatives digitize specimens produce virtual herbarium records images made publicly accessible via
