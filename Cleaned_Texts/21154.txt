neovenator neeovenator meaning new hunter genus carcharodontosaurian theropod dinosaur known several skeletons found early cretaceous hauterivianbarremian wessex formation south coast isle wight southern england one best known theropod dinosaurs early cretaceous europe first bones neovenator discovered summer storm made part grange chine collapse rocks containing fossils fell beach brighstone bay southwestern coast isle wight rocks consisted plant debris bed within variegated clays marls wessex formation dating barremian stage early cretaceous million years ago first collected henwood family shortly afterwards geology student david richards richards sent remains museum isle wight dinosaur isle british museum natural history latter institution paleontologist alan jack charig determined bones belonged two kinds animal iguanodon theropod iguanodon later referred mantellisaurus ultimately made separate genus brighstoneus generated interest early team sent bmnh secure bones

shared theropods nostrils large uncommonly pneumatised rear back vertebrae normal carcharodontosaurids elevated paired nasal crests shared allosaurus denticles continuing tooth apex today known reported front snout neovenator contains complex system neurovascular canals functioning sensory organs trait also known spinosauridae explained adaptation searching prey water doubted however whether neovenator used system time described steve hutt martill barker considered known allosaurid europe however studies suggested common advanced carcharodontosaurid group allosaurs several studies including detailed examination species benson carrano brusatte suggest closely related carcharodontosauridae group called carcharodontosauria actually closer megaraptorans together forming family studies supported neovenator carcharodontosaurid megaraptorans tyrannosauroids cladogram follows analysis benson carrano neovenator chilantaisaurus australovenator fukuiraptor orkoraptor aerosteon megaraptor cladogram novas et al allosaurus neovenator eocarcharia concavenator acrocanthosaurus shaochilong carcharodontosaurus tyrannotitan mapusaurus giganotosaurus chris barker colleagues suggested neovenator may possessed integumentary sensory organs snout much modern waterfowl crocodilians use find food muddy water based neurovascular structures found skull neovenator believed completely terrestrial unlike modern species assumed sensory organs used purposes sensitivity pressure temperature controlling jaw pressure precision feeding support tooth wear neovenator seems indicate avoided eating biting bone fed additionally neovenator might used integumentary sensory organs courtship sensing nest conditions technique seen today species crocodilians megapode birds though structures known another theropod tyrannosaurid daspletosaurus horneri neovenators neurovascular structures likely supported organs best preserved complete known theropod yet however recent study reviewing evolution trigeminal canals among sauropsids notes much denser network neurovascular canals snout lower jaw commonly encountered aquatic semiaquatic taxa eg spinosaurus halszkaraptor plesiosaurus taxa developed rhamphotheca eg caenagnathasia terrestrial taxa tyrannosaurids neovenator may average facial sensitivity nonedentulous terrestrial theropods although research holotype
