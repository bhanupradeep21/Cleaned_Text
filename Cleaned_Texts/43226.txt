thyroid hormones hormones produced released thyroid gland namely triiodothyronine thyroxine tyrosinebased hormones primarily responsible regulation metabolism partially composed iodine derived deficiency iodine leads decreased production enlarges thyroid tissue cause disease known simple major form thyroid hormone blood thyroxine whose halflife around one longer humans ratio released blood approximately converted active three four times potent within cells deiodinases processed decarboxylation deiodination produce iodothyronamine thyronamine three isoforms deiodinases seleniumcontaining enzymes thus dietary selenium essential production american chemist edward calvin kendall responsible isolation thyroxine levothyroxine manufactured form thyroxine second commonly prescribed medication united states million levothyroxine world health organizations list essential thyroid hormones act nearly every cell body acts increase basal metabolic rate affect protein synthesis help regulate long bone growth synergy growth hormone neural maturation increase bodys sensitivity catecholamines adrenaline thyroid hormones essential proper development differentiation cells human body hormones also regulate protein fat carbohydrate metabolism affecting human cells use energetic compounds also stimulate vitamin metabolism numerous physiological pathological stimuli influence thyroid hormone synthesis thyroid hormone leads heat generation humans however thyronamines function via unknown mechanism inhibit neuronal activity plays important role hibernation cycles mammals moulting behaviour birds one effect administering thyronamines severe drop body temperature used treat thyroid hormone deficiency hypothyroidism absorbed well stomach given orally levothyroxine pharmaceutical name manufactured version metabolised slowly hence usually needs oncedaily administration natural desiccated thyroid hormones derived pig thyroid glands natural hypothyroid treatment containing traces calcitonin also available synthetic combinations different ratios liotrix medications inn liothyronine levothyroxine sodium usually first course treatment tried patients feel better desiccated thyroid hormones however based anecdotal evidence clinical trials shown benefit biosynthetic thyroid tablets reported different effects attributed difference torsional angles surrounding reactive site thyronamines medical usages yet though use proposed controlled induction hypothermia causes brain enter protective cycle useful preventing damage ischemic shock synthetic thyroxine first successfully produced charles robert harington george barger people treated levothyroxine similar synthetic thyroid different polymorphs compound different solubilities additionally natural thyroid hormone supplements dried thyroids animals still levothyroxine contains therefore largely ineffective patients unable convert patients may choose take natural thyroid hormone contains mixture alternatively supplement synthetic cases synthetic liothyronine preferred due potential differences natural thyroid products studies show mixed therapy beneficial patients addition lyothyronine contains additional side effects medication evaluated individual natural thyroid hormone brands fda approved thyroid hormones generally well thyroid hormones usually dangerous pregnant women nursing mothers given doctors

heart conditions especially older patients therefore doctors may start patients lower dose work larger one avoid risk heart thyroid hormones produced follicular cells thyroid gland regulated tsh made thyrotropes anterior pituitary gland effects vivo mediated via converted target tissues three five times active thyroxine produced follicular cells thyroid gland produced precursor thyroglobulin thyroxinebinding globulin tbg cleaved enzymes produce active steps process thyroglobulin tg kda dimeric protein produced follicular cells thyroid used entirely within thyroid thyroxine produced attaching iodine atoms ring structures proteins tyrosine residues thyroxine contains four iodine atoms triiodothyronine otherwise identical one less iodine atom per thyroglobulin protein accounts approximately half protein content thyroid thyroglobulin molecule contains approximately tyrosine residues small number subject iodination catalysed enzyme catalyses coupling one modified tyrosine another via freeradicalmediated reaction iodinated bicyclic molecules released hydrolysis protein therefore thyroglobulin protein molecule ultimately yields small amounts thyroid hormone experimentally observed order molecules either per original molecule specifically monatomic anionic form iodine iodide actively absorbed bloodstream process called iodide process sodium cotransported

thyroglobulin iodinated phenol rings one positions ortho phenolic hydroxyl group yielding monoiodotyrosine mit diiodotyrosine dit respectively introduces atoms element iodine covalently bound per tyrosine coupling together two fully iodinated tyrosine residues also catalysed thyroperoxidase yields peptidic still peptidebound precursor thyroxine coupling one molecule mit one molecule dit yields comparable precursor coupling dit mit opposite order yields substance biologically hydrolysis cleavage individual amino acids modified protein proteases liberates well noncoupled tyrosine derivatives
