behaviorism also spelled systematic approach understanding behavior humans assumes behavior either reflex evoked pairing certain antecedent stimuli environment consequence individuals history including especially reinforcement punishment contingencies together individuals current motivational state controlling stimuli although behaviorists generally accept important role heredity determining behavior focus primarily environmental events behaviorism emerged early reaction depth psychology traditional forms psychology often difficulty making predictions could tested experimentally derived earlier research late nineteenth century edward thorndike pioneered law effect procedure involved use consequences strengthen weaken behavior publication john b watson devised methodological behaviorism rejected introspective methods sought understand behavior measuring observable behaviors events b f skinner suggested covert cognition subject controlling variables observable behavior became basis philosophy called radical watson ivan pavlov investigated conditioned neutral stimuli elicit reflexes respondent conditioning skinner assessed reinforcement histories discriminative antecedent stimuli emits behavior technique became known operant conditioning application radical applied behavior used variety contexts including example applied animal behavior organizational behavior management treatment mental disorders autism substance addition behaviorism cognitive schools psychological thought agree theoretically complemented cognitivebehavior therapies demonstrated utility treating certain pathologies including simple phobias ptsd mood disorderscitation needed titles given various branches behaviorism include two subtypes theoretical behaviorism b f skinner proposed radical behaviorism conceptual underpinning experimental analysis behavior viewpoint differs approaches behavioral research various ways notably contrasts methodological behaviorism accepting feelings states mind introspection behaviors also subject scientific investigation like methodological behaviorism rejects reflex model behavior defends science behavior complementary independent physiology radical behaviorism overlaps considerably western philosophical positions american although john b watson mainly emphasized position methodological behaviorism throughout career watson rosalie rayner conducted infamous little albert experiment study ivan pavlovs theory respondent conditioning first applied eliciting fearful reflex crying human infant became launching point understanding covert behavior private events radical however skinner felt aversive stimuli experimented animals spoke watson testing something controversial human skinner observed emotions two pigeons

contrast respondent conditioning antecedent stimuli elicit reflexive behavior operant behavior emitted therefore force occurrence includes following controlling although operant conditioning plays largest role discussions behavioral mechanisms respondent conditioning also called pavlovian classical conditioning also important behavioranalytic process needs refer mental internal processes pavlovs experiments dogs provide familiar example classical conditioning procedure beginning dog provided meat unconditioned stimulus ucs naturally elicit response controlled eat resulting increased salivation unconditioned response ucr means response naturally caused ucs afterward bell ring presented together food dog although bell ring neutral stimulus ns meaning stimulus effect dog would start salivate hearing bell ring number pairings eventually neutral stimulus bell ring became conditioned therefore salivation elicited conditioned response response unconditioned response pairing conditioned stimulus although pavlov proposed tentative physiological processes might involved classical conditioning idea classical conditioning helped behaviorist john watson discover key mechanism behind humans acquire behaviors find natural reflex produces response considered watsons behaviourist manifesto three aspects deserve special recognition one psychology purely objective interpretation
