dynamics theoretical model used ecologists describe variation habitat quality may affect population growth decline organisms since quality likely vary among patches habitat important consider low quality patch might affect population model organisms occupy two patches habitat one patch source high quality habitat average allows population increase second patch sink low quality habitat would able support population however excess individuals produced source frequently moves sink sink population persist indefinitely organisms generally assumed able distinguish high low quality habitat prefer high quality habitat however ecological trap theory describes reasons organisms may actually prefer sink patches source patches finally model implies habitat patches may important longterm survival population considering presence dynamics help inform conservation decisions although seeds model planted often recognized first present fully developed model defined source sink patches terms demographic parameters bide rates birth immigration death emigration rates source patch birth rates greater death rates causing population grow excess individuals expected leave patch emigration rates greater immigration rates words sources net exporter individuals contrast sink patch death rates greater birth rates resulting population decline toward extinction unless enough individuals emigrated source patch immigration rates expected greater emigration rates sinks net importer individuals result would net flow individuals source sink see table pulliams work followed many others developed tested model watkinson presented phenomenon high immigration rates could cause patch appear sink raising patchs population carrying capacity number individuals support however absence immigration patches able support smaller population since true sinks support population authors called patches pseudosinks definitively distinguishing true sinks pseudosinks requires cutting immigration patch question determining whether patch still able maintain population thomas et able taking advantage unseasonable frost killed host plants source population ediths checkerspot butterfly euphydryas editha without host plants supply immigrants nearby patches cut although patches appeared sinks become extinct without constant supply immigrants capable sustaining smaller population suggesting fact pseudosinks watkinson caution identifying pseudosinks followed argued differentiating sources sinks may difficult asserted longterm study demographic parameters populations patch necessary otherwise temporary variations parameters perhaps due climate fluctuations natural disasters may result misclassification patches example described periodic flooding river costa rica completely inundated patches host plant rolledleaf beetle cephaloleia fenestrata floods patches became sinks times different patches researchers considered happened floods would understood full complexity system also argued inversion source sink habitat possible sinks may actually become sources reproduction source patches much higher sink patches natural selection generally expected favor adaptations source habitat however proportion source sink habitat changes sink habitat becomes much available organisms may begin adapt instead adapted sink may become source habitat believed occurred blue tit parus caeruleus years ago forest composition corsica changed modern examples known described inversion butterfly populations e following frost butterflies difficulty recolonizing former source patches boughton found host plants former sources senesced much earlier former pseudosink patches result immigrants regularly arrived late successfully reproduce found former pseudosinks become sources former sources become true sinks one recent additions literature tittler et examined wood thrush hylocichla mustelina survey data evidence source sink populations large scale authors reasoned emigrants sources would likely juveniles produced one year dispersing reproduce sinks next year producing oneyear time lag population changes source sink using data breeding bird survey annual survey north american birds looked relationships survey sites showing oneyear time lag found several pairs sites showing significant relationships km apart several appeared sources one sink several sinks appeared receive individuals one source addition sites appeared sink one site source another see figure authors concluded dynamics may occur continental scales one confusing issues involves identifying sources sinks runge et point general researchers need estimate per capita reproduction probability survival probability emigration differentiate source sink habitats emigration ignored individuals emigrate may treated mortalities thus causing sources classified sinks issue important concept viewed terms habitat quality table classifying highquality habitat lowquality may lead mistakes ecological management runge et showed integrate theory dynamics population projection ecological order differentiate sources sinks would individuals ever leave high quality source habitat low quality sink habitat question central theory ultimately depends organisms way move distribute habitat patches example plants disperse passively relying agents wind water currents move seeds another patch passive dispersal result dynamics whenever seeds land patch support plants growth reproduction winds may continually deposit seeds maintaining population even though plants successfully another good example case soil protists soil protists also disperse passively relying mainly wind colonize result dynamics arise simply external agents dispersed protist propagules eg cysts spores forcing individuals grow poor contrast many organisms disperse actively reason remain sink provided organisms able recognize poor quality patch see discussion ecological traps reasoning behind argument organisms often expected behave according ideal free distribution describes population individuals distribute evenly among habitat patches according many individuals patch patches varying quality available ideal free distribution predicts pattern balanced model preferred habitat patch becomes crowded enough average fitness survival rate reproductive success individuals patch drops average fitness second lower quality patch individuals expected move second patch however soon second patch becomes sufficiently crowded individuals expected move back first patch eventually patches become balanced average fitness individuals patch rates dispersal two patches even balanced dispersal model probability leaving patch inversely proportional carrying capacity case individuals remain sink habitat long carrying capacity zero probability leaving therefore high alternative ideal free distribution balanced dispersal models fitness vary among potential breeding sites within habitat patches individuals must select best available site alternative called ideal preemptive distribution breeding site preempted already example dominant older individuals population may occupy best territories source next best territory available may sink subordinate younger individuals age may able take territories source new subordinate juveniles source move sink argued pattern dispersal maintain large sink population indefinitely furthermore good breeding sites source rare poor breeding sites sink common even possible majority population resides sink model population dynamics made contributions many areas ecology example species niche originally described environmental factors required species carry life history species expected found areas met niche concept niche later termed fundamental niche described places species could successfully occupy contrast realized niche described places species actually occupy expected less extent fundamental niche result competition however model demonstrated majority population could occupy sink definition meet niche requirements therefore outside fundamental niche see figure case realized niche actually larger fundamental niche ideas define species niche change dynamics also incorporated studies metapopulations group populations residing patches though patches may go extinct regional persistence metapopulation depends ability patches recolonized long source patches present successful reproduction sink patches may allow total number individuals metapopulation grow beyond source could support providing reserve individuals available dynamics also implications studies coexistence species within habitat patches patch source one species may sink another coexistence may actually depend immigration second patch rather interactions two similarly dynamics may influence regional coexistence demographics species within metacommunity group communities connected dispersal potentially interacting finally model greatly influenced ecological trap theory model organisms prefer sink habitat source besides ecological trap sink habitat may vary response major disturbance colonization sink habitat may allow species survival even population source habitat extinct due catastrophic may substantially increase metapopulational land managers conservationists become increasingly interested preserving restoring high quality habitat particularly rare threatened endangered species concerned result important understand identify create high quality habitat populations respond habitat loss change large proportion species population could exist sink conservation efforts may misinterpret species habitat requirements similarly without considering presence trap conservationists might mistakenly preserve trap habitat assumption organisms preferred habitat also good quality habitat simultaneously source habitat may ignored even destroyed small proportion population resides degradation destruction source habitat turn impact sink trap populations potentially large finally efforts restore degraded habitat may unintentionally create ecological trap giving site appearance quality habitat yet developed functional elements necessary organisms survival reproduction already threatened species mistakes might result rapid population decline toward extinction considering place reserves protecting source habitat often assumed goal although cause sink human activity simply designating area reserve potential convert current sink patches source patches eg notake either way determining areas sources sinks one species may area source one species may unimportant others finally areas sources sinks currently may future habitats continually altered human activity climate change areas expected universal sources universal presence source sink trap patches must considered shortterm population survival especially small populations longterm survival may depend creation networks reserves incorporate variety habitats allow populations
