psychological example tendency females change sexual strategies faced developmental pressures absent father may result psychological adaptation human males developed psychological adaptations make attractive opposite sex order increase reproductive success evolutionarily pays male polygynous number female partners means create offspring dont invest time carrying foetus examples adaptations include strategies entice females strategies retain partner desire shortterm relationships researched humour sexually selected acts fitness according research concluded production humour increases mate value men women seek men good sense humour turn men believed developed adaptation endeavour produce humour aim attract female mates human males developed adaptation find women attractive show cues fertility good ratio women waisttohip ratio considered attractive males ratio considered masculine perceived able children fertile healthy males developed behaviours help retain mate also known mate guarding order enhance reproductive success longterm relationships examples intersexual manipulations involves male manipulating way partner views current relationship repulse could enhancing value decreasing value males extreme cases men developed intersexual adaptations restrict partner interacting men including use violence women may less able leave relationship even due fear hand intrasexual manipulations used reduce options women could include decreasing partners value make clear males woman using possessive techniques holding hand regards parental investment males much wary investing offspring guarantee child therefore adaptation males tend invest offspring high levels commitment produced longterm relationship opposed shortterm relationships human males also developed adaptation desire shortterm relationships human females men hardly investment obligation whereas female carry child nine months fall pregnant sexual encounter evolutionarily thought males desire reproduce much shortterm relationships good way inseminate many women sperm order genes continue generations much evidence shortterm mating evolved psychologically males beginning desire variety sex partners seems larger percentage men every culture world desire one sex partner one month compared furthermore men likely women sexual intercourse someone known one hour one day one week one however

rape poses severe costs female pregnancy physical harm injury death relationship abandonment selfesteem greatest cost female circumvention mate choice threatens reproductive success resulting

strong dominant males women may also form groups men women protective alliance potential psychological pain experienced following rape also identified adaptive process designed focus female social circumstances surrounding rape future evidence adaptation seen reproductiveaged women found experience psychological pain following rape due increased risk research also suggests women fertile phase
