joan ellen baileywilson born american statistical geneticist senior investigator cochief computational statistical genomic branch national human genome research institute baileywilson received ba magna cum laude biology western maryland college followed phd medical genetics minor biomathematics indiana university school medicine direction joe c christian completed postdoctoral training robert elston department biometry genetics louisiana state university medical baileywilson became professor medical center louisiana new orleans joining national institutes health appointed cobranch chief inherited disease research branch became cochief computational statistical genomics branch national human genome research institute research program focuses understanding genetic factors increase risk various complex diseases interactions environmental risk factors baileywilson specializes statistical genetics genetic epidemiology especially interested risk factors lung cancer prostate cancer eye disorders autism oral served many scientific advisory boards including cancer family registry cfrccs advisory board world trade center kinship data analysis panel national institute justice genetic analysis workshop advisory board also served member international genetic epidemiology society iges board directors iges presidentelect president past president chair iges ethical legal social issues baileywilson actively studying range diseases including lung cancer prostate cancer myopia eye diseases autism cleft lip palate trained statistical genetics interested understanding genetics complex diseases developing novel methodologies disentangle roles genes environment play disease causation particularly interested lung cancer since early scientists believed might genetic link condition today significantly data support idea susceptibility alleles one unknown genes dramatically increase certain smokers risk developing lung cancer collaboration called genetic epidemiology lung cancer consortium gelcc baileywilson others recently narrowed location potential lungcancer gene region chromosome showed tumor suppressor gene region shows association lung cancer risk highly aggregated lung cancer families collaborators using dense genotyping panels nextgeneration dna sequencing gelccs set highly aggregated lung cancer families familyhistorypositives cases agegendersmoking matched controls search causal variants additional lung cancer susceptibility baileywilson used similar approaches locate cancerrelated genes example collaborators published evidence genes involved prostate cancer reside specific regions chromosomes x findings replicated three candidate genes rare variants appear increase prostate cancer risk cloned rnasel encodes ribonuclease l msri encodes macrophage scavenger receptor encodes homeobox protein baileywilson focusing identifying additional susceptibility genes cancers ongoing studies present collaborating international consortium prostate cancer genetics whole exome sequencing study families strong family history prostate cancer lead statistician study icpcgs africanamerican baileywilson also applying nextgeneration sequencing tools studies highly aggregated nonsyndromic oral cleft families syrian arab republic affected individuals per family set multiplex autism spectrum disease families autism study subset families least one child autism also abnormal cholesterol levels particular baileywilson develops tests novel computational methods analyze genetic markers group especially interested using machine learning methods detect causal variants limited marginal effects risk disease show strong interaction effects either genetic variants environmental risk factors also working address effects linkage disequilibrium nonrandom association closely spaced loci genetic interaction tests machine learning methods linkage disequilibrium caused low frequency recombinations two loci close together chromosome closer two loci likely exhibit linkage disequilibrium thus markers kb apart display significantly greater linkage disequilibrium markers kb apart standard linkage analysis methods typically assume linkage disequilibrium exists loci baileywilsons group developed approaches streamline methods study sets dense genetic markers using association methods take advantage linkage disequilibrium data hapmap data sequence human genome determine location genetic loci increase risk various diseases used analytical methods determine example whether alleles specific marker loci transmitted along disease generations families several affected baileywilson also used statistical methods determine marker alleles people specific disease carry frequently diseasefree people carry less frequently explained chance work helped greatly reduce number target regions investigators need search potential diseaserelated genes group also developing approaches mitigate increased falsepositive evidence epistatic interaction observed strong ld exists variants within single genetic locus marginal effect baileywilson received number awards honors including distinguished alumnus award department medical genetics indiana university school medicine trustees alumni award western maryland college leadership award international genetic epidemiology society induction alumni member phi beta kappa nhgri outstanding mentor award baileywilson diplomat american board medical genetics founding fellow american college medical joan baileywilson alexander f wilson met undergraduates working sole genetics faculty member western maryland college westminster maryland one thing led another ended attending graduate school together indiana university studied medical genetics mathematics computer married two years later received doctorates went louisiana state university medical school new orleans work robert elston elston one leading figures statistical genetics thenemerging field draws elements epidemiology genetics molecular biology computer science statistics entered lsu postdoctoral fellows stayed years ultimately reaching rank full professor elston left lsu case western reserve university cleveland wilson baileywilson decided relocate well initially separate genetic disease research branch led robert nussbaum baileywilson medical genetics branch led time clair francomano however work different traditional bench scientists branches posed administrative dont purchase supplies make contracts data collection buy computers laptop computers big servers explained two years later wilson baileywilson became branch unto inherited disease research branch idrb nihs antinepotism rules prohibit one spouse supervising nussbaum appointed acting chief branch years nussbaum gradually taught wilson baileywilson administrative aspects chiefs job thus well prepared take year trained us said cobranch chiefs rare nih married cochiefs even rarer baileywilson wilson
