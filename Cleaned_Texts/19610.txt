anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction acl reconstruction surgical tissue graft replacement anterior cruciate ligament located knee restore function torn ligament either removed knee common preserved graft passed inside preserved ruptured native ligament reconstruction arthroscopic procedure acl repair also surgical option involves repairing acl reattaching instead performing reconstruction theoretical advantages repair include faster lack donor site morbidity randomised controlled trials longterm data regarding rerupture rates using contemporary surgical techniques lacking anterior cruciate ligament ligament keeps knee anterior cruciate ligament damage common injury especially among athletes anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction acl surgery common

higher females males acl injuries account quarter knee injuries high school increased q angle hormonal differences examples gender disparity acl tear graft options acl reconstruction include accessory hamstring part patellar ligament common donor tissues used autografts originally less commonly utilized quadriceps tendon become popular tissue used autograft patients risk rejection minimal retear rate young active individuals shown lower using autograft compared allograft hamstring autografts made semitendinosus tendon either alone accompanied gracilis tendon stronger graft semitendinosus accessory hamstring primary hamstrings left intact gracilis hamstring accessory adductor primary adductors left intact well two tendons commonly combined referred fourstrand hamstring graft made long piece cm removed tendon tendon segments folded braided together form tendon quadruple thickness graft braided segment threaded heads tibia femur ends fixed screws opposite sides two bonescitation needed unlike patellar ligament hamstring tendons fixation bone affected motion surgery therefore brace often used immobilize knee one two weeks evidence suggests hamstring tendon graft well nearly well patellar ligament graft long cochrane review found insufficient evidence suggest whether hamstring versus patellar ligament graft found individuals receiving hamstring autografts reduced flexion bending knee range motion common problems recovery include strengthening quadriceps itband calf musclescitation needed main surgical wound upper proximal tibia prevents typical pain experienced kneeling surgery wound typically smaller patellar ligament graft causes less postoperative pain another option first described minimally invasive technique harvesting back knee faster produces significantly smaller wound avoids complications graft harvesting anterior incision decreases risk nerve controversy well hamstring tendon regenerates harvesting studies suggest tendon regenerated least partially though still weaker original advantages hamstring grafts include high load failure strength stiffness graft low postoperative morbidity natural acl withstand load newtons hamstring graft number doubles decreasing risk reinjury stiffness hamstring natural acl bartlett clatworthy ngugen reduces risk reinjurycitation needed patellar tendon connects patella kneecap tibia shin graft normally taken injured knee circumstances second operation knee may used middle third tendon used bone fragments removed end graft threaded holes drilled tibia femur screwed place slightly larger hamstring graftcitation needed cochrane review found significant difference long term outcome patellar hamstring receiving patellar autografts improved static stability loss extension straightening knee range motion disadvantages compared hamstring graft include disadvantages may attributable postoperative patellar tendon rehabilitation surgery different knee beginning rehab acl graft knee focused reducing swelling gaining full range motion stimulating leg muscles goal graft donor need immediately start high repetition strength training patellar ligament tibialis anterior tendon achilles tendon may recovered cadaver used acl reconstruction achilles tendon large size must shaved fit within joint cavity typically age lifestyle help determine type graft used acl biggest factors knee stability correct graft placement surgeon treatment meniscoligament injuries knee rather type graft however current literature arthrometer assessment demonstrated laxity allograft bonepatellar

failed higher rate bonetendonbone autografts short midterm followup primary acl reconstruction however observed difference failure rates small enough still regarded viable options primary acl hamstring grafts historically problems fixation slippage stretching time modern fixation methods avoid graft slippage produce similarly stable outcomes easier rehabilitation less anterior knee pain less joint stiffness although less experience use tibialis anterior grafts preliminary data shown difference shortterm subjective outcomes tibialis anterior allografts patellar tendon quadriceps tendon historically reserved revision reconstructions enjoyed renewed focus versatile durable graft primary reconstructions use quadriceps tendon usually result degree anterior knee pain postoperatively quadriceps tendon harvest produces reliably thick robust graft quadriceps tendon approximately greater collagen per crosssectional area patellar tendon greater diameter usable soft

advanced reinforcement system lars one new synthetic ligaments recently gained popularity evidence supports lars viable option reconstruction surgery regards complication rates high patient satisfaction scores compared traditional surgical techniques however systematic reviews lars regarding graft stability long term functional outcomes highlighted several important gaps existing literature requires future investigation necessity rehabilitation following lars well recognized limited evidence available guide rehabilitation autologous stemcell transplantation using mesenchymal stem cells mscs used improve recovery time acl surgery especially athletes mscs multipotent stem cells meaning differentiate multiple cell types case mesenchymal stem cells cell types include osteoblasts bone cells adipocytes fat cells chondrocytes cartilage cells ligament tissue mainly consists fibroblasts extracellular matrix ligament cells differ size respond different cues cell environment express different cell surface markers limiting number clinical treatments accelerated repair acl tissue mscs primary fibroblasts obtained acl tissue therefore modern stem cell injections use mscs promote faster repair acl allow people athletes return previous form fastercitation needed order mscs differentiate acl must placed proper scaffold grow must bioreactor maintains normal

physical therapist range motion exercises used regain flexibility ligament prevent break scar tissue forming reduce loss muscle tone range motion exercise examples include quadriceps contractions straight leg raises cases continuous passive motion cpm device used immediately surgery help flexibility preferred method preventing muscle loss isometric exercises put zero strain knee knee extension within two weeks important many rehab guidelines perturbation training help improve gait asymmetries knee approximately six weeks required bone attach graft however patient typically walk perform
