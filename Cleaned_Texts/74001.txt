typically administered week sessions sessions total consists two treatment phases childdirected interaction cdi parentdirected interaction pdi cdi component focuses improving quality parentchild relationship help promote changes behavior sets foundation pdi stage continues encourage appropriate play also focusing structured consistent approach pcit derived several theories including attachment theory social learning theory parenting styles theory according attachment theory sensitive responsive parenting infancy toddlerhood leads child develop expectation needs met parent thus parents show young children greater warmth responsive sensitive needs promote sense security later apply relationships others also help effective emotion children referred clinics externalizing behaviors likely nonreferred children display distress separated parent display indicators insecure attachment child directed interaction cdi component pcit applies attachment theory goal restructure parentchild relationship provide secure attachment child cdi component makes use idea parents dramatic effect childs behavior especially early preschool critical period children responsive parents less influences teachers social learning theory suggests new behaviors learned watching imitating behaviors patterson expands proposes child behavior problems inadvertently established maintained dysfunctional parentchild interactions coercive interaction cycle parent child try control behavior behaviors arguing aggression children reinforced parent behaviors eg withdrawal demands negative parent behaviors subsequently reinforced negative child sum children learn many behaviors parents feedback result negative externalizing behaviors well pdi component targets cycle specifically establishing consistent parenting behaviors encourage desired behavior children according diana baumrind parenting style theory year link citation found authoritative parenting style leads healthiest outcomes children transitioning style combines responsive nurturing interactions clear communication firm discipline influence theory seen particularly pdi treatment phase parents taught use direct commands increase desired behavior along positive nurturing eyberg original paper thoroughly describes assessment treatment phase pcit includes suggestions applying first parents attend training session therapist explains rule rationale parent also taught oneonone role play interactions therapist parents also given handout end session summarizes basic directions review training session sessions follow include child sessions held playroom child playing one parent time meanwhile therapist parent observing play oneway mirror video system therapist provide immediate feedback suggestions buginear device sit room coaching end session therapist discusses childs progress using summary sheets parents use guide interactions practice sessions home practice sessions serve homework assignment parents practice interaction child five minutes day using homework sheets track progress treatment begins childdirected interaction phase followed parentdirected interaction pdi according eyberg parents goal stage follow childs lead play sure follow rules rules cdi child free lead activity make decisions play letting children take control play parents help child develop autonomy according eyberg dont rules help parents step back encourage childled play avoiding commands questions criticisms commands instructions would take lead away child could also introduce potential disagreements play parents also encouraged ask questions include questions putting toys away actually implied commands concern asking questions may come accusatory choose toy take conversation adult level instead letting child play freely naturally general idea questions provide little information limited usefulness therapy third rule avoid criticizing though criticisms range mild blatant attacks child criticisms general lead damaging effects childs selfesteem children learn behaviors good bad rely parents say believe criticisms may also frustrate anger child lead counterattack taken together criticisms unproductive therapy also threats positive relationship pcit according eyberg rules cdi promote positive behavior throughout play first describe child activity may seem unnatural first describing serves purposes allows child lead play improve attention towards independent activities clarify activity encourage child elaborate play help teach child different concepts positive way example child learns positive feedback found red one instead coercion find red one second imitation eyberg recommends parents sit close thing child parent add childs play something similar focus still remain childs style play attention imitation demonstrate show child parent interested believes important imitation may even lead child imitating parent aim parentchild play child learn cooperative play skills one day use parents encouraged reflect child says play third cdi helps parents practice listening child example child says car fast parent might say yes car fast reflections show parent understands accepts child saying additionally using reflective statements improve childs vocabulary grammar providing clarity childs thoughts also gives child opportunity agree disagree parents understanding elaborate praise fourth important make children feel good increase warmth important goal cdi praise statements good job show child creations actions important important children tend believe things parents say whether positive negative manual specifies two types praise labeled praise statements specify exactly parent likes behavior example saying beautiful job drawing picture teaches children something parent liked also teaches earn pcit used ages coaching takes account developmental differences age teaches parents mindful differences parents encouraged praise reflect attempts child verbally communicate speech skills concurrently according eyberg pdi component parents continue skills learned cdi time taught new skills lead play skills include giving verbal directions applying appropriate consequences child fair manner child understand clearly steps practiced clinic parents encouraged practice home feel eyberg states first step give clear direct commands desired behavior child avoid indirect commands vague confusing child example put red table house direct command however indirect command color leaves green interpreted child genuine question another example indirect command let clean toys indicate clearly parent child task much task child additionally phrases general good avoided provide enough information exactly expected child sum clear statements used towards child understand easily without getting eyberg provides guidelines parents teach parents giving direct commands first commands stated positively tell child rather example put hands lap used instead stop grabbing toys secondly command one ageappropriate child example telling tie shoe would considered ageappropriate lastly command require one behavior time way children need remember long strings orders single second step pdi involves labeled praise child displays desired behavior example like tell quickly tells child specific action pleased parent praise help increase desired third step initiate timeout whenever child noncompliance eyberg states noncompliance reinforced parental attention child able get something want example may warning followed threeminute eventually skills mastered parent commands begin address relevant behavioral problems child may displaying approach depends treatment goal example goal increase certain desired behavior parent must break skill simpler parts built practice labeled praise child masters dpics observational system originally created conduct problem uses direct observations behaviors assess parentchild interactions dpics undergone two revisions since first edition published dpics categories serve indicators relationship quality measured verbal physical behaviors social examples parent behavior categories direct
