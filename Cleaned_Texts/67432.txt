functions rest body humans pairs spinal nerves cervical thoracic lumbar sacral coccygeal nerve roots named according spinal vertebrata adjacent cervical region spinal nerve roots come corresponding vertebrae ie nerve root skull cervical vertebrae called spinal nerve thoracic region coccygeal region spinal nerve roots come corresponding vertebrae method creates problem naming spinal nerve root called spinal nerve root lumbar sacral region spinal nerve roots travel within dural sac travel level cauda equina first cervical spinal nerves split recombine produce variety nerves serve neck back head spinal nerve called suboccipital nerve provides motor innervation muscles base skull form many nerves neck providing sensory motor control include greater occipital nerve provides sensation back head lesser occipital nerve provides sensation area behind ears greater auricular nerve lesser auricular nerve phrenic nerve nerve essential survival arises nerve roots supplies thoracic diaphragm enabling breathing spinal cord transected spontaneous breathing possiblecitation needed last four cervical spinal nerves first thoracic spinal nerve combine form brachial plexus plexus brachialis

usually divided three parts autonomic nervous system ans controls involuntary responses regulate physiological brain spinal cord central nervous system connected organs smooth muscle heart bladder cardiac exocrine endocrine related organs ganglionic notable physiological effects autonomic activity pupil constriction dilation salivation autonomic nervous system always activated either sympathetic parasympathetic depending situation one state overshadow resulting release different kinds sympathetic system activated fight flight situation mental stress physical danger neurotransmitters norepinephrine epinephrine increases heart rate blood flow certain areas like muscle simultaneously decreasing activities noncritical functions survival like systems independent allows activation certain parts body others remain primarily using neurotransmitter acetylcholine ach mediator parasympathetic system allows body function rest digest consequently parasympathetic system dominates body increases salivation activities digestion heart rate sympathetic response unlike sympathetic system humans voluntary controls parasympathetic system prominent examples control urination lesser known division autonomic nervous system known enteric nervous located around digestive tract system allows local control without input sympathetic parasympathetic branches though still receive respond signals rest enteric system responsible various functions related gastrointestinal diseases peripheral nervous system specific one nerves affect system whole peripheral nerve
