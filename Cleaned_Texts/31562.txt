nonreproductive sexual behavior consists sexual activities animals participate lead reproduction species although procreation continues primary explanation sexual behavior animals recent observations animal behavior given alternative reasons engagement sexual activities animals observed engage sex social interaction bonding exchange significant materials affection mentorship pairings sexual enjoyment demonstration social rank observed nonprocreative sexual activities include noncopulatory mounting without insertion female younger male yet produce semen oral sex genital stimulation anal

behavioural transvestites known engage homosexual malemale copulation observed captive homosexual behaviour observed among bats particular fruit homosexual pairbonding established several ways two main ways pair bonding partners partners animals engage sexual activities companion bonding sexual engagement necessary relationship form homosexuality partnership friendship spend time together species birds engage one two homosexual parenting sometimes referred cooperative breeding occurs wide variety species animal homosexual parenting occur different ways one common two females typically related coming together help one another raise offspring example meadow vole populations summer peak breeding season meadow voles however going winter spring division male female meadow vole populations prefer communal nesting thermoregulatory benefits therefore winter spring female meadow voles commonly nest another female nurse offspring together well kind communal nursing samesex social bonds among meadow voles actually thought benefit young increasing growth survival homosexual parenting especially present among certain species one famous examples laysan albatross fairly uncommon among different species unrelated individuals sex raise offspring together femalefemale pairings laysan albatross populations one exceptions samesex pairing mutual cooperation chickrearing often occurs laysan albatross populations uneven sex ratios overall greater surplus females also laysan albatross known monogamous tendency actually allows samesex parenting genitalgenital rubbing gg rubbing among nonhuman animals sexual activity one animal rubs genitals genitals another animal term gg rubbing frequently used primatologists describe type sexual intimacy among female bonobos stated
