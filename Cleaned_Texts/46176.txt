antarctosaurus ænˌtɑːrktoʊˈsɔːrəs meaning southern lizard genus titanosaurian sauropod dinosaur late cretaceous period south america type species antarctosaurus wichmannianus second species antarctosaurus giganteus described prolific german paleontologist friedrich von huene three additional species antarctosaurus named since later studies considered dubious unlikely pertain genus type species wichmannianus controversial uncertainty whether described remains belong individual even genus second species giganteus considered dubious fragmentary remains represent one largest dinosaurs known remains dinosaur first mentioned print although fully described named monograph written paleontologist friedrich von antarctosaurus refer continent antarctica since first found argentina although derivation greek words αντι anti meaning opposite αρκτός arktos meaning north σαυρος sauros meaning lizard generic name refers animals reptilian nature geographical location southern continent antarctosaurus wichmannianus type species genus named discoverer remains geologist ricardo von huene used name wichmannianus describe large assemblage bones considered come anacleto

cretaceous plottier like younger anacleto member neuquén remains known species regarded nomen dubium researchers regard giganteus likely valid species probably belonging new leigh van valen considered wichmannianus giganteus growth stages species favored name idea problematic wichmannianus named earlier paper known material therefore get priority giganteus two species also geological formation suggests belong time von huene charles matley described another species antarctosaurus septentrionalis meaning northern remains found lameta formation madhya pradesh state species preserve important anatomical information since assigned genus antarctosaurus jaxarticus kazakhstan known single named soviet paleontologist anatoly riabinin first sauropod species reported certain locality kyzylkum

jaw small squaredoff jaws suggest specialised feeding habits feeding near surface plane like low vegetation ground floating plants bones part associated scattered throughout formation consequently many scientists believe may belong type animal particular square lower jaw frequently suggested belong rebbachisaurid sauropod similar however jaw bonitasaura described similar overall shape clearly associated titanosaur skeletal remains indicating lower jaw may belong wichmannianus respectively brasilotitan baalsaurus described also possessed squaredoff noted brazilotitan bonitasaura antarctosaurus titanosaurs show three teeth per alveolus tooth socket whereas rebbachisaurid nigersaurus shows seven brazilotitan baalsaurus described titanosaurs closely related back skull remainder skeleton usually regarded titanosaurian researchers although necessarily belong type jeffrey wilson considered braincase referable nemegtosauridae noted skull remains require study published ariana paulina carabajal ct scanned wichmannianus braincase revealed complete brain endocast inner ear structures brain endocast inner ear share several features titanosaurids short olfactory tracts olfactory bulbs horizontally powell compared width cranium length limb bones wichmannianus saltasaurus led conclude skull proportionally small wichmannianus might imply skull limb elements could belong different individuals different taxa noted however comparison potentially misleading overall anatomy saltasaurus shorter stouter might facilitate bigger von huene assigned two tarsal ankle bones wichmannianus described astragalus calcanium powell suggested possible calcanium described von huene actually astragalus smaller individual also noted astragalus seems small belong individual
