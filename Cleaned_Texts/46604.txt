cortical magnification describes many neurons area visual cortex responsible processing stimulus given size function visual field center visual field corresponding center fovea retina large number neurons process information small region visual field stimulus seen periphery visual field ie away center would processed much smaller number neurons reduction number neurons per visual field area foveal peripheral representations achieved several steps along visual pathway starting already quantitative purposes cortical magnification factor normally expressed millimeters cortical surface per degree visual angle expressed way values cortical magnification factor vary factor approximately foveal peripheral representation primary visual cortex depending estimate obtained inverse ie degrees visual angle per millimeter cortical tissue increases linearly eccentricity visual visual performance depends importantly amount cortical tissue devoted task example spatial resolution ie visual acuity best center fovea lowest far periphery consequently visual performance variations across visual field often equalized enlarging stimuli depending location visual field factor compensates cortical magnification referred scaling mmagnification however variation visual performance across visual field differs widely different functions pattern recognition motion perception etc cortical magnification one factor amongst others determine visual performance retinotopy httpsenwikipediaorgwikicorticalmagnification
