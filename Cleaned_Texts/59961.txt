ontogenetic niche shift abbreviated ecological phenomenon organism usually animal changes diet habitat ontogeny ontogenetic niche shifting ecological niche individual changes breadth best known representatives taxa exhibit kind ontogenetic niche shift fish eg migration socalled diadromous fish saltwater freshwater purpose insects eg metamorphosis different life stages larva pupa amphibians eg metamorphosis tadpole adult niche shift thought determined genetically also important aspect ons fact individuals different stages population eg various age size utilize different kind resources term introduced paper biologists earl e werner james f ontogenetic niche shift thought determined genetically also complex natural systems ons happens multiple times lifetime individual examples ontogenetic niche shifting occur ontogenetic niche shift varies across species hardly visible gradual example change diet size mammals reptiles others obvious abrupt metamorphosis insects often results changing habitat diet ecological one studies suggests differences ons across species could least degree explained diversity traits functional roles species consequence differences ontogenetic niche shifting thought follow general thought almost every organism shows kind ontogenetic niche shift ons responsible causing noticeable phenotypic variation among individuals species plays important role structuring communities influencing inside cases individuals undergoing ons change habitat become mobile link two different communities example via flow energy matter stage structure population result various stages interacting different representatives community even individuals thus distinct ecological role lifehistory stages theoretical models communities stagestructured propose ontogenetic niche shifting studied organisms influencing whole community especially resilience disturbance apparent consequence ontogenetic niche shifting reduction competition different stages population ons individuals different age size compete food materials habitat different stages population also different trophic effects food web division population distinct lifehistory stages useful evident lack resources one stage example juveniles get enough resources case lacking stage higher mortality ons great importance survival populations researchers noticed many species exhibit ontogenetic niche shifting different times lot examples ons occurred response various abiotic biotic environmental factors thought ontogenetic niche shift could adaptive response changing conditions individuals habitat authors life history theory predicted organisms affect time ontogenetic niche shifting individuals living favorable conditions would usually delay ons successive ecological niche organisms living niche poor conditions typically advance understanding ontogenetic niche shifting different species impact whole community important studying biodiversity ecosystem thought useful dealing populations threatened anthropogenic environmental even though occurrence ontogenetic niche shifting thought widely distributed best known representative taxa extensively studied ons insects groups vertebrates especially fish amphibians individuals often change habitat well lot aspects niche development less pronounced ontogenetic niche shifting seen many taxa habitat stays usually ons species evident looking resources used organisms species various ages size classes example change ontogenetic niche shifting connected extreme habitat changes seen among individuals taxon insecta known exhibit one various types metamorphosis best studied hemimetabolism insect passes three life stages egg nymph imago holometabolism characterized four life stages insect egg larva pupa nutritional niches shifting ontogeny accurately measured using stable isotopic signature method used studying ons gastropods field ons similar among insects happens amphibian best known frogs start egg hatch larval stage called tadpoles exhibit many differences distinguish adult stage frog species tadpoles aquatic usually possess external gills primarily feed plant material even though exceptions consume dead animal flesh mixed another well studied example ons occurs fish exhibit diadromous behaviour diadromous fish species drastically change habitat set journey sea saltwater rivers freshwater vice lot freshwater fish species show ons diet switch preying plankton performing ons may visible reptiles even though vertebrates utilize ontogenetic niche shifting studied american alligator alligator mississippiensis ideal studying ecological aspects ons many distinct size stages population alligators switching habitat niche hydrologically isolated seasonal wetlands riverine systems study shown riverine systems populated primarily adults subadults sexes used area nonnesting habitat hand juveniles adult females found seasonal wetlands served nursery nesting sites good example ons birds big seabirds albatrosses spend time fully oceanic birds sexually mature begin visit breeding grounds immature juveniles usually stay subtropical water occupy high trophic levels researchers noticed young birds progressively direct towards lower trophic positions coming closer sexual maturity time take isotopic niche adult ontogenetic niche shifting concept widely studied paleontology paleozoology large nonavian dinosaurs known exhibited one intensive ontogenetic niche shifting hatched egg experience big size shifts one problems connected understanding mesozoic dinosaur fauna lack socalled mesocarnivores predicted ontogenetic niche shift answer carnivorous dinosaurs started small hatchlings progressed towards adult size occupying different successive niches limiting trophic species diversity juvenile individuals megatheropods thought occupy mesocarnivore ontogenetic niche shifting primarily studied animals studies deal ons one onss studied plants
