paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea pnd attack severe shortness breath coughing generally occurs usually awakens person sleep may quite pnd well simple orthopnea may relieved sitting upright side bed legs dangling symptoms typically occur person recumbent lying since paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea occurs mainly heart lung problems common risk factors include affect function heart lungs risk factors cardiac diseases include high blood pressure high cholesterol diabetes obesity lifestyle lacking exercise healthy diet risk factors lung diseases include tobacco use including second hand smoke pollution exposure hazardous fumes pnd explained mechanisms similar orthopnea typical dyspnea person recumbent lying blood redistributed lower extremities abdominal cavity splanchnic
