privacy research participants concept research ethics states person human subject research right privacy participating research typical scenarios would apply include example surveyor social research conducts interview participant medical researcher clinical trial asks blood sample participant see relationship something measured blood persons health cases ideal outcome participant join study neither researcher study design publication study results would ever identify participant study thus privacy rights individuals preserved privacy medical research participants protected several procedures informed consent compliance medical privacy laws transparency patient data accumulated people decide participate research number different reasons personal interest desire promote research benefits community reasons various guidelines human subject research protect study participants choose participate research international consensus rights people participate studies best protected study participant trust researchers connect identities study participants input study many study participants experienced problems privacy upheld participating research sometimes privacy kept insufficient study protection also sometimes unanticipated problems study design inadvertently compromise privacy privacy research participants typically protected research organizer institutional review board designated overseer monitors organizer provide protection study participants researchers publish data get participants preserve participants privacy data goes process deidentify goal process would remove protected health information could used connect study participant contribution research project participants suffer data reidentificationcitation needed privacy attack exploitation opportunity someone identify study participant based public research way might work researchers collect data including confidential identifying data study participants produces identified data sent research processing deidentified means personally identifying data removed dataset ideally means dataset alone could used identify cases researchers simply misjudge information deidentified dataset actually identifying perhaps advent new technology makes data cases published deidentified data crossreferenced data sets finding matches identified dataset deidentified data set participants deidentified set may particularly case medical research data traditional data anonymization techniques designed numerical data effective nonnumerical data contained medical data rare diagnoses personalized treatments thus cases like medical research data contain unique nonnumerical data removing identifying numerical features age social security number may enough mitigate privacy attacks ideal situation research perspective free sharing since privacy research participants priority though various proposals protecting participants made different replacing real data synthetic data allows researchers show data gives conclusion equivalent one drawn researchers data may problems unfit repurposing strategies include noise addition making random value changes data swapping exchanging values across still another approach separate identifiable variables data rest aggregate identifiable variables reattach rest data principle used successfully creating maps diabetes australia united kingdom using confidential general practice clinic data biobank place human biological specimens kept research often genomics data paired phenotype data personallyidentifying data many reasons biobank research created new controversies perspectives challenges satisfying rights student participants needs researchers access resources one problem even small percentage genetic information available information used uniquely identify individual came studies shown determination whether individual participated study made even reporting aggregate research participants identities revealed may face various problems concerns include facing genetic discrimination insurance company respondents united states expressed desire research data restricted access law enforcement agencies would want prevent connection study participation legal consequences another fear study participants research revealing private personal practices person may want discuss medical history includes sexually transmitted disease substance abuse psychiatric treatment elective case genomic studies families genetic screening may reveal paternity different particular reason people may find private information becomes
