plasmid preparation method dna extraction purification plasmid dna important step many molecular biology experiments essential successful use plasmids research many methods developed purify plasmid dna purification procedure plasmid dna often separated contaminating proteins genomic dna methods invariably involve three steps growth bacterial culture harvesting lysis bacteria purification plasmid purification plasmids central molecular cloning purified plasmid used many standard applications sequencing transfections cells plasmids almost always purified liquid bacteria cultures usually e coli transformed virtually plasmid vectors common use encode one antibiotic resistance genes selectable marker example gene encoding ampicillin kanamycin resistance allows bacteria successfully transformed multiply bacteria taken plasmid vector assumed lack resistance gene thus colonies representing successful transformations expected bacteria grown favourable conditions several methods cell lysis including alkaline lysis mechanical lysis enzymatic common method alkaline lysis involves use high concentration basic solution sodium hydroxide lyse bacterial bacteria lysed alkaline conditions ph chromosomal dna protein denatured plasmid dna however remains scientists reduce concentration naoh used order reduce occurrence ssdna addition acetatecontaining neutralization buffer lower ph around large less supercoiled chromosomal dna proteins form large complexes precipitate small bacterial dna plasmids stay mechanical lysis involves use physical force grinding sonication break bacterial cells release plasmid dna several different mechanical lysis methods used including french press beadbeating enzymatic lysis also called lysozyme lysis involves use enzymes digest cell wall release plasmid commonly used enzyme purpose lysozyme breaks peptidoglycan cell wall grampositive bacteria lysozyme usually added bacterial culture followed heating andor shaking culture release plasmid plasmid preparation divided five main categories based scale preparation minipreparation midipreparation maxipreparation megapreparation gigapreparation choice method use depend amount plasmid dna

work principle generating conditions either nucleic acid precipitates biomolecules precipitate allowing nucleic acid separated ethanol precipitation widely used method purifying concentrating nucleic acids including plasmid basic principle method nucleic acids insoluble ethanol isopropanol soluble water therefore works using ethanol antisolvent dna causing precipitate solution collected centrifugation soluble fraction discarded remove spin columnbased nucleic acid purification method purifying dna rna plasmid sample using spin column method based principle selectively binding nucleic

relatively insoluble phenol chloroform cellular components relatively soluble solvents addition phenolchloroform mixture dissolve protein lipid contaminants leaving nucleic acids aqueous phase also denatures proteins like dnase especially important plasmids used enzyme digestion otherwise smearing may occur enzyme restricted form plasmid beadsbased extraction addition mixture containing magnetic
