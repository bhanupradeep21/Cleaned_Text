relaxation technique also known relaxation training method process procedure activity helps person relax attain state increased calmness otherwise reduce levels pain anxiety stress anger relaxation techniques often employed one element wider stress management program decrease muscle tension lower blood pressure slow heart breath rates among health relaxation therapy application relaxation techniques applied various settings complement treatment stress anxiety depression pain addresses psychological physiological effects stress increased heart rate sweating muscle many variations relaxation techniques including progressive muscle relaxation autogenic training guided imagery biofeedbackassisted relaxation thus relaxation techniques useful either emotional pain caused stress anger anxiety mood depression chronic pain caused strains singleside muscle use awkward position restriction movement certain areas spine improper form physical activity stressful multiple relaxation techniques share fundamental principle decrease muscle tension lower physical mental relaxation techniques generally safe healthy occasional instances exist individuals reported negative experiences receiving relaxation current past researchers explored relationship physical mental disorders various methods investigated effects relaxation techniques subsequent literature review presents brief succinct overview latest research discoveries providing background understanding relaxation techniques claude bernard scientist observed maintaining constant internal environment internal milieu facing changes external environment conditions critical life additionally chronic stressors negative consequences especially prevalent humans potentially due high cognitive ability may cause ongoing stress responses various adverse life work connection psychosocial stressors chronic illness intricate influenced various factors type quantity duration stressors along individuals biological susceptibility like genetics inherent characteristics learned ways previous studies indicated relaxation techniques including limited deep breathing guided imagery meditation progressive muscle relaxation effective ways reduce stress indicating relaxation techniques effective promoting relaxation physically research released indicated stronger ties stress health showed benefits wider range relaxation techniques previously known research received national media attention including new york times article recent study found participants practiced progressive muscle relaxation deep breathing guided imagery experienced statistically significant increase relaxation compared control significant difference relaxation levels training intervention groups demonstrated significantly higher levels relaxation training compared control additionally linear association progressive muscle relaxation guided imagery physiological relaxation deep breathing group initially showed increased physiological arousal quickly returning baseline findings support existing research findings effectiveness relaxation techniques effectively enhance relaxation states psychologically physiologically people use relaxation techniques following reasons among othersmedical citation needed thus relaxation techniques used designed help individuals reduce tension anxiety physically psychologically inducing bodys relaxation response characterized slower respiratory rate reduced blood pressure slower heart main techniques progressive muscle relaxation autogenic training guided imagery biofeedbackassisted relaxation progressive muscle relaxation pmr one important easytolearn relaxation techniques developed dr edmund jacobson setting foundation development relaxation involves effective repetitive relaxation different muscle groups used treat anxiety tension headaches migraines tmj neck pain insomnia bipolar disorder anxiety backaches high blood pressure pmr twostep practice involves creating tension specific muscle groups releasing build awareness sensations tension deep recommended repeat process several times practice regularly induce physical muscular relaxation first signs stress initial practice pmr several muscle groups may still require additional tensing relaxation achieve maximum effects decreasing degree muscle tension typically recommended dr edmund train body immediate continuous following steps recommended perform effective guided imagery gi wellestablished technique reducing stress anxiety involves replacing distressing memories positive mental imagery process sensory engagement behavioral physiological technique guided instructor audio recording directs participants imagine peaceful pleasant setting often involving rich sensory experiences sounds smells visual actively engaging senses focusing specific contextual details guided imagery enables individuals generate vivid realistic mental images create strong sense presence immersion imagined scenario helps divert attention away negative thoughts feelings fosters sense relaxation used combination progressive muscle relaxation pmr pmrgi approach highly effective method managing symptoms nausea vomiting well improving patients overall mental studies identified several connections exposure natural environments health specifically compelling evidence linking nature exposure enhancements cognitive function brain activity blood pressure mental health physical activity however may always feasible alleviate anxiety symptoms spending time natural settings depending situation studies demonstrated incorporating naturebased gi interventions overcome barriers limited access natural environments enhance effectiveness gi naturebased gi techniques shown highly effective managing anxiety also offering advantages affordable highly accessible providing great alternative traditional biofeedback technique enables individuals make subtle changes body relaxation muscles help alleviate pain decrease aid electronic device provides feedback realtime information changes heart rate blood pressure muscle tension individuals learn monitor level relaxation recognize regulate bodys response biofeedbackrelated relaxation techniques found researchers decrease test anxiety nursing students significantly reduce average blood glucose muscle tension lower various techniques used individuals improve state relaxation methods performed alone require help another person often trained professional involve movement focus stillness methods involve different elements certain relaxation techniques known formal passive relaxation exercises generally performed sitting lying quietly minimal movement involve degree include movementbased relaxation methods incorporate exercises walking gardening yoga tai chi qigong forms bodywork helpful promoting state increased relaxation examples include massage acupuncture feldenkrais method myotherapy reflexology selfregulationmedical citation needed relaxation methods also used activities example autosuggestion prayer least one study suggested listening certain types music particularly newage music classical music increase feelings associated relaxation peacefulness sense technique growing popularity flotation therapy use float tank solution epsom salt kept skin temperature provide effortless floating research usa sweden demonstrated powerful profound relaxation twenty minutes cases floating may reduce pain stress shown release endorphins even actions simple walk park shown aid feelings relaxation regardless initial reason new relaxation technique course developed specifically medical students universities found effective reducing anxiety burnout depression leading significant improvements academic performance evaluated introducing particular course important prevalence stressrelated mental disorders medical students significantly higher general relaxation techniques generally deemed
