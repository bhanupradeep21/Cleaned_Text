abandoning natural selection principal even important cause evolutionary change state news us believe news knowledgeable people well go criticise conceptual empirical issues state rival mechanisms fodor cites supplements natural selection replacements evodevo alternative adaptation rather way explain genes mechanistically produce evolutionary developmental biologist pz myers expressed similar criticism characterisation evolutionary developmental dennett states fodors discussion gould lewontin spandrel argument misrepresents argument stating far suggesting alternative adaptationism concept spandrel depends blackburn writes problem fortunately quite easily solved two traits may found together nature one play causal role producing reproductive advantage thus know trait gives advantage one selected fodor replies problem merely knowledge selected process selection operation selection distinguish traits coextensive creatures ecology blackburn writes back fodors question irrelevant process natural selection actually formulated biologists viz organisms genes enhance reproductive success likely pass genes next generation frequency genes increases incoherent nothing fodor says bears fodor replies picture sketched blackburn incomplete picture made complete adding darwin bit white bears selected improved camouflage white bears selected improved camouflage ie improved camouflage explains white bears survived flourished incoherence clear fodor claims theory natural selection entail aforementioned selectionfor explanation incoherent admit theory natural selection distinguish among locally coextensive properties continuing claim natural selection explains polar bears book divided two parts part one review new facts new nonselectional mechanisms discovered part two discussion logical conceptual bases theory natural outset authors state atheism commitment naturalistic add accept evolution common doubt evolution proceeds natural selection authors central argument concept natural selection call problem extension gould lewontins concept spandrels authors note certain traits organisms always come together authors give examples traits come together correlated fitness exogenous selection processes posited theory natural selection access therefore fodor piattellipalmarini argue theory natural selection predictexplain traits creatures population claim selection mechanism evolution another way authors put point follows mechanism natural selection currently formulated correct paradigm example intensional causation intensional causation requires either mind involved causal process causal mechanism access nomological laws since neither biological level theory natural selection correct response published london review books november pigs dont wings tim lewens states elliott sober gave following solution problem appealing metaphors mother nature selection pertains effects selection process whereas selection describes causes say selection given property means property causes success survival reproduction lewens continues property cause success survival reproduction linked one selection property precisely fodor thinks although selection curly tails selection curly tails elliott sober argues fodor analogy imagine toy tube contained several balls different colour size two traits locally coextensive balls color size balls size color toy disks different sized holes though disk hole different points tube thus toy could sort balls holding one way smallest balls would fall bottom largest would remain stuck top held way balls would fall bottom sober argues ball size color coextensive clear selectionfor size color fodor piatellipalmarini reject arguing given toys endogenous structure requisite intensionality present comparable story told exogenous selectors posited theory natural selection continue sobers sieve shows us draw selectselectfor distinction mechanism mediates selection specified tells us nothing draw within framework adaptionist fodor also points grounds counterfactuals sober example structure mechanism given works lets round pebbles others one intuitions trait selected follow laws selection per mechanics notice example whereas competition plays central role explanation every bona fide darwinian selection plays role explaining sober machine sorts round marbles sober machine would work exactly way even one marble sober argues matter since balls selected size rather color despite two coextensive thus sober argues possible determine two coextensive traits selected steven harnad observes fodor makes distinction artificial natural selection arguing former mind latter comparable however harnad argues false dichotomy artificial selection still case certain traits increasing reproductive success breeder breeds animals traits thus selected humans culling maladaptive traits rather example hungry predators making artificial selection special case general mindless process natural selection transmission success heritable traits determined causal contingencies environment fodors position breeder picture makes mechanism selection mind necessarily supplies required intensional causal explanation sensitive relevant counterfactuals however without breeder mental states natural selection loses power support relevant robert richards argues presence mind irrelevant darwin breeder another type environmental condition richards also suggests presence intentionality matter example antibiotic resistant bacteria proliferate due excess use antibiotics hospitals farms despite fact hospital workers farmers intend select greater antibiotic resistance actual intentions still play causal role concept selectfor intentional reflects biologists judgements causally relevant aspects

reviews critical book pigliucci criticises first part book claiming darwinism puts far much emphasis external causes biological change namely natural selection ignored internal mechanisms whilst failing acknowledge biology long addressed internal mechanisms darwin explicitly referring readers laws correlation growth fact internal structure living organisms imposes limits direction evolution criticises second part book raising correlated traits new issue biologists long known problem dealt hypotheses natural selection usually tested means functional analyses rooted physiology genetics developmental biology observations selection field whenever possible coupled manipulative experiments make possible distinguish say flies dark spots moving front tongue kinds pigliucci observes authors argue earth could natural selection specifically capturing flies biologists exclude counterfactual possibility frogs evolved catch dark spots dancing front happen resemble flies instead catching flies per se however pigliucci argues biologists determine traits selected via functional analyses rooted biology physiology development biology along observational evidence furthermore pigliucci argues fodor piatellipalmarinis discussion intensionality problem easily solved distinguishing select select case frogs say selection capturing flies byproduct also selection propensity catch whatever small dark objects come within frog field view look sufficiently like flies incidentally difference contrary popular belief natural selection optimizing process makes mistakes inefficient yielding whatever outcome good enough survival rejoinder authors kitcher block argued authors demanding form mechanism would distinguish adaptive traits correlated yet standard one else ever required evolutionary thinking kitcher block argue distinction adaptive traits freeriders done causation case coloured moths dark colour promotes reproductive success mechanism required explain block kitcher suggest authors mistakenly believe theory natural selection without supposed mechanism yet view block kitcher noone ever believed mechanism existed thus argument irrelevant since scientists able determine traits contribute reproductive success organisms natural selection regardless whether theory exists sense fodor piatellipalmarini understand talk delivered university california santa barbara fodor responds kitcher blocks argument distinction adaptive traits freeriders done causation fodor suggests position crazy offers analogy regarding phoneringers demonstrate problem kitcher blocks position incoming calls cause ringer phone ring fodor suggests kitcher block correct would work incoming calls didnt cause ringer ring ringer wouldnt ringer ringer caused ring incoming calls interdefined therefore doesnt need mechanism causes ringer ring response incoming calls job done causation fodor suggests position simply untenable although true ringer something rings incoming calls doesnt follow doesnt need theory mechanism explanation describes thing sensitive incoming call also cause ruse makes following suggestion motivation book beginning book proudly claim atheists perhaps suspicion like scorned christians fodor piattellipalmarini stomach idea humans might organisms better rest living world special superior denizens planet earth christians open beliefs humans special explaining lies beyond scope science wish authors little open view evolutionary biologist jerry coyne describes book profoundly misguided critique natural biologically uninformed coyne argued fodor piatellipalmarini may claim way tell whether trait selected merely correlate reality biologists different ways determining case coyne gives famous peppered moth classic example biologists able conduct tests studies confirm moths colour trait selected authors respond position coyne ascribes preposterous stating endorse view traits coextensive way tell cause fitness science determine trait selected merely fodor argues often accused believing fact matter causes fitness determining cause fitness epistemologically inaccessible believe either things argument would useless criticism natural selection provide mechanism allow one determine cause fitness makes sense difference fitness nonfitness producing traits knowledge thing epistemologically accessible authors thus argue issue theory natural selection fact matter traits selected facts accessible via empirical inquiry maintain theory natural selection offer means determine discussion sober fodor argued piattellipalmarini accept matter fact selected example agrees hearts pumping blood rather making thumping noises increases organisms relative fitness rather deny theory natural selection capable demonstrating traits selected fodor argued theory natural selection generating explanations rather ancillary theories theory natural selection specify traits selected rather provided theories experimental biology accumulated knowledge natural world review science douglas j futuyma concluded prominent fields readers may suppose authorities evolution written profound important book arent peter godfreysmith also reviewed book negatively arguing authors criticising idea natural selection agent seemed making mistake godfreysmith argues authors demand know natural selection distinguish traits agency hence demand laws despite fact trait causing reproductive success selected thus godfreysmith argues need laws selectionfor determined contribution reproductive success furthermore experimental evidence determine whether trait contributes reproductive success merely response godfreysmiths criticism authors suggest reduced theory natural selection definitional truth supposed explanatory theory authors offer following reply theory natural selection claims traits selected causing reproductive success explains creature cant also claim sense matters trait selected means cause reproductive success mean theory natural selection would reduce traits cause reproductive success explains cause reproductive success explains nothing isnt truepsychologists hoped defend law effect saying true definition reinforcement alters response strength made much mistake godfreysmith evan thompson points empirical argument book complement conceptual argument book points fodor piattellipalmarini suggest natural selection plays minor role evolution words think natural selection tuning piano composing melodies also believe natural selection impossible thompson argues makes sense fodor piattellipalmarini argue causal factors important evolution natural selection also believe natural selection impossible logical conceptual adam rutherford also reviewed book negatively
