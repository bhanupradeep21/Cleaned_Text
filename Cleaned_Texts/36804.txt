xlinked ichthyosis abbreviated xli skin condition caused hereditary deficiency steroid sulfatase sts enzyme affects xli manifests dry scaly due sts gene xli also occur context larger deletions causing contiguous gene treatment largely aimed alleviating skin term ancient greek ichthys meaning fish major symptoms xli include scaling skin particularly neck trunk lower extremities extensor surfaces typically severely affected areas mm diameter scales adhere underlying skin dark brown gray color symptoms may subside aside skin scaling xli typically associated major medical atrial fibrillation atrial flutter may affect males heart rhythm abnormalities individuals xli tend cooccur disorders gastrointestinal tract likely result steroid sulfatase corneal opacities may present affect vision cryptorchidism reported individuals xli appear increased risk developmental disorders autism attention deficit hyperactivity disorder affected individuals exhibit mood problems mood problems xli appear influenced stigma bullying associated skin condition difficulties treating skin bloodclotting abnormalities may occur frequently males xli female individuals xli exhibit intellectual disability although thought due deletions encompassing neighboring genes eg vcx addition skin medical conditions associated xli likely due perturbed basement membrane function abnormal interactions extracellular knockdown sts gene expression human skin cell cultures affects pathways associated skin function brain heart development bloodclotting may relevant explaining skin condition increased likelihood adhdautism cardiac arrhythmias disorders hemostasis female carriers generally experience problems difficulty childbirth sts expressed placenta plays role normal female carriers may also slightly increased risk developing mental health problems following childbirth reasons carriers ensure obstetrician aware conditioncitation needed sts gene located x chromosome band thus syndrome xlinked condition affects males females differently pair chromosomes typically termed sex chromosomes females two x chromosomes males one x one chromosome therefore normal individuals males carry single copy sts gene females carry two copies gene partially escapes xinactivation females normally express higher amounts sts enzyme xli occur new deletions mutations sts gene commonly inherited carrier hemizygous deletion mutation sts gene male results complete absence enzyme activity female carrier mutation deletion heterozygous still normal copy sts gene female carriers sts deletion mutation still express sts enzyme although decreased enzyme reason xli commonly affects males although individuals numeric abnormalities sex chromosomes also carry sts deletions mutations would exceptions
