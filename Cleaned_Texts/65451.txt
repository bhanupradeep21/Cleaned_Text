membranous glomerulonephritis mgn slowly progressive disease kidney affecting mostly people ages years usually white people ie european middle eastern north african ancestrycitation needed second common cause nephrotic syndrome adults focal segmental glomerulosclerosis fsgs recently becoming people present nephrotic syndrome triad albuminuria edema low serum albumin without kidney failure high blood pressure high cholesterol often also present others may symptoms may picked screening urinalysis finding high amounts protein loss urine definitive diagnosis membranous nephropathy requires kidney biopsy though given high specificity antibody positivity sometimes avoided patients nephrotic syndrome preserved kidney traditional definitions split membranous nephropathy primaryidiopathic secondary likely instead field move novel classification basis specific autoantigen detected though given current lack clinical assays autoantibodies may several years still traditionally mgn cases classified primary membranous say cause disease idiopathic unknown origin cause also referred idiopathic membranous nephropathycitation needed antibodies mtype phospholipase receptor responsible around cases membranous nephropathy testing revolutionised diagnosis treatment disease antibody positive patients tracking titre level time allows predict risk disease progression chance spontaneous little secondary disease association autoantibodies second autoantigen discovered thrombospondin type domaincontaining system might account additional membranous nephropathy cases appears associated studies identidied novel autoantigens responsible causing membranous nephropathy pattern injury continue published antibodies discovered include traditional list secondary causes though nomenclature moving towards autoantibody specific approach membranous nephropathy associated following mgn caused immune complex formation glomerulus immune complexes formed binding antibodies antigens glomerular basement membrane antigens may part basement membrane deposited elsewhere systemic circulationcitation needed immune complex serves activator triggers response complements form membrane attack complex

although usually affects entire glomerulus affect parts glomerulus treatment secondary membranous nephropathy guided treatment original disease treatment idiopathic membranous nephropathy treatment options include immunosuppressive drugs nonspecific antiproteinuric measures ace inhibitors angiotensin ii receptor blockers given spontaneous remission common international guidelines recommend period watchful waiting considering immunosuppressive likelihood achieving spontaneous remission much higher antiproteinuric therapy ace inhibitors angiotensin ii receptor blockers commencedcitation needed recommended first line immunosuppressive therapy often includes cyclophosphamide alternating also known ponticelli regime perhaps difficult aspect membranous glomerulonephritis deciding people treat immunosuppressive therapy opposed simple background antiproteinuric therapies large part difficulty due lack ability predict people progress endstage kidney disease kidney disease severe enough require dialysis medications carry risk treatment initiated without careful consideration riskbenefit profile note corticosteroids typically prednisone alone little benefit combined one medications along prednisone shown benefit slowing progression membranous nephropathy must kept mind however medications also carry risks top prednisonecitation needed twin aims treating membranous nephropathy first induce remission nephrotic syndrome second prevent development endstage kidney failure metaanalysis four randomized controlled trials comparing treatments membranous nephropathy showed regimes comprising chlorambucil cyclophosphamide either alone steroids effective symptomatic treatment treatment steroids alone inducing remission nephrotic syndromecitation needed third untreated patients spontaneous remission another third progress require dialysis last third continue proteinuria without progression kidney failurecitation needed closely related terms membranous nephropathy membranous
