sexual motivation influenced hormones testosterone estrogen progesterone oxytocin vasopressin mammalian species sex hormones control ability motivation engage sexual behaviours sexual motivation measured using variety different techniques selfreport measures sexual desire inventory commonly used detect levels sexual motivation humans selfreport techniques bogus pipeline used ensure individuals falsify answers represent socially desirable results sexual motivation also implicitly examined frequency sexual behaviour including masturbation testosterone appears major contributing factor sexual motivation male primates including humans elimination testosterone adulthood shown reduce sexual motivation male humans male male humans testicular function suppressed gnrh antagonist displayed decreases sexual desire masturbation two weeks following research male rhesus monkeys suggests testosterone functions increase sexual motivation thereby motivating males compete access sexual partners postulated motivating effects testosterone male rhesus monkeys promotes successful sexual competition may particularly important motivating tools low ranking important note elimination testosterone primates reduce ability copulate rather reduces motivation copulate testosterone levels males shown vary according ovulating state females males exposed scents ovulating women recorded higher testosterone levels males exposed scents nonovulating exposed female ovulating cues may increase testosterone turn may increase males motivation engage initiate sexual behaviour ultimately higher levels testosterone may increase reproductive success males exposed female ovulation cues relationship testosterone female sexual motivation somewhat ambiguous research suggests androgens testosterone sufficient prompt sexual motivation females particular studies rhesus macaques observed testosterone significantly associated variations level sexual motivation however research nonhuman primates suggests role androgens female sexual behaviour adrenalectomized female rhesus monkeys displayed diminished female sexual later studies revealed diminished sexual receptivity specific elimination androgens converted also suggested levels testosterone related type relationship one involved men involved polyamorous relationships display higher levels testosterone men involved either single partner relationship single polyamorous women higher levels testosterone score higher measures sexual desire women single women singlepartner estrogens progesterone typically regulate motivation engage sexual behaviour females mammalian species though relationship hormones female sexual motivation well understood particular estrogens shown correlate positively increases female sexual motivation progesterone associated decreases female sexual periovulatory period female menstrual cycle often associated increased female receptivity sexual stage cycle estrogens elevated female progesterone levels low time mating likely result female pregnancy females different stages menstrual cycle shown display differences sexual attraction heterosexual females using birth control pills ovulating high levels estrogens preference scent males low levels fluctuating ovulating heterosexual females also display preferences toward masculine faces report greater sexual attraction males current evolutionary perspective increases estrogens fertile periods females may direct sexual motivation toward males preferential genes good genes hypothesis following natural surgically induced menopause many women experience declines sexual menopause associated rapid decline estrogen well steady rate decline decline estrogen androgen levels believed account lowered levels sexual desire motivation postmenopausal women although direct relationship well understood hormones oxytocin vasopressin implicated regulating male female sexual motivation oxytocin released orgasm associated sexual pleasure formation emotional based pleasure model sexual motivation increased sexual pleasure occurs following oxytocin release may encourage motivation engage future sexual activities emotional closeness especially strong predictor sexual motivation females insufficient oxytocin release may subsequently diminish sexual arousal motivation females high levels vasopressin lead decreases sexual motivation link vasopressin release aggression observed females may impair female sexual arousal sexual motivation leading feelings neglect hostility toward sexual males vasopressin involved arousal phase vasopressin levels shown increase erectile response male sexual arousal decrease back baseline following increase vasopressin erectile response may directly associated increased motivation engage sexual hormonal influences sexual motivation much clearly understood nonprimate females suppression estrogen receptors ventromedial nucleus hypothalamus female rats observed reduce
