goodenow et al one first examine schoolrelated factors associated lower rates victimization suicidality population school related factors included presence lgb support groups staff support well school characteristics like studenttoteacher found lgb support groups associated low victimization suicidality among lgb students results indicated existence lgb support groups may led decrease suicidality decreasing incidence peer victimization association lgb support groups suicidality disappeared victimization controlled yet study examined correlations causality assumed student courts associated less

communities less likely victimized rural communities results studies show strong need intervention programs specifically inschool programs though schools punish bullying disciplinary action frequency bullying victimization remains high thus newer effective strategies must implemented programs focus punishing bully also focus victim victims taught use healthier coping strategies instead internalizing externalizing feelings one intervention program focuses bullying prevention positive behavior support bppbs bppbs designed series steps teach students treat respectfully well teach ways minimize social reinforcement bullying behaviors order improve school atmosphere ross horner investigated effectiveness program across three elementary schools oregon focusing collected baseline data frequency bullying well victim bystander responses implemented program across school approximately weeks results showed frequency bullying behaviors significantly reduced among students also significant increase appropriate responses victims bystanders thus interventions like bppbs may effective alleviating problem bullying victimization schools really test programs put effect nationally
