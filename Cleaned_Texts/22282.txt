stem cell controversy consideration ethics research involving development use human embryos commonly controversy focuses embryonic stem cells stem cell research involves human embryos example adult stem cells amniotic stem cells induced pluripotent stem cells involve creating using destroying human embryos thus minimally controversial many less controversial sources acquiring stem cells include using cells umbilical cord breast milk bone marrow pluripotent many decades stem cells played important role medical research beginning ernst haeckel first used phrase describe fertilized egg eventually gestates organism term later used william sedgwick describe parts plant grow regenerate work alexander maximow leroy stevens introduced concept stem cells pluripotent significant discovery led first human bone marrow transplant e donnall thomas although successful saving lives generated much controversy since included many complications inherent stem cell transplantation almost allogeneic marrow transplants performed humans longterm successes first successful treatment made modern problems many cells sufficient engraftment various types hematopoietic stem cell transplants whether older patients undergo transplant therapy role irradiationbased therapies preparation transplantation discovery adult stem cells led scientists develop interest role embryonic stem cells

human embryonic stem cells even greater potential drug discovery therapeutic transplantation however use technique human embryos led widespread controversy criticism technique began wider public debated moral ethics questions concerning research involving human embryonic cells since pluripotent stem cells ability differentiate type cell used development medical treatments wide range treatments proposed include treatment physical trauma degenerative conditions genetic diseases combination gene therapy yet treatments using stem cells could potentially developed due ability repair extensive tissue great levels success potential realized research using adult stem cells early fda approved first human clinical trials using embryonic stem cells cells embryo morula stage earlier truly totipotent meaning able form cell types including placental cells adult stem cells generally limited differentiating different cell types tissue origin however evidence suggests adult stem cell plasticity may exist increasing number cell types given adult stem cell become destruction human embryo required order research new embryonic cell lines much debate surrounding human embryonic stem cells therefore concern ethical legal quandaries around destruction embryo ethical legal questions point one consider life begin destroy human embryo potential cure countless numbers patients understanding disease central controversy political leaders debate regulate fund research studies involve techniques used remove embryo cells clear consensus much criticism result religious beliefs

analogous properties embryonic stem cells austria denmark france germany portugal ireland allow production embryonic stem cell creation embryonic stem cell lines permitted finland greece netherlands sweden united roe v wade legalized abortion united states five years later first successful human vitro fertilization resulted birth louise brown england developments prompted federal government create regulations barring use federal funds research experimented human embryos nih human embryo research panel advised administration president bill clinton permit federal funding research embryos left vitro fertility treatments also recommended federal funding research embryos specifically created experimentation response panels recommendations clinton administration citing moral ethical concerns declined fund research embryos created solely research agree fund research leftover embryos created vitro fertility treatments point congress intervened passed amendment final bill included dickeywicker amendment signed law bill clinton prohibited federal funding department health human services used research resulted destruction embryo regardless source embryo privately funded research led breakthrough discovery human embryonic stem cells prompted clinton administration reexamine guidelines federal funding embryonic research presidents national bioethics advisory commission recommended hesc harvested embryos discarded vitro fertility treatments embryos created expressly experimentation eligible federal funding though embryo destruction inevitable process harvesting hesc past longer clinton administration decided would permissible dickeywicker amendment fund hesc research long research directly cause destruction embryo therefore hhs issued proposed regulation concerning hesc funding enactment new guidelines delayed incoming george w bush administration decided reconsider issue president bush announced august federal funds first time would made available hesc research currently existing embryonic stem cell lines president bush authorized research existing human embryonic stem cell lines human embryos specific unrealistic timeline stem cell lines must developed however bush administration chose permit taxpayer funding research hesc cell lines currently existence thus limiting federal funding research lifeanddeath decision already bush administrations guidelines differ clinton administration guidelines distinguish currently existing notyetexisting hesc bush clinton guidelines agree federal government fund hesc research directly destroys embryos neither congress administration ever prohibited private funding embryonic research public private funding research adult cord blood stem cells unrestricted april members congress signed letter urging president bush expand federal funding embryonic stem cell research beyond bush already supported may house representatives voted loosen limitations federally funded embryonic stemcell research allowing governmentfunded research surplus frozen embryos vitro fertilization clinics used stem cell research permission donors despite bushs promise veto bill july senate majority leader william h frist rtn announced favored loosening restrictions federal funding embryonic stem cell july senate passed three different bills concerning stem cell research senate passed first bill stem cell research enhancement act would made legal federal government spend federal money embryonic stem cell research uses embryos left vitro fertilization july president bush vetoed bill second bill makes illegal create grow abort fetuses research purposes third bill would encourage research would isolate pluripotent ie embryoniclike stem cells without destruction human embryos congressman ron paul introduced cures found cosponsors income tax credit bill favors research upon nonembryonic stem cells obtained placentas umbilical cord blood amniotic fluid humans birth unborn human offspring died natural causes bill referred committee paul argued hesc research outside federal jurisdiction either ban bush vetoed another bill stem cell research enhancement act would amended public health service act provide human embryonic stem cell research bill passed senate april vote passed house june vote president bush vetoed bill july march president obama removed restriction federal funding newer stem cell lines two days obama removed restriction president signed omnibus appropriations act still contained longstanding amendment bans federal funding research human embryo embryos destroyed discarded knowingly subjected risk injury congressional provision effectively prevents federal funding used create new stem cell lines many known methods scientists might free create new lines federal funding president obamas policy allows potential applying funding research involving hundreds existing stem cell lines well lines created using private funds statelevel funding ability apply federal funding stem cell lines created private sector significant expansion options limits imposed president bush restricted funding viable stem cell lines created announced decision ethical concerns raised clintons time office continue restrict hesc research dozens stem cell lines excluded funding judgment administrative office rather presidential legislative nih funded million worth stem cell research million specifically used sigrid fryrevere argued private organizations federal government provide funding stemcell research shifts public opinion government policy would bring valuable scientific research grinding state california took billion bond loans fund embryonic stem cell research china one permissive human embryonic stem cell policies world absence public controversy human embryo stem cell research supported policies allow use human embryos therapeutic generally speaking group advocates unrestricted stem cell research especially context embryonic stem cell research according rabbi levi yitzchak halperin institute science jewish law jerusalem embryonic stem cell research permitted long implanted womb permitted research encouraged rather wasting long implanted womb still frozen fertilized egg status embryo prohibition destroy ithowever order remove doubt permissibility destroying preferable destroy preembryo unless otherwise implanted woman gave eggs either many fertilized eggs one parties refuses go procedure husband wife reason certainly implanted another woman best worthiest solution use lifesaving purposes treatment people suffered trauma nervous system etc similarly sole jewish majority state israel permits research embryonic stem cells catholic church opposes human embryonic stem cell research calling absolutely unacceptable act church supports research involves stem cells adult tissues umbilical cord involves harm human beings state support expressed politically financially different catholic groups either raising money indirectly offering grants seeking pass federal legislation according united states conference catholic bishops specific examples include grant catholic archiocese sydney funded research demonstrating capabilities adult stem cells us conference catholic bishops working pass federal legislation creating nationwide public bank umbilical cord blood stem southern baptist convention opposes human embryonic stem cell research grounds bible teaches human beings made image likeness god gen protectable human life begins however supports adult stem cell research require destruction united methodist church opposes human embryonic stem cell research saying human embryo even earliest stages commands however supports adult stem cell research stating moral questions raised assemblies god opposes human embryonic stem cell research saying perpetuates evil abortion islamic scholars generally favor stance scientific research development stem cells allowed long benefits society causing least amount harm subjects stem cell research one controversial topics time period raised many religious ethical questions regarding research done true guidelines set forth quran study biomedical testing muslims adopted new studies long studies contradict another teaching quran one teachings quran states whosoever saves life one shall saves life humankind teaching makes stem cell research acceptable muslim faith promise potential medical statement however make distinction adult embryonic stemcells specific instances different sources issued fatwas nonbinding authoritative legal opinions according islamic faith ruling conduct stem cell research fatwa islamic jurisprudence council islamic world league december addressed permissible stem cell sources fatwa khamenei iran several different governments predominantly muslim countries also supported stem cell research notably saudi arabia religious officials issued decree sanctions use embryos therapeutic research first presidency church jesus christ latterday saints taken position regarding use embryonic stem cells research purposes absence position interpreted support opposition statement made church members whether embryonic stem
