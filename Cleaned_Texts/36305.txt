wildlife populations better understand transmission health impacts affected wildlife tools geographical information system gis utilized order keep track individual occurrences disease order create overall image disease prevalence spread given major zoonotic diseases rabies influenza hemorrhagic fever monitored ensure human health safety well mitigation impacts proactive intervention increase
