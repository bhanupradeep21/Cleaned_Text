kindling due substance withdrawal neurological condition results repeated withdrawal episodes drugs alcohol benzodiazepines withdrawal leads severe withdrawal symptoms previous episodes individuals withdrawal episodes increased risk severe withdrawal symptoms including seizures death longterm use gabaergicacting drugs causes chronic gaba receptor downregulation well glutamate overactivity lead drug neurotransmitter sensitization central nervous system hyperexcitability excitotoxicity binge drinking believed increase impulsivity due altered functioning orbitofrontal circuits binge drinking alcoholics undergone repeated detoxification associated inability interpret facial expressions properly believed due kindling amygdala resultant distortion neurotransmission adolescents females young adults sensitive neuropsychological effects binge drinking adolescence particularly early adolescence developmental stage particularly vulnerable neurotoxic neurocognitive adverse effects binge drinking due time significant brain approximately percent people alcohol dependent experience psychosis acute intoxication withdrawal alcoholrelated psychosis may manifest kindling mechanism mechanism alcoholrelated psychosis due distortions neuronal membranes gene expression well thiamine deficiency possible cases alcohol abuse via kindling mechanism cause development chronic substanceinduced psychotic disorder eg schizophrenia effects alcoholrelated psychosis include increased risk depression suicide well psychosocial repeated acute intoxication followed acute withdrawal associated profound behavioural changes neurobiological alterations several brain regions much documented evidence kindling caused repeated detoxification regards increased seizure frequency increased fear anxiety cognitive impairments also associated alcohol withdrawal kindling due binge drinking alcoholics repeated alcohol withdrawal experiences impairments induced binge drinking repeated detoxification alcoholics cause loss behavioural inhibition prefrontal cortex prefrontal cortex mediated subcortical systems amygdala loss behavioral control due brain impairment predisposes individual alcoholism increases risk abstaining alcoholic relapsing impairment may also result longterm adverse effects emotional behavior impaired associative learning may make behavioural therapies involving conditioning approaches alcoholics less binge drinking regimes associated causing imbalance inhibitory excitatory amino acids changes monoamine release central nervous system increases neurotoxicity may result cognitive impairments psychological problems may cause irreversible brain damage adolescent adult longterm binge similar binge drinkers individuals suffering alcohol dependence develop changes neurotransmitter systems occur result kindling sensitization withdrawal progressively lowers threshold needed cause alcoholrelated brain damage cognitive impairments leading altered neurological function changes activity excitatory inhibitory neurotransmitter systems similar occurs individuals suffering limbic temporal lobe adaptational changes gabaa benzodiazepine receptor complex fully explain tolerance dependence withdrawal benzodiazepines receptor complexes may involved particular excitatory glutamate system implicated involvement glutamate benzodiazepine dependence explains longterm potentiation well neurokindling phenomena use shortacting benzodiazepine night sleeping pill causes repeated acute dependence followed acute withdrawal evidence prior history cns depressant dependence eg alcohol increases risk dependence benzodiazepines tolerance drugs commonly believed due receptor downregulation however limited evidence support hypothesis comes animal studies using high doses instead mechanisms receptor uncoupling may play important role development benzodiazepine dependence may lead prolonged conformational changes receptors altered subunit composition repeated benzodiazepine withdrawal episodes may result similar neuronal kindling seen repeated withdrawal episodes alcohol resultant increased neuroexcitability glutamate system believed play important role kindling phenomenon ampa receptors subtype glutamate receptors altered repeated withdrawals benzodiazepines changes occur withdrawal ampa receptors animals found regions brain govern anxiety seizure threshold thus kindling may result increased severity anxiety lowered seizure threshold repeated withdrawal changes glutamate system gaba system may play important role different time points benzodiazepine withdrawal binge drinking may induce brain damage due repeated cycle acute intoxication followed acute abstinence withdrawal based animal studies regular binge drinking longterm thought likely result brain damage chronic daily alcoholism due increase glutamate release nucleus accumbens acute withdrawal state binges dose gkg gkg increase glutamate release contrast withdrawal chronic alcoholism increase glutamate release occurs high levels glutamate release causes chain reaction neurotransmitter systems reason chronic sustained alcoholism thought researchers less brain damaging binge drinking tolerance develops effects alcohol unlike binge drinking repeated periods acute withdrawal also many alcoholics typically drink binges followed periods excessive glutamate release known major cause neuronal cell death glutamate causes neurotoxicity due excitotoxicity oxidative glutamate toxicity evidence animal studies suggests people may genetically sensitive neurotoxic brain damage associated binge drinking regimes binge drinking activates microglial cells leads release inflammatory cytokines mediators tumour necrosis factor nitric oxide causing neuroinflammation leading neuronal repeated acute withdrawal alcohol occurs heavy binge drinkers shown several studies associated cognitive deficits result neural kindling neural kindling due repeated withdrawals believed mechanism cognitive damage binge drinkers alcoholics neural kindling may explain advancing pathogenesis progressively deteriorating course alcoholism explain continued alcohol abuse due avoidance distressing acute withdrawal symptoms get worse withdrawal multiple withdrawals alcohol associated longterm nonverbal memory impairment adolescents poor memory adult alcoholics adult alcoholics experienced two withdrawals showed frontal lobe impairments alcoholics history one prior alcohol withdrawals finding kindling alcoholism consistent mechanism brain damage due binge drinking subsequent kindling refers phenomenon increasingly severe withdrawal symptoms including increased risk seizures occurs result repeated withdrawal alcohol related modes action ethanol alcohol similar mechanism tolerance withdrawal benzodiazepines involving gabaa receptors nmda receptors ampa receptors majority research kindling primarily focused intensification anxiety psychological symptoms alcohol withdrawal also failure manage alcohol withdrawal syndrome appropriately lead permanent brain damage acamprosate drug used promote abstinence alcohol nmda antagonist drug reduces excessive glutamate activity central nervous system thereby may reduce excitotoxicity withdrawal related brain
