shringasaurus known denwa formation state madhya pradesh shringasaurus allokotosaur group unusual herbivorous reptiles triassic closely related smaller better known azendohsaurus family azendohsauridae like ceratopsid dinosaurs shringasaurus two large horns eyes faced forwards skull shringasaurus also bears convergent physical similarities sauropodomorph dinosaurs long neck shoulders forelimbs shape teeth shringasaurus possibly occupied similar ecological niche large browsing herbivore dinosaurs shringasaurus largebodied quadruped estimated body length metres ft closely resembles related azendohsaurus small boxy head long neck large barrelshaped body deep shoulders ribs sprawled semisprawled limbs short tail aside notably larger azendohsaurus shringasaurus recognisable long curving brow horns well proportionately shorter thicker neck azendohsaurids much taller neural spines neck skull shringasaurus completely known whats preserved indicates skull small boxy short deep snout rounded jaw tips bony nostrils fused single confluent opening front snout broadly similar completely known skull azendohsaurus lower jaw shringasaurus conspicuous taper towards tip compared deep downturned dentary horns shringasaurus closely resemble seen ceratopsid dinosaurs despite azendohsaurids ceratopsids totally unrelated horns attached frontal bones roof skull eyes sit across almost entire breadth skull pointed curve forwards skull slight variation size orientation existing among large individuals smaller younger individuals smaller gracile horns indicating horns fully develop animals mature intriguingly least one small specimen lacks horns entirely whereas another similarly small specimen small well developed horns suggested shringasaurus sexually dimorphic possibly females lacked horns rough grooved texture implies covered keratinous sheath horn life also like ceratopsid horns would likely longer bony cores bones skull beneath horns unusually thick larger individuals bones roof skull nasal prefrontal frontal postfrontal fused together teeth shringasaurus low leafshaped lanceolate large denticles either side similar shape azendohsaurus lacking prominent expansion root like teeth pamelaria skull jaws incompletely known total tooth count shringasaurus unknown like azendohsaurus four teeth premaxilla shringasaurus also numerous palatal teeth though known vomer thus far like azendohsaurus uniquely well developed marginal teeth along edge jaw like leafshaped serrated shringasaurus palatal teeth even lanceolate marginal palatal teeth unusual herbivorous reptiles much simpler domed palatal teeth palatal teeth identical jaw margins otherwise found related allokotosaurs azendohsaurus vertebral column well known shringasaurus including whole cervical series various dorsal vertebrae sacral vertebrae caudal vertebrae like azendohsaurids firstthroughmiddle cervical vertebrae characteristically elongated giving shringasaurus long raised neck
