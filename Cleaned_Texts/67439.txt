mammary secretory carcinoma msc also termed secretory carcinoma breast rare form breast msc usually affects women significant percentage cases also occurs men indeed mcdvitt stewart first described msc termed juvenile breast carcinoma increased number cases time diagnosed juvenile msc common form breast cancer representing childhood breast although accounts less breast pediatric population

sometimes termed secretory carcinoma without reference breast cancer location however term secretory carcinoma also used name tumors microscopic appearance msc localized salivary glands termed mammary

secretory carcinomas mscs typically develop ductal breast tumors invaded tissue around ducts origin may spread nearby sentinel lymph nodes axillary lymph nodes rarely metastasized ie spread distant

suggested msc tumor sizes less centimeters widest dimension tumors circumscribed margins tumors evidence axillary lymph node tumors individuals less years old diagnosis andor tumors purely favorable prognoses msc tumors high rates proliferation tumors greater centimeters widest tumors contain areas sarcomalike tumors individuals older andor tumors spread distant less favorable prognoses general surgery considered best treatment msc tumors consensus extent conservative surgery simple mastectomy biopsy sentinel lymph nodes recommended patients msc tumors favorable prognoses removal adjacent mammary tissue tumor insure invasive tissue removed also recommended since leaving tumor tissue behind surgery runs higher risk local tumors unfavorable prognostic features treated radical mastectomy since msc tumors grow slowly carry relatively good prognoses metastasizing distant tissues usually years strong evidence benefit adjuvant chemotherapy andor retrospective study patients msc metastasized distant tissue found breastconserving surgery plus radiotherapy gave significantly better survival times simple general conservative surgery modified radical mastectomy radical mastectomy frequent procedures adults simple mastectomy local excision sentinel lymph node biopsy complete axillary dissection recommended adequate treatment children studies needed confirm radiotherapy improves one latter treatment cases longterm followup examination eg least years diagnoses strongly rare cases msc tumors spread distant tissues initial presentation prior treatment treated various chemotherapy regimens responses regiments poor recently three individuals two juvenile females one year old male fusion geneharboring msc tumors metastasized distant tissues treated larotrectinib drug attacks genetic abnormality underlying disease drug orally available selective ntrki inhibitor blocks proteins tyrosine kinase activity produced good fastdeveloping responses three reported msc
