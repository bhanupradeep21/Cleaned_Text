criteria set symptoms help standardize diagnosis constipation various age groups criteria help physicians better define constipation standardized manner causes constipation divided congenital primary common kind primary also divided age group affected children adults primary functional constipation defined ongoing symptoms greater six months due underlying cause medication side effects underlying medical associated abdominal pain thus distinguishing irritable bowel common kind constipation often adults primary causes include dietary choices insufficient dietary fiber fluid intake behavioral causes decreased physical activity elderly common causes attributed insufficient dietary fiber intake inadequate fluid intake decreased physical activity side effects medications hypothyroidism obstruction colorectal evidence support factors however secondary causes include side effects medications opiates endocrine metabolic disorders hypothyroidism obstruction colorectal ovarian celiac disease nonceliac gluten sensitivity may also present cystocele develop result chronic constipation caused exacerbated lowfiber diet low liquid intake dietary fiber helps decrease colonic transport time increases stool bulk simultaneously softens stool therefore diets low fiber lead primary many medications constipation side effect include limited opioids diuretics antidepressants antihistamines

constipation include bloating distension abdominal pain headaches feeling fatigue nervous exhaustion sense incomplete although constipation may diagnosis typically viewed symptom requires evaluation discern cause distinguish acute days weeks chronic months years onset constipation information changes differential diagnosis context accompanied symptoms helps physicians discover cause constipation people often describe constipation bowel movements difficult pass firm stool lumpy hard consistency excessive straining bowel movements bloating abdominal distension abdominal pain often accompany chronic constipation symptoms present least three days per month three months associated abdominal discomfort often diagnosed irritable bowel syndrome ibs obvious cause poor dietary habits previous abdominal surgeries certain medical conditions contribute constipation diseases associated constipation include hypothyroidism certain types cancer irritable bowel syndrome low fiber intake inadequate amounts fluids poor ambulation immobility medications contribute presence constipation identified based culmination symptoms described cause constipation figured separating nonlifethreatening serious causes may partly based symptoms example colon cancer may suspected person family history colon cancer fever weight loss rectal alarming signs symptoms include family personal history inflammatory bowel disease age onset change stool caliber nausea vomiting neurological symptoms like weakness numbness difficulty physical examination involve least abdominal exam rectal exam abdominal exam may reveal abdominal mass significant stool burden may reveal abdominal discomfort rectal examination gives impression anal sphincter tone whether lower rectum contains feces rectal examination also gives information consistency stool presence hemorrhoids blood whether perineal irregularities present including skin tags fissures anal physical examination done manually physician used guide diagnostic tests order functional constipation common warrant diagnostic testing imaging laboratory tests typically recommended alarm signs laboratory tests performed depends suspected underlying cause constipation tests may include cbc complete blood count thyroid function tests serum calcium serum potassium abdominal xrays generally performed bowel obstruction suspected may reveal extensive impacted fecal matter colon may confirm rule causes similar colonoscopy may performed abnormality colon like tumor tests rarely ordered include anorectal manometry anal sphincter electromyography
