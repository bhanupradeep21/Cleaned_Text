ronald david vale formemrs born american biochemist cell biologist professor department cellular molecular pharmacology university california san research focused motor proteins particularly kinesin awarded canada gairdner international award biomedical research shaw prize life science medicine together ian gibbons albert lasker award basic medical research alongside michael sheetz james spudich fellow american academy arts sciences member national academy sciences president american society cell biology also investigator howard hughes medical institute since vale named executive director janelia research campus vice president hhmi appointment began early vale born hollywood california mother evelyn former actress father eugene novelist screenwriter finished high school hollywood high school grade science project set laboratory basement home investigate circadian rhythm bean plants guidance counselor contacted karl hammer university california los angeles allowed vale continue experiments laboratory guidance counselor also encouraged vale submit work westinghouse science talent search regeneron science talent search selected one top forty students vale firstgeneration university entered college creative studies university california santa barbara earned bachelors degree chemistry biology study first worked laboratory c fred fox ucla robert lefkowitzs group duke university earning two articles published respectively vale entered mdphd program stanford university supervised eric studied nerve growth factor receptor also known neurotrophic factor vale obtained phd neuroscience spent one year nih staff scientist tom reeses laboratory marine biological laboratory woods hole working nerve growth factor ngf receptors graduate student vale became interested exploring mechanism receptors molecules transported nerve axons heard research michael sheetz james spudich used video camera microscope film myosincoated beads moving along actin filaments vale sheetz decided test whether movement myosin actin source organelle transport axons using squid giant axon model however since squid caught year stanfords hopkins marine station following shooters approval went marine biological laboratory marine biological laboratory vale sheetz teamed bruce schnapp thomas j found membrane organelle transport occurred bidirectionally microtubule actin filament vale originally vale demonstrated purified organelles rarely moved microtubules movement observed adding cytosol axon discovered serendipitously cytosol caused microtubules translocate along glass surface similarly found cytosolcoated beads moved along microtubules two phenomena provided assays study microtubulebased motility assay vale sheetz reese isolated dominant motor protein cytosol naming kinesin showed kinesin moved one direction towards plus ends microtubules second motor later shown dynein richard vallee moved opposite direction results vale colleagues axonal transport published five papers vale finish md joined university california san francisco assistant professor promoted associate professor full professor vale jonathan howard james hudspeth developed single molecular assay kinesin discovered first protein severed microtubules later purified named vale colleagues solved crystal structure kinesin motor discovered unexpectedly structurally similar year working toshio yanagida vale developed singlemolecule fluorescence assay kinesin using various techniques vale coworkers developed mechanical model two motor domains kinesin dimer walk handoverhand model along microtubule since vale focused dynein motor protein discovered ian r gibbons although discovery occurred years kinesin large size hampered investigation vales laboratory prepared recombinant dynein yeast elucidated walked microtubules using singlemolecule worked gibbons determine structure dynein microtubulebinding team also solved structure dynein motor vale extended research fields including tcell rna vale founded ibiology nonprofit organization produces disseminates free online videos leading biologists speaking biological principles research scientific training professional development practicing scientists vale founded produced explorers guide biology xbio free online undergraduate textbook provides storytelling discoverfocused approach learning biology vale tim mitchison codirected physiology course marine biological laboratory woods hole transforming interdisciplinary training environment brings together biologists physicists computational scientists vale established young investigators meeting india provides mentoring networking workshop postdocs junior faculty india founded asapbio accelerating science publication biology promoting
