synthetic genomics nascent field synthetic biology uses aspects genetic modification preexisting life forms artificial gene synthesis create new dna entire lifeforms synthetic genomics unlike genetic modification sense use naturally occurring genes life forms may make use custom designed base pair series though expanded presently unrealized sense synthetic genomics could utilize genetic codes composed two base pairs dna currently used life development synthetic genomics related certain recent technical abilities technologies field genetics ability construct long base pair chains cheaply

field genetics began using molecular tools assemble artificial sequences smaller fragments synthetic naturallyoccurring dna advantage using recombinatory approach opposed continual dna synthesis stems inverse relationship exists synthetic dna length percent purity synthetic length words synthesize longer sequences number errorcontaining clones increases due inherent error rates current although recombinant dna technology commonly used construction fusion proteins plasmids several techniques larger capacities emerged allowing construction entire polymerase cycling assembly pca uses series oligonucleotides oligos approximately nucleotides long altogether constitute strands dna synthesized oligos designed single oligo one strand contains length approximately nucleotides end complementary sequences two different oligos opposite strand thereby creating regions overlap entire set processed cycles hybridization b elongation via taq polymerase standard ligase c denaturation forming
