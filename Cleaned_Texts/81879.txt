selfexpansion model proposes individuals seek expand sense self acquiring resources broadening perspectives increase competency ultimately optimize ability thrive developed arthur aron elaine aron provide framework underlying experience behavior close relationships model two distinct related core principles motivational principle inclusionofotherinself principle motivational principle refers individuals inherent desire improve selfefficacy adapt survive reproduce environment inclusionofotherinself principle posits close relationships serve primary way expand sense self incorporate identities perspectives resources experiences others relationships one underlying themes selfexpansion individuals basic motive selfexpand unlike maslows hierarchy needs theory omnipresent lowlevel needs met highlevel needs need self expansion occurs even basic need researchers believe selfexpansion like hunger thirst originates basic physiological needs nervous associated reward system researchers also believe motivation selfexpansion partly rooted social approval selfexpansion may conscious unconscious people may sometimes realize sense selfexpansion strive achieve goal promote selfexpansion time selfexpansion unconscious selfexpansion desire enhance individuals potential motivational models often refer selfefficacy ones belief competent achieve specific within selfexpansion model potential efficacy used instead refers obtaining resources make goal attainment possible achievement goal secondary however motivation selfexpand still influence attraction others potential close relationship aron aron suggest attraction broken two components based rotters valueexpectancy selfexpansion model originally established explore question people develop maintain relationships attempts describe peoples feelings actions intimate therefore related research mostly based intimate relationships motivation behind relationship lewandowski aron designed selfexpansion questionnaire seq explore expanding self selfexpansion questionnaire seq composed several key components selfexpansion contains total items measure degree increase knowledge skills abilities individual experienced partners three representative questions much partner help expand sense kind person much knowing partner made better person much see partner way expand capabilities second principle selfexpansion model people use close relationships self expand including self self often described content knowledge others could interpreted individuals studies also found individuals also include according aron aron entering close relationship person perceive self begin overlap including aspects specifically people include others feel resources ideas identity others think resources ideas identity others gained lost also gained new resources lead greater inclusion self also incorporating others perspectives identities aron aron tudor nelson conducted several classic studies scientifically demonstrated include suggested increased confusion self close directly related integrating self degree closeness relationship affects self reaction two individuals become closer greater confusion therefore longer reaction time result closeness relationship increases greater inclusion self inclusion self scale ios one frequently used tools assess phenomenon scale consists seven venn diagramlike pairs circles vary level overlap self respondents asked select pair circles best represents current close relationship several studies showed measurement tool effective getting accurate depictions amount closeness inclusion ios also assessed continuous ios javabased applet suitable online surveys measures ios continuous scale participants instructed use mouse move one circles typically labeled self towards typically labeled degree overlap best describes relationship question ios scale also adapted measure inclusion contexts example community connectedness via inclusion community self adaptability ios broad demonstrated recent versions substituting target idea including self extended include entire ingroup ingroup interdependent set individuals person identifies individual believes member fact several academic groups found similar findings menot reaction time paradigm group participants showed slower reaction time traits incongruent self ingroup comparison quicker reaction times traits congruent self ingroup slow reaction times consistent inclusion ingroup self claim suggested individual included group characteristics self result difficulty recalling trait belong self ingroup several researchers examined role ingroup identification ie persons prolonged psychological connection ingroup selfexpansion fact trop wright refined meaning ingroup identification believed analogous inclusion ingroup authors found degree connectedness ingroup affect confusion selfdescriptors people highly identified ingroup showed slower reaction times selfdescriptors relate ingroup consistent previous findings however low ingroup identification lead differences reaction times whether selfdescriptors also descriptive ingroup demonstrated level identification ingroup conceptualized degree include ingroup self central motivation including ingroup self parallels selfexpansion model interpersonal level selfexpansion model suggests strongly motivated expand including self occurs individual incorporates others perspectives identities resources likewise proposed including ingroup self ingroup identification partly influenced selfexpansion motive inclusion ingroups perspectives resources increase ones confidence completing variety goals thus groups attractiveness often based potential selfexpansion group higher social status greater amount potential resources likely included tropp wright created instrument measure extent individual includes ingroup inclusion ingroup self scale iss scale based inclusion self scale similar original scale seven pairs circles vary degree overlap self particular ingroup scale well validated degree inclusion ingroup self said capture sense ingroup identification abundance research focuses negative interactions different groups eg negative attitudes intolerance discrimination however sparse evidence explain positive aspects intergroup relations reduction prejudice contact hypothesis gordon allport one area psychology focuses positive aspects intergroup hypothesis suggests cooperation equal status common goals authority support contact members different groups result reduced negative attitudes addition positive emotions intergroup members said utmost importance would lead positive attitudes turn would generalize entire group set individuals individuals unclear attitude generalization actually happened recently process including group self used explanatory mechanism including group self based similar selfexpansion notion including ingroup self person becomes friend group member aspects group included self group made salient essentially representation group identity shared representation self including group self vary person may actually become member however certain circumstances virtually impossible simply psychologically identify group even though aware part upon inclusion group self give group several benefits benefits include taking pride group sharing resources positive biases causal explanations group benefits increase likelihood reduced group prejudice hence use mechanism contact hypothesis important note focus inclusion group self initially interpersonal level ie interaction needs interpersonal closeness inclusion self occur consequently decategorized approach contact used focus personal identities instead group identities focusing personalization greater chance development closeness eventually group membership needs become available individual include group self well however believed group membership become central natural manner close relationship develops empirical evidence seems support inclusion group self hypothesis one study white women paired either another white woman ingroup member latina woman group pairs women met extended period time completing different activities together led measurable close friendship women intergroup friendship likely positive intergroup attitudes less likely endorse antiminority policies less likely demonstrate intergroup anxiety study suggests intergroup close relationship led improved attitudes towards entire group suggested inclusion group self mechanism another study also found level inclusion group self would affect amount decreased prejudicial simply including friend self close relationship group member decrease group prejudiced attitudes knowing friend includes group member self allows individual include entire group self turn also leads positive attitudes group may case individuals want make friends group members instead oppress mistreat group selfexpansion based aron arons original work people want expand self optimal way make close friendships give opportunity increased perspectives identities resources people similar provide diminished capacity selfexpansion result individual may turn group members friendship different ones selfconcept differences allow greater likelihood increase resources identities perspectives consistent selfexpansion motive recent study shown consistent idea priming high selfexpansion motivation enhances group selfexpansion quality outcomes group interactions eg greater selfefficacy reported closeness selfexpansion motives explain people may appreciate intergroup contact however also provide explanations avoid intergroup contact people may cautious selfexpansion due sense selfloss selfexpand one area may put risk losing aspects self another area consequently people may fearful creating close relationship group member may trigger animosity original ingroup members often individuals must attempt balance potential benefits including group self potential loss ingroup friends associated resources selfloss outweighs selfexpansion possible decrease perceived second barrier selfexpansion risk overabundance selfexpansion might occur short accumulation new resources perspectives selfconcept leads need selfintegration ie combining different resources identities perspectives single overarching selfconcept excessive amount selfexpansion without proper selfintegration quite stressful eg moving new city starting new job suggested person socially stable selfexpansion via group member likely successful consequently likelihood crossgroup contact inclusion group self dependent degree selfexpansion domains expansion motivation believing recentlywhen selfexpansion research begun shift away investigating selfexpansion social context eg romantic instead focused selfexpansion processes outcomes selfexpansion individual research also focused selfexpansion domains results research studies shown selfexpansion occur individual level eg hobbies spiritual experiences workplace settings similar findings social selfexpansion literature individual selfexpansion also positive effects includes processes eg motivation selfefficacy selfexpansion also presented theoretically within framework selfconcept selfconcept change thought occurring along two independent dimensions valence positive vs negative content direction change increase vs decrease content selfexpansion represents one four possible processes selfconcept change increasing positive content selfexpansion usually begins attraction toward another falling love provides opportunity rapid selfexpansion desire unite person studies shown perceived similarity likeness promote interpersonal people tend prefer others similar goes motivation increase expansion perceived similarity interests background values found important factor affecting attraction dissimilarity partners avenue expansion due provision novel resources opinions study found providing information high likelihood developing relationship target person diminished somewhat reversed similarityattraction effect men case men likely select dissimilar partners providing opportunity expansion self people may generally reluctant pursue dissimilar others despite opportunity selfexpansion likely assume dissimilar would reciprocate feelings would expect expansion established couples research shows experience different levels motivation selfexpansion throughout relationship findings replicated crosscultural relationships continue change evolve degree foster expansion growth may vary future type confirmation bias emerges expect future selfexpansion relationships likely engage selfexpanding potential future expansion strong predictor relationship satisfaction research shows couples participate selfexpansion activities activities increase relationship satisfaction improve relationship quality however expansion also reduce negative outcomes relationship boredom one study dating college students married couples attributed boredom relationships low novelty also associated low pleasure arousal relationship participants primed boredom another study inclined seek new follows first principle model posits individuals possess inherent motivation expand sexual desire affected relationship boredom report high sexual desire partners likely sexual overall satisfaction consensually nonmonogamous individuals one sexual romantic partner time opportunities selfexpansion suggesting positive implications relationship transitioning open relationship novel exciting experience couple increase levels passion posited research several nonsexual opportunities well multiple partners involved exploring different interests learning new romantic relationships provide sufficient opportunity individual selfexpansion may increase inclination perceive focus alternative occurs great extent could lead negative relational outcomes exclusive monogamous relationship low relationship satisfactionstability higher susceptibility one study participants reported lower selfexpansion relationships likely enjoy interacting computer program simulation shown circumstances individuals less likely employ motivational perceptual biases protect influence attractive alternatives mediational analysis demonstrated attention alternatives explains observed relationship selfexpansion another study fmri data revealed less brain activation response series attractive faces participants primed remember moments selfexpansion current relationships suggesting selfexpansion discourage attending attractive infidelity severe relational transgression could lead dissolution ending relationship dependent many key factors improvement self hindering selfexpansion opportunities provided relationship also affect individual breaking loss relationship promote expansion found positive effects individual could provide new previously restricted opportunities however individual may experience selfcontraction loss self relationship provide sufficient relationships serve primary means selfexpansion however personal nonrelational selfexpansion still occur novel challenging individual experiences eg learning new language resulting several intrapersonal notable behavioral changes caused individual selfexpansion include smoking cessation weight loss better physical using experience sampling design researchers showed increases personal selfexpansion individual correlated higher passion relationship low levels passion observed high levels selfexpansion across suggests growth experienced nonshared activities fulfill individual needs could reduce passion ones partner another contributing factor level support received partner study retired married couples showed prior support partners individual growth predicted happiness satisfaction retirement relationship satisfaction ongoing couples increased partners encouraging nonrelational selfexpanding activities occurs individuals believe partners facilitating expansion associate httpsenwikipediaorgwikiselfexpansionmodel
