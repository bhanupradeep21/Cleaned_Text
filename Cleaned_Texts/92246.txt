amygdalofugal pathway latin fleeing amygdala commonly distinguished ventral amygdalofugal pathway one three major efferent pathways amygdala meaning one three principal pathways fibers leave amygdala leads basolateral nucleus central nucleus amygdala amygdala limbic structure medial temporal lobe brain main efferent pathways amygdala stria terminalis anterior commissure stria terminalis carries information primarily corticomedial nuclei amygdala ventral amygdalofugal pathway carries output central basolateral nuclei delivers number targets namely medial dorsal nucleus thalamus hypothalamus basal forebrain brainstem septal nuclei nucleus accumbens amygdalofugal pathway stria terminalis project septal region hypothalamus thalamus stria terminalis reaches septal region hypothalamus much longer less direct stria terminalis follows cshaped pathway along lateral ventricles ventral amygdalofugal pathway direct contains higher proportion myelinated axons causing pathway appear darker upon observation stained crosssection amygdalofugal pathway stria terminalis together enable corticomedial amygdala directly control medial hypothalamus enable basolateral amygdala directly control lateral hypothalamus pag midbrain periaqueductal gray bed nucleus stria terminalis amygdala additionally modulates hypothalamus pag pathway particularly important associative basolateral nucleus far largest part amygdala fibers leading central nucleus provide key link experience emotions expression basolateral nucleus includes five parts posterolateral part ventromedial part intermediate part dorsal part ventrolateral inputs basolateral nucleus include visual auditory somatosensory basolateral nucleus close communication cerebral cortex terms function basolateral nucleus like cerebral cortex central basolateral nucleus differs cortex layered includes pyramidal neurons continuous parahippocampal cortex extensive connections parts strongest direct connections cerebral cortex insular cortex orbital cortex medial wall frontal lobe connections allow basolateral nucleus receive modulate sensory polysensory processing neurotransmitter connections either glutamate neocortex basolateral nucleus receive diffuse cholinergic acetylcholine projections nucleus basalis stimulation basolateral nucleus causes reduction feeding stimulation basolateral nuclear group causes increase arousal components basolateral nuclear group include basolateral nucleus lateral nucleus basomedial basolateral nucleus cooperates central nucleus persistent fear responses influences regions brainstem central nucleus via amygdalofugal pathway stria mice basolateral nucleus mediates oxytocin visualized basolateral one study prescription opioid patients found decreased anisotropy amygdalofugal central nucleus thought exit amygdaloid bodies bodily responses associated fear leave peptiderich region amygdalofugal pathway connects central nucleus amygdala brainstem stria terminalis also longer less direct connections collectively involved emotional brainstem regions central nucleus connects responsible controlling expression innate behaviors associated physiological responses central nucleus also three subnuclei lateral capsular medial medial subnucleus forms connections response control regions projection neurons central nucleus nucleus basalis also connects central nucleus amygdala cortex cholinergic projections thought arouse cortex lesion experiments show central nucleus amygdala connects startle circuit via caudal part amygdalofugal pathway part pathway projects directly parts pons medulla perhaps spinal conscious perception emotion involves output central nucleus amygdala well connections amygdalofugal pathway anterior cingulate cortex orbitofrontal cortex prefrontal connections amygdalofugal pathway nucleus accumbens plays role perception stimulus either gratifying nucleus accumbens along regions ventral striatum prefrontal cortex one major targets ascending dopaminergic pathways originating ventral tegmental amygdala connects thalamus amygdalofugal pathway direct connection dorsomedial nucleus leaving substantia innominata ventral amygdalofugal pathway continues medial path enter septal region lateral preoptic area hypothalamus nucleus diagonal band fibers bypass preoptic area hypothalamus travel superiorly enter inferior thalamic peduncle amygdalofugal fibers travel laterally mammillothalamic tract ventral anterior nucleus enter dorsal medial nucleus amygdalofugal fibers well fibers nucleus basalis project substantia innominata followed thalamic peduncle magnocellar division dorsal medial nucleus dorsal medial nucleus therefore receives indirect input amygdala nucleus basalis lesions dorsal medial nucleus cause amnesic syndromes need interrupt mammillothalamic tract amygdalofugal pathway order thus pathways play role pyriform cortex type allocortex corresponds rostral half uncus strongest afferent connections olfactory although olfactory cortex comprises areas rostroventral portion forebrain receive direct projections olfactory bulb including anterior olfactory nucleus olfactory tubercle pyriform cortex entorhinal cortex insular cortex amygdala pyriform cortex considered synonymous olfactory cortex far largest cortical area primarily involved perception learning olfactory stimuli type paleocortex means older fewer layers neocortex recent contains layers along parahippocampal gyrus pyriform cortex chief component pyriform cortex located anterior medial temporal lobe amygdalofugal pathway projects nucleus diagonal pyriform cortex adjoined basolateral nucleus pyriform cortex basolateral nucleus considered main starting points amygdalofugal connection basolateral nucleus goes deep pyriform cortex also considered part amygdalofugal one reason amygdalofugal pathway important links motivations anterior cingulate cortex particular involved using emotions make decisions implicated wide variety cognitive functions well transient mood changes depression anxiety disorders perception stria terminalis amygdalofugal pathway main connection amygdala amygdalofugal connection however shorter hypothalamus highly important structure involved regulation bodily functions include endocrine autonomic behavioral produces wide variety hormones control body temperature hunger moods sex drive sleep thirst release dozens peptides within hypothalamus discovered recent years hypothalamus also influences daily physiologic cycles plays role regulating emotional responses many functions described homeostatic ventral part diencephalon contains three regions supraoptic region tuberal region mammillary httpsenwikipediaorgwikiamygdalofugalpathway
