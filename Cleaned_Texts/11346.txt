drugs related sedatives whereas term sedative describes drugs serve calm relieve anxiety term hypnotic generally describes drugs whose main purpose initiate sustain lengthen sleep two functions frequently overlap drugs class generally produce dosedependent effects ranging anxiolysis loss consciousness often referred collectively hypnotic drugs regularly prescribed insomnia sleep disorders insomnia patients prescribed hypnotics many hypnotic drugs habitforming many factors known disturb human sleep physician may instead recommend changes environment sleep better sleep hygiene avoidance caffeine alcohol stimulating substances behavioral interventions cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia cbti prescribing medication sleep prescribed hypnotic medication used shortest period time among individuals sleep disorders taking prescribed nonbenzodiazepines taking benzodiazepines early classes drugs barbiturates fallen use practices still prescribed patients children prescribing hypnotics

tested medicine later include urethan acetal methylal sulfonal paraldehyde amylenhydrate hypnon chloralurethan ohloralamid research using medications treat insomnia evolved throughout last half century treatment insomnia psychiatry dates back chloral hydrate first used barbiturates emerged first class drugs early chemical substitution allowed derivative compounds although best drug family time less toxicity fewer side effects dangerous overdose tended cause physical psychological benzodiazepines introduced safer alternatives replace barbiturates late benzodiazepines emerged safer benzodiazepines without drawbacks substance dependence possible deaths overdoses sometimes occur especially combination alcohol andor depressants questions raised whether disturb sleep nonbenzodiazepines recent development although clear less toxic barbiturates predecessors comparative efficacy benzodiazepines established efficacy hard determine without longitudinal studies however psychiatrists recommend drugs citing research suggesting equally potent less potential sleep remedies may considered exist psychiatrists sometimes prescribe medicines offlabel sedating effects examples include mirtazapine antidepressant clonidine older antihypertensive drug quetiapine antipsychotic overthecounter allergy antiemetic medications doxylamine diphenhydramine offlabel sleep remedies particularly useful firstline treatment unsuccessful deemed unsafe patients history substance abuse barbiturates drugs act central nervous system depressants therefore produce wide spectrum effects mild sedation total anesthesia also effective anxiolytics hypnotics anticonvulsalgesic effects however effects somewhat weak preventing barbiturates used surgery absence analgesics dependence liability physical psychological barbiturates largely replaced benzodiazepines routine medical practice treatment anxiety insomnia mainly benzodiazepines significantly less dangerous overdose however barbiturates still used general anesthesia epilepsy assisted suicide barbiturates derivatives barbituric acid principal mechanism action barbiturates believed positive allosteric modulation gabaa
