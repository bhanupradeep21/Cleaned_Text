sharply little brown bat promiscuous mating structure meaning individual bats sexes mate multiple seasonal breeder mating taking place fall annual seasonal breeder males produce sperm yearround instead spermatogenesis occurs may august throughout spring summer males females roost separately fall however individuals sexes congregate roost behavior known like several bat species males species
