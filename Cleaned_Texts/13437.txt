erythrocytapheresis apheresis procedure erythrocytes red blood cells separated whole blood extracorporeal blood separation method whereby whole blood extracted donor patient red blood cells separated remaining blood returned circulation separation erythrocytes whole blood passed apparatus isolates red blood cells remaining components erythrocytapheresis centrifugation commonly used red blood cell fractionation method hematocrit percentage blood volume taken red blood cells present highest percentage blood cell components solid portion blood therefore since erythrocytes highest specific weight comparison solids blood easily separated using centrifugation whole blood spun spinning bowl centrifuge bottom layer concentrated erythrocytes sediments bottom separated rest blood retransfused centrifugal sedimentation used process erythrocytapheresis occurs method patient donor blood collected processed erythrocyte concentrate high hematocrit content exhausted prefiltered blood collected suitable reservoir pumped rotating centrifuge centrifugal force separate red blood cells cells due high specific weight cells collected separate washing step lead removal plasma parts purify concentrate erythrocytes remaining blood consisting blood plasma leukocytes platelets stem cells lipids solids retransfused patient donor advancement centrifugation membrane filtration methods essential development erythrocytapheresis addition blood separation microdevices containing capillary channels identified potential blood cell fractionation methodcitation needed plasma blood cell separation techniques explored based magnetophoresis electrophoresis microchannel bends ultrasound standing wavescitation needed therapeutic erythrocytapheresis commonly used remove red blood cells patients experiencing sickle cell crisis affected erythrocytes removed rest blood retransfused blood separation also used patients severe malaria removal affected cells patient transfused dose normal red blood cells erythrocytapheresis also used blood donations procedure commonly done using automated red blood cell collection involves removal two units red blood cells includes either two standard units red blood cells one unit plus red blood cells another either plasma platelets advantage donor use smaller needles saline compensation well convenient donating schedules nodonation period following apheresis twice long single unit advantage blood bankers online separation standardized rbc masses subsequent reduction testing data entry staffing process commonly referred power reds double reds double red cell httpsenwikipediaorgwikierythrocytapheresis
