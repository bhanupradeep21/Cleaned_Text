salmonellosis symptomatic infection caused bacteria salmonella common disease known food poisoning though name refers foodborne illness general defined diseases usually either infectious toxic nature caused agents enter body ingestion food humans common symptoms diarrhea fever abdominal cramps symptoms typically occur hours hours exposure last two seven occasionally significant disease result old young others weakened immune system likely develop severe specific types salmonella result typhoid fever paratyphoid two species salmonella salmonella bongori salmonella enterica many however subgroups serovars within species may substantially different ability cause disease suggests epidemiologic classification organisms subspecies level may improve management salmonella similar vegetarian nonvegetarian populations susceptible salmonella infections due consumption contaminated meat infection usually spread consuming contaminated meat eggs water foods may spread disease come contact number pets including cats dogs reptiles also carry spread diagnosis stool test blood efforts prevent disease include proper washing preparation cooking food appropriate mild disease typically require specific significant cases may require treatment electrolyte problems intravenous fluid high risk disease spread outside intestines antibiotics salmonellosis one common causes diarrhea deaths occurred nontyphoidal salmonellosis deaths typhoidal united states million cases deaths occur nontyphoidal salmonellosis europe second common foodborne disease short incubation period hours one day bacteria multiply small intestine causing intestinal inflammation enteritis people salmonellosis develop diarrhea fever vomiting abdominal cramps hours diarrhea often watery nonbloody may mucoid cases illness lasts four seven days require treatment cases though diarrhea may severe patient becomes dangerously dehydrated must hospitalized hospital patient may receive fluids intravenously treat dehydration may given medications provide symptomatic relief fever reduction severe cases salmonella infection may spread intestines blood stream body sites cause death unless person treated promptly antibioticscitation needed otherwise healthy adults symptoms mild normally sepsis occurs occur exceptionally complication immunocompromised however people risk infants small children elderly salmonella infections become serious leading complications infants dehydration cause state severe toxicity extraintestinal localizations possible especially salmonella meningitis children osteitis etc
