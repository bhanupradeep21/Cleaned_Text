immunoglobulin ig also referred siga secretory form antibody plays role immune function mucous membranes amount iga produced association mucosal membranes greater types antibody absolute terms three five grams secreted intestinal lumen represents total immunoglobulins produced throughout iga two subclasses produced monomeric well dimeric form iga dimeric form prevalent also called secretory iga siga siga main immunoglobulin found mucous secretions including tears saliva sweat colostrum secretions genitourinary tract gastrointestinal tract prostate respiratory epithelium also found small amounts blood secretory component siga protects immunoglobulin degraded proteolytic enzymes thus siga survive harsh gastrointestinal tract environment provide protection microbes multiply body siga also inhibit inflammatory effects iga poor activator complement system opsonizes weakly iga exists two isotypes heavily glycosylated predominates serum percentages higher secretions serum ratio secreting cells varies different lymphoid tissues human found external secretions like colostrum maternal milk tears saliva prominent polysaccharide antigens tend induce protein membranebound see
