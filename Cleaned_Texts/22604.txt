sexual selection observed fungi part reproduction although also often reproduce asexually basidiomycetes sex ratio biased towards males implying sexual selection competition fertilize occurs fungi including yeasts pheromone signaling used female gametes conidia implying male choice cases competition may also occur indicated much faster evolution femalebiased genes fungi fungi produce asexually sexually currently sexual selection studied occur predominantly ascomycota basidiomycota phyla although different sexes present within fungi sexual selection act due presence different sex roles well different mating types fungi sex roles distinguished sexually producing filamentous fungi example sexually producing ascomycetes produce anisogamous gametes larger immobile gametes act female gametes smaller motile gametes act male gametes increased difference operational sex ratio osr due asymmetry sex roles leads production male gametes addition variation within gamete quality could affect offspring viability fitness also lead differences femalemale gamete addition sexual selection occur within fungi limiting number certain type limiting gamete typically female gamete tend costly produce invest energetically fungi haploiddiploid life cycle sexual selection much crucial diploid phase product phase immediately undergoes meiosis longer fertilized mushroomforming fungi within phylum basidiomycota produce sexually reciprocal migration nuclei malebiased osr aids supporting sexual selection present within fungi although traditional males present variation mating types responsible acting male female sex role receiving mycelia act female gametes donating nucleus acts male gamete sexual selection might occur competition female choice study demonstrated sexual selection occur donating nucleus heterokaryon receiving homokaryon two nuclear types within heterkaryon two nuclear types competition fertilize homokaryon female choice nuclear types also possible strong bias one two however supported competition donating nuclei responsible shown variation success various nuclei independent receiving factors may affect nucleis success include faster mitotic division increased migration possibly mechanism suppresses mitotic division basidiomycetes two mating types b unlinked however b locus codes larger amount pheromones subloci subloci produce many pheromones yet codes one receptor resulting high redundancy pheromones although one pheromone necessary fertilize presence high amount increases likelihood individuals pheromones received characteristic hypothesized evolved result sexual competition occur within fungi plants animals inequality ability access one sex role mating type present inequality could result increased competition access mating type competition also occur variation quality gametes within fungi competition fertilize seen equivalent competition plants animals sexual selection fungi aids explaining certain characteristics including high redundancy pheromones b matingtype locus well strong pheromone signaling male gametes ability reproduce asexually asexual spores fail reproduce sexually fungal species capable producing male gametes two different sizes throughout evolution smaller gametes lost ability produce asexually order increase likelihood fertilizing female gamete decreasing size increasing amount motility male gamete likely result direct competition tradeoff made order increase likelihood pheromone signaling used within fungi either attract mate assess quality gamete tends effective occurring small distances female gametes typically ones responsibly producing pheromones order attract however pheromones also released male choice occur populations low concentration male gametes allowing selective female fertilize female highest concentration pheromone usually situations fertilization may occur long distances watersoluble pheromones may secreted seen female gametes aquatic similarly occurs within aquatic oomycete algae species also variation pheromone production related male reaction observed variations within pheromone production well response studied found affected environmental conditions well developmental differences although proven production pheromones may lead fisherian runaway selection production pheromone increases due increase preference throughout addition pheromone signaling used method finding mate also appears utilized method assess mate quality pheromones costly produce due posttranslational modification therefore may subject handicap principle organism fake fitness producing isogamous budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae pheromones used distinguish different mating types show preference higher concentrations pheromones along rejection lower however pheromone studies within fungi performed laboratory research necessary effects natural gamete density motility pheromone production postcopulatory mechanisms may also present within fungi polyandry zygotelevel sexual selection might occur within multicellular ascomycete fungi haploid mycelium produces fruiting body turn produces many offspring also haploid fruiting body
