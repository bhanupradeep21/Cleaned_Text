hunting chasing belize also wildlife protection act established calls protection manatees section protection manatees lands allowed populations countries focus repopulation side conservation example mexico zoos parks taken injured dying manatees rehabilitated parks taken manatees around caribbean helped heal injuries sustained captivity captive breeding program started try encourage growth populations successful due nature manatee reproduction process sustainable way increase population size also enacting laws try protect manatees habitats less animals need rehabilitated recover
