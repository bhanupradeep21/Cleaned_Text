heterocercal tail fin asymmetry differed sharks lower lobe largest instead upper lobe derived forms nearly vertical symmetric tail fin sharks use asymmetric tail fin compensate fact negatively buoyant

richard cowen accepting endothermy group presumed ichthyosaurs would subject carriers constraint limitation reptilian respiration pointed david carrier undulated locomotion forces air lungs thus

surfaced breathe probably tilting heads slightly take air lower position nostrils compared ichthyosaurs viviparous ie bore live young instead laying eggs although reptiles descended egglaying oviparous ancestors viviparity unexpected first appears airbreathing marine creatures must either come ashore lay eggs like turtles sea snakes else give birth live young surface waters like whales
