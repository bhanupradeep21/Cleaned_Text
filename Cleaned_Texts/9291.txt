aggression refers negative behavior attitudes toward another mainly applying physical force evolution hand process formation development something like habit trait character population generation generation evolution explain fish exhibit aggression simple emotion emotion increases individuals survival reproduction aggressive behavior derive fish species due territory sex specific selection genetic variation specific fish species display invasive behavior almost fish aggressive sometimes lives depending surroundings fish territory another word defended areas generally ruled single individual breeding pairs guarded resource may include food shelter sexual partner offspring protecting regions fish often display aggressive behavior intruders territory owner strikes competing fish directly ending bite bump aggressive behavior seen large juveniles females fish kind area better understand topic consider male threespine stickleback gasterosteus aculeatus example theo bakkers paper claims threespine stickleback male fish prefer two female mates territory thus males highly aggressive access females particular territory also leads intrasexual selection among males intrasexual selection selection within sex instance male animals compete one another physically access females kind characters like big tail sharp teeth similar weaponry used males species means mating females selective advantage deep relationship aggression fish size regions owned smaller territory female fish often disappear mating female fish bound mate particular fish chance female get attracted another male dump previous partner without hesitation situation ditched male fish become aggressive find mates order reproduce levels aggression increase rates sneaking rival males go sneaking males enter nest release sperm eggs breeding fish rival fish using alternative reproduction methods like parental sneaker satellite avoid hurt breeding males hand breeding males higher mating success endure less looting eggs large territories eggs gathered breeding males decrease territories protect offspring predators parental phase eggs hatched males continue show similar invasive behavior due increased reproductive value offspring awareness newly hatched young fish enemies territorial aggression take place due pressure mating producing offspring intruders also light intensity term intensity used describe rate light spreads surface given area distance source lower light levels risk losing resources like food mates give rise aggressive behavior among fish belonging territory additionally understanding rate aggression distance among neighboring fish varied nighttime light intensities area sveinn valdimarsson neil metcalfe conducted experiment juveniles atlantic salmon salmo salar beginning salar disclosed four different nighttime light intensities lx hours period result concluded fish showed less aggression intensity light lower level light intense due darkness night territorial fish failed detect food members area decreased territory size remained closer attacking good example evolution cooperation among fish additionally light intensities light increased fish could see defend space territory size increases bright lights short aggressive behavior salmon toward rivals highly manipulated light intensities thus size space fish defending increases decreases day night male female fish get involved aggressive confrontation yet varying selection pressures affecting sex result gender differences aggressive syndrome competition aggressive syndrome social condition describing individuals need show distaste dislike certain individuals adult female fish usually gather groups including adult females nonreproductive males aggressive behavior displayed females especially female fish attack directly dominance relationships take place among female association instance females higher status size better opportunities mate minors residing group females become aggressive two dominant females trying select male fish mating selection based intersexual selection selection two sexes females use selection choosing mates good genes example female peacocks tend prefer male peacocks bright plumage females think mate males bright plumage offspring similar characteristic josefin dahlbom colleagues experimented zebra fish danio rerio study difference aggression level males females put together similar environment testing fish paired one sex experiment continued observed dominant males females increase aggression level day four fifth day dominant female members group stopped aggressive authors suggested could subordinate females stopped challenging dominant female early study thereby dominant female need prove superiority contrast male subordinates continued fighting dominant males result dominant males showed aggression suppress subordinate males maintain position among others paper gender differences aggressive behavior convict cichlids gareth arnott robert w elwood investigated gender related variations aggression seen convict cichlids amatitlania nigrofasciata see genderrelated changes aggression tested intersexual agonistic events take place isolated males females previously paired breeding partners end detected terms encroachment texas cichlids males used lateral display along tail biting whereas females used frontal display biting two different displays explanation convict cichlids generally use either left right eye swimming therefore fish use either left right hemisphere brain aggressive males believed use left hemisphere whereas aggressive females navigate based right eyes although clear conclusion drawn study hemispheres aggression levels fairly seen males females show variation aggression syndrome short various forces affecting sex result distant aggressive behavior among male female fish evolution aggression occur fish due genetic makeup examine relationship aggression genetic makeup team cnrslaboratoire neurobiologie et d√©veloppement conducted experiment zebra fish spiegeldanio beginning team cnrs organized behavioral tests quantitatively measure three characters aggressive behavior experiment turned particular fish mutation gene summarizing membrane receptor sensitive fgf fibroblast growth factor key growth factor fish reaction mutation group fish displays low brain levels histamine histamine neurotransmitter controls appetite sleep attention species due low histamine levels zebra fish exhibit aggressive behavior therefore link genes histamine regulates behavioral status aggression zebra fish another experiment katrina tiira performed different test landlocked salmon salmo salar see juveniles low estimated genetic diversity showed less aggression continue theory researches selected one group fish low genetic diversity another group high genetic diversity compared aggression levels observed salmon fry low genetic variation showed less aggression group group less variation researcher used closely related parents juveniles genetically related sharing high number alleles thus display low aggression competitors used kin recognition method others conclusion explained genetic variation salmon manipulate agnostic syndrome individuals group closely related aggression fish increased effect growth hormone gh essential growth factor species control use nutrients tissue synthesis thus increases metabolic demands species resulting aggression fight daily needs experiment designed juvenile rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss selected two control fish cc pairs two growth hormone treated fish ghgh pairs one growth hormonetreated one control cgh pairs testing analyzed gh increases aggression levels groups mykiss indirectly improved swimming activity along attacking rate competitors summary growth hormone plays vital role controlling aggression rainbow trout fish httpsenwikipediaorgwikifishaggression
