sinoventricular conduction rare form cardiac conduction sinoatrial node generates impulse conducted atrioventricular node av node absence right atrium contracting physiological proof presence internodal tracts clearly demonstrated histologically electrocardiogram ecg p wave due inactivation atrial hyperkalemia lead sinoventricular conduction evidenced ecg p waves becoming flatter flatter eventually disappearing impulse sinus node still conducted via internodal tracts av node thus normal ventricular activation occurs sinoventricular conduction also demonstrated acute myocardial ischemia elucidated absence p waves surface leads despite effective high right atrial httpsenwikipediaorgwikisinoventricularconduction
