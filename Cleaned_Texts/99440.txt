different factors need carefully studied order optimize synergistic effects hypothesized interactions neurotrophic factors could alter optimal concentrations factor cell survival phenotype maintenance

critical nutrient proper gradients previous studies shown growth factors able optimize neurite extension best presented future studies neurotrophic factor combinations need include gradients cell adhesion molecules cams neurotrophic factors embedded together biocompatible matrices relatively new concept cams immunoglobulin superfamily igsf includes neurofascin particularly promising expressed developing nervous system neurons schwann cells known serve guidance cues mediate neuronal differentiation neurotrophic factors ngf growth differentiation factor however well established promoters

combining neurofascin artificial fusion protein improves efficiency since factors delivered different cues used may even fused single new cue effect presenting multiple stimuli types chemical physical
