four sensible qualities hot cold wet dry empedoclean scheme matter made four elements differing proportions aristotles scheme added heavenly aether divine substance heavenly spheres stars aristotle describes two kinds motion violent unnatural motion thrown stone physics natural motion falling object heavens violent motion soon agent stops causing motion stops also words natural state object

element concerned aether naturally moves circle around heavensh empedoclean elements move vertically like fire observed like earth towards natural resting physics aristotle effectively states

absurdity vacuum opinions varied whether aristotle intended state quantitative laws henri carteron held extreme aristotles concept force basically authors reject archimedes corrected aristotles theory bodies move towards natural resting places metal boats float displace enough water floating depends archimedes scheme mass volume object aristotle thought elementary aristotles writings motion remained influential early modern period john philoponus late antiquity galileo early modern period said shown experiment aristotles claim heavier object falls faster lighter object contrary opinion given carlo rovelli argues aristotles physics motion correct within domain validity objects earths gravitational field immersed fluid air system heavy bodies steady fall indeed travel faster light ones whether friction ignored fall slowly denser newtons forced motion corresponds aristotles violent motion external agent aristotles assumption agents effect stops immediately stops acting eg ball leaves throwers hand awkward consequences suppose surrounding fluid helps push ball along make continue rise even though hand longer acting resulting medieval theory aristotle suggested reason

view soul timaeus soul takes space able come physical contact scholarship overwhelmingly opposed aristotles interpretation plato maintained misunderstood todays scholars tended reassess aristotles interpretation warmed aristotles criticism platos view reincarnation entails possible soul body mismatched principle aristotle alleges soul go body according platos aristotles claim soul form living meant eliminate possibility thus rule according aristotle soul memory ability hold perceived experience mind distinguish internal appearance occurrence words memory mental picture phantasm recovered aristotle believed impression left semifluid bodily organ undergoes several changes order make memory memory occurs stimuli sights sounds complex nervous system receive impressions changes involved operations sensation aristotelian common sense aristotle uses term memory actual retaining experience impression develop sensation intellectual anxiety comes impression formed particular time processing specific contents memory past prediction future sensation present retrieval impressions performed suddenly transitional channel needed located past experiences previous experience present aristotle believes people receive kinds sense perceptions perceive impressions people continually weaving together new impressions experiences search impressions people search memory within memory one experience offered instead specific memory person reject experience find looking recollection occurs one retrieved experience naturally follows another chain images needed one memory stimulate next people recall experiences stimulate certain previous experiences reach one recollection thus selfdirected activity retrieving information stored memory humans remember impressions intellectual activity numbers words animals perception time retrieve memories past observations remembering involves perception things remembered time aristotle believed chain thought ends recollection certain impressions connected systematically relationships similarity contrast contiguity described laws association aristotle believed past experiences hidden within mind force operates awaken hidden material bring actual experience according aristotle association power innate mental state operates upon unexpressed remains former experiences allowing rise aristotle describes sleep sleep sleep takes place result overuse vital person asleep critical activities include thinking sensing recalling remembering function wakefulness since person sense sleep desire result sensation however senses able work albeit unless dreams involve actually sensing stimulus dreams sensation still involved altered aristotle explains person stares moving stimulus waves body water looks away next thing look appears wavelike motion person perceives stimulus stimulus longer focus attention leaves body awake senses functioning properly person constantly encounters new stimuli sense impressions previously perceived stimuli however sleep impressions made throughout day noticed new distracting sensory dreams result lasting impressions since impressions left exact stimuli dreams resemble actual waking sleep person altered state mind aristotle compares sleeping person person overtaken strong feelings toward stimulus example person strong infatuation someone may begin think see person everywhere overtaken feelings since person sleeping suggestible state unable make judgements become easily deceived appears dreams like infatuated leads person believe dream real even dreams absurd de anima iii aristotle ascribes ability create store recall images absence perception faculty imagination one component aristotles theory dreams disagrees previously held beliefs claimed dreams foretelling sent divine aristotle reasoned naturalistically instances dreams resemble future events simply aristotle claimed dream first established fact person asleep experience person image appear moment waking see something dark considered dream awake occurred secondly sensory experience perceived person asleep qualify part dream example person sleeping door shuts dream hear door shut sensory experience part dream lastly images dreams must result lasting impressions waking sensory aristotles practical philosophy covers areas ethics politics economics aristotle considered ethics practical rather theoretical study ie one aimed becoming good good rather knowing sake wrote several treatises ethics notably including nicomachean aristotle taught virtue proper function ergon thing eye good eye much
