life support anencephalic newborns whose parents requested organ donation could likewise organs removed general anesthesia without need wait diagnosis brain approach conceptual pragmatic advantages conceptual side securing organs optimum times require us constantly redefine death occurs persons alive may organs taken would also allow us say physician removes lifesupport patient dies physician

rejecting rules question would advantages recipients donors transplant programs necessary interval pulselessness declaration death reduction warm ischemia time improvement quality quantity transplantable also possible give donor drugs heparin phentolamine hasten death also maximize organ preservation finally eliminate possibility patients experience discomfort withdrawn ventilator support allowing potentially fatal doses morphine titrated signs main obstacle accepting proposal securing acceptance public allow physicians cause death say kill patients obtain transplantable organs proponents proposal contend robust consent requirements provide public assurance exploitation dead donor rule prohibition killing designed provide others deny thus question posed given difficulties
