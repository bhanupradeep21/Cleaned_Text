multiple sclerosis demyelinating diseases central nervous system cns produce lesions demyelinated areas cns glial scars scleroses present different shapes histological findings according underlying condition produces demyelinating diseases traditionally classified two kinds demyelinating myelinoclastic diseases demyelinating leukodystrophic diseases first group normal healthy myelin destroyed toxic chemical autoimmune substance second group myelin abnormal second group denominated dysmyelinating diseases therefore since poser demyelinating diseases normally refers myelinoclastic part demyelinating diseases cns classified according pathogenesis five nonexclusing categories demyelination due inflammatory processes viral demyelination demyelination caused acquired metabolic derangements forms demyelination demyelination caused focal four noninflammatory possibilities four types demyelination noninflammatory different even leukoencephalopathies produce similar typical lesions similar ms four kinds atypical inflammatory demyelinating lesions ringlike antibodymediated megacystic tumefactive balolike diffuselyinfiltrating list diseases produce cns demyelinating lesions complete includes special characteristic makes difference ms several kinds adem structure lesions strictly perivenous adem showing confluence around veins ms given adem multiphase sometimes ms appear children characteristic often considered line separates typical perivenous demyelination adem adem present plaquelike lesions indistinguishable nevertheless adem white matter appears intact magnetization transfer mri ms shows problems see besides adem present black holes mri zones axonal damage lesions develop strictly around veins instead relaxed rule ms several patterns described inside nmo heterogeneous inside individual reflecting stages lesion early active demyelinating nmo lesions may show complement within macrophages oligodendrocyte apoptosis associated selective loss minor myelin proteins addition typical nmo features subset active demyelinating nmo demyelination around vein normally called plaque ms plaques reported appear coalescence several confluent smaller demyelinations normally ms lesions small ovoid lesions less cm long oriented perpendicular long axis brains ventricles often disposed surrounding active preactive lesions appear hyperintense areas mri preactive lesion refers lesions localized normal appearing white matter without apparent loss myelin nevertheless showing variable degree oedema small clusters microglial cells enhanced major histocompatibility complex class ii antigen antigen expression variable number perivascular lymphocytes around small blood using high field mri system several variants several areas show lesions spacially classified infratentorial callosal juxtacortical periventricular white matter authors simplify three regions intracortical mixed graywhite matter others classify hippocampal cortical wm finally others give seven areas intracortical mixed white mattergray matter juxtacortical deep gray matter periventricular white matter deep white matter infratentorial distribution lesions could linked clinical postmortem autopsies reveal gray matter demyelination occurs motor cortex cingulate gyrus cerebellum thalamus spinal cortical lesions observed specially people spms also appear rrms clinically isolated syndrome frequent men partly explain cognitive deficits known two parameters cortical lesions fractional anisotropy fa mean diffusivity md higher patients larger spms rrms remain unchanged short followup periods spread subcortical white matter never show gadolinium enhancement oneyear period cls increase number size relevant proportion ms patients without spreading subcortical white matter showing inflammatory features similar white matter first plausible explanation distribution published dr schelling said problems chest veins ever found morphologic appearance named dawsons fingers charles lumsden scottish pathologist james walker first defined condition dawsons fingers name lesions around ventriclebased brain patients multiple sclerosis antimog associated though thought specific ms known condition thought result inflammation mechanical damage blood around long axis medular veins dawsons fingers spread along large periventricular collecting veins attributed perivenular lesions far away veins known steiners sometimes experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis triggered humans accident medical mistake damage cases fulfils pathological diagnostic criteria ms therefore classified ms right lesions classified pattern ii lucchinetti system case human eae also showed dawson demyelinating lesions whose size larger cm normally appear together normal ms lesions situation described tumefactive multiple sclerosis appear alone usually named solitary difficult diagnose look like intracranial neoplasms sometimes get biopsied suspected tumors proton mr spectroscopy help hallmark ms lesion appears mainly white matter shows macrophage mediated demyelination bbb breakdown inflammation axon transection demyelinating lesions begin appearance areas named nawm normal appearing white matter despite name abnormal several parameters areas show axonal transections stressed oligodendrocytes cells responsible maintaining myelin randomly show clusters activated microglia named preactive lesions prelesions normally resolve though sometimes spread towards capilar vein followed barrier bbb breakdown bbb tight vascular barrier blood brain prevent passage antibodies ms patients work unknown reasons special areas appear brain spine followed leaks barrier immune cells infiltrate leads entrance macrophages cns triggering beginning immunemediated attack myelin gadolinium cross normal bbb therefore gadoliniumenhanced mri used show bbb breakdowns bbb breakdown immunemediated attack myelin happens cells kind lymphocyte plays important role bodys defenses cells recognize myelin foreign attack explaining cells also called autoreactive lymphocytes demyelination inflammation axonal transection result attack myelin starts inflammatory processes triggers immune cells release soluble factors like cytokines antibodies breakdown barrier turn cause number damaging effects swelling activation macrophages activation cytokines destructive proteins astrocytes heal partially lesion leaving scar scars sclerae known plaques lesions usually reported ms repair process called remyelination takes place early phases disease oligodendrocytes unable completely rebuild cells myelin sheath repeated attacks lead successively less effective remyelinations scarlike plaque built around damaged axons according view researchers special subset lymphocytes called helper cells specifically play key role development lesion normal circumstances lymphocytes distinguish self nonself however person ms cells recognize healthy parts central nervous system foreign attack invading virus triggering inflammatory processes stimulating immune cells soluble factors like cytokines antibodies many myelinrecognizing cells belong terminally differentiated subset called costimulationindependent effectormemory recently type immune cells b cells also implicated pathogenesis degeneration axons also damaged often brain able compensate damage due ability called neuroplasticity ms symptoms develop cumulative result multiple lesions brain spinal cord symptoms vary greatly different individuals depending lesions occur laboratory conditions stem cells quite capable proliferating differentiating remyelinating oligodendrocytes therefore suspected inflammatory conditions axonal damage somehow inhibit stem cell proliferation differentiation affected possible predict much lesion related found neural cells primary progressive patients ppms kind problem protect neuroprotection demyelination oligodendrocytes compared healthy subjects genetics seem underlie problem shown using induced pluripotent stem cell ipsc neural progenitor cells four different damage patterns known lassmann identified team scars brain tissue multiple sclerosis used sometimes basis describing lesions demyelinating diseases meaning fact controversial investigation teams means ms heterogeneous disease others maintain shape scars change time one type could marker disease anyway heterogeneity could true early stage lesions present mitochondrial defects could distinguish types currently antibodies lipids peptides sera detected microarrays used markers pathological subtype
