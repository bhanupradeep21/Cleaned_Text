cellular adoptive immunotherapy type immunotherapy immune cells tcells usually isolated patients expansion engineering purposes reinfused back patients fight diseases using immune system major application cellular adoptive therapy cancer treatment immune system plays vital role development growth primary types cellular adoptive immunotherapies cell therapies therapies include cart therapy carnk therapy macrophagebased immunotherapy dendritic cell therapy although immunotherapy immune checkpoint blockade targeted therapy used treat improve survival patients several types cancers nonsmall cell lung cancer many patients still develop disease progression even receiving therapies cellular adoptive therapy another alternative patients first studies tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes
