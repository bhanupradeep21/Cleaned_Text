overall quality voice case transgender voice therapy vocal pedagogy related field alter voice purpose singing voice therapy may also serve teach preventive measures vocal hygiene safe speaking singing several orientations towards management voice therapy approach taken voice therapy varies individuals set treatment method applies specific method treatment consider type severity disorder well individual qualities personal cultural common orientations described symptomatic voice therapy aims directly indirectly modify symptoms caused voice techniques implemented facilitate production maintenance voice appropriate symptomatic voice therapy modify respiration phonation resonance voice loudness rate laryngeal muscle tension may assist gender reassignment voice physiologic voice therapy may adopted voice disorder caused disturbance physiology vocal therapy directly modifies abnormal physiologic activity affecting respiration phonation physiologic voice therapy aims create balance various hygienic voice therapy involves modifying eliminating inappropriate vocal behaviours lead voice dysfunction behaviours modified voice may improve towards normal voice improved without directly targeting physiological hygienic voice therapy uses different techniques used management prevention voice disorders management disorders hygienic voice therapy usually used conjunction voice therapy methods vocal hygiene programs include many different components usually includes speech nonspeech aspects speech aspects include addressing loudness amount use whereas nonspeech components typically address components allergies laryngopharyngeal reflux vocal hygiene program also may include component learning voice works eg anatomy vocal hygiene guidelines better vocal health

largo andante allegro maintaining proper breathing techniques rhythms generalized real speech use repetition reading passages conversations wide variety treatments fall symptomatic voice example symptomatic voice treatment method chanttalk approach chanttalk approach uses preexisting characteristics found chantingstyled music rhythm prosodic patterns therapy used reduce phonatory effort causes vocal chant therapy used minimize hyperfunctionality affecting loudness voice quality technique employs continuous tone quality found music chanting specifically elevates pitch voice phonation prolongs vowels destresses syllables lessens wordinitial glottal goals chanttalk approach use voice quality pitch techniques decrease effort used talking technique first demonstrated use recordings patient subsequently asked imitate specified voicing patterns chant mastered patient asked read aloud chant normal register second alternation patients asked reduce chanting minimal maintaining vowel prolongations softened glottal word onsets sessions recorded order provide auditory resonant voice technique often taught actors singers improve voice resonant voice therapy teaches clients use resonant voice order reduce vocal fold trauma resonant voice produced minimally adducted closed vocal folds technique reduces force vocal folds vibrating reduces trauma allows variety different programs including lessacmasden resonant voice therapy lmrvt humming ybuzz studied used help teach resonant program uses slightly different strategies teach resonant voice however similar hierarchical structures share goal producing strong clear voice minimal aforementioned programs client begins trying produce resonance nasal consonants vowels progresses using technique words sentences voice therapy clinicians often help patients conceptualize resonant voice discussing patient feels voice patients dysphonia often describe voices vibrating resonant voice described vibrating higher forward felt alveolar ridge maxillary range expansion stabilization techniques rest exercises range expansion stabilization techniques rest exercises target symptoms reduced pitch range reduced loudness voice instability often related variety different voice three main exercises work target symptoms first called stretching exercise targets pitch range client asked find comfortable pitch slowly go octave using gliding technique gently go back comfortable pitch one inhale procedure followed exhale rest seconds repeated times client improves octave levels increased second called resistance exercise focuses loudness client asked use comfortable pitch go soft loud voice seconds followed exhale important train client without straining voice third called endurance exercise client instructed hold
