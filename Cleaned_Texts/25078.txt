coccydynia medical term meaning pain coccyx tailbone often brought fall onto coccyx persistent irritation usually sitting coccydynia also known coccygodynia coccygeal pain coccyx pain coccydynia occurs lowest part spine coccyx believed vestigial tail words tail bone name coccyx derived greek word cuckoo due beak like appearance coccyx made vertebrae may fused together ventral side coccyx slightly concave whereas dorsal aspect slightly convex sides transverse grooves show vestigial coccygeal units previously fused coccyx attaches sacrum dorsal grooves attachment either symphysis true synovial joint also gluteus maximus muscle coccygeal muscle anococcygeal ligament four different orientations coccyx described postacchini massobrio type coccyx curved anteriorly apex facing downward caudally type ii forward curvature dramatic apex extends forward type iii coccyx angles forward sharply lastly type iv characterized coccyx subluxated sacrococcygeal joint common pathophysiological ways person may develop coccydynia two main causes condition sudden impact due fall coccydynia caused childbirth pressure ways coccydynia develops partial dislocation sacrococcygeal synchondrosis possibly result abnormal movement coccyx excessive sitting repetitive trauma surrounding ligaments muscles resulting inflammation tissues pain number different conditions cause pain general area coccyx involve coccyx muscles attached first task diagnosis determine whether pain related coccyx physical rectal examination high resolution xrays mri scans rule various causes unrelated coccyx tarlov cysts pain referred higher spine note contrary anatomical textbooks coccyxes consist several segments fractured coccyx often diagnosed coccyx fact normal dislocated intercoccygeal simple test determine whether coccyx involved injection local anesthetic area pain relates coccyx produce immediate anesthetic test proves positive dynamic sitstand xray mri scan may show whether coccyx dislocates patient use dynamic xrays patients gave positive results anesthetic test showed study found pattern lesions different depending obesity patients obese patients likely posterior luxation coccyx thin patients likely coccygeal spicules sagittal coccygeal movement measured using angle angle coccyx strikes seat individual sits smaller angle indicates coccyx parallel seat resulting flexion normal movement larger angle indicates coccyx perpendicular seat causing posterior subluxation backward movement one way classifying coccydynia whether onset traumatic versus nontraumatic many cases exact cause unknown referred idiopathic coccydynia coccydynia fairly common injury often result falls particularly sports cycling skateboarding skating ice hockey coccydynia often reported following fall childbirth cases persistent pressure activities like bicycling may cause onset coccyx coccydynia due causes usually permanent may become persistent chronic controlled coccydynia may also caused sitting improperly thereby straining coccyx rarely coccydynia due undiagnosed presence sacrococcygeal teratoma tumor vicinity study cases back pain referred hospital found diagnosed type pain occurs five times frequently women men occur age mean age onset around ethnicity race associations coccydynia activities put pressure affected area bicycling horseback riding activities increased sitting put direct stress coccyx medical condition often characterized pain worsens constipation may relieved bowel movement rarely even sexual intercourse aggravate symptoms since sitting affected area may aggravate condition cushion cutout back coccyx recommended tailbone pain bowel movements stool softeners increased fiber diet may help antiinflammatory medications nsaids may pain persists treatments may applied manual treatment carried repeated massage muscles attached coccyx via anus treatment usually given intimate partner chiropractor osteopath physical therapist thiele applied treatment series coccydynia patients reported orthopaedic surgeons commonly inject corticosteroids painful joint maigne tamalet applied treatment patients fluoroscopic two months injection patients luxation hypermobility improved healed patients visible abnormality improved abnormality found injection relieved pain abnormality remained ceased painful temporary permanent nerve blocks sometimes applied cases coccydynia foye et al reported repeated temporary nerve blocks injection ganglion impar could give relief number cases occasionally single injection nonsurgical treatments fail relieve pain cases cancer surgery remove coccyx coccygectomy may required cases pain persists surgery standard drugs chronic pain tricyclic antidepressants may help alleviate body positioning alignment significant producing less stress coccyx region bad posture influence coccyx pain people may realize stressing coccyx daily activities pain coccyx caused many incidents like falling horseback riding even sitting hard surfaces long period time main focus prevent coccyx pain occurring correcting everyday activities contribute tailbone pain take hot cold water baths stream hot cold water run back continuously pain becomes unbearable use cold water pain persists repeat procedure intervals minutes definite way fully prevent coccyx pain accident occur given time however people obese higher risk developing coccyx pain carrying excessive weight contributes stress coccyx sitting causing increased chances prevention carrying excessive weight gain help reduce tension pressure coccyx words coccyx obese people may posteriorly outward sitting avoidance contact sports like basketball football hockey decrease risks coccyx pain help reduce chances falling another method proper safety equipment sports prevent coccyx pain example hockey pants provide extra cushion protect thigh coccyx buttocks results lead less falls cause trauma coccyx kneeling groin stretch help prevent coccyx pain occurring long periods sitting adductor magnus involved kneeling groin stretch tight contribute tailbone pain stretching help prevent tailbone pain stretches like piriformis stretch hands feet stretch relieve stress muscles around coccyx sitting long time release tension built around muscles coccyx httpsenwikipediaorgwikicoccydynia
