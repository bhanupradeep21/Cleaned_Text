holometabolism also called complete metamorphosis form insect development includes four life stages egg larva pupa imago adult holometabolism synapomorphic trait insects superorder holometabola immature stages holometabolous insects different mature stage species holometabolous life cycle prevents larvae competing adults inhabit different ecological niches morphology behavior stage adapted different activities example larval traits maximize feeding growth development adult traits enable dispersal mating egg laying species holometabolous insects protect feed offspring insect developmental strategies include ametabolism hemimetabolism four general developmental stages morphology function first stage insect life cycle egg embryo developmental strategies egg begins single cell divides develops larval form hatching insects reproduce parthenogenesis may haplodiploid produce viable eggs without fertilization egg stage insects short days however insects may hibernate undergo diapause egg stage avoid extreme conditions case stage last several months eggs types insects tsetse flies aphids hemimetabolous hatch laid second stage holometabolous life cycle larva plural larvae many adult insects lay eggs directly onto food source larvae may begin eating soon hatch larvae never possess wings wing buds simple rather compound species larval stage mobile wormlike form larvae classified body type larval stage variously adapted gaining accumulating materials energy necessary growth metamorphosis holometabolous insects pass several larval stages instars grow develop larva must moult pass larval stage stages may look similar differ mostly size may differ many characteristics including behavior color hairs spines even number legs differences larval stages especially pronounced insects hypermetamorphosis final larval stage insects called prepupa prepupae feed become uncommon larval tissue broken metamorphosis increase size cell enlargement cells tissues turn imago grows increase enter third stage homometabolous development larva undergoes metamorphosis pupa pupa quiescent nonfeeding developmental stage pupae move little although pupae species mosquitoes mobile preparation pupation larvae many species seek protected sites construct protective cocoon silk material accumulated feces insects undergo diapause pupa stage insects physiology functional structure internal external change drastically pupae classified three types obtect exarate coarctate obtect pupae compact legs appendages enclosed butterfly chrysalis exarate pupae legs appendages free extended coarctate pupae develop inside larval skin final stage holometabolous insect development adult imago adult insects wings excepting secondarily lost functioning reproductive organs adult insects grow little eclosion pupa adult insects feed focus entirely mating reproduction adult insects postmitotic adult emergence dividing cells restricted specific organs cyrtodiopsis

occupy different ecological niches exploiting different resources fact considered key driver unusual evolutionary diversification form physiology within group according latest phylogenetic reconstructions holometabolan insects suggests evolutionary innovation complete metamorphosis occurred paleontological evidence shows first winged insects appeared paleozoic carboniferous fossil samples approximately already display remarkable diversity species functional wings fossil remains show primitive apterygota ancient winged insects ametabolous completely lacking metamorphosiscitation needed end carboniferous permian approximately pterygotes postembryonic development included separated nymphal adult stages shows hemimetaboly already evolved earliest known fossil insects considered holometabolan appear permian strata approximately phylogenetic studies also show sister group holometabola paraneoptera includes hemimetabolan species number neometabolan parsimonious evolutionary hypothesis holometabolans originated hemimetabolan ancestors origin complete metamorphosis insects subject long lasting times fierce debate one first theories proposed one william harvey harvey suggested nutrients contained within insect egg scarce selection embryo forced hatch completion development posthatch larval life desembryonized animal would accumulate resources external environment reach pupal stage harvey viewed perfect egg form however jan swammerdam conducted dissection study showed pupal forms egglike instead transitional stage larvae john lubbock revitalized harveys hypothesis argued origin evolution holometabolan development explained precocious eclosion embryo hemimetabolan species whose larvae look like adult embryo completes developmental stages namely protopod polipod oligopod stages inside eggshell holometabolan species instead vermiform larvae pupal stage incomplete development hatching debate continued twentieth century authors like charles pérez claiming precocious eclosion theory outlandish antonio berlese reestablishing leading theory augustus daniel imms disseminating widely among anglosaxon readers see wigglesworth one contentious aspects precocious eclosion theory fueled debate field evolution development proposal hemimetabolan nymphal stages equivalent holometabolan pupal stage critics theory notably h e argue postembryonic

holometabolan evolutionary trend jw truman lm riddiford revitalized precocious eclosion theory focus endocrine control metamorphosis postulated hemimetabolan species hatch three embryonic moults nymphal form similar adult whereas holometabolan species hatch two embryonic moults vermiform larvae different however b konopová j zrzavý reported ultrastructural studies across wide range
