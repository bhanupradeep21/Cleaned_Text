vascular access refers rapid direct method introducing removing devices chemicals bloodstream hemodialysis vascular access used remove patients blood filtered dialyzer three primary methods used gain access blood intravenous catheter arteriovenous fistula av synthetic graft latter two needles used puncture graft fistula time dialysis performed type vascular access created patients hemodialysis influenced factors expected time course patients kidney failure condition vasculature patients may multiple accesses usually av fistula graft maturing catheter still used creation three major types vascular accesses requires catheter access sometimes called cvc central venous catheter consists plastic catheter two lumens occasionally two separate catheters inserted large vein usually vena cava via internal jugular vein femoral vein allow large flows blood withdrawn one lumen enter dialysis circuit returned via lumen however blood flow almost always less well functioning fistula graft catheters usually found two general varieties tunnelled nontunnelled catheter access shortterm access days often one dialysis session catheter emerges skin site entry vein tunnelled catheter access involves longer catheter tunnelled skin point insertion vein exit site distance away usually placed internal jugular vein neck exit site usually chest wall tunnel acts barrier invading microbes tunnelled catheters designed short mediumterm access weeks months infection still frequent problem aside infection venous stenosis another serious problem catheter access catheter foreign body vein often provokes inflammatory reaction vein wall results scarring narrowing vein often point occlusion cause problems severe venous congestion area drained vein may also render vein veins drained useless creating fistula graft later date patients longterm hemodialysis literally run access fatal problem catheter access usually used rapid access immediate dialysis tunnelled access patients deemed likely recover acute kidney injury patients endstage kidney failure either waiting alternative access mature unable alternative access catheter access often popular patients attachment dialysis machine doesnt require needles however serious risks catheter access noted mean access contemplated longterm solution desperate access situation av arteriovenous fistulas recognized preferred access method create fistula vascular surgeon joins artery vein together anastomosis since bypasses capillaries blood flows rapidly fistula one feel placing ones finger mature fistula called feeling thrill produces distinct buzzing feeling fistula one also listen stethoscope sound blood whooshing fistula sound called bruit fistulas usually created nondominant arm may situated hand snuffbox fistula forearm usually radiocephalic fistula socalled bresciacimino fistula radial artery anastomosed cephalic vein elbow usually brachiocephalic fistula brachial artery anastomosed cephalic vein though less common fistulas also created groin though creation process differs placement groin usually done options arm hands available due anatomy failure fistulas previously created armshands fistula take number weeks mature average perhaps weeks treatment two needles inserted vein one draw blood one return orientation needles takes normal flow blood account arterial needle draws blood upstream location venous needle returns blood downstream sequence prevents partial recycling blood dialysis machine would lead less effective treatment advantages av fistula use lower infection rates foreign material involved formation higher blood flow rates translates effective dialysis lower incidence thrombosis complications fewer access methods fistula high blood flow vasculature supplies rest limb poor steal syndrome occur blood entering limb drawn fistula returned general circulation without entering limbs capillaries results cold extremities limb cramping pains severe tissue damage one longterm complication av fistula development aneurysm bulging wall vein weakened repeated insertion needles time large extent risk developing aneurysm reduced carefully rotating needle sites entire fistula using buttonhole constant site technique aneurysms may necessitate corrective surgery may shorten useful life fistula fistulas also become blocked due blood clotting infected sterile precautions followed needle insertion start dialysis high volume blood flowing fistula excessive bleeding also occur common soon dialysis treatment pressure must applied needle holes induce clotting pressure removed prematurely patient engages physical activity soon dialysis needle holes open prevent damage fistula aneurysm pseudoaneurysm formation recommended needle inserted different points rotating fashion another approach cannulate fistula blunted needle exactly place called buttonhole approach often two three buttonhole places available given fistula also prolong fistula life help prevent damage fistula recent study published american journal pathology provides information mechanisms underlying failure common type hemodialysis vascular access arteriovenous fistula spite av fistula one preferred methods vascular access researchers observed newly created fistulas never become usable dialysis fail mature meaning vessels enlarge enough support dialysis blood circuit study suggests impairment responsiveness nitric oxide occurs patients endstage renal disease may result hyperplasia excessive growth innermost layer blood vessels reduced ability vessels dilate either abnormality limit maturation viability arteriovenous fistula research raises possibility therapeutic restoration nitric oxide responsiveness manipulation local mediators may prevent fistula maturation failure patients potentially contribute ability remain av arteriovenous grafts much like fistulas respects except artificial vessel used join artery vein graft usually made synthetic material often ptfe sometimes chemically treated sterilized veins animals used grafts inserted patients native vasculature permit fistula mature faster fistulas may ready use several weeks formation newer grafts may used even sooner however av grafts high risk develop narrowing especially vein downstream graft sewn vein narrowing often leads thrombosis clotting foreign material greater risk becoming infected options sites place graft available graft made quite long thus graft placed thigh even neck necklace graft av fistulas much better access patency survival venous catheters grafts also produce better patient survival far fewer complications compared grafts venous catheters reason centers medicare medicaid cms set fistula first whose goal increase use av fistulas dialysis patients initiative many successes fistula always superior strategy comes ongoing research make bioengineered blood vessels may immense importance creating av fistulas patients hemodialysis good blood vessels creation one involves growing cells produce collagen proteins biodegradable micromesh tube followed removal cells make blood vessels storable httpsenwikipediaorgwikivascularaccess
