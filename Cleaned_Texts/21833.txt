reopening straits refilling mediterranean beginning pliocene around million years ago isolated animal populations islands changes morphology myotragus developed course evolution probably driven resource limitation relatively resource poor balearics lack competitors leading increased intraspecific competition absence effective predators meaning population would periodically outstrip carrying capacity islands resulting denudation vegetation consequently mass small proportion population surviving starvation episode leading strong selection myotragus initially colonized island mallorca
