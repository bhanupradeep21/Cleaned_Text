literature john higgins one oldest known bedpans display science museum london green glazed earthenware bedpan dated century time bedpans made materials including pewter brass pottery glass bedpans commonplace item hospitals late florence nightingale worked nurse united kingdom mid late diagramed death rates causes soldiers military hospitals crimean war correlated corresponding sanitization procedures result nightingale proposed several methods improve sanitary conditions military civilian hospitals including addition bedpans order reduce infection exposure urine century bedpans made ceramic enamel stainless steel bedpan materials expanded include plastics disposable initial bedpan patent created united states today bedpans made stainless steel plastic disposable materials stainless steel durable easy clean may cold hard andor uncomfortable use since disposable bedpans singleuse bedpan liners made either recycled wood pulp biodegradable plastics become first patent disposable bedpan liners patented united states june relied mainly wood pulp products primary particular introduction implementation health technical memorandum united kingdom renamed health technical memorandum became mandatory sterilize hospital equipment using autoclave also known steam sterilizer jumpstarted switch stainless steel bedpans pulpmade bedpans within united kingdom mainly overall cost using macerator outweighed cost disposing pulp materials furthermore european union pulp products recently reclassified medical devices beginning means products must meet certain requirements regulations ensure safety efficacy medical use categorizing pulp products medical devices european union recognizes importance healthcare settings due crucial role maintaining hygiene preventing infection spread utilizing disposable bedpans prevent spread infectious diseases lowering risk contamination handling disposal bedpans used toileting confined beds may used hospital nursing facility home many reasons someone may confined bed necessitating use bedpans include permanent longterm disease states limited mobility alzheimers disease parkinsons disease stroke dementia additionally individuals may confined bed temporarily result shortterm illness injury current nursing guidance suggests bedpans indicated immobile patients following concerns fractures hip lower extremities profound fatigue major surgeries high fall risk increased injury potential downsides using bedpans include risk pressure ulcers lack privacy potential spread infection pressure ulcers caused prolonged use supporting areas bedpan small order reduce risk ergonomic bedpans developed support person larger area lessconductive plastic also designs completely cover genitalia use offering protection providing extra measure privacy ergonomic designs require material difficult sterilize may become reservoir microorganisms improvements cleaning sterilization combat managing proper hygiene cleaning bedpans bedridden individuals important reduce risk infection used bedpans contain bodily fluids waste either reused disinfection disposed sterilization disinfection procedures medical devices established based device category three categories medical device types generally agreed upon international governing bodies including center disease control prevention cdc food drug administration fda european centre disease prevention control ecdc categories critical use semicritical use noncritical use bedpans considered noncritical use meaning recommendation cleaning low intermediate level shared equipment cdc recommends cleaning disinfecting use compatible disinfectants available guidance use washerdisinfector boiling dedicated equipment cleaning disinfectant similar additional note accommodate sanitization based risk level example caregivers wear gloves emptying bedpans chemotherapy order avoid exposure using stainless steel plastic reusable bedpans poses risk spreading infection caregivers compared metals like copper steel inherent ability disinfect copper antimicrobial indications dating back century copper workers appeared immune cholera outbreaks used copper treat infections infectious variety alternative disposal methods ensure infection spread control bedpan washer disinfector machines disposable bedpans washer disinfectors utilized recently cleaning reusable bedpans rather disinfectants especially due risk crosscontamination viruses ebola washer disinfectors instruments used disinfect used bedpans high temperatures least disinfector machines shown efficacious common bacterial infections c difficile spores e coli following instructions alternative disposable bedpan waste proven trial commercially available washer disinfectors evaluated efficacy thermal disinfections c difficile spores colonies e coli one cycle washer bedpan devices observed efficacy disinfection c diff e coli using swabs devices shortly cycle microorganisms eluted logkill calculated process showed evidence washer disinfector highly efficacious c diff spores e coli colonies however important note countries technology may use methods disinfecting reusable bedpans opt disposable bedpans reusable bedpans used multiple times disinfecting procedure carried hospital staff whereas disposable bedpans used discarded right use bedpan use varies significantly among countries based social cultural norms resources available infection control recent study estimated percent worlds population lacks adequate sanitary toilet lack access basic sanitation far reaching effects leading spread diseases reducing overall quality correlation amount bedpan usage whether multiuse singleuse well cleaned countries denmark france germany hong kong indonesia mongolia norway

benefits catheters common complication longterm catheter use asymptomatic bacteriuria portable urinals urinal bottles common instruments used bedridden also en routeclarification needed get rid liquid waste use portable urinals long history dating way back french renaissance century surgeons developed urinals manage male urinary female urinals exist however may less easy use compared male urinals since require wider opening lead spillage especially bedridden individuals bedpan may better mobile shower commodes types sturdy portable toilets used outside bed individuals spinal cord injuries shower commodes common part assistive technology help bowel movements bathing routines concerns shower commodes include long frequent usage associated skin breakdown development pressure ulcers additional studies need conducted address safety old age multiple comorbidities increase risk adults developing urinary incontinence absorbent products designed specifically absorb contain urine even
