epsilon cells εcells one five types endocrine cells found regions pancreas called islets epsilon cells produce hormone ghrelin induces hunger first discovered mice humans cells compose less islet cells connected tight junctions allow impermeability watersoluble researchers investigating pancreatic islets mice compared normal mice pancreatic tissue development knockout found normal mouse pancreas includes population ghrelinproducing cells investigation took place thought genes promote cell differentiation βcells absence instead form εcells later confirmed findings absence genes βcells fail form replaced εcells overall findings population ghrelinproducing εcells mouse pancreas knockout insulinproducing βcells leads enormous amount εcells cells round oval shape usually perimeter islets sometimes cytoplasmic εcells also proposed similar cell lineage αcells βcells found closely related αcells εcells found pancreas xenopus frogs cat fish zebrafish among animals suggests islet
