psychology selfefficacy individuals belief capacity act ways necessary reach specific concept originally proposed psychologist albert bandura selfefficacy affects every area human endeavor determining beliefs person holds regarding power affect situations selfefficacy strongly influences power person actually face challenges competently choices person likely make effects particularly apparent compelling regard investment behaviors strong sense selfefficacy promotes human accomplishment personal wellbeing person high selfefficacy views challenges things supposed mastered rather threats avoid people able recover failure faster likely attribute failure lack effort approach threatening situations belief control things linked lower levels stress lower vulnerability contrast people low sense selfefficacy view difficult tasks personal threats shy away difficult tasks lead look skills lack rather ones easy lose faith abilities failure low selfefficacy linked higher levels stress psychologist albert bandura defined selfefficacy ones belief ones ability succeed specific situations accomplish task ones sense selfefficacy play major role one approaches goals tasks theory selfefficacy lies center banduras social cognitive theory emphasizes role observational learning social experience development personality main concept social cognitive theory individuals actions reactions including social behaviors cognitive processes almost every situation influenced actions individual observed others selfefficacy developed external experiences selfperception influential determining outcome many events important aspect social cognitive theory selfefficacy represents personal perception external social according banduras theory people high believe perform likely view difficult tasks something mastered rather something avoided social learning theory describes acquisition skills developed exclusively primarily within social group social learning depends individuals either succeed fail dynamic interactions within groups promotes development individual emotional practical skills well accurate perception self acceptance others according theory people learn one another observation imitation modeling selfefficacy reflects individuals understanding skills heshe offer group selfconcept theory seeks explain people perceive interpret existence clues receive external sources focusing impressions organized active throughout life successes failures closely related ways people learned view relationships others theory describes selfconcept learned ie present birth organized way applied self dynamic ie everchanging fixed certain attribution theory focuses people attribute events beliefs interact selfperception attribution theory defines three major elements cause according bandura effective way build selfefficacy engage mastery mastery experiences defined personal experience achieving difficult goals face adversity helps build confidence strengthen another source selfefficacy vicarious experiences social models seeing someone view similar succeed something difficult motivate believe skills necessary achieve similar goal however inverse previous statement true well seeing someone fail task lead doubt personal skills abilities greater assumed similarity persuasive models successes third source selfefficacy found strengthening belief one ability succeed positively persuaded ability complete given task show greater sustained effort complete task also lowers effect selfdoubt person however important remember encouraging put person situation success often likely attained put situation prematurely hope success undermine persons emotional physiological state also influence individuals belief ability perform given judging capabilities people often take information body person interprets information impacts selfefficacy example activities require physical strength someone may take fatigue pain indicator inability people generally avoid tasks selfefficacy low undertake tasks selfefficacy high selfefficacy significantly beyond actual ability leads overestimation ability complete tasks hand selfefficacy significantly lower actual ability discourages growth skill development research shows optimum level selfefficacy slightly ability situation people encouraged tackle challenging tasks gain selfefficacy made dimensions like magnitude strength generality explain one believes perform specific high selfefficacy affect motivation positive negative ways general people high selfefficacy likely make efforts complete task persist longer efforts low stronger selfefficacy mastery expectations active negative effect low selfefficacy lead state learned helplessness learned helplessness studied martin seligman

weaker controlled laboratory settings implications research managers provide accurate descriptions tasks provide clear concise instructions moreover provide necessary supporting elements including

difference selfefficacy correlates fundamentally different world people high selfefficacy generally believe control lives actions decisions shape lives people low selfefficacy may see lives outside control example student high selfefficacy poorly exam likely attribute failure fact study enough however student low selfefficacy poorly exam likely believe cause failure due test difficult
