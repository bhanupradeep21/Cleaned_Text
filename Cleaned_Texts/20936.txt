prosimians contrast exaggerated swellings larger size prevalence mainly restricted old world primate instance occur species cercocebus mandrillus theropithecus papio pan macaques colobines researchers attempted determine characteristics primate species displaying exaggerated swellings identified species exhibit exaggerated sexual swellings predominantly live multimale social systems large social groups multiple adults sexes well species swellings twice many males per group without furthermore whilst old world primate species living multimale groups show exaggerated swellings females living within singlemale groups instances however sexual swellings seen primate societies alternative mating systems example female langur monkeys exhibit swellings live within polygamous singlemale primates exaggerated sexual swellings also demonstrate nonseasonal breeding patterns longer mating periods longer ovulation specifically species nonseasonal breeders live multimale societies sexual nonetheless nonseasonal reproductive environments necessary precursor selection sexual swellings indeed females seasonal breeders female barbary macaques also exhibit exaggerated sexual exaggerated sexual swellings also increase gradually size throughout females cycle beginning example research baboons showed days gradual increase swellings peaked days cyclic changes appearance sexual skin reflect changes ovarian hormones estrogen progestogen female menstrual specifically increase sexual swelling size follicular phase correlated increased estrogen levels decrease swelling size luteal phase associated rising progesterone shown ovariectomized chimpanzees swelling induced estrogen inhibited result peak size swellings often coincides highest potential ovulation although perfect example research west african chimpanzees showed higher probabilities ovulation tended occur within days onset maximum swelling sexual additionally study wild whitehanded gibbons showed maximum swelling size ovulation overlapped closely menstrual size sexual swellings varies within cycle also across female cycles across species specifically maximal swelling size increases cycle cycle individual female chimpanzees additionally duration maximal sexual swellings size varies considerably species baboons instance maximal swelling lasting approximately days whilst duration maximal swelling days like size firmness also varies considerably across cycle instance chimpanzees state maximum firmness correlates period maximum male primates highly attracted females sexual swellings largest demonstrate preferential mating periods maximal males tend compete females whose swellings maximum competition peaks males attempting mate females largest swellings receive increased levels aggression males

though provide indications female fertility using swellings determine level investment effort courting male baboons mating effort determined size females swellings turn impacts levels malemale aggression competition fighting behaviours well much time invested grooming courting peak swelling also correlates higher levels mate guarding behaviour males preferring guard females whose swellings

food difference travelling costs parous nulliparous assumption females require certain number copulations conceive would suggest may achieve number faster either high number ovulatory cycles appearing attractive males around time ovulation larger however obvious ovulation leads male coercion may negative consequences undesired consortship lowranking male injury forcible therefore females accept high level coercion scramble competition community high coercion allow reach required number copulations short example eastern chimpanzees previously produced offspring tend experience high withingroup scramble driven towards fewer ovulatory cycles result need mate high number males ovulatory period therefore need appear attractive periods develop larger sexual although wranghams model justified much support hypothesis deschner boesch investigated hypothesis directly observing species found unable support results proposed social passport hypothesis female chimpanzees first sexual swelling occurs near time first begin explore different potentially dangerous period prior females permanent emigration away native social based observation sexual swellings believed act social passport advertises sexual receptivity transitional period hypothesis proposes swelling transforms potential aggression males new social group may show female sexual thought gain female acceptance males living within new social turn male acceptance reduces likelihood female attacked males increases likelihood males protect hostile resident females social passport hypothesis sexual swellings therefore allow relatively safe passage different communities allowing adolescent females investigate local competitors resources different territories deciding resettle breed hypothesis young females safely integrated within new community still benefit sexual swellings specifically young females believed require support males acquired integrating new group conflicts females higher social rank protecting infants fights children higherranking therefore sexual swellings act social passport eases femalefemale investigation social passport hypothesis yielded contradictory results observations common chimpanzees pan troglodytes tai forest instance led discovery sterile adolescent females subordinate mothers exhibit swellings upon emigration new communities suggesting swellings indeed function eliminate social stress could directed emigration however research olive colobus monkeys procolobus verus residing region showed females emigrate without displaying sexual basis evidence suggested social passport hypothesis appropriate explanation function sexual swellings species male services hypothesis proposes sexual swellings lead direct benefits female encouraging dominant males engage consortship behaviours ie forming swellings elicit mate guarding behaviours males want increase chances siring swollen females offspring resulting dominant males acting like bodyguards reduce prevent harassment males social females may also benefit dominant males may later protect resulting offspring reducing threat infanticide observed male primates attempt monopolise gain exclusive sexual access female early duration sexual swellings ensure sexual access maximum swelling likely though males situations guarding females gains ie ensure able sire females offspring observed rhesus macaque macaca mulatta females also benefit consortships harassed less subordinate males dominant male services hypothesis praised ability account evidence swellings always precisely indicate

assessment whether achieved obviousovulation explanation sexual swellings consistent observation ovulation often coincides maximum support males use swellings way set hypothesis assess timing ovulation comes observations wild longtailed macaques macaca fascicularis males aroused find females attractive peak others critical hypothesis however according stallman froehlichs assessment hypothesis predicts monandry ie females one mating partner runs counter observations species barbary macaques macaca sylvanus exaggerated sexual swellings yet seen promiscuous polyandrous ie mating multiple males mating bestmale hypothesis sexual one longest standing explanations function sexual swellings hypothesis proposes sexual swellings incite competition males access female indicating

swelling attracts competing males results benefit increased viability support hypothesis argues accounts correlates characteristics sexual swellings proximity peak swelling ovulation increased malemale competition females peak bestmale hypothesis criticised however inability account exaggerated nature specifically pagel argued smaller swellings would sufficient incite competition males since behaviour calculated evolutionarily stable others criticised assumption male successful competition swollen females ie dominant would also females choice partner observed females choose mate subordinate according hrdys many males hypothesis sexual swellings enable female attract multiple different males mating partners attributed males instinctive attraction mating several males across menstrual cycle manner female increase males parental parental uncertainty describes eventuality males uncertain whether offspring female mated genetically uncertainty two contrasting outcomes may increase total amount parental care offspring receives whilst also reducing possibility females offspring suffers example discovered male captive ruffled lemurs varecia variegata less likely kill infants believed sired supporting hrdys second proposition successfully ensure paternal confusion hrdy predicted ovulation must randomly distributed across term sexual swelling maximum would ensure males unable use swelling signal female fertility one example stems research sooty mangabey cercocebus atys females species found produce sexual swellings fertile additionally sexual swellings

indicate fertile period males species larger swelling suggests ovulation likely thus indicating phase female fertile intersexual conflict considered within hypothesis key factor development exaggerated sexual male reproductive strategies coercion including infanticide prolonged may costly females necessary females resist developing features counterstrategies protect whilst still allowing successful explained combination number previously mentioned hypotheses notably obviousovulation bestmale many terms obviousovulation swelling perineal skin likened distribution curve would represent

females still continue mate lowerranking males probability ovulation high conception still serves confuse paternity offspring amongst linking manymales also resulting reduced infanticide males within therefore protective role swellings male coercion serve ways manipulate male behaviour benefiting female enhancing females chances successful one recent hypotheses gradedsignals hypothesis still limited research supporting evolutionary function sexual swellings however growing literature base supportive hypothesis sole reason behind evolution swellings perhaps conjunction reliable indicator

indicator quality must fulfil two criteria trait costly mating effort costly males regards sexual swellings ring true terms costliness swellings affect females weight centre affecting ease skin increases vulnerability predators due conspicuousness well additionally increased attention males also puts females risk injury male terms cost males mate guarding found significantly reduce foraging

male fights baboons potentially although pagel performed field experiment found support predictions hypothesis observation olive baboons papio methodology since subsequent research failed find empirical evidence sexual swellings reliably indicate female quality species eg barbary example one main predictions higher quality therefore fertile females consistently display largest however largest swellings often occur least fertile females least likely raise surviving never borne several ovulation cycles without despite lack empirical evidence hypothesis sole evolutionary function exaggerated sexual swelling suggested reliable indicator hypothesis may work together gradedsignals suggestion based evidence swelling size advertises level fertility therefore reproductive quality
