long extended far front humerus relatively short claws hand high bases suddenly narrowed transversely middle zygapophyses middle tail juravenator originally classified member compsognathidae making close relative compsognathus preserved evidence scales tail one specimen also sinosauropteryx sinocalliopteryx fossil evidence downy featherlike however patch fossilized juravenator skin tail eighth twentysecond vertebra lower hind leg shows primarily normal dinosaur scales well traces may simple paleontologist xu xing comments find journal nature initially suggested presence scales tail juravenator could mean feather coat early feathered dinosaurs variable seen modern birds xu also questioned interpretation juravenator compsognathid suggesting extensive scaly hide could primitive trait xu considered likely juravenator primitive feathered dinosaurs simply possessed extensive scales bodies modern birds retain scales feet lower xus interpretation supported study juravenator fossil first followup study initial description reported faint impressions filamentous structures possibly primitive feathers present along top tail indepth study published included examination specimen ultraviolet light helmut tischlinger examination uv revealed extensive covering filamentlike structures similar anatomy primitive feathers compsognathids including sinosauropteryx

complete specimen nonavian theropod ever found first classified member compsognathidae subsequent studies found problems initial study produced findings rather grouping sinosauropteryx compsognathids butler et al found compsognathid rather basal member group studies conflict whether compsognathids belong later group primitive additional work published luis chiappe ursula göhlich found juravenator similar anatomy compsognathus probably belong compsognathidae actually natural group also suggested compsognathids including juravenator may form grade primitive coelurosaurs rather monophyletic cristiano dal sasso simone maganuco published analysis recovered compsognathidae natural group juravenator belonging sister species however large analysis coelurosaurs published found juravenator coelurosaur closely related member compsognathidae instead recovered close relative ornitholestes outside clade foth et al considered plausible juravenator may noncoelurosaurian tetanuran potentially

structures preserved sides tail interpreted integumentary sense organs like scales crocodiles identification correct would first sensory organs found skin dinosaur juravenator may used detect movement aquatic prey fish waded reisdorf wuttke provided extensive discussion taphonomy juravenator specimen ie events lead death transportation fossilization specimen deposited within lagoon must transported possibly nearby islands possible flash flood swept animal sea case likely died drowning also possible animal swam drifted onto sea rafted plants transported surface currents place burial rafting hypothesis supported tree trunks found schamhaupten locality specimen would arrived sea floor within hours death otherwise gases forming body cavity would prevented sinking one piece water depth burial site would large enough prevent refloating carcass gases specimen found almost full articulation bones still connected together skull pelvic girdle front section tail disarticulated degree skeleton nearly complete missing parts tail likely lost excavation discussion revolved around original orientation fossil within rock slab prepared top bottom site whether individual lay back belly chiappe göhlich description assumed lay interpretation supported aptychus body part ammonite found within slab aptychi almost always embedded concave sides pointing upwards however original excavator later confirmed specimen bottom site slab therefore lay reisdorf wuttke discovered small rounded stones within belly area interpreted ooids ooids formed shallow water likely transported individual place burial authors speculate juravenator might lived shores ooids might swallowed also possible individual drowned shallow water inhaling ooids suspended chiappe göhlich identified fossils isopods found specimen concluded animals likely scavenged carcass still reisdorf wuttke stated isopods could alternatively parasitising living cadaver arrived seafloor head came rest right side tail bent left seafloor devoid life except covering microbial mats preventing disruption scavengers contrast many specimens solnhofen archipelago including compsognathus juravenator specimen found typical death pose neck tail curved torso reisdorf wuttke concluded death poses resulted release elastic ligaments decay spanned vertebral column juravenator specimen show pose lying back preventing spine
