human sexual response cycle fourstage model physiological responses sexual order occurrence excitement plateau orgasmic resolution phases physiological response model first formulated william h masters virginia e johnson book human sexual since time models regarding human sexual response formulated several scholars criticized certain inaccuracies human sexual response cycle model excitement phase also known arousal phase initial excitement phase first stage human sexual response cycle occurs result physical mental erotic stimuli kissing making fantasizing viewing erotic images leads sexual arousal stage body prepares sexual intercourse initially leading plateau wide sociocultural variation regarding preferences length foreplay stimulation methods physical emotional interaction stimulation erogenous zones foreplay usually establishes least initial arousalcitation needed among sexes excitement phase results increase heart rate breathing rate rise blood survey found sexual arousal young females young males arises enhanced direct stimulation nipples reporting decreased vasocongestion skin commonly referred sex flush occur approximately females males sex flush tends occur often warmer conditions may appear cooler temperatures female sex flush pinkish spots develop breasts spread breasts torso face hands soles feet possibly entire vasocongestion also responsible darkening clitoris walls vagina sexual arousal male sex flush coloration skin develops less consistently female typically starts epigastrium upper abdomen spreads across chest continues neck face forehead back sometimes shoulders forearms sex flush typically disappears soon orgasm occurs may take two hours sometimes intense sweating occur simultaneously flush usually diminishes reverse order increase muscle tone myotonia certain muscle groups occurring voluntarily involuntarily begins phase among needed also external anal sphincter may contract randomly upon contact later orgasm without contact males beginning excitement phase observed penis becomes partially fully erect often seconds erotic erection may partially lost regained repeatedly extended excitement phase testicles become drawn upward toward perineum notably circumcised males less skin available accommodate erection also scrotum tense thicken erection process females excitement phase last several minutes several hours onset vasocongestion results swelling womans clitoris labia minora vagina muscle surrounds vaginal opening grows tighter uterus elevates grows size vaginal walls begin produce lubricating organic meanwhile breasts increase slightly size nipples become hardened erect plateau phase period sexual excitement prior orgasm phase characterised increased circulation heart rate sexes increased sexual pleasure increased stimulation increased muscle tension also respiration continues elevated prolonged time plateau phase without progression orgasmic phase may result sexual frustration phase male urethral sphincter contracts prevent urine mixing semen guard retrograde ejaculation muscles base penis begin steady rhythmic males may start secrete seminal fluid preejaculatory fluid testicles rise closer plateau stage females basically continuation changes evident excitement stage clitoris becomes extremely sensitive withdraws slightly bartholin glands produce lubrication tissues outer third vagina swell pubococcygeus muscle tightens reducing diameter opening masters johnson refer changes take place plateau stage orgasmic platform orgasm experienced males females ending plateau phase sexual response cycle orgasm accompanied quick cycles muscle contraction lower pelvic muscles surround anus primary sexual organsclarification needed orgasms often associated involuntary actions including vocalizations muscular spasms areas body generally euphoric sensation heart rate increased even tantric sex practices may seek diminish goal achieving orgasm frequently common goal sexual intercourse males orgasm usually associated ejaculation ejection accompanied continuous pulses sexual pleasure especially penis surrounding sensations may felt strongly among lower spine lower back first second convulsions usually intense sensation produce greatest quantity semen thereafter contraction associated diminishing volume semen milder sensation women also experience uterine vaginal contractions orgasms females vary widely individual individual commonly associated increase vaginal lubrication tightening vaginal walls overall women also possibility female ejaculation also called squirting resolution phase occurs orgasm allows muscles relax blood pressure drop body slow excited refractory period part resolution phase time frame usually man unable orgasm though women also experience refractory period masters johnson described twostage detumescence penis first stage penis decreases erect state percent larger flaccid state occurs refractory period second stage refractory period finished penis decreases size returns generally impossible men achieve orgasm refractory masters johnson argue period must end men become aroused although due refractory period rare men achieve multiple men reported multiple consecutive orgasms particularly without multiple orgasms commonly reported young men older younger men refractory period may last minutes last hour older according masters johnson women ability orgasm quickly long effective stimulation result able multiple orgasms relatively short period though generally reported women experience refractory period thus experience additional orgasm multiple orgasms soon sources state men women experience refractory period women may also experience period orgasm sexual stimulation produce women clitoris sensitive climax making additional stimulation initially initial orgasm subsequent orgasms women may also stronger pleasurable stimulation masters johnson argue despite minor differences sexual responses men women fundamentally however researchers argued many differences men women terms response first masters johnson put forth one model men three different models women stated mens sexual response differs terms duration showing different models would thus repetitive women hand state responses differ intensity variations pose problems psychologists argued everyone fits model example women orgasm penetrative sexual masters johnson also equate mans erection womans vaginal lubrication excitement phase roy levin states observation false womans clitoris anatomical parallel mans penis result clitoral swelling would equivalent mans another aspect lack concordance subjective sexual arousal genital arousal research meredith l chivers j michael bailey indicates men tend show categoryspecific arousal sexually aroused preferred gender however women show category nonspecificity genitals show arousal preferred nonpreferred even though women reported subjectively aroused example man woman engaging sexual activity genitals also show sexual arousal two men engaging sexual activity two women even nonhuman animals overall masters johnsons model appears better example mens sexual response much research conducted based masters johnsons model however inaccuracies found descriptions stages sexual response example roy levin identified areas model touched first masters johnson state vagina lubricated arousal stage levin argues labia produce lubricant levin also presents research shows first signs physiological arousal women increased blood flow vagina lubrication also dispels information men sexual response masters johnson report pleasure positively associated volume ejaculate released rosenberg hazzard tallman ohl gave group men questionnaire found significantly men reported physical pleasure associated strength ejaculation compared moreover researchers found men multiple orgasms despite masters johnson researchers also criticized masters johnson define sexual response solely terms physiology example everaerd laan found sexual arousal defined emotional state men researchers stated lack concordance womens subjective sexual arousal genital rosemary basson argues model poorly explains womens sexual response especially longterm shortly masters johnson published book several scholars criticized model human sexual response cycle example helen singer kaplan argued masters johnson evaluated sexual response physiological perspective psychological emotional cognitive factors need taken consideration result proposed model sexual response cycle includes three phases desire excitement orgasm argues three phases interconnected yet different neurophysiological similarly paul robinson argued excitement plateau phases criticizes masters johnsons work clearly distinguishing excitement phase ends plateau phase another model put forth incentivemotivation model model explains desire sex comes interaction sensitive sexual response system stimuli present environment researchers argue model supports idea sexual desire spontaneous furthermore model implies case one sex one feels sexual desire rather case one feels sexual desire one rosemary basson proposed alternative model sexual response argues linear model good explaining mens sexual response poorly explains womens sexual responses thus puts forth circular states closeness attachment partner increases effectiveness sexual stimulation leads enhanced sexual arousal may ultimately result orgasm consequently positive sexual arousal continues sexual desire women feel desire increases intimacy researchers attempted evaluate womens sexual functioning terms new model found contradictory results one study conducted giles mccabe found linear model sexual response good predictor womens sexual functioning dysfunction circular model poor modified pathways model circular model became good predictor sexual another study looking malaysian women researchers found circular model actually good predictor womens sexual desire research needs done area show whether circular model accurately describes womens sexual response human sexual response cycle set foundation studying categorizing sexual dysfunctions men four main categories sexual dysfunctions desire disorders arousal disorders orgasm disorders sexual pain disorders still categorized dsmivtr recent research however suggests current model sexual response needs revised better treat dysfunctions one reason considerable overlap sexual dysfunctions one study found patients hypoactive sexual desire disorder hsdd women least one sexual dysfunction diagnoses three categories desire arousal orgasm another issue among women discrepancy desire arousal cynthia graham critically evaluated female sexual arousal disorder fsad found women reported contrary masters johnsons model sexual arousal sometimes preceded sexual desire times desire presented high comorbidity rates hsdd fsad would like merge make category sexual interestarousal disorder hartmann colleagues summarize views current model sexual response cycle conclude simply expanding continuing dsmiv criteria traditional response cycle classification systems impossible come diagnostic categories subtypes adequately reflect reallife female sexual httpsenwikipediaorgwikihumansexualresponsecycle
