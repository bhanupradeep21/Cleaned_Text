humans circulatory system different birth fetal circulation composed placenta umbilical blood vessels encapsulated umbilical cord heart systemic blood vessels major difference fetal circulation postnatal circulation lungs used fetal stage resulting presence shunts move oxygenated blood nutrients placenta fetal tissue birth start breathing severance umbilical cord prompt various changes quickly transform fetal circulation postnatal placenta functions exchange site nutrients wastes maternal fetal water glucose amino acids vitamins inorganic salts freely diffuse across placenta along oxygen two umbilical arteries carry deoxygenated blood waste fetus placenta waste exchanged oxygen nutrients oxygenated blood return fetus placenta via umbilical vein hemoglobin structure found within red blood cells binds carries oxygen fetal hemoglobin enhances fetus ability draw oxygen placenta facilitated hemoglobin molecule made two alpha two gamma chains oxygenhemoglobin dissociation curve shifted left meaning able absorb oxygen lower concentrations adult hemoglobin enables fetal hemoglobin absorb oxygen adult hemoglobin placenta oxygen pressure lower lungs around months age birth gamma chains gradually replaced beta chains new hemoglobin structure known hemoglobin composed two alpha two beta chains hemoglobin predominant form found adults oxygenated blood placenta carried fetus umbilical vein drain inferior vena cava ivc ductus venosus oxygenated blood enters ivc moves parallel deoxygenated blood fetal systemic veins establishing bilaminar blood flow enters right fetal heart contains two upper atria two lower ventricles also contains two additional structures foramen ovale ductus arteriosus function shunts oxygenated function shunts bypass lungs maintain proper circulation important fetal tissue fetal stage lungs fill fluid collapse fetus within amniotic sac placenta providing oxygen needs grow lung collapsed pulmonary vascular resistance remains high fetal stage prevent blood flow oxygenated blood arrives right atrium eustachian valve helps direct oxygenated blood foramen ovale opening right left atrium blood flows left atrium move mitral valve left ventricle pumped aorta body shunting oxygenated blood right left atrium supply blood high oxygen nutrient content upper extremities includes critical organ brain blood moves aorta internal iliac arteries umbilical arteries reenters placenta carbon dioxide waste products fetus taken enter maternal blood entering right atrium pass directly left atrium foramen ovale enters right ventricle blood consists oxygenated placental blood deoxygenated blood returning fetal blood pumped pulmonary artery pulmonary artery met high pulmonary vascular resistance result collapsed lungs pulmonary capillaries fetus special connection pulmonary artery aorta called ductus aorta lower pressure pulmonary artery blood flows across ductus arteriosus away blood goes ductus arteriosus mixes blood aorta results mixed blood oxygen saturation supplies structures lower half fetal umbilical vessels obliterated infant starts breathing birth source oxygen changes placenta lungs major trigger facilitate transformation fetal postnatal circulation many ways first ductus venosus previously kept open blood flow umbilical vein reduced blood flow umbilical vein birth collapse close ductus venosus hence ivc carry deoxygenated blood infant organs lower extremities second infant breathes lungs expand fill alveoli oxygen increased oxygen content dilate pulmonary capillaries also trigger release nitric oxide dilates blood vessels within lungs together forces decrease pulmonary vascular decreased resistance lungs increased blood flow lungs right ventricle heart pulmonary arteries establishing newborn pulmonary circulation newborn breaths blood perfuses pulmonary capillary beds undergoes oxygenation exiting lungs via pulmonary veins returning heart thus blood flows pulmonary circulation higher volume blood returning left atrium lungs increased venous return elevate pressure left atrium exceeds pressure right atrium difference pressure two chambers heart close foramen ovale lastly due decreased pulmonary vascular resistance pressure pulmonary artery fall lower pressure aorta since blood flows high low pressure systems direction blood flow across ductus arteriosus reverses oxygenrich blood aorta flows across ductus arteriosus pulmonary artery ductus arteriosus constrict response high oxygen content blood oxygen serves vasoconstrictor ductus arteriosus prostaglandins keep ductus arteriosus open maintain blood flow lower extremities cases hypoplastic left heart syndrome mitral valve shut removal placenta source prostaglandin another mechanism ductus arteriosus closes within next weeks constriction results decreased blood flow structure induces death tissue keep structure permanently result changes postnatal circulation direct deoxygenated blood inferior superior vena cava right heart blood flow lungs via pulmonary circulation blood oxygenated lungs return left heart pump oxygenrich blood aorta supply rest body via systemic circulation certain cases transition fetal postnatal circulation may occur described due complications leading persistently high pulmonary vascular resistance preterm infants born without fully mature lungs lacking compound called surfactant allows alveoli remain open overcoming surface tension resulting difficulty lung expansion prevents necessary reduction pulmonary vascular resistance infant make normal cardiopulmonary transition resulting infant respiratory distress addition occasionally birth infants may inhale remnants fecal matter known meconium preventing adequate presence meconium within lungs known meconium aspiration syndrome obstruct airways also deactivate newborn surfactant inflammation also results inhalation meconium also causes airway constriction resulting poor ventilation alveoli inadequate oxygenation pulmonary capillary lack oxygen entering lungs pulmonary vascular resistance remain high newborns blood longer oxygenated preventing fetal shunt closure cases infant respiratory distress syndrome meconium aspiration syndrome fetal shunts remain open due high pulmonary vascular resistance appropriate measures administration surfactant mechanical ventilation taken help infant breathe problem corrected infant undergo hypoxia acidosis serious complications seizures remnants fetal circulation found core concept behind fetal circulation fetal hemoglobin higher affinity oxygen adult hemoglobin together difference partial pressure oxygen allows diffusion oxygen mothers circulatory system fetus fetal heart mothers heart builds fetal blood pressure drive blood fetal
