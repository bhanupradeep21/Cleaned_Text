oprelvekin recombinant interleukin eleven thrombopoietic growth factor directly stimulates proliferation hematopoietic stem cells megakaryocyte progenitor cells induces megakaryocyte maturation resulting increased platelet production marketed trade name neumega member family human growth factors produced bone marrow healthy adults synonyms oprelvekin produced escherichia coli e coli recombinant dna technology protein molecular mass approximately gmol nonglycosylated polypeptide amino acids length natural alteration resulted measurable differences bioactivity either vitro vivo

chemotherapy showed similar pharmakinetic characteristics humans treated oprelvekin daily base twofold increase fibrinogen levels occurred healthy volunteers displayed increase vonwillebrandfactor vwf activity isolated molecules formed oprelvekin found exact multimere structure normal factor therefore fully functioning increases coagulation factors may contribute development stroke see sideeffects precise association made stage variety clinical studies upon fda approval based neumega showed effectivity reducing thrombocytopenia oncologic patients treated myelosuppressant chemotherapeutic drugs

lyophilized powder fda approved drug neumega indicated prevention severe thrombocytopenia reduction need platelet transfusions following myelosuppressive chemotherapy adult patients nonmyeloid malignancies high risk severe thrombocytopenia efficacy demonstrated patients experienced severe thrombocytopenia following previous chemotherapy cycle studies rats rabbits treated chronically
