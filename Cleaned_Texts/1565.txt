urinary system also known urinary tract renal system consists kidneys ureters bladder urethra purpose urinary system eliminate waste body regulate blood volume blood pressure control levels electrolytes metabolites regulate blood ph urinary tract bodys drainage system eventual removal kidneys extensive blood supply via renal arteries leave kidneys via renal vein kidney consists functional units called nephrons following filtration blood processing wastes form urine exit kidney via ureters tubes made smooth muscle fibres propel urine towards urinary bladder stored subsequently expelled body urination voiding female male urinary system similar differing length urine formed kidneys filtration blood urine passed ureters bladder stored urination urine passed bladder urethra outside body milliliters ml urine normally produced every day healthy human amount varies according fluid intake kidney function urinary system refers structures produce transport urine point excretion human urinary system two kidneys located dorsal body wall parietal peritoneum left right sides formation urine begins within functional unit kidney nephrons urine flows nephrons system converging tubules called collecting ducts collecting ducts join together form minor calyces followed major calyces ultimately join renal pelvis urine continues flow renal pelvis ureter transporting urine urinary bladder anatomy human urinary system differs males females level urinary bladder males urethra begins internal urethral orifice trigone bladder continues external urethral orifice becomes prostatic membranous bulbar penile urethra urine exits external urethral meatus female urethra much shorter beginning bladder neck terminating vaginal vestibule microscopy urinary system covered unique lining called urothelium type transitional epithelium unlike epithelial lining organs transitional epithelium flatten distend urothelium covers urinary system including renal pelvis ureters bladder main functions urinary system components average urine production adult humans litres l per day depending state hydration activity level environmental factors weight individuals health producing much little urine requires medical attention polyuria condition excessive urine production lday conditions involving low output urine oliguria mlday anuria mlday first step urine formation filtration blood kidneys healthy human kidney receives cardiac output averages lmin basic structural functional unit kidney nephron chief function regulate concentration water soluble substances like sodium filtering blood reabsorbing needed excreting rest urine first part nephron bowmans capsule filters blood circulatory system tubules hydrostatic osmotic pressure gradients facilitate filtration across semipermeable membrane filtrate includes water small molecules ions easily pass filtration membrane however larger molecules proteins blood cells prevented passing filtration membrane amount filtrate produced every minute called glomerular filtration rate gfr amounts litres per day filtrate reabsorbed passes nephron remaining becomes urine urinary system regulated endocrine system hormones antidiuretic hormone aldosterone parathyroid urinary system influence circulatory system nervous system endocrine system aldosterone plays central role regulating blood pressure effects kidney acts distal tubules collecting ducts nephron increases reabsorption sodium glomerular filtrate reabsorption sodium results retention water increases blood pressure blood volume antidiuretic hormone adh neurohypophysial hormone found mammals two primary functions retain water body vasoconstriction vasopressin regulates bodys retention water increasing water reabsorption collecting ducts kidney vasopressin increases water permeability kidneys collecting duct distal convoluted tubule inducing translocation aquaporincd water channels kidney nephron collecting duct plasma urination also sometimes referred micturition ejection urine urinary bladder urethra outside body healthy humans many animals process urination voluntary control infants elderly individuals neurological injury urination may occur involuntary reflex physiologically micturition involves coordination central autonomic somatic nervous systems brain centers regulate urination include pontine micturition center periaqueductal gray cerebral cortex placental mammals male ejects urine penis female vulva urologic disease involve congenital acquired dysfunction urinary system example urinary tract obstruction urologic disease cause urinary retention diseases kidney tissue normally treated nephrologists diseases urinary tract treated urologists gynecologists may also treat female urinary incontinence diseases bodily systems also direct effect urogenital function instance shown protein released kidneys diabetes mellitus sensitizes kidney damaging effects diabetes also direct effect urination due peripheral neuropathies occur individuals poorly controlled blood sugar urinary incontinence result weakening pelvic floor muscles caused factors pregnancy childbirth aging overweight findings recent systematic reviews demonstrate behavioral therapy generally results improved urinary incontinence outcomes especially stress urge ui medications pelvic floor exercises known kegel exercises help condition strengthening pelvic floor also underlying medical reasons urinary incontinence often treatable children condition called enuresis cancers also target urinary system including bladder cancer kidney cancer ureteral cancer urethral cancer due role location organs treatment often complicatedcitation needed kidney stones identified recorded long written historical records urinary tract including ureters well function drain urine kidneys described galen second century first examine ureter internal approach called ureteroscopy rather surgery hampton young improved vf marshall first published use flexible endoscope based fiber optics occurred insertion drainage tube renal pelvis bypassing ureters urinary tract called nephrostomy first described approach
