oral disease one common diseases found caused buildup various anaerobic bacteria mouth forms plaque eventually hardening tartar teeth along gum line related development since small toy breeds much smaller jaw contain number teeth crowding allows higher bacterial build puts higher risk developing periodontal although daily brushing provides best preventative measure feeding dental diet using dental chews dogs effective approach pet owners take help prevent control accumulation plaque tartar avoid consequences severe periodontal dental diets consider many aspects oral health inflammation

aafco also states maximum amount vitamin within canine diet exceed one main aims dental food dogs minimize plaque accumulation gingival oral cavity dogs exposed variety bacteria parasites viruses environment surprising induce inflammatory reaction accumulation bacteria along extracellular polysaccharides salivary glycoproteins leads formation bacteria buildup plaque causes gingival inflammation indirectly stimulates activation host immune severe gingivitis dogs advance periodontal disease periodontal tissues begin degrade left untreated lead tooth studies also shown periodontal disease negatively affect systemic health impacts overall health dog therefore exhibiting importance preventing periodontal using dental diet may beneficial towards preventative care regards periodontal dental diets try combat buildup plaque physically attempt reduce plaque build chemically chemical compounds antimicrobial elements added dental diets directly target oral cavity order prevent excessive plaque formation lead severe inflammation gums may result loss plaque also able mineralize teeth creating crystallized calcium phosphate build known ingredients polyphosphate zinc salts chlorhexidine active properties help prevent reduce formation plaque compounds able work whole mouth including teeth way gum line limited chewing contact surface polyphosphates constitute wide variety compounds beneficial effects oral health effective hexametaphosphates tripolyphosphates pyrophosphates may attached alkali metal alkaline metal ammonium sodium tripolyphosphates example able bind directly enamel well mineralized sections teeth takes binding sites calcium attach interacts calcium already bonded enamel prevent able form calcium mixed saliva also bound sodium tripolyphosphates thus preventing crystal sodium tripolyphosphates also beneficial stain prevention broken digestive tract provide source phosphorus allows undeposited calcium available whole body zinc compounds specifically zinc ascorbate also play role preventing plaque accumulation due antimicrobial zinc salts inhibit bacterial growth binding sulfur control plaque formation well reduce foul oral however research performed cats evidence may directly applicable chlorhexidine another example nonspecific antimicrobial acts disrupting bacterial deposition plaque formation teeth assisting reducing chlorhexidine also reduce amount preexisting chlorhexidine generally found products dental chews oral rinses may suitable use longterm diet prolonged use may lead staining teeth tongue change taste components diet may help prevent plaque accumulation thus reducing overall inflammatory state periodontal disease dogs physical characteristics dental kibble important contribute mechanical
