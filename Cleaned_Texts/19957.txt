stimulus filtering occurs animals nervous system fails respond stimuli would otherwise cause reaction nervous system developed capability perceive distinguish minute differences stimuli allows animal react significant enables animal conserve energy responding unimportant signals proximate causes stimulus filtering many things around animals environment ultimate cause response may evolutionary advantage offered stimulus filtering animal saves energy responding unnecessary stimuli may increased fitness means would able produce offspring whereas animal filter stimuli may reduced fitness due depleted energy animal practices stimulus filtering may also likely respond appropriately serious threats animal distracted unimportant stimuli particular signals received animal superiorranking neurons determine signals important enough preserve signals insignificant process essentially works filter synapses neural network enhance certain signals repress others simple stimuli receiving attention lowerlevel neurons complicated stimuli receiving attention higher level stimulus filtering also seen humans daytoday basis phenomenon called cocktail party effect crowded room people tend
