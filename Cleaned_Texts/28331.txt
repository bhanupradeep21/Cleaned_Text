thiotimoline fictitious chemical compound conceived american biochemist science fiction author isaac asimov first described spoof scientific paper titled endochronic properties resublimated thiotimoline major peculiarity chemical endochronicity starts dissolving makes contact water asimov went write three additional short stories describing different properties uses thiotimoline asimovs writings endochronicity thiotimoline explained fact thiotimoline molecule least one carbon atom two carbons four chemical bonds lie normal space time one bonds projects future another past thiotimoline derived bark fictitious shrub rosacea karlsbadensis rufo thiotimoline molecule includes least fourteen hydroxy groups two amino groups one sulfonic acid group possibly one nitro compound group well nature hydrocarbon nucleus unknown although seems part aromatic hydrocarbon asimov engaged doctoral research chemistry part experimental procedure needed dissolve catechol water observed crystals dissolve soon hit waters surface occurred catechol soluble would dissolve encountered time asimov writing professionally nine years would soon write doctoral dissertation feared experience writing readable prose publication ie science fiction might impaired ability write turgid prose typical academic discourse decided practice spoof article including charts graphs tables citations fake articles nonexistent journals describing experiments compound thiotimoline soluble dissolved water seconds water asimov wrote article june uncertain whether resulting work fiction publishable john w campbell editor astounding science fiction accepted publication june agreeing asimovs request appear pseudonym deference asimovs concern might alienate potential doctoral examiners columbia university revealed months later asimov alarmed see piece appear march issue astounding name copies issue circulated columbia chemistry department asimov believed campbell done greater wisdom examiners told accepted dissertation asking final question thiotimoline resulting led room laughing hysterically relief article made asimov famous first time outside science fiction chemists shared copies article heard many children went new york public library trying find nonexistent asimov wrote second spoof scientific paper thiotimoline called micropsychiatric applications thiotimoline like first included charts graphs tables citations fake articles fake journals along one real citation asimovs earlier spoof article astounding listed tongueincheek journal astounding science fiction second article described use thiotimoline establish quantitative classification certain mental disorders also expounds putative rationale thiotimolines behaviour namely chemical bonds compounds structural formula starved space forced time dimension according second article thiotimolines time solubility varies depending determination person adding water also claims one effect people multiple personalities add water parts thiotimoline dissolve others due individuals personalities determined others micropsychiatric applications thiotimoline appeared december issue astounding first two thiotimoline articles appeared together asimovs first collection science essays trillion joint title marvellous properties thiotimoline asimov also included original article collection early asimov first article also appeared fifty years best science fiction analog davis publications asimov wrote third thiotimoline article november called thiotimoline space age instead fake scientific paper third article took form address asimov annual meeting american chronochemical society nonexistent scientific society address asimov describes first experiments thiotimoline july timing compounds dissolution original endochronometer instrument smithsonian asimov laments skepticism chronochemistry greeted america noting sorrow address attracted fifteen attendees contrasts thriving state chronochemistry soviet union research town khrushchevsk nicknamed tiotimolingrad established urals according asimov two scottish researchers developed telechronic battery uses series interconnected endochronometers allow final sample thiotimoline dissolve day water added initial sample asimov says strong indirect evidence soviet union possesses even sophisticated devices turning commercial quantities believes soviets using telechronic batteries determine ahead time whether satellite launches successful finally asimov describes attempts create heisenberg failure get sample thiotimoline dissolve without later adding water every case thiotimoline dissolved accident occurred caused water added proper time several attempts create heisenberg failure coincided series hurricanes striking new england manner suggest nature would find way add water whatever man decided man resolute adding water asimov speculated noahs flood might brought thiotimoline experiments among ancient sumerians concludes speculation thiotimolines potential applications weapon mass destruction deliberately using artificially induce hurricanes thiotimoline space age appeared october issue astounding final stages changing name analog article reprinted full opus asimov chronicles fifty years isaac asimov asimovs final piece thiotimoline short story titled thiotimoline stars wrote harry harrisons anthology astounding admiral vernon commandant astronautic academy gives speech graduating class vernons speech explains thiotimoline first mentioned semimythical scientist named azimuth asymptote serious study compound didnt begin century scientist almirante worked theory hypersteric hindrance later scientists worked ways form endochronic molecules polymers allowing large structures spaceships built endochronic materials one effect endochronicity one fails add water object reacted water object travel future search water interact individual sufficient inborn talent vernon explains perfectly balance starships endochronicity relativistic time dilation ship traveling relativistic speeds age rate rest universe allowing return starting point within months rather centuries departure vernon emphasizes starship pilots expected match endochronicity relativity exactly sixtysecond difference two regarded barely acceptable difference considered grounds dismissal vernon also emphasizes endochronic molecules unstable must renewed trip endochronic ship finds lost might sufficient endochronicity return proper time ship finds future might able reendochronize technology still exists ship finds past marooned finally vernon reveals auditorium giving speech actually endochronic starship speech flown outskirts solar system graduates felt acceleration canceling time dilation also caused canceling inertia vernon concludes speech graduates landing united nations port lincoln nebraska spending weekend land vernon receives awful shock passes pilot informs ship surrounded indians vernon wrongly assumed pilot meant red indians thought landed centuries past pilot meant landed correct time near calcutta india asimov included thiotimoline stars collection buy jupiter stories glen bevers story silently vanish away chemist
