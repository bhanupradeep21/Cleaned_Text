reproductive vegetative plant organs include roots stems leaves reproductive organs variable flowering plants represented flower seed fruitcitation needed conifers organ bears reproductive structures called cone divisions phyla plants reproductive organs called strobili lycopodiophyta simply gametophores mosses common organ system designations plants include differentiation shoot root parts plant

perform vital functions photosynthesis reproductive organs essential reproduction however asexual vegetative reproduction vegetative organs create new generation plants see clonal colony many societies system organ donation living deceased donors organ transplanted person failing organ transplantation larger solid organs often requires immunosuppression prevent organ rejection graftversushost disease considerable interest throughout world creating laboratorygrown artificial organscitation needed beginning organ transplants began take place scientists knew anatomy organs came later time procedures often dangerous source method obtaining organ transplant major ethical issues consider organs resources transplant always limited demand various notions justice including distributive justice developed ethical analysis situation continues long transplantation relies upon organ donors rather technological innovation testing industrial manufacturingcitation needed
