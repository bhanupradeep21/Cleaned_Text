speculative collaboration group american british scientists collectively commissioned national geographic purposes documentary team scientists divides two hypothetical examples realistic worlds extraterrestrial life could evolve tidally locked planet dubbed aurelia orbiting red dwarf star large moon dubbed blue moon orbiting gas giant binary star system scientific team series used combination accretion theory climatology xenobiology imagine likely locations extraterrestrial life probable evolutionary path life would aurelia blue moon concepts seen series also featured touring exhibition science aliens start documentary presenter team scientists draw attention reasons speculating life extrasolar planets discoveries regarding extrasolar planets first published raising prospect whether life know imagine could supported planets currently believed happen planet must orbit relatively narrow band around parent star temperatures suitable water exist liquid region called habitable zone earthlike exoplanets yet found gliese cc gliese disputed masses larger earths orbit red dwarf stars habitable zone sensitivity current detection methods makes difficult scientists search terrestrial planets smaller allow smaller bodies detected nasa studying project called terrestrial planet finder tpf twotelescope concept slated begin launching around however congressional spending limits house resolution passed january us house representatives february us senate canceled program prior tpfs cancellation astrophysicists begun speculating best places point telescope order find earthlike planets whereas life earth formed around stable yellow dwarf solar twins common galaxy red dwarf stars mass less onehalf sun consequently emit less heat bigger brighter blue giants addition estimated quarter stars least binary systems many systems containing two stars trinary sun companion therefore may prudent consider life might evolve environments speculation may still use future planetfinding telescope launched possibly nasas kepler mission first episode series focused aurelia hypothetical earthsized extrasolar planet orbiting red dwarf star local area milky way scientists project theorized aiming tpf red dwarf star might yield best opportunities seeing smaller planets due slow rate burn hydrogen red dwarfs enormous estimated lifespan allowing plenty time life evolve surrounding planets also red dwarfs common universe therefore support habitable planets substantially increases chances finding life universe however much dimmer stars harder detect planetary systems around addition lower gravity would limit potential size system discovery gliese raises hopes finding red dwarf systems including potentially habitable ones however dwarfs smaller nature fainter heatlight output would mean planet would need particularly close stars surface cost orbit would earthsized body would become tidally locked happens object presents face parent times orbits moon earth technically one sidereal day exactly equal one year orbiting body traditional scientific theories proposed tidally locked planet might incapable holding atmosphere slow rotation would weaken magnetic effect protects atmosphere blown away solar wind see rare earth hypothesiscitation needed nonetheless scientists employed programme decided test traditional assumptions planet start model protoplanetary disk eventual death estimations suggested planet could indeed hold atmosphere although freakishly unusual results earth standards aurelia would gravitationally locked due aurelia would seasons daynight half would perpetual darkness permanent ice age half would contain giant unending hurricane permanent torrential rain point directly opposite local star two zones would suitable life giant hurricane might generate enormous waves ocean would migrate outwards would winddriven would reach top ocean bottom tsunami nonetheless waves big devastating humans call freak waves
