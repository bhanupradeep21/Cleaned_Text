flight initiation distance used tool wildlife studying flight zones wildlife managers able reduce impact humans creating buffer zones human populations animal alert distance ad distance definition greater within animal changes behaviour manner enabling better observe stimulus raising head alert posture necessarily flee unless stimulus also within escape measures usually used quantify tolerance wildlife humans animals faced approaching predators must decide distance initiate flight expected way maximizes fitness flight costs including lost opportunity benefits general optimal flight
