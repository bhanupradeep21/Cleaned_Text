mobile phone tracking process identifying location mobile phone whether stationary moving localization may affected number technologies multilateration radio signals several cell towers network phone simply using gnss locate mobile phone using multilateration mobile radio signals phone must emit least idle signal contact nearby antenna towers require active call global system mobile communications gsm based phones signal strength nearby antenna mobile positioning may used locationbased services disclose actual coordinates mobile phone telecommunication companies use approximate location mobile phone thereby also location mobile phone determined number ways location mobile phone determined using service providers network infrastructure advantage networkbased techniques service providers point view implemented nonintrusively without affecting handsets networkbased techniques developed many years prior widespread availability gps handsets see us issued may one first works relating technology locating based measuring power levels antenna patterns uses concept powered mobile phone always communicates wirelessly one closest base stations knowledge location base station implies cell phone nearby advanced systems determine sector mobile phone located roughly estimate also distance base station approximation done interpolating signals adjacent antenna towers qualified services may achieve precision meters urban areas mobile traffic density antenna towers base stations sufficiently rural desolate areas may see miles base stations therefore determine locations less precisely gsm localization uses multilateration determine location gsm mobile phones dedicated trackers usually intent locate accuracy networkbased techniques varies cell identification least accurate due differential signals transposing towers otherwise known bouncing signals triangulation moderately accurate newer advanced forward link timing methods accurate accuracy networkbased techniques dependent concentration cell base stations urban environments achieving highest possible accuracy higher number cell towers implementation current timing methods one key challenges networkbased techniques requirement work closely service provider entails installation hardware software within operators infrastructure frequently compulsion associated legislative framework enhanced required service provider deploy solution december emerged israeli surveillance company rayzone group may gained access signaling system via cellular network provider sure guernsey thereby able track location cellphone location mobile phone determined using client software installed technique determines location handset putting location cell identification signal strengths home neighboring cells continuously sent addition handset also equipped gps significantly precise location information sent handset carrier another approach use fingerprintingbased signature home neighboring cells signal strengths different points area interest recorded wardriving matched realtime determine handset location usually performed independent carrier key disadvantage handsetbased techniques service providers point view necessity installing software handset requires active cooperation mobile subscriber well software must able handle different operating systems handsets typically smartphones one based symbian windows mobile windows phone blackberry os ios android would able run software eg google maps one proposed workaround installation embedded hardware software handset manufacturers eg enhanced observed time difference eotd avenue made significant headway due difficulty convincing different manufacturers cooperate common mechanism address cost issue another difficulty would address issue foreign handsets roaming network crowdsourced wifi data also used identify handsets poor performance gpsbased methods indoor environment increasing popularity wifi encouraged companies design new feasible methods carry wifibased indoor smartphones combine global navigation satellite systems gnss gps glonass wifi positioning systems hybrid positioning systems use combination networkbased handsetbased technologies location determination one example would modes assisted gps use gps network information compute location types data thus used telephone make location accurate ie agps alternatively tracking systems also occur phone attain gpslocation directly satellites information sent via network person trying locate telephone systems include google maps well ltes otdoa ecellid also hybrid positioning systems combine several different location approaches position mobile devices wifi wimax gsm lte ip addresses network environment data order route calls phone cell towers listen signal sent phone negotiate tower best able communicate phone phone changes location antenna towers monitor signal phone roamed adjacent tower appropriate comparing relative signal strength multiple antenna towers general location phone roughly determined means make use antenna pattern supports angular determination phase discrimination newer phones may also allow tracking phone even
