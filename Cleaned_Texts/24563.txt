cerebrovascular disease includes variety medical conditions affect blood vessels brain cerebral circulation arteries supplying oxygen nutrients brain often damaged deformed common presentation cerebrovascular disease ischemic stroke ministroke sometimes hemorrhagic hypertension high blood pressure important contributing risk factor stroke cerebrovascular diseases change structure blood vessels result atherosclerosis narrows blood vessels brain resulting decreased cerebral perfusion risk factors contribute stroke include smoking narrowed cerebral arteries lead ischemic stroke continually elevated blood pressure also cause tearing vessels leading hemorrhagic stroke usually presents abrupt onset neurologic deficit hemiplegia onesided weakness numbness aphasia language impairment ataxia loss coordination attributable focal vascular neurologic symptoms manifest within seconds neurons need continual supply nutrients including glucose oxygen provided blood therefore blood supply brain impeded injury energy failure besides hypertension also many less common causes cerebrovascular disease including congenital idiopathic include cadasil aneurysms amyloid angiopathy arteriovenous malformations fistulas arterial many diseases asymptomatic acute event stroke cerebrovascular diseases also present less commonly headache diseases result vascular dementia due ischemic damage common presentation cerebrovascular diseases acute stroke occurs blood supply brain symptoms stroke usually rapid onset may include weakness one side face body numbness one side face body inability produce understand speech vision changes balance hemorrhagic strokes present severe sudden headache associated vomiting neck stiffness decreased symptoms vary depending location size area involvement stroke edema swelling brain may occur increases intracranial pressure may result brain herniation stroke may result coma death involves key areas symptoms cerebrovascular disease include migraines seizures epilepsy cognitive decline however cerebrovascular disease may go undetected years acute stroke occurs addition patients rare congenital cerebrovascular diseases may begin symptoms congenital diseases medical conditions present birth may associated inherited examples congenital cerebrovascular diseases include arteriovenous malformations germinal matrix hemorrhage cadasil cerebral autosomaldominant arteriopathy subcortical infarcts arteriovenous malformations abnormal tangles blood vessels usually capillary bed separates arteries veins protects veins higher blood pressures occur arteries arteriovenous malformations arteries directly connected veins increases risk venous rupture hemorrhage cerebral arteriovenous malformations brain chance rupture year however many arteriovenous malformations go unnoticed asymptomatic throughout persons germinal matrix hemorrhage bleeding brain premature infants caused rupture fragile blood vessels within germinal matrix premature germinal matrix highly vascularized area within unborn infants brain brain cells including neurons glial cells originate infants risk germinal matrix hemorrhages born prematurely stresses exposed birth along fragile blood vessels increase risk hemorrhage signs symptoms include flaccid weakness seizures abnormal posturing irregular cadasil inherited disorder caused mutations gene located chromosome codes transmembrane protein whose function wellknown however mutation causes accumulation protein within small mediumsized blood disease often presents early adulthood migraines stroke mood disturbances cognitive deterioration mri shows white matter changes brain also signs repeated strokes diagnosis confirmed gene acquired cerebrovascular diseases obtained throughout persons life may preventable controlling risk factors incidence cerebrovascular disease increases individual causes acquired cerebrovascular disease include atherosclerosis embolism aneurysms arterial atherosclerosis leads narrowing blood vessels less perfusion brain also increases risk thrombosis blockage artery within brain major modifiable risk factors atherosclerosis controlling risk factors reduce incidence atherosclerosis atrial fibrillation also major risk factor strokes atrial fibrillation causes blood clots form within heart may travel arteries within brain cause embolism embolism prevents blood flow brain leads strokecitation needed aneurysm abnormal bulging small sections arteries increases risk artery rupture intracranial aneurysms leading cause subarachnoid hemorrhage bleeding around brain within subarachnoid space various hereditary disorders associated intracranial aneurysms ehlersdanlos syndrome autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease familial hyperaldosteronism type however individuals without disorders may also obtain aneurysms american heart association american stroke association recommend controlling modifiable risk factors including smoking arterial dissections tears internal lining arteries often associated dissections within carotid arteries vertebral arteries may compromise blood flow brain due thrombosis dissections increase risk vessel idiopathic diseases occur spontaneously without known moyamoya example idiopathic cerebrovascular disorder results narrowing occlusion intracranial blood common presentation stroke transient ischemic attack cognitive decline within children may also presenting disease may begin show symptoms beginning adolescence may symptoms reduction blood flow lasting seconds occurs brain tissue suffers ischemia inadequate blood interruption blood flow restored minutes tissue suffers infarction followed tissue low cerebral blood flow persists longer duration may develop infarction border zones areas poor blood flow major cerebral artery distributions severe instances global hypoxiaischemia causes widespread brain injury leading severe cognitive sequelae called hypoxicischemic ischemic cascade occurs energetic molecular problem arises due lack oxygen nutrients cascade results decreased production adenosine triphosphate atp highenergy molecule needed cells brain consumption atp continues spite insufficient production causes total levels atp decrease lactate acidosis become established ionic homeostasis neurons lost downstream mechanisms ischemic cascade thus begins ion pumps longer transport cell triggers release glutamate turn allows calcium cell walls end apoptosis pathway initiated cell death several arteries supply oxygen different areas brain damage occlusion result carotid arteries cover majority cerebrum common carotid artery divides internal external carotid arteries internal carotid artery becomes anterior cerebral artery middle central artery aca transmits blood frontal parietal basilar artery two posterior cerebral arteries branches basilar pca supply occipital lobe brain stem ischemia loss blood flow focal region brain produces heterogeneous areas ischemia affected vascular region furthermore blood flow limited residual flow regions blood flow less g tissuemin core regions cells die within minutes stroke ischemic penumbra blood flow tissuemin remain usable time two main divisions strokes ischemic hemorrhagic ischemic stroke involves decreased blood supply regions brain hemorrhagic stroke bleeding around mri demonstrating white matter changes brain patients cadasil brain infarct diagnoses cerebrovascular disease may important differentiate symptoms caused stroke caused syncope fainting also reduction cerebral blood flow almost always generalized usually caused systemic hypotension various origins cardiac arrhythmias myocardial infarction hemorrhagic shock among treatment cerebrovascular disease may include medication lifestyle changes surgery depending examples medications surgical procedures include prognostics factors lower glasgow coma scale score higher pulse rate higher respiratory rate lower arterial oxygen
