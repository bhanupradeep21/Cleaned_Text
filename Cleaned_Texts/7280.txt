impaired circulation increases sensitivity cold peripheral pulses diminished absent color changes extremities colour may range cyanotic blue reddish blue skin becomes thin shiny hair growth reduced ulcerations gangrene extremities common complications often resulting need amputation involved characteristic pathologic findings acute inflammation thrombosis clotting arteries veins hands feet lower limbs common mechanisms underlying buergers disease still largely unknown smoking tobacco consumption major factors associated suggested tobacco may trigger immune response susceptible persons may unmask clotting defect either could incite inflammatory reaction vessel eventually leads vasculitis ischemic changes distal parts limbscitation needed possible role rickettsia disease concrete diagnosis thromboangiitis obliterans often difficult relies heavily exclusion conditions commonly followed diagnostic criteria outlined although criteria tend differ slightly author author olin proposes following buergers disease mimicked wide variety diseases cause diminished blood flow extremities disorders must ruled aggressive evaluation treatments differ substantially buergers disease treatment known effectivecitation needed diseases buergers disease may confused include atherosclerosis buildup cholesterol plaques arteries endocarditis infection lining heart types vasculitis severe raynauds phenomenon associated connective tissue disorders eg lupus scleroderma clotting disorders production clots bloodcitation needed angiograms upper lower extremities helpful making diagnosis buergers disease proper clinical setting certain angiographic findings diagnostic buergers findings include corkscrew appearance arteries result vascular damage particularly arteries region wrists ankles collateral circulation gives tree root spider leg angiograms may also show occlusions blockages stenosis narrowings multiple areas arms legs distal plethysmography also yields useful information circulatory status digits rule forms vasculitis excluding involvement vascular regions atypical buergers sometimes necessary perform angiograms body regions eg mesenteric angiogramcitation needed skin biopsies affected extremities rarely performed frequent concern biopsy site near area poorly perfused blood heal wellcitation needed cause disease thought autoimmune nature heavily linked tobacco use patients buergers primary diseaseclarification needed smoking cessation shown slow progression disease decrease severity amputation patients halt progressioncitation needed acute cases drugs procedures cause vasodilation effective reducing pain experienced patient example prostaglandins like vasodilators give relief pain help changing course disease epidural anesthesia hyperbaric oxygen therapy also vasodilator moderate certainty evidence intravenous iloprost prostacyclin analogue effective aspirin relieving rest pain healing ischemic difference detected iloprost clinprost prostacyclin alprostadil prostaglandin analogue relieving pain healing chronic cases lumbar sympathectomy may occasionally reduces vasoconstriction increases blood flow limb aids healing giving relief pain ischemic bypass sometimes helpful treating limbs poor perfusion secondary disease use vascular growth factor stem cell injections showing promise clinical studies may benefit using bone marrowderived stem cells healing ulcers improving painfree walking distance larger highquality trials debridement done necrotic ulcers gangrenous digits amputation frequently required belowknee aboveknee amputation rarely streptokinase proposed adjuvant therapy despite clear presence inflammation disorder antiinflammatory agents corticosteroids shown beneficial healing significant antiinflammatory pain relief qualities low dosage intermittent form similarly strategies anticoagulation proven effective physical therapy interferential current therapy decrease inflammationcitation

patients tend show much higher longevity rates men known way slow progression disease abstain tobacco productscitation needed buergers common among men women although present worldwide prevalent
