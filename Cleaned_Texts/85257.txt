music sightreading also called prima vista italian meaning first sight practice reading performing piece music notation performer seen learned sightsinging used describe singer sightreading activities require musician play sing notated rhythms pitches music literature term sightreading often used generic sense refer ability read perform instrumental vocal music first sight involves converting musical information sight however authors including udtaisuk prefer use specific terms sightplaying sightsinging applicablecitation needed distinction allows narrower usage term sightreading describe silent reading music without producing sound instrument voice highly skilled musicians sightread silently look printed music hear heads without playing singing see audiationa less able sightreaders generally must least hum whistle order sightread effectively distinction analogous ordinary prose reading late antiquity ability read silently notable enough augustine hippo comment term prima vista also used italian words phrases commonly used music music notation play musical piece prima vista means play first sight according payne ability hear notes page clearly akin music reading considered prerequisite effective performance egregious errors occur student analyzing piece music makes effort play hear composition mechanically processes notes music schools generally require sightreading part audition exam musicians transpose music performance suit particular instruments vocal ranges make playing instruments singing easier number uses transposing instruments clarinets trumpets saxophones others transposing necessary skill musicians useful onecitation needed according udtaisuk many authors use term sightreading instrumental sightreading performance however udtaisuk authors use descriptive term sightplaying sightplaying instrumental sightreading sightplaying combines two unique skill sets music reading music authors according udtaisuk use term sightsinging vocal sightreading sightplaying udtaisuk advocates uses descriptive term sightsinging vocal sightreading sightsinging combines sightreading singing skills ability sightread partly depends strong shortterm musical experiment sight reading using eye tracker indicates highly skilled musicians tend look ahead music storing processing notes played referred span storage notational information working memory

trained larger would otherwise normal conditions leading robust sightreading ability human memory divided three broad categories longterm memory sensory memory shortterm working memory according formal definition working memory system temporarily storing managing information required carry complex cognitive tasks learning reasoning comprehension paramount feature distinguishes working memory longterm sensory memory systems ability simultaneously process store information knowledge called limited capacity certain amount information stored easily accessible small window time processed

cognition contains two major neural loops pathways central processing tasks via working memory visual loop necessary visual component task phonological loop deals linguistic aspects task ie repeating

recall certain tasks type memory specifically come focus discussing sight reading since process looking musical notes first time deciphering playing instrument considered complex task comprehension main conclusion terms idea working memory shortterm memory capacity mental speed three important predictors sight reading achievement although none studies discredits correlation amount time one spends practicing musical ability specifically sightreading proficiency studies pointing level one working memory functions key factor sightreading abilities stated one study working memory capacity made statistically significant contribution well percent mediumsize effect words took two pianists amount practice different levels working memory capacity likely one higher working memory capacity would performed considerably better sightreading task based research opinions multiple musicians scientists take home message ones sightreading ability working memory capacity seems best sightreaders combined strong working memories tens thousands hours practice sightreading also depends familiarity musical idiom performed permits reader recognize process frequently occurring patterns notes single unit rather individual notes thus achieving greater efficiency phenomenon also applies reading language referred chunking errors sightreading tend occur places music contains unexpected unusual sequences defeat strategy reading expectation sightreaders typically employ studio musicians eg musicians employed record pieces commercials etc often record pieces first take without seen often music played television played musicians sightreading practice developed intense commercial competition industries kevin mcnerney jazz musician professor private instructor describes auditions university north texas jazz lab bands almost completely based sightreading walk room see three four music stands front piece music different styles asked read piece emphasis sightreading according mcnerney prepares musicians studio work playing backing tracks pop performers recording commercials expense studio musicians techs makes sightreading skills essential typically studio performance rehearsed check copying errors recording final track many professional big bands also sightread every live performance known rehearsal bands even though performance rehearsal according frazier score reading

also reports sense keyboard geography ability quickly efficiently match notes keyboard keys important sightreading found computer programs flash cards effective ways teach students identify notes enhance sense keyboard geography highlighting relationships keyboard printed notation students sightread well requires specific instruction seldom given major challenge sightreading instruction according hardy obtaining enough practice material since practicing rehearsed reading help improve sightreading student use practice piece moreover material must right level difficulty student variety
