puttkamer blind realization power could projected across atlantic gained renewed confidence victorious outcome war generals suffered landlocked hallucination entire headquarters staff gave ecstasy rejoicing saw became even lonelier naval officers saw clearly hitlers reasons declaring war us numerous although obliged treaty support japan except directly attacked third party inspired respond promptly enthusiasm japans tactic surprise attack without prior declaration war used tactic attacked soviet union operation barbarossa june indeed told japanese ambassador one strike hard possible waste time declaring also prospect worldwide war fed hitlers tendency towards grandiose thinking reinforced feeling worldhistorical figure destiny said declaration speech reichstag grateful providence entrusted leadership historic struggle next five hundred thousand years described decisive history germany whole europe indeed whole whatever consultations hitler sought help make decision include anyone wehrmacht except perhaps sycophantic generals alfred jodl wilhelm keitel jodl hitlers chief military advisor operation planning jodls second charge general walter warlimont later recalled another entirely independent decision advice wehrmacht either asked given likely asked military leadership would advised expanding war given extent crisis eastern front hitlers luftwaffe adjutant nicolaus von told decision widen war returned months leave astounded hitlers cluelessness military potential united states saw example hitlers dilettante approach limited knowledge foreign countries hitler ordered preparations necessary decision taken account logistical may seen strategic advantage us presumably primarily engaged responding pearl harbor attack german uboats unleashed american shipping atlantic thereby severing lifeline supplies given admiral karl dönitz advance notification could position uboats take maximum advantage new hitlers lack knowledge us industrial demographic capacity mounting war two fronts also entered early midmarch nine months japanese attack president roosevelt acutely aware hitlers hostility towards united states destructive potential presented due attitude within white house rapidly progressing efforts americans industrial capacity start providing armed forces ordnance combat aircraft ships would required defeat axis whole us already well path complete war economy would make arsenal democracy allies hitler however dismissive military power united states view shared hermann göring german troops outskirts moscow hitler may also counted quick defeat soviet union making available german economic military resources tied another factor hitlers deeplyheld racial prejudices made see us decadent bourgeois democracy filled people mixed race population heavily influence jews negroes history authoritarian discipline control direct interested luxury living good life dancing drinking enjoying negrofied music country hitlers mind would never

well german declaration war meant american naval ships inevitably became involved conflicts german ones ribbentrop expressed opinion great powers wait war declared may seemed hitler ignorant strains angloamerican relationship united states nearbelligerent might formally declare war germany one advantage declaration war us provided hitler propaganda diversion german public distract state war soviet union germany suffered severe setbacks unexpectedly prolonged engagement hitler assured german people soviet union would crushed well onset winter fact happen little way good news timing japanese attack pearl harbor enabled hitler angle planned speech reichstag positive fashion squeezing much propaganda value possible hitler fact put speech declaration war several days trying arrive proper psychological moment make still propaganda motive hardly sufficient justify declaring war us especially considering would create otherwise unnatural alliance two disparate heretofore antagonistic polities united states soviet union also motivation linked hitlers psychology time wehrmacht forced red army russian winter move defense invasion russia hitler may wanted show declaring war still master situation furthermore throughout life hitler always gambled long shot betting everything single roll dice served well point lack information us ideological preconceptions made particular choice poor one unlikely come hitlers favor historical perspective however choice looks like desperate regardless hitlers reasons declaration decision generally seen enormous strategic blunder part allowed united states enter european war support united kingdom allies without much public opposition still facing japanese threat pacific hitler fact committed germany fight us midst war extermination russia without first defeated uk instead taking option putting conflict us long possible forcing concentrate war pacific japan making much difficult become involved european war least extent held hands power control timing intervention us instead declaring war america freed roosevelt churchill act saw point view hitler much german political military elite declaring war us response pearl harbor attack calculated risk fighting us prepared effectively defend time german leadership believed united states effectively acting belligerent conflict given actions lendlease supplies britain sustain war effort president roosevelts public statements deployment american soldiers marines iceland us navy escorts convoys across atlantic sometimes came contact uboats acts well americas previous intervention world war led assumption war inevitable decision made use attack rationale official declaration war order drive britain conflict widening submarine operations directly attacking us commercial shipping hitlers declaration war united states eventually led downfall initially seemed successful objective effectively cutting britains supply lines us militarys lack tactics equipment procedures fighting uboats caused devastating year war shipping war declaration enabled second happy time hitlers declaration war came great relief british prime minister winston churchill feared possibility two parallel disconnected wars uk soviet union versus germany europe us british empire versus japan far east pacific nazi germanys declaration united states effect american assistance britain theaters war full ally assured also simplified matters american government john kenneth galbraith recalled pearl harbor happened roosevelts advisors desperate agony mood american people
