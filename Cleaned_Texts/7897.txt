bone decalcification softening bones due removal calcium ions performed histological technique study bones extract process also occurs naturally bone development growth uninhibited cause diseases since calciumrich bones exceedingly difficult study scientists use bone decalcification make specimens available example bone decalcification used examine cartilage magnesium levels order understand bone two categories decalcifying agents removing calcium ions chelating agents acids acids divided weak picric acetic formic acid strong acids nitric hydrochloric acid acids help produce solution calcium ions chelating agents take calcium ions frequently used chelating agent ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta decalcification lengthy procedure bone pieces left decalcifying agent days weeks depending size bone numerous methods test bone decalcification complete xray examination chemical analysis measurement specimen flexibility decalcification necessary obtain soft sections bone using microtome every thin section bone cut processed see tissue processing like soft tissue body httpsenwikipediaorgwikibonedecalcification
