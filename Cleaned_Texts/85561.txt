emotions play key role overall mental sleep plays crucial role maintaining optimal homeostasis emotional deficient sleep form sleep deprivation restriction adversely impacts emotion generation emotion regulation emotional scientists offer two explanations effects sleep loss emotions one explanation sleep loss causes disinhibition emotional brain regions leading overall increase emotional also referred dysregulation model explanation describes sleep loss causes increase fatigue sleepiness coupled overall decrease energy arousal leading overall decrease emotional also referred fatigue model dysregulation model supported neuroanatomical physiological subjective selfreport studies emotional brain regions eg amygdala shown greater reactivity emotionally negative photographs following one night sleep deprivation measured functional magnetic resonance five days sleep restriction four hour sleep opportunity per night caused decrease connectivity cortical brain regions involved regulation pupil diameter shown increase significantly response negative photographs following sleep exposed positive stimuli sleep deprived participants showed amplified emotional reactivity throughout various midbrain striatal limbic visual processing brain one night sleep deprivation caused participants judge neutral images negatively non sleep deprived one night sleep loss also caused increased impulsivity negative fatiguemodel supported subjective selfreport physiological studies arousal measured electroencephalograph eeg decreases sleep loss leading decrease desire perform exert effort shortterm sleep loss associated blunting recognition negative positive facial various forms emotional expression including facial vocal expression adversely affected sleep loss following one night sleep deprivation participants show decreased facial expressiveness response positive well decreased vocal expression positive sleep deprivation slows generation facial reactions response emotional one two nights sleep loss healthy adults associated decrease generated intensity positive moods ie happiness activation well increase generated intensity negative moods ie anger depression fear fatigue longterm chronic exposure insufficient sleep associated decline optimism sociability increase subjective experiences sleepiness furthermore sleep restricted five hours night course week causes significant increases selfreports subjective mood disturbance deficient sleep patterns prominent many psychiatric insomnia increases risk depressive episode sleep deprivation influences onset hypomania sleep disturbance contributes maintenance mood amongst manic bipolar patients sleep loss may act trigger onset manic sleep patterns affected behavioral emotional disorders aspects emotional cognitive wellbeing influenced sleep scientists examined effects deficient sleep patterns emotion regulation individuals diagnosed mental disorders eg depression borderline personality disorder bipolar panic methods typically include observational subjective behavioral physiological measures emotional emotion regulation difficulties associated greater symptoms depression borderline personality worsen poor sleep patterns heart rate variability hrv described time interval heartbeats linked emotion regulation higher resting hrv associated greater emotion regulation capacity lower resting hrv associated low emotion regulation physiological data suggests hrv negatively affected sleep seen panic disorder patients poor sleep quality display increased cognitive inhibition due reduced emotion dysregulation also shown play role maintenance generalized anxiety panic obsessivecompulsive posttraumatic stress overall deficient sleep plays role dampening emotions clinical populations already susceptible emotion dysregulation well maintaining various psychiatric conditions contributing emotion several important emotional characteristics develop childhood linked sleep quality duration example approachability adaptability sleep disruption argued play role crying frequency crying interpreted early form behavioral dysregulation therefore linked emotion hypothesized

negative emotional component whereby women recall dreams men dream recall associated higher level anxiety lighter study conducted depressed healthy adults able show healthy subjects dreaming way
