vestibular system vertebrates sensory system creates sense balance spatial orientation purpose coordinating movement balance together cochlea part auditory system constitutes labyrinth inner ear mammals movements consist rotations translations vestibular system comprises two components semicircular canals indicate rotational movements otoliths indicate linear accelerations vestibular system sends signals primarily neural structures control eye movement provide anatomical basis vestibuloocular reflex required clear vision signals also sent muscles keep animal upright general control posture provide anatomical means required enable animal maintain desired position space brain uses information vestibular system head proprioception throughout body enable animal understand bodys dynamics kinematics including position acceleration moment moment two perceptive sources integrated provide underlying structure sensorium unknown semicircular canal system detects rotational movements semicircular canals main tools achieve detection since world threedimensional vestibular system contains three semicircular canals labyrinth approximately orthogonal right angles horizontal lateral anterior semicircular canal superior posterior inferior semicircular canal anterior posterior canals may collectively called vertical semicircular canals movement fluid pushes structure called cupula contains hair cells transduce mechanical movement electrical canals arranged way canal left side almost parallel counterpart right side three pairs works pushpull fashion one canal stimulated corresponding partner side inhibited vice versacitation needed pushpull system makes possible sense directions rotation right horizontal canal gets stimulated head rotations right fig left horizontal canal gets stimulated thus predominantly signals head rotations left vertical canals coupled crossed fashion ie stimulations excitatory anterior canal also inhibitory contralateral posterior vice versa vestibularocular reflex vor reflex eye movement stabilizes images retina head movement producing eye movement direction opposite head movement thus preserving image center visual field example head moves right eyes move left vice versa since slight head movements present time vor important stabilizing vision patients whose vor impaired find difficult read stabilize eyes small head tremors vor reflex depend visual input works even total darkness eyes closed reflex combined pushpull principle described forms physiological basis rapid head impulse test halmagyicurthoystest head rapidly forcefully moved side observing whether eyes keep looking mechanics semicircular canals described damped oscillatorcitation needed designate deflection cupula θ displaystyle theta head velocity q displaystyle dot q cupula deflection approximatelycitation needed α proportionality factor corresponds frequency humans time constants approximately ms respectivelycitation needed result typical head movements cover frequency range hz hz deflection cupula approximately proportional head velocity useful since velocity eyes must opposite velocity head maintain clear vision signals vestibular system also project cerebellum used keep vor effective task usually referred learning adaptation different areas cortex projections cortex spread different areas implications currently clearly understood vestibular nuclei either side brainstem exchange signals regarding movement body position signals sent following projection pathways semicircular canals respond rotations otolithic organs sense linear accelerations humans two otolithic organs side one called utricle called saccule utricle contains patch hair cells supporting cells called macula similarly saccule contains patch hair cells macula hair cell macula forty seventy stereocilia one true cilium called kinocilium tips cilia embedded otolithic membrane membrane weighted proteincalcium carbonate granules called otoconia otoconia add weight inertia membrane enhance sense gravity motion head erect otolithic membrane bears directly hair cells stimulation minimal however head tilted otolithic membrane sags bends stereocilia stimulating hair cells orientation head causes combination stimulation utricles saccules two ears brain interprets head orientation comparing inputs input eyes stretch receptors neck thereby detecting whether head tilted entire body essentially otolithic organs sense quickly accelerating forward backward left right utricular signals elicit eye movements majority saccular signals projects muscles control posture interpretation rotation signals semicircular canals straightforward interpretation otolith signals difficult since gravity equivalent constant linear acceleration one somehow distinguish otolith signals caused linear movements caused gravity humans quite well neural mechanisms underlying separation yet fully understood humans sense head tilting linear acceleration even dark environments orientation two groups hair cell bundles either side striola hair cells opposite sides move mirror symmetry one side moved inhibited opposing effects caused tilt head cause differential sensory inputs hair cell bundles allowing humans tell way head sensory information sent brain respond appropriate corrective actions nervous muscular systems ensure balance awareness experience vestibular system called equilibrioception mainly used sense balance spatial orientation vestibular system stimulated without inputs one experiences sense selfmotion example person complete darkness sitting chair sense turned left chair turned left person elevator essentially constant visual input sense descending elevator starts descend variety direct indirect vestibular stimuli make people sense moving moving tilted tilted although vestibular system fast sense used generate reflexes including righting reflex maintain perceptual postural stability compared senses vision touch audition vestibular input perceived diseases vestibular system take different forms usually induce vertigocitation instability loss balance often accompanied nausea common vestibular diseases humans vestibular neuritis related condition called labyrinthitis ménières disease bppv addition vestibular systems function affected tumours vestibulocochlear nerve infarct brain stem cortical regions related processing vestibular signals cerebellar atrophy since function vestibular hair cells detect levels carbon dioxide blood transmit information brain loss vestibular hair cells cause vestibular system visual system deliver incongruous results nausea often occurs vestibular system reports movement visual system reports movement motion disorientation often called motion sickness seasickness car sickness simulation sickness airsickness opposite case person zerogravity environment virtual reality session disoriented sensation often called space sickness space adaptation syndrome either sicknesses usually cease congruity two systems restored alcohol also cause alterations vestibular system short periods result vertigo possibly nystagmus due variable viscosity blood endolymph consumption alcohol term positional alcohol nystagmus pan pan result subjective vertigo one direction typically occurs shortly ingestion alcohol blood alcohol levels highest pan ii eventually cause subjective vertigo opposite direction occurs several hours ingestion relative reduction blood alcohol levelscitation needed benign paroxysmal positional vertigo bppv condition resulting acute symptoms vertigo probably caused pieces broken otoliths slipped one semicircular canals cases posterior canal affected certain head positions particles shift create fluid wave displaces cupula canal affected leads dizziness vertigo nystagmus similar condition bppv may occur dogs mammals term vertigo applied refers subjective perception terminology standardized condition common vestibular pathology dogs cats colloquially known old dog vestibular disease formally idiopathic peripheral vestibular disease causes sudden episode loss balance circling head tilt signs condition rare young dogs fairly common geriatric animals may affect cats vestibular dysfunction also found correlate cognitive emotional disorders including depersonalization though humans well vertebrates exhibit three semicircular canals vestibular systems lampreys hagfish vertebrates deviate trend vestibular systems lampreys contain two semicircular canals hagfish contain single canal lampreys two canals developmentally similar anterior posterior canals found humans single canal found hagfish appears secondarily derived additionally vestibular systems lampreys hagfish differ found vertebrates otolithic organs lampreys hagfish segmented like utricle saccule found humans rather form one continuous structure referred macula birds possess second vestibular organ back lumbosacral behavioral evidence suggests system
