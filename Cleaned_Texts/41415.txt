establishment single species best adapted physical biological conditions play inordinately important role determining community restoration used tool reducing spread invasive plant species many ways first method views restoration primarily means reduce presence invasive species limit spread approach emphasizes control invaders restoration techniques differ typical restoration goal projects necessarily restore entire ecosystem projects frequently use lower diversity mixes aggressive native species seeded high always actively managed following target areas type restoration heavily dominated invasive species goals first remove species reduce number invasive seeds spread surrounding areas example use biological control agents herbivorous insects suppress invasive weed species restoration practitioners concurrently seed native plant species take advantage freed approaches shown effective reducing weeds although always sustainable solution long term without additional weed control mowing restoration projects also used way better understand makes ecological community resistant invasion restoration projects broad range implementation strategies methods used control

conservation biologists agree protecting restoring habitat important protecting biodiversity however conservation biology primarily rooted population biology generally organized population genetic
