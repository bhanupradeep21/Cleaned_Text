ejaculation strictly necessary domesticated stallions trained managed variety ways depending region world owners philosophy individual stallions temperament cases however stallions inborn tendency attempt dominate horses human handlers affected degree proximity horses especially mares heat must trained behave respect toward humans times else natural aggressiveness particularly tendency bite may pose danger serious reason regardless management style stallions must treated individuals handled people experienced horses thus recognize correct inappropriate behavior becomes breeds gentle temperament others individual stallions may wellbehaved enough even handled inexperienced people short periods time common sense must always used even gentle stallion natural instincts may overcome human training general rule children handle stallions particularly breeding environment management stallions usually follows one following models confinement isolation management stallion kept alone management systems variously called natural herd pasture management stallion allowed horses harem model stallion allowed run loose mares akin feral semiferal herd bachelor herd model stallions kept maleonly group stallions cases stallions geldings sometime stallions may periodically managed multiple systems depending season year advantage natural types management stallion allowed behave like

managers keep stallion mare herd yearround others turn stallion mares breeding places young domesticated stallions allowed live separately bachelor herd growing kept sight sound smell mares swiss study demonstrated even mature breeding stallions kept well away horses could live peacefully together herd setting proper precautions taken initial herd hierarchy example new forest england breeding stallions run open forest two three months year mares youngstock taken forest many stay together bachelor herds rest new forest stallions breeding work take part annual roundups working alongside mares geldings compete successfully many drawbacks natural management however one breeding date hence foaling date given mare uncertain another problem risk injury stallion mare process natural breeding risk injury hierarchy established within allmale herd stallions become anxious temperamental herd setting may lose considerable weight sometimes point health risk may become highly protective mares thus aggressive dangerous handle also greater risk stallion may escape pasture stolen stallions may break fences adjoining fields fight another stallion mate wrong herd mares thus putting pedigree ensuing foals general method managing stallions confine individually sometimes small pen corral tall fence times stable certain places small field paddock strong fence advantages individual confinement include less risk injury stallion horses controlled periods breeding mares greater certainty mares bred less risk escape theft ease access humans stallions temperament develop vicious behavior due improper socialization poor handling must confined kept natural setting either behave dangerous manner toward horses dangerous humans loose drawbacks confinement vary details actual method used stallions kept herd setting require careful balance nutrition exercise optimal health fertility lack exercise serious concern stallions without sufficient exercise may become fat may reduce health fertility also may become aggressive develop stable vices due pentup energy stallions within sight sound horses may become aggressive noisy calling challenging horses sometimes addressed keeping stallions complete isolation animals however complete isolation significant drawbacks stallions may develop additional behavior problems aggression due frustration pentup energy general rule stallion isolated time weaning sexual maturity difficult time adapting herd environment one allowed live close animals however horses instinctively social creatures even stallions believed benefit
