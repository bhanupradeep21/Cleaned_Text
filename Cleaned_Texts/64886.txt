snub syndrome diagnostic methods particular syndrome thoroughly described literature therefore section describe diagnostic methods used epidermal nevus syndromes beckers nevus syndrome particular beckers nevus supernumerary nipples usually diagnosed visually observing however visual observation alone insufficient make conclusive diagnosis skin biopsy performed small sample skin removed nevus examined microscope analyze cellular components epidermal nevi typically contain abnormal overgrowth keratinproducing cells sweat glands hair also typically increased levels melanin innermost layer skin causing darker ultrasound ct scans imaging technology used evaluate kidney bladder cancers urinalysis also performed urine samples evaluate urinary tract problems since supernumerary nipples commonly regarded benign treatment remove usually done cosmetic purposes cases skin abnormality also cause discomfort around breast tissue particularly issue component lesion glandular tissue cause tenderness puberty occasionally although studies still done establish association supernumerary nipples kidney diseases researchers proposed renal ultrasounds used precautionary measure detect kidney abnormalities population identify need cosmetically treating beckers nevus syndrome focuses hyperpigmentation hair growth correcting skin pigmentation done variety methods including use makeup dermabrasion laser treatments studies also established tissue beckers nevus increased number androgen receptors compared unaffected skin consequently treatments using drugs antiandrogenic properties shown efficacy reducing pigmentation particularly spironolactone topical flutamide examples studied likewise excessive hair growth resolved shaving waxing electrology treatments note qswitched laser intense pulsed light treatments preferred longer term effects proper diagnoses lesion help determine treatment appropriate well reduce risk recurrence side effects aforementioned procedures postinflammatory laser treatments may pursued careful consideration case nevus associated another disease state affected area would longer available histological examination laser removal
