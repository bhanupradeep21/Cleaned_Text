repair mechanism causing fibrous tissue including muscle tendons ligaments become ossified either spontaneously damaged result trauma many cases otherwise minor injuries cause joints become permanently fused new bone forms replacing damaged muscle tissue new bone formation known heterotopic ossification eventually forms secondary skeleton progressively restricts patients ability move
