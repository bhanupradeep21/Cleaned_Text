genetically modified rice rice strains genetically modified also called genetic engineering rice plants modified increase micronutrients vitamin accelerate photosynthesis tolerate herbicides resist pests increase grain size generate nutrients flavors produce human natural movement genes across species often called horizontal gene transfer lateral gene transfer also occur rice gene transfer
