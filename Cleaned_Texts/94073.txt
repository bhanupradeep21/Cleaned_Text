expression vector otherwise known expression construct usually plasmid virus designed gene expression cells vector used introduce specific gene target cell commandeer cells mechanism protein synthesis produce protein encoded gene expression vectors basic tools biotechnology production proteins vector engineered contain regulatory sequences act enhancer promoter regions lead efficient transcription gene carried expression goal welldesigned expression vector efficient production protein may achieved production significant amount stable messenger rna translated protein expression protein may tightly controlled protein produced significant quantity necessary use inducer systems however protein may expressed constitutively escherichia coli commonly used host protein production cell types

like multiple cloning site cloned gene may transferred specialized cloning vector expression vector although possible clone directly expression vector cloning process normally performed escherichia coli vectors used protein production organisms ecoli may addition suitable origin replication propagation e coli elements allow maintained another organism vectors called shuttle vectors expression vector must elements necessary gene expression may include promoter correct translation initiation sequence ribosomal binding site start codon termination codon transcription termination differences machinery protein synthesis prokaryotes eukaryotes therefore expression vectors must elements expression appropriate chosen host example prokaryotes expression vectors would shinedalgarno sequence translation initiation site binding ribosomes eukaryotes expression vectors would contain kozak consensus sequence promoter initiates transcription therefore point control expression cloned gene promoters used expression vector normally inducible meaning protein synthesis initiated required introduction inducer iptg gene expression however may also constitutive ie protein constantly expressed expression vectors low level constitutive protein synthesis may occur even expression vectors tightly controlled promoters expression gene product may necessary purify expressed protein however separating protein interest great majority proteins host cell protracted process make purification process easier purification tag may added cloned gene tag could histidine tag marker peptides fusion

successful cloned genes may used study protein expression cellular expression vector transformed transfected host cell protein synthesis expression vectors may elements transformation insertion dna host chromosome example vir genes plant transformation integrase sites chromosomal integration vectors may include targeting sequence may target expressed protein specific location periplasmic space bacteria different organisms may used express genes target protein expression vector used therefore elements specific use particular organism commonly used organism protein production bacterium escherichia coli however proteins successfully expressed e coli expressed correct form posttranslational modifications glycosylations systems may therefore used expression host choice expression many proteins escherichia coli production heterologous protein e coli relatively simple convenient well rapid cheap large number e coli expression plasmids also available wide variety needs bacteria used protein production include bacillus subtilis heterologous proteins expressed cytoplasm e coli however proteins formed may soluble cytoplasm incorrectly folded proteins formed cytoplasm form insoluble aggregates called inclusion bodies insoluble proteins require refolding involved process may necessarily produce high proteins disulphide bonds often able fold correctly due reducing environment cytoplasm prevents bond formation possible solution target protein periplasmic space use nterminal signal sequence another possibility manipulate redox environment sophisticated systems also developed systems may allow expression proteins previously thought impossible e coli glycosylated promoters used vector usually based promoter lac operon normally regulated lac operator promoters may also hybrids different promoters example tacpromoter hybrid trp lac note commonly used lac lacderived promoters based mutant insensitive catabolite repression mutant allows expression protein control lac promoter growth medium contains glucose since glucose would inhibit gene expression wildtype lac promoter presence glucose nevertheless may still used reduce background expression residual inhibition examples e coli expression vectors pgex series vectors glutathione stransferase used fusion partner gene expression control tac pet series vectors uses possible simultaneously express two different proteins e coli using different plasmids however plasmids used plasmid needs use different antibiotic selection well different origin replication otherwise one plasmids may stably maintained many commonly used plasmids based replicon therefore incompatible order plasmid coexist another cell would need different replicon eg repliconbased plasmid pacyc series another approach would use single

expression vectors offer considerable advantages expression mammalian proteins bacterial expression systems proper folding posttranslational modifications relevant enzymatic activity may also desirable eukaryotic nonmammalian systems whereby proteins expressed may contain correct glycosylations particular use producing membraneassociating proteins require chaperones proper folding stability well containing numerous posttranslational modifications downside however low yield product comparison prokaryotic vectors well costly nature techniques involved complicated technology
