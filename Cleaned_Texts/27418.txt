pleistocene rewilding advocacy reintroduction extant pleistocene megafauna close ecological equivalents extinct extension conservation practice rewilding aims restore functioning selfsustaining ecosystems practices may include species reintroductions towards end pleistocene era roughly years ago nearly megafauna eurasia australia southnorth america dwindled towards extinction referred quaternary extinction event loss large herbivores predator species niches important ecosystem functioning left words biologist tim flannery ever since extinction megafauna years ago continent seriously unbalanced fauna means example managers national parks north america resort culling keep population ungulates paul martin originator pleistocene overkill states present ecological communities north america function appropriately absence megafauna much native flora fauna evolved influence large research shows species interactions play pivotal role conservation efforts communities species evolved response pleistocene megafauna lack large mammals may danger living megafauna threatened endangered extant megafauna significant impact communities occupy supports idea communities evolved response large mammals pleistocene rewilding could serve additional refugia help preserve evolutionary potential reintroducing megafauna north america could preserve current megafauna filling ecological niches vacant since restoring large herbivores greenhouse gas levels may grazers may also reduce fire frequency eating flammable brush would turn lower greenhouse gas emissions lower aerosol levels atmosphere alter planets browsing grazing also accelerates nutrient cycling may increase local plant productivity maintain ecosystem productivity specifically grassy megafauna also aid carbon storage loss megafauna eat fruits may responsible reduction carbon storage tropical sergey zimov russian scientist proponent pleistocene rewilding argues could restore mammoth steppe ecosystem thus slow melting arctic permafrost give world time respond climate holds mammoth steppe collapsed overhunting humans rather natural climate change established pleistocene

provide habitat required herbivores set reintroduction large tortoise species might later introduced fill role various species hesperotestudo however successful ecologists must first support fauna already present region pronghorn extant west almost becoming extinct crucial revival ancient ecosystem pronghorns native region supported large numbers species extinct relatives family would occupy great plains arid regions west southwest plains bison wood bison numbered millions pleistocene holocene european settlers drove nearextinction late century plains bison made recovery many regions former range involved several local rewilding projects across midwestern united states distributions todays arctic species relatives much broader late pleistocene holocene reindeer reached far southern united states close relatives muskox bootherium euceratherium extended southern united states mexico hence reindeer muskox might able inhabit northern portions central north america bighorn sheep mountain goats already present surrounding mountainous areas therefore pose problem rewilding mountainous areas mountain goats already introduced areas formerly occupied oreamnos haringtoni southern relative went extinct end pleistocene reintroducing extant species deer forested areas region would beneficial ecosystems occupy providing rich nutrients forested regions helping maintain species include elk whitetailed mule deer herbivorous species considered beneficial regional ecosystems include collared peccary species piglike ungulate abundant pleistocene although species along flatheaded longnosed peccaries extinct many regions north america relatives survive central south america collared peccary still found southern arizona new mexico texas chacoan peccary morphologically similar flatheaded peccary might able replace areas great plains south horses originated north america spread asia via ice age land bridge became extinct evolutionary homeland alongside mammoth ground sloth pleistocene grasslands north america birthplace modern horse extension wild horse north america already feral populations mustang burro przewalskis horses well adapted arid grassland regions

existed north america many ecotypes became extinct end pleistocene era relatives survive asia south america mountain tapir would excellent choice rewilding humid areas near lakes rivers mountain tapir extant nontropical species tapir predators mountain tapirs include cougars bears less commonly good introduction areas might include forested ecosystems west east coasts scrublike wetland ecosystem south pleistocene large populations proboscideans lived north america columbian mammoth american mastodon mastodons became extinct end pleistocene era mammoths north america however extant relative mammoth asian elephant resides tropical southeastern asia fossil record shows much widespread living temperate northern china well middle east area bearing ecological similarity southern central

keep numbers american bison equids camelids check pleistocene rewilding parts brazil parts americas proposed brazilian ecologist mauro galetti suggested introduction elephants analogues extinct megafauna private lands brazilian cerrado parts americas paul martin made similar argument favour taxon reaplacement suggesting megafauna north america became extinct arrival humans eg mastodons mammoths ground sloths smilodons could replaced species similar ecological megafauna arose insular landmasses especially vulnerable human influence evolved isolation landmasses thus subjected selection pressures surviving fauna subject many forms insular megafauna wiped arrival humans therefore scientists suggested introducing closely related taxa replace extinct taxa done several islands replacing closely related ecologically functional giant tortoises replace extinct giant example aldabra giant tortoise suggested replacement extinct malagasy giant malagasy radiated tortoises introduced mauritius replace tortoises present however usage tortoises rewilding experiments limited replacing extinct tortoises makauwahi cave reserve hawaii exotic tortoises used replacement extinct large flightless duck hunted extinction first polynesians reach hawaii grazing habits tortoises control reduce spread invasive plants promote growth native animals already introduced expanding populations extant outside australia considered reintroduction introduced species alternative proxy extinct fauna discussions introduced exotic faunas notably dromedary camel proxy diprotodon palorchestes may fill empty niches extinct faunas hence promote conservation animals rather animals already introduced including semiwild animals considered reintroduction animals already introduced
