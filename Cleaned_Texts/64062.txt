cryptogyps extinct genus old world vulture pleistocene australia relatively small vulture still larger extant wedgetailed eagle originally described eagle binomial name taphaetus lacertosus reidentified vulture first known example continent phylogenetic analysis supports sister species extant widespread eurasian vulture genus gyps basal member subfamily identification cryptogyps vulture solves longstanding mystery lack specialized lineages large scavenging birds australia despite present every continent aside antarctica likely cryptogyps went extinct towards end pleistocene due disappearance megafauna depended carrion genus contains single species c lacertosus cryptogyps long complicated taxonomic history initially described taphaetus lacertosus charles walter de vis based lower part humerus quadrate bone middlelate pleistocene age found around kalamurina south australia assignment fossil material taphaetus de vis problematic genus declared junior synonym uroaetus de vis earlier year later still uroaetus deemed synonymous aquila type specimen found identical modern wedgetailed eagle subsequently genus taphaetus unavailable accordance rules international code zoological nomenclature iczn gerard frederick van tets suggested lacertosus member genus icthyophaga synonymous haliaeetus designated humerus lectotype later placing species subfamily gypaetinae time

nullarbor plain western name cryptogyps combination ancient greek kryptos gyps meaning hidden vulture respectively name reflects fact despite known century animals identity vulture remained largely unknown additionally name also contains word crypt underground burial site matches discovery fossil material species name means despite close size large wedgetailed eagle aquila audax cryptogyps still unusually small aegypiine vulture extant hooded vulture necrosyrtes monachus initially three phylogenetic trees recovered using combination morphological molecular data analysis provide moderate support fact cryptogyps part clade containing aegypiine vultures serpent eagles strong support placement former key traits appear place cryptogyps subfamily appear two synapomorphies tarsometatarsus within vultures may closely related modern genus gyps contains modern griffon vultures however relationship poorly supported later analysis conducted discovery dynatoaetus find different placements mather et al cryptogyps recovered basal position outside aegypiine crown derived dynatoaetus bayesian analysis publication recovers even basal position sister taxon clade containing aegypiine vultures

developed extant vultures nowhere near pronounced active predators wedgetailed eagle thus likely cryptogyps primarily scavengers feeding upon dead dying australian megafauna times traveled great distances searching carrion assuming size vulture correlates general feeding preference observed modern relatives cryptogyps may gulper ripper type scavenger means may either fed soft parts carcasses internal organs may ripped open flesh skin regardless specifics would provided valuable ecological service reducing disease transmission facilitating energy flow nothing conclusive said specifics behavior hypothesis cryptogyps related extant griffon vultures could mean times gathered large numbers social groups formed scavenging could provided multiple advantages aid foraging also driving another possibility cryptogyps could solitary animal foraged still cryptogyps may uncontested scavenger addition native marsupials contemporary dynatoaetus notably larger bird assuming behaved similar fashion extant wedgetailed eagle may scavenging opportunity presented shere size dynatoaetus may allowed successfully dominate smaller cryptogyps two fought single similar interactions known africa large raptors would occasionally follow vultures drive away given discovery remains across australia western australia new south wales possible cryptogyps may widespread species across continent foraging grassland open woodland environments following extinction australian megafauna quaternary extinction event years ago cryptogyps may also gone extinct due lack carrion feed large bodied kangaroos would later grow numbers spread environments previously inhabit shift may come late cryptogyps extinction cryptogyps thought allowed wedgetailed eagle easily exploit resource become
