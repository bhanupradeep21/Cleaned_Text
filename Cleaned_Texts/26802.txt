promoter bashing technique used molecular biology identify certain regions dna strand commonly promoters affect transcription downstream genes normal circumstances proteins bind promoter activate repress transcription promoter bashing assay specific point mutations deletions made specific regions promoter transcription gene measured contribution region promoter observed level transcription mutation deletion changes level transcription known region promoter may binding site regulatory promoter bashing often done deletions either end dna strand assay easier perform based repeated restriction digestion gelpurifying fragments specific sizes often easiest ligate promoter reporter generate large amount reporter construct using pcr growth bacteria perform serial restriction digests sample ability upstream promoters easily assayed removing segments end end strand downstream promoter commonly contains binding sequences proteins affecting transcription proteins also necessary testing effects promoter proteins associate promoter identified using electrophoretic mobility shift assay emsa effects inclusion exclusion proteins mutagenized promoters assessed assay allows use promoter bashing discover location dna strand affects transcription also proteins affect strand effects protein interactions well binding sites also assayed way candidate proteins must instead identified proteinprotein interaction assays instead example procedure promoter bashing assay adapted boulin et data received assaying different promoters effects various parts promoter ascertained however possible may enough data present assay must rerun different promoter region andor different mutations httpsenwikipediaorgwikipromoterbashing
