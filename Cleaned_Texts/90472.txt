specimen ivpp v mostly complete left mandible teeth attached collected base baron sog formation located haerhada inner mongolia generic name comes greek lonch meaning spear cyon meaning dog specific name qiui given honour professor zhanxiang qiu contributions study carnivoran evolution one distinct features lonchocyon deep mandible ramus getting progressively deeper first premolar towards third molar distinguishable small marginal process rises ventral border powerful digastric muscle inserted marginal process shallow depression along posterior ventral border possibly suggests presence rudimentary premasseteric fossa anterior marginal process extending ventrally towards first molar masseter muscle inserts large deep masseteric fossa two mandibular foramina present larger one located ventral gap second third premolars smaller one ventral anterior border fourth premolar interdigitated rugosities seen rough robust mandibular symphysis although posterodorsal corner comparatively smooth posteriorly inclined coronoid crest broadens distal half high broad coronoid process projects anterior border robust condyloid process latter composed two parts slightly medially inclined long axis narrow triangular depression present lateral side wide shallow indentation separates marginal process angular process shallow wide mandibular notch gently curves coronoid process condyloid incisors preserved alveoli indicate first two incisors aligned almost longitudinally rather transversely much smaller third one large robust canine laterally compressed resembles arctoids nearly erect oval outline crosssection although apex canine preserved likely recurved distally mm long diastema separates canine strongly reduced premolars almost unique among hypercarnivorous arctoids except magericyonini premolars furthermore spaced separated diastemas two closely placed tooth sockets interpreted belonging singlerooted first second premolar respectively instead doublerooted second premolar third premolar also singlerooted whereas roots fourth one nearly coalesced latter possesses sharp pointed main cuspid flat lingual surface convex buccal surface well straight distinct anterior posterior crests former extending anterolingually latter posteriorly however accessory cingulid cuspid large spearlike paraconid cusp gave lonchocyon name present massive first molar composed three facets bordered three ridges descend apex paraconid first posteriorly slanted anterior cristid extending slightly lingually base crown second shorter lingual cristid descends notch paraconid protoconid third posterior cristid forming anterior half carnassial blade posterior half carnassial blade formed preprotocristid extends anterobuccally alongside buccal edge blade slightly worn facet present nearright angle formed notch two cristids blade buccal view highest cuspid tooth protoconid however smaller paraconid buccal view distinct groove occlusal lingual sides separates two cusps blunt ridge descends protoconid notch paraconid protoconid lingual side creating deep vshaped notch lingual cristid paraconid resulting presence flat anterior face two cristids protoconid metaconid half high protoconid located posterolingually almost tall paraconid short talonid slightly narrower tall trigonid theyre separated distinct groove continuous occlusal buccal surfaces talonids lingual surface vertical whereas buccal surface lingually inclined slightly anterolingually extending hypoconid crest lies middle talonid joins slightly lower entoconid crest posterior side results talonid forming loop occlusal surface cingulid present first molar second molar possesses relatively large alveolus composed two equalsized portions likely doublerooted reduced alveolus third molar however much smaller indicating singlerooted overall molars decrease size posteriorly first molar largest third several features notably deep mandible robust canine sectorial trigonid indicate lonchocyon hypercarnivore diet evolved numerous times among arctoids major amphicyonid subfamilies well hemicyonine ursids hypercarnivorous members however second molar lonchocyon reduced unlike magericyon thaumastocyonines similar condition seen hemicyonines hemicyonines carnivorous arctoids except magericyonini functional fourth premolars opposed strongly reduced premolar lonchocyon magericyon lacks coalesced fourth premolar seen lonchocyon two taxa furthermore strongly temporally separated suggested similarities result parallel evolution hypercarnivorous features lonchocyon plesiomorphic dorsoventral mandibular force profiles zxl lonchocyon similar canids amphicyonids zxl values similar lions ysengrinia tolosana higher amphicyonids values canine also similar lions higher compared taxa except tolosana brown bears suggests capable delivering powerful canine bites subdue large preys like big cats instead delivering rapid shallow bites packhunting canids large value indicates capable withstanding high dorsoventral stresses labiolingual mandibular force profiles zyl point toward high labiolingual torsional stresses also showcase similarities canids amphicyonids though lower zxl values location except canine values high generally similar lions spotted hyaenas tolosana higher amphicyonids except magericyon ammitocyon canine value even surpasses lion indicating capable withstanding huge labiolingual torsional stresses restraining prey powerful canine bites zxl zyl values rise gradually along horizontal ramus posterior canine relative mandibular force zxzy lonchocyon almost plateaus third premolar second molar corresponding sectorial carnassial tooth reduced premolars marked difference caniformes indicatzes mainly used slice meat need withstand great buccolingual torsional stresses posterior molars however seem ability crack harder objects overall lonchocyon possessed robust mandibular symphysis allowing deliver canine bites similar lions subdue prey large larger furthermore suggested solitary hunter unlike modern httpsenwikipediaorgwikilonchocyon
