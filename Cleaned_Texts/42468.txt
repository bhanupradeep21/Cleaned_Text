received fda approval october world health organizations list essential since introduction propofol become almost exclusively drug choice anesthesiologists induction maintenance general anesthesia largely replaced often administered part anesthesia maintenance technique called total intravenous anesthesia using either manually programmed infusion pumps computercontrolled infusion pumps process called target controlled infusion propofol also used sedate individuals receiving mechanical ventilation undergoing surgery patients intensive care critically ill patients propofol superior lorazepam effectiveness overall propofol relatively inexpensive compared medications similar use due shorter icu stay one reasons propofol thought effective although longer halflife lorazepam studies found benzodiazepines like midazolam lorazepam tend accumulate critically ill patients prolonging propofol also suggested sleep aid critically ill adults icu setting however effectiveness medicine
