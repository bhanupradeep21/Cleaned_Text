reproductive toxicity refers potential risk given chemical physical biologic agent adversely affect male female fertility well offspring reproductive toxicants may adversely affect sexual function ovarian failure fertility well causing developmental toxicity lowered effective fertility related reproductive toxicity relates male female effects alike reflected decreased sperm counts semen quality ovarian failure infertility medically defined failure couple conceive course one year unprotected many couples experience among men oligospermia defined paucity viable spermatozoa semen whereas azoospermia refers complete absence viable spermatozoa globally harmonized system classification labelling chemicals ghs separates reproductive toxicity germ cell mutagenicity carcinogenicity even though hazards may also affect fertility many drugs affect human reproductive system effects however studies reproductive toxicity focused occupational environmental exposure chemicals effects reproduction consumption alcohol tobacco smoking known toxic reproduction sense used one wellknown group substances toxic reproduction teratogens substances cause birth defects sthalidomide possibly notorious another group substances received much attention prompted controversy possibly toxic reproduction socalled endocrine endocrine disruptors change hormones produced interact receptors endocrine disruptors classified estrogenic antiestrogenic androgenic antiandrogenic category includes pharmaceutical compounds environmental compounds estrogenic androgenic compounds cause hormonal responses sex steroids estrogen testosterone however antiestrogenic antiandogenic compounds bind receptor block hormones binding receptors thus preventing function examples many types endocrine disruptors trenbolone androgenic flutamide antiandrogenic diethylstilbestrol estrogenic bisphenol estrogenic tributyltin however many substances toxic reproduction fall groups lead compounds example considered toxic given adverse effects normal intellectual psychomotor development human babies children lead heavy metal exist organic inorganic forms associated adverse effects male libido erectile disfunction premature ejaculation poor sperm lead believed predominantly affect male reproduction disruption hormones reduces quantity sperm production seminiferous tubules also proposed lead causes poor semen quality increasing reactive oxygen speciesclarification needed due lipid peroxidation leading cellular cadmium heavy metal used jewelry making electronics welding galvanizing human route exposure primarily inhalational oral environmental exposure among nonoccupationally exposed occur due exposure cigarette oral route exposure occur due ingesting plants shellfish taken cadmium water exposure cadmium results adverse male fertility terms decreased spermatogenesis semen quality sperm motility impaired hormonal likewise exposure cadmium impairs female fertility terms menstrual cycle regularity reproductive hormonal hexavalent chromium cr vi used electronics industry metal chromium exposure primarily inhalation human animal studies show exposure hexavalent chromium decreases semen quality sperm elemental mercury metal exists liquid form room temperature commonly found thermometers blood pressure cuffs dental amalgams terms exposure route absorption primarily via inhalation mercury data among female dental technicians exposed mercury vapors demonstrated decreased fertility among exposed practiced poor industrial hygiene handling dental among female workers mercury smelting plants increase spontaneous abortions dibromochloropropane dbcp used pesticide nematodes agricultural dbcp one wellknown reproductive toxicants known cause testicular workers chemical factories exposed dibromochloropropane shown develop dosedependent oligospermia additional studies also demonstrated dbcpexposed workers banana pineapple plantations central america countries also developed oligospermia united states environmental protection agency banned use dbcp agriculture due effect male despite banned use agriculture dbcp still used intermediate chemical manufacturing well reagent ethylene dibromide ethylene dibromide edb fumigant originally used protect citrus fruits grains vegetables use edb united states banned united states environmental protection agency however edb still used united states fumigant treat timber logs beetles likewise still used intermediate chemical exposure edb shown adversely affect male fertility leading decreased sperm counts decreased numbers viable sperm increased abnormal sperm primary route exposure solvent exposure common among men women working industrial settings specific solvents including xylene perchloroethylene toluene methylene chloride shown associated concurrent elevation risk spontaneous abortion ionizing radiation form alpha beta gamma emissions well known adversely affect male exposure range gy associated spermatogonial injury whereas gy reductions sperm counts radio frequency electromagnetic fields generated mobile phone devices shown decrease semen quality production experimental animal models however human data still equivocal international association research canceriarc classifies radio frequency electromagnetic fields group possibly thalidomide prescribed therapeutically early europe antinausea medication alleviate morning sickness among pregnant women exact mechanism action thalidomide known thought related inhibition angiogenesis interaction insulin like growth fibroblast like growth factor became apparent thalidomide altered embryo development led limb deformities thumb absence underdevelopment entire limbs thalidomide may caused teratogenic effects babies lipid soluble compounds cross cell lipid bilayer bind cytoplasmic steroid hormone receptors translocate nucleus act estrogen diethylstilbestrol des synthetic estrogen one endocrine disruptor acts estrogen agonist diethylstilbestrol used prevent spontaneous diethylstilbestrol causes cancer mutations producing highly reactive metabolites also causing dna adducts form exposure diethylstilbestrol womb cause atypical reproductive tract formation specifically females exposed diethylstilbestrol utero first trimester likely develop clear cell vaginal carcinoma males increased risk bisphenol bpa used polycarbonate plastic consumer goods aluminum bpa example endocrine disruptor negatively affects reproductive development acting estrogen mimicker xenoestrogen likely androgen bisphenol exposure fetal female rats leads mammary gland morphogenesis increased formation ovarian tumors increased risk developing mammary gland neoplasia adult life lab animal models bpa considered ovarian uterine toxicant impairs endometrial proliferation decreases uterine receptivity decreases chances successful implantation embryo adverse reproductive toxicological impacts bisphenol better studied females
