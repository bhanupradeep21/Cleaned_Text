principle concept ecology food quality herbivores intake decreases size herbivore increases amount food increases counteract low quality operates observing allometric non linear scaling properties principle coined pj jarman rhv bell large herbivores subsist low quality gut size larger smaller increased size allows better digestive efficiency thus allow viable consumption low quality small herbivores require energy per unit body mass compared large smaller size thus smaller gut size lower efficiency imply animals need select high quality food small gut limits amount space food eat low

size appears consistent across multiple species explanation behind principle bigger size allowed better digestion via retention time clauss et al argues retention time proportional body mass smaller

environment copes principle applied model primate behaviours explain sexual segregation ungulates sexual segregation soay sheep ovis aries soay sheep polygynous nature males multiple partners opposed polygynandry two main hypothesis proposed help explain observed male soay sheep morphologically larger females larger overall size implies larger gut size hence digestive efficiency males larger subsist lower quality food leads resource partitioning males females thus sexual segregation intraspecies time taken process food depends food quality poorer high fibre food requires time process extra time influences behaviour group ungulates lead segregation via food since males larger handle low quality food feeding ruminating activity differ pérezbarbería f j et al tested proposed hypothesis feeding soay sheep grass hay observing digestive efficiency sexes via faecal given supplied food faecal matter implies less digestion thus lower digestive male soay sheep produced less faecal matter although result consistent principle observes relationship size food quality adequately explain proposed hypothesis sheep kept environment food abundance quality controlled need resource partitioned segregation hypothesis many external factors may influence behavioural changes males enough induce sexual segregation explored pérezbarbería f j et al experiment sheep kept controlled environment controlled diet monitoring digestive efficiency males consume food females thereby greater allowance energy activities predator lookout migration simply standing use energy since males energy could enough leeway induce sexual however cost benefit ratio segregating group remains equivocal hard observing effective food digestibility soay sheep principle seems apply intraspecific

food trend supported observed primate adaptations help survive also used hypothesis general diet newly discovered mysterious primates researched taking account animals body example information pygmy chimpanzees scarce around however expected fruity steven j c gaulin examined primate species various scientific literature links size diet hence omnivorous primates seemed inconsistent trend likely due diversity omnivores majority primate omnivores live open ranges particularly ecotonal regions two biomes environments food abundance comparatively lower forest diet would shift mixture low amounts highquality food high amounts lowquality food maximise forage deviations expected trend question universality principle steven j c gaulin notes principle applied offer type explanation subjected numerous phenomena occur example habitat range constrains size organism large primates heavy live tree perhaps use adaptations even tools enough allow viable consumption food quality would otherwise extinct dinosaurs particularly large sauropods imagined primarily two method one involves fossil records bones dentition method two involves drawing ideas extant animals body mass linked reptiles generally shorter retention time however loss digestive efficiency offset ability process food smaller particles smaller particles easier digest sauropods reptiles would expected similar retention time extant however lack particle reduction mechanisms eg gastric mills chewing teeth challenge validity marcus clauss et al hypothesised sauropods enlarged gut capacity account retention time inversely proportional intake therefore enlarged gut cavity allows increased intake thus shorter retention time similar herbivorous wilkinson g ruxton considered available nutrients driving factor sauropod gigantism sauropods appeared late triassic period became extinct end cretaceous time period herbivorous plant matter conifers ginkgos cycads ferns horsetails may dietary choice plants high carbon nitrogen content large amounts plant matter would consumed meet bodily nitrogen requirement hence carbon content consumed clauss hummel et al cited wilkinson g ruxtons argues larger sizes necessarily improve digestive efficiency rather allows nutrient example exists diet high carbon low nitrogen content meeting nitrogen dietary requirement suggests consuming high level carbon diet since gut volume scales linearly body mass larger animals capacity digests food
