transcription factor hairy enhancer protein encoded gene mammalian homolog hairy gene one seven members hes gene family hes genes code nuclear proteins suppress protein belongs basic helixloophelix bhlh family transcription factors transcriptional repressor genes require bhlh protein transcription protein particular type basic domain contains helix interrupting protein binds nbox promoter region rather canonical enhancer box member bhlh family transcriptional repressor influences cell proliferation differentiation regulates expression via negative feedback loop oscillates approximately three conserved domains hes genes impart transcriptional functions bhlh domain orange domain wrpw motif hes genes differ bhlh factors proline residue middle basic dna binding region proline proposed give hes proteins unique dna binding capacity bhlh factors bind ebox consensus sequence canntg present promoter region target genes hes factors bind preferentially class c site n box orange domain serves regulate choice bhlh heterodimer cterminal wrpw domain inhibits similarly hes proteins shown interact corepressors encoded transducinlike espl tle genes grouchorelated gene grg homologs drosophila groucho drosophila inhibits transcription recruiting histone deacetylase likely hesgroucho complex actively blocks transcription disabling chromatin hes proteins also heterodimerize bhlh repressors process also blocks transcription hes factors also heterodimerize bhlh activators also known also known mammalian homologs proneural genes drosophila heterodimer complexes bind dna therefore repress also interacts sirtuin influences maintenance certain stem cells progenitor cells specifically influences timing differentiation repressing bhlh activators determines binary cell fate shown play large role nervous digestive systems shown influence two systems partially notch signaling pathway expressed neuroepithelial cells radial glial cells neural stem cells expression along covers majority developing embryo embryonic day point expression limited subventricular zone knockout ko mice compensatorily upregulated neurogenesis accelerated indeed expression genes inhibited expression proneural genes increases neurogenesis accelerated neural stem cells become prematurely depleted contrariwise hes genes overexpressed neurogenesis thus genes involved maintaining creating neural stem cells additionally guide neural stem cells one two paths differentiation maintain neural stem cells expressing leads cells astrocyte differentiation epigenetic modifications dna methylation also influence

stem cells received differentiation signal often adopted mesodermal fate cells received differentiation signal differentiated neuronal cells results confirmed using quantitative pcr showed cells showed high levels brachyury expression expressed highly mesodermal cell types comparatively low levels genes expressed neural cells nestin contrast cells showed high levels expression genes involved neural induction low levels expression genes involved mesodermal cycling levels also contribute maintenance neural progenitor cells regulating levels fluctuate different frequencies different parts central nervous system continuously expressed high levels boundaries vacillates compartments suggests alternating levels may prompt differences characteristics anatomical elements central nervous also plays important role notch signaling absence notch signaling rbpj inhibits expression notch signals processed within cell however plasma membrane releases intracellular domain notch moves nucleus associates rbpj binding causes conformational change leads corepressors disassociate allows coactivators bind new activating complex prompts expression notch signaling activates expression shown target least notch ligands notch ligands shown induce neural differentiation binding blocks neural differentiation leads maintenance neural stem cells neural progenitor notch signaling also occurs intestinal crypt cells hyperactivated notch causes reduction number secretory cell types ie goblet cells enteroendocrine cells paneth cells deletion notch pathway removing notch expression controller rbpsuh causes production nearly goblet shown influence differentiation decision cells gastrointestinal tract pancreatic progenitor cells expression inhibits expression controls exocrine cell differentiation drives differentiation endocrine cell types form islets absence developing intestine mice promotes increase protein required production intestinal secretory cell types leads increase goblet enteroendocrine paneth cells deleted mouse zebrafish surplus goblet cells enteroendocrine cells made enterocytes liver progenitor cells differentiate two different cell types hepatocytes biliary epithelial cells expression low hepatocytes form normally bile ducts completely phenotype resembles alagille syndrome hallmark mutations therefore hesnotch interactions also play role
