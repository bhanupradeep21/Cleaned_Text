osteoderms estimated subadult individual estimated maximum adult approximately lines arrested growth lag counted thin sections suggesting imperator took years reach adult given extant wild

generalized diet similar nile crocodile would included large terrestrial prey abundant dinosaurs lived however analysis biomechanical model skull suggested unlike deinosuchus sarcosuchus may able perform death roll maneuver used extant crocodilians dismember suggests imperator hunt big game probably dismember prey fashion extant crocodilians remains imperator found region ténéré desert named
