idiopathic childhood occipital epilepsy gastaut icoeg pure rare form idiopathic occipital epilepsy affects otherwise normal children classified amongst benign idiopathic childhood focal epilepsies rolandic epilepsy panayiotopoulos seizures purely occipital primarily manifest elementary visual hallucinations blindness usually frequent diurnal develop rapidly within seconds brief lasting seconds min rarely longercitation needed elementary visual hallucinations common characteristic ictal symptoms likely first often clinical manifestation consist mainly small multicoloured circular patterns often appear periphery visual field becoming larger multiplying course seizure frequently moving horizontally towards sidecitation needed occipital symptoms sensory illusions ocular movements ocular pain tonic deviation eyes eyelid fluttering repetitive eye closures may occur onset seizures appear elementary visual deviation eyes often associated ipsilateral turning head common cases nonvisual ictal symptom often associated ipsilateral turning head usually starts visual hallucinations although may also occur hallucinations still persist may mild often severe progresses hemiconvulsions secondarily generalised tonic clonic seizures gtcs children may seizures eye deviation start without visual hallucinations forced eyelid closure eyelid blinking occur patients usually stage consciousness impaired signal impending secondarily gtcscitation needed ictal blindness appearing start less commonly manifestations occipital seizures usually lasts min occur alone ictal event patients could times visual hallucinations without blindnesscitation needed complex visual hallucinations visual illusions symptoms resulting anterior ictal spreading rarely occur start may terminate hemiconvulsions generalised convulsionscitation needed ictal headache mainly orbital pain may occur often precedes visual ictal occipital symptoms small number patients consciousness impaired visual symptoms simple focal seizures may disturbed lost course seizure usually eye deviation convulsionscitation needed occipital seizures icoeg may rarely progress extraoccipital manifestations hemiparaesthesia spread produce symptoms temporal lobe involvement exceptional may indicate symptomatic causecitation needed postictal headache mainly diffuse also severe unilateral pulsating indistinguishable migraine headache occurs half patients may associated nausea vomitingcitation needed circadian distribution visual seizures predominantly diurnal occur time day longer seizures without hemi generalised convulsions tend occur either sleep causing patient wake awakening thus children may numerous diurnal visual seizures seizures exclusively nocturnal occur awakeningcitation needed frequency seizures untreated patients experience frequent brief visual seizures often several every day weekly however propagation seizure manifestations focal generalised convulsions much less frequentcitation needed may increased family history epilepsies cases migraine cases family history similar seizures exceptionalcitation needed seizures purely occipital lobe origin mechanisms postictal headache common event minor idiopathic symptomatic visual seizures without predisposition migraine unknown likely occipital seizure discharge triggers genuine migraine headache trigeminovascular brainstem mechanismscitation needed definition idiopathic epilepsy tests eeg normal however high resolution brain magnetic resonance imaging probably mandatory high incidence symptomatic occipital epilepsies clinicoeeg manifestationscitation needed interictal eeg shows occipital paroxysms often demonstrating fixationoff sensitivity however patients may random occipital spikes whereas others may occipital spikes sleep eeg may consistently normal eeg photoparoxysmal abnormalities occur patients whose seizures triggered ictal eeg preceded regression occipital paroxysms characterised sudden appearance occipital discharge consists fast rhythms fast spikes ictal eeg blindness show pseudoperiodic slow waves spikes differ seen ictal visual hallucinations usually postictal abnormalitiescitation needed differential diagnosis icoeg mainly symptomatic occipital epilepsy migraine misdiagnosis high differential diagnosis migraine easy elementary visual hallucinations occipital seizures develop rapidly within seconds brief duration minutes usually colored circular fundamentally different visual aura migraine develops slowly minutes longer lasting minutes mainly achromatic linear patterns symptomatic occipital epilepsy often imitates icoeg neuroophthalmological examination brain imaging may normal thus high resolution mri required detect subtle lesions differentiation icoeg panayiotopoulos syndrome straightforward seizures icoeg purely occipital brief frequent diurnal conversely seizures panayiotopoulos syndrome manifest autonomic manifestations lengthy infrequent visual symptoms rare sole manifestation seizurecitation needed patients icoeg need prophylactic treatment mainly carbamazepine antiepileptic drugs licensed focal seizures slow reduction dose medication years last visual minor major seizure advised visual seizures reappear treatment restoredcitation needed prognosis icoeg unclear although available data indicate remission occurs patients within years onset seizures show dramatically good response carbamazepine patients however patients may continue visual seizures infrequent secondarily generalized
