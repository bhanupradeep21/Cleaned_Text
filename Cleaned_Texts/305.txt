osteopetrosis literally stone bone also known marble bone disease albersschönberg disease extremely rare inherited disorder whereby bones harden becoming denser contrast prevalent conditions like osteoporosis bones become less dense brittle osteomalacia bones soften osteopetrosis cause bones dissolve one hereditary causes considered prototype osteosclerosing dysplasias cause disease understood
