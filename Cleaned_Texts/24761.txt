important note typical difficulties speech language come normal aging well age language become difficult process resulting slowing verbal comprehension reading abilities likely word finding difficulties though unlike aphasias functionality within daily life remains localizationist approaches aim classify aphasias according major presenting characteristics regions brain probably gave rise inspired early work nineteenthcentury neurologists paul broca carl wernicke approaches identify two major subtypes aphasia several minor subtypes recent classification schemes adopting approach bostonneoclassical also group classical aphasia subtypes two larger classes nonfluent aphasias encompasses brocas aphasia transcortical motor aphasia fluent aphasias encompasses wernickes aphasia conduction aphasia transcortical sensory aphasia schemes also identify several aphasia subtypes including anomic aphasia characterized selective difficulty finding names things global aphasia expression comprehension speech severely compromised many localizationist approaches also recognize existence additional pure forms language disorder may affect single language example pure alexia person may able write read pure word deafness may able produce speech read understand speech spoken although localizationist approaches provide useful way classifying different patterns language difficulty broad groups one problem individuals fit neatly one category another problem categories particularly major ones brocas wernickes aphasia still remain quite broad meaningfully reflect persons difficulties consequently even amongst meet criteria classification subtype enormous variability types difficulties instead categorizing every individual specific subtype cognitive neuropsychological approaches aim identify key language skills modules functioning properly individual person could potentially difficulty one module number modules type approach requires framework
