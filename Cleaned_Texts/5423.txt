osteosarcoma os osteogenic sarcoma ogs simply bone cancer cancerous tumor bone specifically aggressive malignant neoplasm arises primitive transformed cells mesenchymal origin thus sarcoma exhibits osteoblastic differentiation produces malignant osteosarcoma common histological form primary bone prevalent teenagers young many patients first complain pain may worse night may intermittent varying
