labidosaurikos genus extinct captorhinid anapsid reptile lived around million years ago kungurian age lower american paleontologist john willis stovall first described labidosaurikos naming labidosaurus like striking similarity holotype skull specimen cranial anatomy another captorhinid labidosaurus labidosaurus generally called lipped lizard another genus family captorhinidae whose name derived greek forceps lizard based labidlabis τσιμπίδα forceps pinsers σαυρος sauros labidosaurikos important find permian red beds north america captorhinids commonly found key discovery evolution herbivory large captorhinids given multirow tooth characteristic share namesake labidosaurus hamatus whose dentition resembles basal mainly singletoothrowed first fossils labidosaurikos came oklahoma later finds discovered information attributed labidosaurikos based cranial anatomy well supported species labidosaurikos meachami collections appendicular captorhinid anatomy interrelationships known primarily lower permian genera romeria protocaptorhinus rhiodenticulatus captorhinus labidosaurikos part less well known collection captorhinids younger permian deposits moradisaurus labidosaurikos

deeper pits occur palate labidosaurikos shares general resemblance captorhinid however specializations come presence multiple rows teeth features include transverse constriction palate medially expanding tooth laminae maxillae loss teeth palatine anterior process vomer exceptionally slender long smoothly convex anteriorly trait shared anteroventrally directed premaxillae contain five long premaxillary teeth decrease size posteriorly case maxilla greatly enlarged medially constricts palate forms tooth plate accommodates parallel rows teeth occur maxilla considered lateral surface maxilla presents lateral flexion characteristic cheek swelling seen single rowed captorhinus aguti multi rowed addition septomaxilla characteristic family group however sports sculptured posterodorsal

maxillae labidosaurikos specimens found permian red beds north specimens found within hennessey shale crescent oklahoma well lower vale choza arroyo formations northern central locations yielded critical information early tetrapod evolution captorhinids extremely common locations correlated formed lower permian sometime within colored beds alternating distinctive redgreen margins formed nonmarine marine series sediments deposited contemporaneously alternative sedimentation indicates environment labidosaurikos inhabited margins aquatic reservoirs plentiful areas early permian able support substantial one aspects labidosaurikos biology behavior inferred limited fossil record morphology multi rowed dentition aspects skull support hypothesis herbivorous morphology dentition shows tooth plate teeth relatively small isodonts wear facets usually characteristic mandibular tooth rows rest maxillary tooth rows multiple contact points could motion pass one another necessary

ability quadrate slide anteroposteriorly articular however holotype skull provided stovall damaged articulating propaliny evident two captorhinids one called moradisaurus shares membership subfamily moradisaurinae morphology articular moradisaurus indicate labidosaurikos may capable propaliny articular fragments show great similarity moradisaurus basal osteological evidence herbivorous feeding
