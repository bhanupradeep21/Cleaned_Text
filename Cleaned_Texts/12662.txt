many interactions discussed article conflict communication bowlby studies children observed certain kinds events trigger anxiety people try relieve anxiety seeking closeness comfort three main sets conditions trigger anxiety children anxiety triggered conditions motivates individuals engage behaviors bring physically closer caregivers similar dynamic occurs adults relationships others care conditions involving personal wellbeing conditions involving relationship partner conditions involving environment trigger anxiety adults adults try alleviate anxiety seeking physical psychological closeness partners mikulincer shaver pereg developed model according model people experience anxiety try reduce anxiety seeking closeness relationship partners however partners may accept reject requests greater closeness leads people adopt different strategies reducing anxiety people engage three main strategies reduce anxiety first strategy called securitybased strategy diagram shows sequence events securitybased strategy person perceives something provokes anxiety person tries reduce anxiety seeking physical psychological closeness attachment attachment responds positively request closeness reaffirms sense security reduces anxiety person returns everyday activities second strategy called hyperactivation anxiety attachment strategy diagram shows sequence events hyperactivation strategy events begin way something provokes anxiety person tries reduce anxiety seeking physical psychological closeness attachment attachment rebuffs request greater closeness lack responsiveness increases feelings insecurity anxiety person gets locked cycle attachment person tries get closer attachment rejects request greater closeness leads person try even harder get closer followed another rejection attachment cycle ends situation shifts securitybased strategy attachment finally responds positively person switches attachmentavoidant strategy person gives getting positive response attachment third strategy called attachment avoidance strategy following diagram shows sequence events attachment avoidance strategy events begin way securitybased strategy person perceives something triggers anxiety person tries reduce anxiety seeking physical psychological closeness attachment attachment either unavailable rebuffs request closeness lack responsiveness fuels insecurity heightens anxiety person gives getting positive response attachment suppresses anxiety distances themself attachment mikulincer shaver pereg contend strategies regulating attachment anxiety different securitybased strategy leads positive thoughts positive explanations others behave particular way positive memories people events positive thoughts encourage creative responses difficult problems distressing situations hyperactivation attachment avoidance strategies lead negative thoughts less creativity handling problems stressful situations notable securitybased strategy contingent positive response attachment perspective would benefit people attachments willing able respond positively persons request closeness use securitybased strategies dealing anxiety people feel less anxious close attachments attachments provide support difficult situations support includes comfort assistance information people receive attachments attachment influences perception support others tendency seek support others adults relationships partner responds consistently positively requests closeness tend secure attachments return seek support adults relationships partner typically inconsistent reacting positively regularly reject requests support tend another attachment adults secure attachment style may trust attachments provide support attachments reliably offered support past may likely ask support needed adults insecure attachment styles often history supportive responses attachments may rely less attachments less likely ask support needed though may factors involved

discussed surprising attachment also relates jealousy bowlby observed attachment behaviors children triggered presence rival young children mere sight mother holding another baby arms enough elicit strong attachment behavior older child insists remaining close mother climbing onto lap often behaves though baby possible wellknown behavior special case child reacting mothers lack attention lack responsiveness fact however older child often reacts way even mother makes point attentive responsive suggests involved pioneer experiments levy also indicate mere presence baby mothers lap sufficient make older child much clinging bowlby page children see rival contending caregivers attention children try get close caregiver capture caregivers attention attempts get close caregiver capture caregivers attention indicate attachment system activated presence rival also provokes jealousy children jealousy provoked sibling rival described recent studies shown rival provoke jealousy young ages presence rival provoke jealousy infants young six months attachment jealousy triggered children presence rival attachment jealousy triggered perceptual cues adults absence attachment trigger need close proximity jealousy people believe attachment spending time rival presence rival also trigger greater need attachment jealousy differences attachment styles influence frequency pattern jealous expressions people fearfulavoidant attachment styles experience jealousy often view rivals threatening people secure attachment people different attachment styles also express jealousy different ways one study found securely attached participants felt anger intensely emotions relatively likely participants express especially toward attachment although anxious participants felt anger relatively intensely likely others express irritability relatively unlikely actually confront attachment might attributable feelings inferiority fear especially characteristic anxiously attached might expected inhibit direct expressions anger avoidants felt sadness relatively intensely secures studies avoidants relatively likely others work maintain selfesteem perhaps consequence relatively unlikely brought closer attachment sharpsteen kirkpatrick page subsequent study confirmed people different attachment styles experience express jealousy qualitatively different attachment thus plays important role jealous interactions influencing frequency manner attachments express jealousy dissolution important romantic relationships people usually go separation anxiety grieving grief process leads acceptance loss usually allows person move process people use different strategies cope securely attached individuals tend look support effective coping strategy avoidantly attached individuals tend devalue
