cognition mental action process acquiring knowledge understanding thought experience encompasses aspects intellectual functions processes perception attention thought imagination intelligence formation knowledge memory working memory judgment evaluation reasoning computation problemsolving decisionmaking comprehension production language cognitive processes use existing knowledge discover new knowledge cognitive processes analyzed different perspectives within different contexts notably fields linguistics musicology anesthesia neuroscience psychiatry psychology education philosophy anthropology biology systemics logic computer approaches analysis cognition embodied cognition synthesized developing field cognitive science progressively autonomous academic discipline word cognition dates back century meant thinking term comes latin noun cognitio examination learning knowledge derived verb cognosco compound con gnōscō know latter half gnōscō cognate greek verb gignósko γιγνώσκω know despite word cognitive dating back attention cognitive processes came eighteen centuries earlier beginning aristotle bc interest inner workings mind affect human experience aristotle focused cognitive areas pertaining memory perception mental imagery placed great importance ensuring studies based empirical evidence scientific information gathered observation conscientious two millennia later groundwork modern concepts cognition laid enlightenment thinkers john locke dugald stewart sought develop model mind ideas acquired remembered early nineteenth century cognitive models developed authors writing philosophy within medicine especially physicians seeking understand cure madness britain models studied academy scholars james sully university college london even used politicians considering national elementary education act psychology emerged burgeoning field study europe whilst also gaining following america scientists wilhelm wundt herman ebbinghaus mary whiton calkins william james would offer contributions study human cognition wilhelm wundt emphasized notion called introspection examining inner feelings individual introspection subject careful describe feelings objective manner possible order wundt find information though wundts contributions means minimal modern psychologists find methods subjective choose rely objective procedures experimentation make conclusions human cognitive process hermann ebbinghaus conducted cognitive studies mainly examined function capacity human memory ebbinghaus developed experiment constructed syllables made nonexistent words instance eas examined personal ability learn nonwords purposely chose nonwords opposed real words control influence preexisting experience words might symbolize thus enabling easier recollection ebbinghaus observed hypothesized number variables may affected ability learn recall nonwords created one reasons concluded amount time presentation list stimuli recitation recall ebbinghaus first record plot learning curve forgetting work heavily influenced study serial position effect memory discussed mary whiton calkins influential american pioneer realm psychology work also focused human memory capacity common theory called recency effect attributed studies recency effect also discussed subsequent experiment section tendency individuals able accurately recollect final items presented sequence stimuli calkins theory closely related aforementioned study conclusion memory experiments conducted hermann william james another pivotal figure history cognitive science james quite discontent wundts emphasis introspection ebbinghaus use nonsense stimuli instead chose focus human learning experience everyday life importance study cognition james significant

focused ones awareness ones strategies methods cognition called metacognition concept cognition gone several revisions development disciplines within psychology psychologists initially understood cognition governing human action information processing movement known cognitivism emerging behaviorist movement viewed cognition form cognitivism approached cognition form computation viewing mind machine consciousness executive however post cognitivism began emerge development cognitive science presented theories highlighted necessity cognitive action embodied extended producing dynamic processes development cognitive psychology arose psychology different theories began exploring dynamics concerning mind environment starting movement prior dualist paradigms prioritized cognition
