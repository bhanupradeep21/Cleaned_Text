xerocole greek xēros ˈzɪroʊs dry latin colere general term referring animal adapted live desert main challenges xerocoles must overcome lack water excessive heat conserve water avoid evaporation concentrate excretions ie urine adept conserving water obtaining food need drink escape desert heat xerocoles tend either nocturnal crepuscular active dawn dusk xerocoles developed variety mechanisms reduce water loss via evaporation mammalian xerocoles sweat much less nondesert counterparts example camel survive ambient temperatures high without kangaroo rat lacks sweat glands birds mammals desert oils surface skin waterproof inhibit desert insects use similar method cuticles waxy prevent water escaping however critical temperatures ex cockroaches wax molecules cuticle rearrange become permeable permit evaporative amphibious xerocoles species frog genus phyllomedusa waxlike coatings skin reduce water loss frogs secrete lipids glands skin skin begins dry move limbs glands backs wipe lipids desert amphibians frog genus cyclorana avoid desiccation burrowing underground dry periods forming cocoon shed skin rather sloughed skin remains attached create cocoon skin layers amass water impermeability though desert birds lack sweat glands still take advantage evaporative cooling panting cools trachea lungs gular flapping consists rapidly fluttering gular skin move air inner mouth kangaroo rats small mammals use evaporative cooling similar way air respired water evaporates nose cooling surface nasal passages approximately low temperature causes moisture condense partially making water process called respiratory heat exchange works best walls nasal passage large surface animals pour bodily fluids take advantage evaporative cooling xerocole birds storks new world vultures ibis urinate desert tortoises sometimes salivate neck front legs keep similarly many rodents marsupials lick spread saliva though remains effective short time requires fur become excrete nitrogenous waste products mammals amphibians excrete urea diluted xerocoles adapted make urine concentrated possible ie use least amount water dissolve urea desert mammals longer deeply inset well smaller fewer cortical juxtamedullary glomeruli glomeruli capillary networks fluid waste extracted blood turn leads smaller glomerular filtration rate whole less water transferred blood kidneys desert mammals also better adapted reabsorbing water tubular fluid though fewer glomeruli xerocole larger juxtamedullary glomeruli cortical glomeruli former playing important role concentrating whereas opposite true nonxerocoles desert mammals also longer loops henle structures whose efficiency concentrating urine directly proportional efficiency loops henle augmented increased antidiuretic hormone desert amphibians store nitrogen aquatic ones enough water available excrete nitrogen african reed frog store excess nitrogen iridophore pigmented granules skin converting nitrogen guanine makes majority iridophores reptiles birds insects amphibious species excrete nitrogenous waste uric acid rather urea uric acid less toxic urea need dissolved water excreted largely animal feces water xerocoles however reabsorb water gut produce much drier example kangaroo rats feces contain much water nondesert insects rectal gland also absorbs water insects excrete dry birds along vertebrates ureter rectum lead cloaca whose walls also absorb camels conserve water closing orifice stomach create two compartments one water one seedeating rodents maintain low metabolic rate reduce water lost respiration prevent burrow overheating rodent mothers produce concentrated milk young eat youngs dilute urine feces regain water lost desert canids kangaroos eat youngs excrement australian waterholding frog conserves water retaining urine bladder swelling like balloon uses bladder water reserve dry xerocoles get substantial amount hygroscopic water food many feed moisturefilled plants aardvark obtains water wild cucumbers cucumis camel eats succulents bushes winter getting enough water go two months without oryx eats acacia leaves late night water content highest hot arid daytime leaves water cooler humid night leaves water xerocoles able obtain water halophytic saltwater plants metabolize high amounts oxalic acid produce concentrated urine chiseltoothed kangaroo rat also mitigates saltiness halophyte eats shadscale using broad sharp lower incisors scrape leaves salty outerlayer reach lesssalty carnivores derive water preys meat insectivores aardwolf type hyena southern grasshopper mouse thus largely independent free xerocoles obtain large percentage water metabolic processes used break food water gained fat nearly twice amount gained carbohydrates former contains hydrogen determines amount water produced water gained metabolism enough offset water lost evaporation lungs increases due need oxygen break xerocoles hare large ears help keep cool ears stand blood flow increases numerous vessels heat however cape hare near abu dhabi uae sits shade drapes ears erecting weather would absorb desert animals less fat nondesert counterparts fat would act insulation retaining heat fat localized camels hump bisons terms fur however desert animals thick insulating coats impede conduction heat towards coats uniformly distributed rather leave sparsely covered patches called thermal windows axilla groin scrotum mammary glands heat dissipated thermal windows via convection similarly desert birds fewer feathers underwing flank heat stress induces birds raise wings increasing surface area exposed skin birds adjust feathers create dissipate insulating layer typified ostrich high temperatures ostrich elevates long dorsal feathers create barrier solar radiation allowing air move across skins surface cool nights feathers lower interlock trapping insulating layer small xerocoles live burrows avoid desert burrows act microenvironments deeper cm surface maintain humidity temperatures regardless external animals seal burrows keep ectotherms also use burrows means keep warm cold desert ectotherms usually small unable store body heat quickly take external temperature environment necessitates controlled microenvironments example reptiles able operate temperatures exceeding optima become sluggish cold spend nights burrows crevices create warm environments quickly generating metabolic desert lizards usually use animals burrows meet desert rodents except ground squirrels chipmunks amphibians usually nocturnal well many xerocoles diurnal reduce activity midday increase mornings xerocoles change activity patterns depending season nocturnal ants example become diurnal colder many xerocoles especially rodents estivate summer becoming desert amphibians estivate underground year unlike hibernation leads state torpor estivation induces lethargy go unnoticed animals body temperature xerocoles usually light sandy color means reflect solar radiation reduce heat change color seasons reflect sunlight summer addaxes change graybrown nearly iguanid lizards change color much smaller time scale varying melanin concentration become darker burrowing lighter basking desert iguana zebratailed lizard become pale appear shine due amount light desert lizards also black peritoneal lining abdominal cavity absorb uv radiation prevent damaging internal shade shrubbery provides resting spots diurnal lizards nesting sites birds well temporary oases diurnal rodents skirt among shady large animals camels carnivores also spend hottest parts day desert animals camel addax kangaroo rat large feet prevent sinking fennec fox extra fur soles feet give traction protect hot animals arid environments slender long legs giving speed travel long distances food three main vulnerabilities sand eyes ears keep sand eyes xerocoles including reptiles birds amphibians nictitating membrane eyes third transparent eyelid protects cornea blowing sand dislodge reptiles also eyes size pinholes protected keep sand ears mammals camel sand cat long hairs protruding camel saiga antelope also adaptations protect noses sand former narrow nostrils close latter large nose nostrils set wide apart far back prevent sand entering reptile diggers nostrils face upwards instead forwards xerocoles travel long distances food water often adapted speed long limbs feet prevent sinking sand overall slender little cover protect predators desert animals also use speed defense mechanism example desert jackrabbit run much faster coyote ordinary wolf coyote attempt chase realize hopelessness following animals known xerocoles httpsenwikipediaorgwikixerocole
