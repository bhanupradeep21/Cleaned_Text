eucritta meaning true creature extinct genus stemtetrapod viséan epoch carboniferous period name type species e melanolimnetes true creature black lagoon homage horror film creature black eucritta possessed many features common generalized carboniferous tetrapods tetrapod relatives large amount features plesiomorphic meaning resembled primitive condition acquired fourlimbed vertebrates amphibians broad sense first appeared short wide skull large eyes stronglybuilt limbs eucritta proportionally resembled balanerpeton contemporary terrestrial tetrapod one earliest members temnospondyli successful tetrapod group may produced modern amphibians however eucritta lacked key temnospondyl adaptations certain adaptations reptiliomorphs tetrapod lineage would lead reptiles amniotes cases possesses certain characteristics common closest relatives may baphetids megalocephalus based possession slight embayments front edge eye eucrittas mosaic possession characters seen baphetids anthracosaurs early reptiliomorphs temnospondyls suggests three groups diverged carboniferous rather earlier limb proportions support terrestrial preferences skeletal features suggest

radiating ridges visible edges small pits center eucritta teeth upper jaw teeth largest shortly front jaw around teeth larger specimens subtle rounded notches outer front corner orbit notches formally known anteroventral embayments develop baphetid stemtetrapods like megalocephalus loxomma giving keyholeshaped orbits otherwise front portion skull fairly typical eucritta similar contemporary early temnospondyl rear skull characteristic region broad possessing large rounded temporal notches although notches wide orbits skull possesses bones characterize early tetrapods even oftenlost intertemporal bone edge temporal notch formed curved supratemporal bone rather squamosal similar baphetids unlike balanerpeton supratemporal contacts postparietal rear edge skull plesiomorphic feature contrast anthracosaurs allow parietal tabular bones contact instead postorbital bone rounded smoothly crescentshaped contrast larger angular bone palate roof mouth closed bone lacking large interpterygoid vacuities characteristic temnospondyls palate covered striations tiny toothlike structures known denticles broad front portion palate also possessed evidence large fangs vomer palatine

tapering near pelvic area cervical neck ribs hand long expanded tips expansion also occurs first dorsal ribs rows needlelike belly scutes known gastralia converge midline due multiple specimens various sizes preserving skull material eucritta one carboniferous stegocephalians known growth series skull experienced isometric growth ie proportions stayed relatively consistent though orbits experienced negative allometric growth ie became proportionally smaller larger specimens apparently eucritta lived habitat preserved east kirkton multiple life stages contemporaries balanerpeton lived adults eucritta fairly long welldeveloped limbs may indicate decent degree terrestriality femur thigh bone length skull comparable ratio contemporaries eldeceeon balanerpeton eucritta several characteristics suggest utilized buccal pumping form breathing also utilized modern amphibians uses neck muscles inflate mouth air pump air lungs short broad skull straight ribs generally considered correspond form breathing features present eucritta several east kirkton stegocephalians eldeceeon silvanerpeton taller skulls drastically curved ribs suggests used costal ventilation form breathing based inflating deflating lungs using ribs andor diaphragm costal ventilation utilized modern amniotes like mammals reptiles eucritta already recognized unique animal original description phylogenetic
