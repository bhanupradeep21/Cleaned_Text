peninsula near norilsk krasnoyarsk krai russia soviet union specific name menneri honors russian paleontologist geologist vladimir vasilyevich menner discovered fossil sent russian paleontologist nestor ivanovich novojilov erected date description considered inaccurate inexhaustive based best preserved novojilov reported presence paired tubercles center second fourth sixth tergites menneri

formation krasnoyarsk british geologist paleobiologist james c lamsdell noted presence paddlelike sixth appendage threesegmented fused buckler ninesegmented postabdomen menneri could fact represent chasmataspidid questioning position menneri tylopterella paleontologists david j marshall lamsdell evgeniy shpinev simon j braddy recognized menneri new separate genus chasmataspidid due body size

fossilization organism named dvulikiaspis composed russian word двуликий dvulikij twofaced referring longlasting misidentification menneri ancient greek suffix ἀσπίς aspis shield translated twofaced shield also noted features almost straight segment boundaries shared another chasmataspidid loganamaraspis although latter probably paddlelike sixth dvulikiaspis classified part family diploaspididae one two families order chasmataspidida includes one species menneri early devonian siberia menneri originally recognized species stylonurus moved tylopterella due apparent presence paired tubercles tergites conclusions done novojilov criticized lamsdell already commented possibility menneri could represent chasmataspidid demonstrated redescribed new genus chasmataspidid removed eurypterida noting distinction diploaspidids suggesting relationship description new ordovician chasmataspidid hoplitaspis hiawathai suggested dvulikiaspis hoplitaspis loganamaraspis could represent new family separated diploaspididae genera share proportionality body postabdomen comprises majority body length poorly differentiated buckler paddle projecting front midpoint prosoma although certain
