glycogen storage disease type ii also called pompe disease formerly known gsdiia autosomal recessive metabolic damages muscle nerve cells throughout body caused accumulation glycogen lysosome due deficiency lysosomal acid alphaglucosidase enzyme gsdii danon disease glycogen storage diseases defect lysosomal metabolism pompe disease first glycogen storage disease identified dutch pathologist j c pompe buildup glycogen causes progressive muscle weakness myopathy throughout body affects various body tissues particularly heart skeletal muscles liver nervous system infantileonset iopd form

feeding difficulties failure needed iopd patients classified crossreactive immunological material crim status found important predictor clinical response patients produce gaa protein referred crim negative therefore develop high sustained antibody titers enzyme replacement therapy immunemodulation immunotherapy found effective treatment prevent immune response ert main clinical findings include
