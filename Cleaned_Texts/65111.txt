product fieldready march clinical isolation vaccination remain effective means prevent spread sars preventive measures include many public health interventions made try control spread disease mainly spread respiratory droplets air either inhaled deposited surfaces subsequently transferred bodys mucous membranes interventions included earlier detection disease isolation people infected droplet contact precautions use personal protective equipment ppe including masks isolation metaanalysis found medical professionals wearing masks could reduce chances getting sick compared screening process also put place airports monitor air travel affected sarscov infectious severely ill patients usually occurs second week illness delayed infectious period meant quarantine highly effective people

nursing precautions taken necessary contact patients limit chances medical personnel becoming certain cases natural ventilation opening doors windows documented help decreasing indoor concentration virus serious damage caused sars may due bodys immune system reacting known cytokine vaccines help immune system create enough antibodies also help decrease risk side effects like arm pain fever

american teacher james earl salisbury hong around time jiang yanyong made accusations regarding undercounting cases beijing military intense pressure chinese officials allowed international officials investigate situation revealed problems plaguing aging mainland chinese healthcare system including increasing decentralization red tape inadequate many healthcare workers affected nations risked

advisory committee described public health officials preparedness emergency response time outbreak basic minimal critics response often cite poorly outlined enforced protocol protecting healthcare workers identifying infected patients major contributing factor continued spread virus atmosphere fear uncertainty surrounding outbreak resulted staffing issues area hospitals healthcare workers elected resign rather risk exposure sarscitation needed late february italian doctor carlo urbani called french hospital hanoi look johnny chen american businessman fallen ill doctors thought bad case
