absolute threshold hearing ath also known absolute hearing threshold auditory threshold minimum sound level pure tone average human ear normal hearing hear sound present absolute threshold relates sound heard absolute threshold discrete point therefore classed point sound elicits response specified percentage threshold hearing generally reported reference rms sound pressure micropascals ie db spl corresponding sound intensity atmosphere approximately quietest sound young human undamaged hearing detect threshold hearing frequencydependent shown ears sensitivity best frequencies khz threshold reaches low db measurement absolute hearing threshold provides basic information auditory tools used collect information called psychophysical methods perception physical stimulus sound psychological response sound several psychophysical methods measure absolute threshold vary certain aspects identical firstly test defines stimulus specifies manner subject respond test presents sound listener manipulates stimulus level predetermined pattern absolute threshold defined statistically often average obtained hearing procedures use series trials trial using singleinterval yesno paradigm means sound may present absent single interval listener say whether thought stimulus interval contain stimulus called catch classical methods date back century first described gustav theodor fechner work elements three methods traditionally used testing subjects perception stimulus method limits method constant stimuli method two intervals presented listener one tone one without tone listener must decide interval tone number intervals increased may cause problems listener remember interval contained unlike classical methods pattern changing stimuli preset adaptive methods subjects response previous stimuli determines level subsequent stimulus simple method consists series descending ascending trial runs turning points reversals stimulus level increased subject respond decreased response occurs similar method limits stimuli adjusted predetermined steps obtaining six eight reversals first one discarded threshold defined average midpoints remaining runs experiments shown method provides produce accurate results simple method modified increasing size steps descending runs eg method bekesys method contains aspects classical methods staircase methods level stimulus automatically varied fixed rate subject asked press button stimulus detectable button pressed level automatically decreased motordriven attenuator increased button pushed threshold thus tracked listeners calculated mean midpoints runs recorded hysteresis defined roughly lagging effect behind cause measuring hearing thresholds always easier subject follow tone audible decreasing amplitude detect tone previously inaudible topdown influences mean subject expects hear sound therefore motivated higher levels concentration bottomup theory explains unwanted external environment internal eg heartbeat noise results subject responding sound signaltonoise ratio certain point practice means measuring threshold sounds decreasing amplitude point sound becomes inaudible always lower point returns audibility phenomenon known hysteresis effect psychometric function represents probability certain listeners response function magnitude particular sound characteristic give example could probability curve subject detecting sound presented function sound level stimulus presented listener one would expect sound would either audible inaudible resulting doorstep function reality grey area exists listener uncertain whether actually heard sound responses inconsistent resulting psychometric function psychometric function sigmoid function characterised shaped graphical representation two methods used measure minimal audible therefore absolute threshold hearing minimal audible field involves subject sitting sound field stimulus presented via sound level measured position subjects head subject sound minimal audible pressure involves presenting stimuli via measuring sound pressure subjects ear canal using small probe two different methods produce different minimal audible field thresholds often db better minimal audible pressure thought difference due minimal audible field minimal audible pressure important considering calibration issues also illustrate human hearing sensitive khz temporal summation relationship stimulus duration intensity presentation time less second auditory sensitivity changes duration sound becomes less second threshold intensity decreases db duration tone burst increased ms example suppose quietest sound subject hear db spl sound presented duration ms sound presented duration ms quietest sound heard subject goes db spl words signal shortened factor level signal must increased much db heard subject ear operates energy detector samples amount energy present within certain time frame certain amount energy needed within time frame reach threshold done using higher intensity less time using lower intensity time sensitivity sound improves signal duration increases ms threshold remains timpani ear operates sound pressure sensor also microphone works way sensitive
