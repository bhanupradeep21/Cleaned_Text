herpes gladiatorum one infectious herpescaused diseases transmissible skintoskin contact disease first described new england journal medicine caused contagious infection human herpes simplex virus type commonly causes oral herpes cold sores another strain usually causes genital herpes although strains similar either cause herpes location disease commonly passed normal human contact strongly associated contact sporting clubs relatively names disease herpes rugbiorum rugby football wrestlers herpes mat pox wrestling one largest outbreaks ever among highschool wrestlers fourweek intensive training camp hsv identified wrestlers lesions head percent wrestlers extremities percent trunk physical symptoms sometimes recur previous adolescent seroconversion would preclude herpes gladiatorum stress trauma recognized triggers person would likely infect others herpes gladiatorum characterized rash clusters sometimes painful fluidfilled blisters often neck chest face stomach legs infection often accompanied lymphadenopathy enlargement lymph nodes fever sore throat often accompanying symptoms much inconvenience actual skin blisters rashcitation needed blister contains infectious virus particles virions close contact particularly abrasive contact found contact sports causes infected blisters burst pass infection along autoinoculation selfinfection occur selfcontact leading infection multiple sites herpes gladiatorum symptoms may last weeks occur first outbreak pronounced recurrences ailment symptoms milder even lesions still tend occur recurrent infections scabs may form days yet lesions still considered infectious days starting oral antiviral healing takes place without leaving scars possible condition evolves asymptomatically sores never presentcitation needed herpes gladiatorum skin infection primarily caused herpes simplex virus virus infects cells epidermal layer skin initial viral replication occurs entry site skin mucous infections caused hsv type virus may primary studies show even though individuals exposed virus get infected develop sores well types sores appear within two twenty days exposure usually last longer ten days primary infections usually heal completely without leaving scars virus caused infection first place remains body latent state reason people experience recurrences even condition taken care virus moves nerve cells reactivatecitation needed condition recurred normally mild infection infection may triggered several external factors sun exposure traumavague infection either type hsv viruses occurs following way first virus comes contact damaged skin goes nuclei cells reproduces blisters ulcers formed skin result destruction infected cells latent form virus reproduce replicate recurrence triggered different factorscitation needed herpes gladiatorum transmitted direct contact skin lesions caused herpes simplex main reason condition often found wrestlers believed virus may transmitted infected wrestlers mats still subject research since virus live long enough outside body order able cause infection direct contact infected person infected secretions undoubtedly main way virus may transmittedcitation needed also believed wearing abrasive clothing may increase chances get infected type virus shirts made polyester cotton may cause frictions lead small breaks skin makes easier contract infection studies athletes wearing cotton shirts showed decrease number herpes gladiatorum spread facilitated sore present happen absence well patients may know virus present skin experience socalled prodromal symptoms include itching tingling skin right blisters lesions appear virus may spread since first symptoms appear lesions completely healed incubation period situated days means person experience symptoms within days contracted infection type virus may transmitted even symptoms yet present individuals mild symptoms may taken herpes symptoms patient may recognize asymptomatic transmission occurs infection spread herpes gladiatorum caused herpes simplex virus shingles also manifesting skin rashes blisters caused different virus herpes zoster agents may cause skin infections example ringworm primarily due fungal dermatophyte tonsurans impetigo cellulitis folliculitis carbuncles usually due staphylococcus aureus betahemolytic streptococcus bacteria less common forms potentially antiviral treatments effect nonviral cases bacterial infections must treated antibiotics fungal infections antifungal key measures prevent outbreaks disease maintaining hygiene standards using screening exclude persons suspicious infections engaging contact sports skin check performed practice competition takes place identify individuals evaluated necessary treated healthcare certain situations ie participating wrestling camps consider placing participants valacyclovir daily duration camp study shown reduction outbreaks probable prevention contracting virus medication must started days participation ensure proper concentrations herpes outbreaks treated antiviral medications like acyclovir valacyclovir famcyclovir available tablet oral antiviral medication often used prophylactic suppress prevent outbreaks recommended dosage suppression therapy recurrent outbreaks mg valacyclovir day mg acyclovir taken twice day addition preventing outbreaks medications greatly reduce chance infecting someone patient outbreakcitation needed often people regular outbreaks anywhere times per year stress virus lies next nerve cells weakened immune system due temporary permanent illness also spark outbreaks people become infected fail ever single outbreak although remain carriers virus pass disease uninfected person asymptomatic shedding virus active skin rashes blisters appearcitation needed use antiviral medications shown effective preventing acquisition herpes specific usage agents focus wrestling camps intense contact individuals occur daily basis several weeks also used large outbreaks seasonal competition research needs performed verify efficacycitation needed httpsenwikipediaorgwikiherpesgladiatorum
