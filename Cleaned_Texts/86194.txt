mitochondrial permeability transition pore mptp mptp also referred ptp mtp mtp protein formed inner membrane mitochondria certain pathological conditions traumatic brain injury stroke opening allows increase permeability mitochondrial membranes molecules less daltons molecular weight induction permeability transition pore mitochondrial membrane permeability transition mpt mpt lead mitochondrial swelling cell death apoptosis necrosis depending particular biological mptp originally discovered haworth found involved neurodegeneration hepatotoxicity reyerelated agents cardiac necrosis nervous muscular dystrophies among deleterious events inducing cell damage mpt one major causes cell death variety conditions example key neuronal cell death excitotoxicity overactivation glutamate receptors causes excessive calcium entry mpt also appears play key role damage caused ischemia occurs heart attack however research shown mpt pore remains closed ischemia opens tissues reperfused blood ischemic playing role reperfusion injury mpt also thought underlie cell death induced reyes syndrome since chemicals cause syndrome like salicylate valproate cause mpt may also play role mitochondrial cells exposed toxic amounts ionophores also undergo mpt death mpt modulation widely studied little known structure initial experiments szabó zoratti proposed mpt may comprise voltage dependent anion channel vdac molecules nevertheless hypothesis shown incorrect mitochondria still capable undergo hypothesis halestraps group convincingly suggested mpt formed inner membrane adenine nucleotide translocase ant genetic ablation protein still led mpt thus mptp components identified far tspo previously known peripheral benzodiazepine receptor located mitochondrial outer membrane cyclophilind mitochondrial mice lacking gene cyclophilind develop normally cells undergo cyclosporin asensitive mpt resistant necrotic death ischemia overload free however cells die response stimuli kill cells apoptosis suggesting mpt control cell death agents transiently block mpt include immune suppressant cyclosporin csa mevalcsa nonimmunosuppressant derivative csa another nonimmunosuppressive agent borate bongkrekic acid alisporivir also known newly synthetitised mpt blocker developed trophos company currently phase clinical various factors enhance likelihood mptp opening mitochondria central nervous system high levels within mitochondria cause mpt pore possibly binds activates binding sites matrix side mpt induction also due dissipation difference voltage across inner mitochondrial membrane known transmembrane potential δψ neurons astrocytes contribution membrane potential mpt induction complex presence free radicals another result excessive intracellular calcium concentrations also cause mpt pore factors increase likelihood mptp induced include presence certain fatty inorganic however factors open pore without though high enough concentrations alone induce stress endoplasmic reticulum factor triggering conditions cause pore close remain closed include acidic high concentrations high concentrations high concentrations nadh divalent cations like also inhibit mpt compete binding sites matrix andor cytoplasmic side multiple studies found mpt key factor damage neurons caused induction mpt increases mitochondrial membrane permeability causes mitochondria become depolarized meaning δψ abolished δψ lost protons molecules able flow across outer mitochondrial membrane loss δψ interferes production adenosine triphosphate atp cells main source energy mitochondria must electrochemical gradient provide driving force atp production cell damage resulting conditions neurodegenerative diseases head injury opening mitochondrial permeability transition pore greatly reduce atp production cause atp synthase begin hydrolysing rather producing produces energy deficit cell needs atp fuel activity ion pumps mpt also allows leave mitochondrion place stress nearby mitochondria activate harmful calciumdependent proteases calpain reactive oxygen species ros also produced result opening mpt pore mpt allow antioxidant molecules glutathione exit mitochondria reducing organelles ability neutralize ros addition electron transport chain etc may produce free radicals due loss components etc cytochrome c loss etc components lead escape electrons chain reduce molecules form free radicals mpt causes mitochondria become permeable molecules smaller kda inside draw water increasing organelles osmolar event may lead mitochondria swell may cause outer membrane rupture releasing cytochrome cytochrome c turn cause cell go apoptosis commit suicide activating proapoptotic factors researchers contend mitochondrial membrane rupture leads cytochrome c release rather another mechanism translocation molecule channels outer membrane involve much research found fate cell insult depends extent mpt mpt occurs slight extent cell may recover whereas occurs may undergo apoptosis occurs even larger degree cell likely undergo necrotic cell although mptp studied mainly mitochondria mammalian sources mitochondria diverse species also undergo similar occurrence easily detected purpose still remains elusive speculated regulated opening mpt pore may minimize cell injury causing rosproducing mitochondria undergo selective lysosomedependent mitophagy nutrient starvation severe stresspathologic conditions mptp opening would trigger injured cell death mainly controversy question whether mptp able exist harmless lowconductance state lowconductance state would induce would allow certain molecules ions cross mitochondrial membranes lowconductance state may allow small ions like leave mitochondria quickly order aid cycling healthy case mpt may harmful side effect abnormal activity usually beneficial mptp mptp detected mitochondria yeasts saccharomyces birds guinea primitive vertebrates baltic permeability transition evident mitochondria sources sensitivity classic
