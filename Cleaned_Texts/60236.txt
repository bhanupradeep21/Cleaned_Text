mollarets meningitis recurrent chronic inflammation protective membranes covering brain spinal cord known collectively meninges since mollarets meningitis recurrent benign noncancerous aseptic meningitis also referred benign recurrent lymphocytic named pierre mollaret french neurologist first described although chronic meningitis defined irritation inflammation meninges persisting weeks associated pleocytosis cerebrospinal cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities may detectable entire diagnosis elusive helbok et al note reality many weeks even months pass diagnosis established many cases signs symptoms chronic meningitis persist periods longer weeks even progress continuing deterioration e headache neck stiffness even low grade fever impairment consciousness epileptic seizures neurological signs symptoms may evolve mollarets meningitis characterized chronic recurrent episodes headache stiff neck meningismus fever cerebrospinal fluid csf pleocytosis large endothelial cells neutrophil granulocytes lymphocytes attacks separated symptomfree periods weeks years spontaneous remission symptoms signs many people side effects bouts vary chronic daily headaches aftereffects

patients may may herpes simplex virus likely common cause mollarets although long time cause mollarets meningitis known recent work associated problem herpes simplex viruses particularly cases mollarets resulting varicella zoster virus infection diagnosed polymerase chain reaction pcr documented cases pcr herpes simplex patients also report frequent shingles outbreakscitation needed

research pcr negative individuals mollarets even episodes severe symptoms example kojima et al published case study individual hospitalized repeatedly clinical symptoms including genital herpes lesions however patient sometimes negative pcr even though meningitis symptoms severe treatment acyclovir successful indicating herpes virus cause acyclovir treatment choice mollarets meningitis patients see drastic difference often get sick others dont often treatment means managing symptoms pain management strengthening immune systemcitation needed ihmf recommends patients benign recurrent lymphocytic meningitis receive intravenous acyclovir amount mgkg every hours days recently secondgeneration antiherpetic drugs valacyclovir famciclovir used successfully treat patients mollarets additionally reported indomethacin administered amount mg times per day meals mg every hours resulted faster recovery patients well extended symptomfree intervals recurring mollaret meningitis attacks generally resolve within years first occurrence patients live disease much suppressive antiviral therapy patients mollarets report experiencing fewer attacks however flare ups throughout disease
