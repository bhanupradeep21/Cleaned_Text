cerebellar abiotrophy ca also called cerebellar cortical abiotrophy cca genetic neurological disease animals best known affect certain breeds horses dogs cats also develop humans develops neurons known purkinje cells located cerebellum brain begin die cells affect balance coordination critical role play brain purkinje layer allows communication granular molecular cortical layers cerebellum put simply without purkinje cells animal loses sense space distance making balance coordination difficult people damage cerebellum experience symptoms like unsteady gait poor muscle control trouble speaking abiotrophy means loss vital nutritive factor cause cerebellar abiotrophy known thought due intrinsic metabolic cases purkinje neurons begin die shortly animal born condition noticeable animal

intelligence mildly affected animals theory live normal lifespan however affected animals quite accidentprone reason many animals develop cerebellar abiotrophy particularly horses euthanized humane reasons horses may experience difficulty stepping objects run fences fall easily even allowed mature full growth generally considered unsafe ride dogs may need lifetime assistance tasks climbing horses symptoms may worsen time onset six months severe enough mandate euthanasia stabilize time dog breeds symptoms appear progressively worsen research consistent point also evidence affected animals partially compensate condition cognitively learning alternative methods moving determine distance thus appear improve become less accidentprone cerebellar abiotrophy best known condition
