fetus foetus ˈfiːtəs pl fetuses feti foetuses foeti unborn offspring develops animal following embryonic development fetal stage development takes place human prenatal development fetal development begins ninth week fertilization eleventh week gestational age continues birth prenatal development continuum clear defining feature distinguishing embryo fetus however fetus characterized presence major body organs though yet fully developed functional yet situated final anatomical location word fetus plural fetuses feti related latin fētus offspring bringing forth hatching greek φυτώ plant word fetus used ovid metamorphoses book line predominant british irish commonwealth spelling foetus use since least spelling oe arose late latin distinction vowel sounds oe e lost spelling common commonwealth nations except medical literature fetus used classical spelling fetus used canada united states addition fetus standard english spelling throughout world medical spelling faetus also used humans fetal stage starts nine weeks start fetal stage fetus typically millimetres length crownrump weighs head makes nearly half size breathinglike movements fetus necessary stimulation lung development rather obtaining heart hands feet brain organs present beginning development minimal point development uncontrolled movements twitches occur muscles brain pathways begin woman pregnant first time nulliparous typically feels fetal movements weeks whereas woman given birth typically feel movements end fifth month fetus cm long amount body fat rapidly increases lungs fully mature

phosphorus become abundant fingernails reach end fingertips lanugo fine hair begins disappear gone except upper arms shoulders small breast buds present sexes head hair becomes coarse thicker birth imminent occurs around week fertilization fetus considered fullterm weeks sufficiently developed life outside may cm length born control movement limited birth purposeful voluntary movements continue develop much variation growth human fetus fetal size less expected condition known intrauterine growth restriction also called fetal growth restriction factors affecting fetal growth maternal placental maternal factors include maternal weight body mass index nutritional state emotional stress toxin exposure including tobacco alcohol heroin drugs also harm fetus ways uterine blood flow placental factors include size microstructure densities architecture umbilical blood flow transporters binding proteins nutrient utilization nutrient production fetal factors include fetal genome nutrient production hormone output also female fetuses tend weigh less males full fetal growth often classified follows small gestational age sga appropriate gestational age aga large gestational age sga result low birth weight although premature birth also result low birth weight low birth weight increases risk perinatal mortality death shortly birth asphyxia hypothermia polycythemia hypocalcemia immune dysfunction neurologic abnormalities longterm health problems sga may associated growth delay may instead associated absolute stunting growth fetal viability refers point fetal development fetus may survive outside womb lower limit viability approximately months gestational age usually sharp limit development age weight fetus automatically becomes according data survival rates babies

circulatory system biological necessity since mammalian tissues grow cell layers thick without active blood supply prenatal circulation blood different postnatal circulation mainly lungs use fetus obtains oxygen nutrients mother placenta umbilical blood placenta carried fetus umbilical vein half enters fetal ductus venosus carried inferior vena cava half enters liver proper inferior border

mother antibodies transfer antibodies humans begins early fifth month gestational age certainly sixth developing fetus highly susceptible anomalies growth metabolism increasing risk birth defects one area concern lifestyle choices made diet especially important early stages development studies show supplementation persons diet folic acid reduces risk spina bifida neural tube defects another dietary concern whether breakfast eaten skipping breakfast could lead extended periods lower normal nutrients maternal blood leading higher risk prematurity birth defects alcohol consumption may increase risk development fetal alcohol syndrome condition leading intellectual disability smoking pregnancy may also lead miscarriages low birth weight grams pounds ounces low birth weight concern medical providers due tendency infants described premature weight higher risk secondary medical problems xrays known possible adverse effects development fetus risks need weighed congenital disorders acquired birth infants certain congenital heart defects survive long ductus remains open cases closure ductus delayed administration prostaglandins permit sufficient time surgical correction anomalies conversely cases patent ductus arteriosus ductus properly close drugs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis used encourage closure surgery avoided heart birth defects include ventricular septal defect pulmonary atresia tetralogy fallot abdominal pregnancy result death fetus rarely resolved lead formation lithopedion existence implications fetal pain debated politically academically according conclusions review published evidence regarding capacity fetal pain limited indicates fetal perception pain unlikely third however developmental neurobiologists argue establishment thalamocortical connections months essential event regard fetal perception needed nevertheless perception pain involves sensory emotional cognitive factors impossible know pain experienced even known thalamocortical connections authors argue fetal pain possible second half pregnancy evidence suggests perception pain fetus occurs well late whether fetus ability feel pain suffering part abortion united states example antiabortion advocates proposed legislation would require providers abortions inform pregnant women fetuses may feel pain procedure would require person accept decline anesthesia abortion human pregnancy legal andor tolerated countries although gestational time limits normally prohibit lateterm fetus stage prenatal development viviparous organisms stage lies embryogenesis many vertebrates fetal stages ranging mammals many fish addition invertebrates bear live young including species many arthropods fetuses mammals situated similarly human fetus within however anatomy area surrounding fetus different litterbearing animals compared humans fetus litterbearing animal surrounded placental tissue lodged along one two long uteri instead single uterus found human female development birth varies considerably among animals even among mammals altricial species relatively helpless birth require considerable parental care protection contrast precocial animals born open eyes hair large brains immediately mobile somewhat able flee defend predators primates precocial birth exception duration gestation placental mammals varies days jumping mice months generally speaking fetuses larger land mammals require longer gestation benefits fetal stage means young developed born therefore may need less parental care may better able fend however carrying fetuses exerts costs mother must take extra food fuel growth offspring whose mobility comfort may affected especially toward end fetal stage instances presence fetal stage may allow organisms time birth offspring
