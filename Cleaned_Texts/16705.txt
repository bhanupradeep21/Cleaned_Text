hallucinations participants general population people diagnosed schizophrenia psychosis related mental illnesses relationship culture relation hallucinations diagnostic statistical manual mental disorders states transient hallucinatory experiences may occur without mental disorder put differently short temporary hallucinations exclusive diagnosed mental study people schizophrenia diagnosis seven countries origin austria poland lithuania georgia pakistan nigeria ghana researchers found total participants n disclosed experienced auditory hallucinations last year hallucinations date study found highest rates auditory hallucinations visual hallucinations west african countries ghana ghana sample n auditory hallucinations reported visual hallucinations reported nigeria sample n auditory hallucinations reported visual hallucinations reported findings line studies found visual hallucinations reported traditional cultures published study hearing voices different cultures social kindling hypothesis compared experiences three groups participants met criteria schizophrenia n three places including san mateo california usa accra ghana africa chennai india south study researchers found distinct differences among participants experience voices san mateo ca sample three participants referred experience hearing voices diagnostic labels even used diagnostic criteria readily also connected hearing voices accra ghana sample almost participants referenced diagnosis instead spoke voices spiritual meaning well psychiatric chennai india sample similarly ghana interviewees participants reference diagnosis many participants voices heard people knew people related voices another key finding identified research study voicehearing experience outside west may less finally researchers found different cultural expectations mind way people expect thoughts feelings private accessible spirits persons could attributed differences found across participants qualitative study selfidentified māori participants subcategorized within one following groups including tangata māori people seeking wellnessservice users kaumatuakuia elders kai mahi cultural support workers managers mental health services clinicians psychiatrists nurses psychologists students undergraduate postgraduate psychology students researchers interviewed participants asked understanding experiences could considered psychotic labelled schizophrenic questions would ask someone came seeking help asked understanding terms schizophrenia participants also people either worked psychosis schizophrenia experienced psychosis study researchers found participants understood experiences labelled psychotic schizophrenic multiple taken directly article researchers wrote one māori way understanding psychotic instead part understanding experiences participants combined biological explanations māori spiritual beliefs preference cultural psychosocial example participants spoke psychotic experiences sometimes sign matakite giftedness one kaumatuakuia elders quoted saying never wanted accept said isnt isnt matakite wouldnt stop truth knew help people didnt want responsibility helped understand told important finding highlighted study studies done world health organization found developing countries nonwestern experience far higher rates recovery schizophrenia western researchers articulate findings may due culturally specific meaning created experience schizophrenia psychosis hearing voices well positive expectations around recovery research found auditory hallucinations hallucinations broadly necessarily symptom severe mental health instead might commonplace assumed also experienced people general according literature review prevalence voicehearers general population literature review compared studies auditory hallucinations participants nine countries found differences prevalence voicehearing adult general population attributed true variations based gender ethnicity environmental studies took place nine countries studies took place united kingdom philippines united states sweden france germany italy netherlands new zealand literature review highlighted studies analyzed data gender reported higher frequency women reporting hallucinatory experiences although generally speaking hallucinations including auditory strongly related psychotic diagnoses schizophrenia presence hallucinations exclusively mean someone psychotic schizophrenic episode audible thoughts also called thought kind auditory verbal hallucination people hallucination constantly hear voice narrating ones thoughts loud idea first defined kurt schneider included symptom one firstrank symptoms diagnosing although diagnostic reliability firstrank symptoms long questioned idea remains important historical descriptive value psychiatry audible thoughts positive symptom schizophrenia according however hallucination exclusively found among people schizophrenia also among patients bipolar disorder manic patients experience audible thoughts hear voice repeating thoughts either thought comes first kind audible thought voice thought appear simultaneously named german psychiatrist august cramer gedankenlautwerden german word stands thoughts become example gedankenlautwerden painter heard quiet voice oxford accent volume slightly lower normal conversation could heard equally well either ear voice would say cant stand man way holds brush looks like poof immediately experienced whatever voice saying thoughts exclusion second kind voice comes thought appears called echo de la pensée french namely thought example thought echo housewife complained mans voice voice would repeat almost patients goaldirected thinking even banalest thoughts patient would think must put kettle pause one second voice would say must put kettle categorized patients subjective feelings voices come audible thoughts either external patients reporting internal origin hallucination claim voices coming somewhere inside body mainly reporting external origin feel voice coming environment external origins vary patients description hear voice front ears attribute ambient surrounding noise like running water wind sometimes influences patients behaviours believe people around also hear audible thoughts therefore may avoid social events public places prevent others hearing besides study suggests locus voice may change patients hallucinations develop theres trend internalization external perceptions means patients locate source hallucination external objects internal subjectivity according phenomenological study conducted tony nayani anthony david half patients audible thoughts claimed hallucination somehow taken place conscience making decisions judgement tend follow voices instructions confronting dilemmas daily study also suggests majority patients male female labeled sounds heard male voices however younger patients tend hear younger voices suggests voices hallucination may share age patients whats voices hallucination usually differ patients voices accents reported voices heard coming different regions social classes patients may develop skills control hallucinations certain extent kind cognitive focusing cant eliminate voices cognitive focusing suggestive behaviours eg swallowing control onset offset exact differences external hallucinations experienced though caused external stimuli internal hallucinations experienced occurring internal space remain according study nayani patients hear exclusively external hallucinations experienced exclusively internal hallucinations however another study leudar et al found exclusively internal hallucinations common exclusively external hallucinations historically experiencing hallucinations external understood indicate severe psychopathology empirical support conclusion studies suggested damage specific brain areas may relate formation audible patients attribute hallucination external locus likely report voice coming right unilateral characteristic explained either contralateral temporal lobe disease ipsilateral ear researchers also came hypotheses audible thought may result damage right hemisphere causes malfunction prosodic construction happens left hemisphere may misinterpret patients thoughts alien leading patients misconceive thoughts coming

rely understanding internalization process inner internalization process inner voice process creating inner voice early childhood separated four distinct level one external dialogue involves capacity

someone talking repeating something written level three expanded inner speech first internal level speech involves capacity carry internal monologues seen reading oneself going list silently level four condensed inner speech final level internalization process involves capacity think terms pure meaning without need put thoughts words order grasp meaning thought disruption could occur normal
