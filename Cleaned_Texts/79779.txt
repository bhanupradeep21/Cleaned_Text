biceps biceps brachii latin musculus biceps brachii twoheaded muscle arm large muscle lies front upper arm shoulder elbow heads muscle arise scapula join form single muscle belly attached upper forearm biceps crosses shoulder elbow joints main function elbow flexes forearm supinates forearm movements used opening bottle corkscrew first biceps screws cork supination pulls cork biceps one three muscles anterior compartment upper arm along brachialis muscle coracobrachialis muscle biceps shares nerve biceps muscle two heads short head long head distinguished according origin coracoid process supraglenoid tubercle scapula origin glenoid long head remains tendinous passes shoulder joint intertubercular groove extending origin coracoid tendon short head runs adjacent tendon coracobrachialis conjoint tendon unlike muscles anterior compartment arm biceps muscle crosses two joints shoulder joint elbow joint heads biceps join middle upper arm form single muscle mass usually near insertion deltoid form common muscle belly although several anatomic studies demonstrated muscle bellies remain distinct structures without confluent muscle extends distally two heads rotate degrees externally inserting onto radial tuberosity short head inserts distally tuberosity long head inserts proximally closer apex bicipital aponeurosis also called lacertus fibrosus thick fascial band organizes close musculotendinous junction biceps radiates inserts onto ulnar part antebrachial tendon attaches radial tuberosity partially completely surrounded bursa bicipitoradial bursa ensures frictionless motion biceps tendon proximal radius pronation supination two muscles lie underneath biceps brachii coracobrachialis muscle like biceps attaches coracoid process scapula brachialis muscle connects ulna along midshaft humerus besides brachioradialis muscle adjacent biceps also inserts radius bone though distally biceps triceps movement biceps triceps arm flexing split line long short heads traditionally described twoheaded muscle biceps brachii one variable muscles human body third head arising humerus cases normal commonly originating near insertion coracobrachialis joining short four five even seven supernumerary heads reported rare one study found higher expected number female cadavers third head biceps brachii equal incidence sides body uniform innervation musculocutaneous distal biceps tendons completely separated bifurcated cases biceps shares nerve supply two muscles anterior compartment muscles supplied musculocutaneous nerve fibers fifth sixth seventh cervical nerves make components musculocutaneous nerve supply blood supply biceps brachial artery distal tendon biceps useful palpating brachial pulse artery runs medial tendon cubital fossa biceps works across three important functions supinate forearm flex elbow besides long head biceps prevents upward displacement head detail actions motor units lateral portion long head biceps preferentially activated elbow flexion motor units medial portionclarification needed preferentially activated forearm biceps usually attributed representative strength within variety worldwide culturescitation needed proximal tendons biceps brachii commonly involved pathological processes frequent cause anterior shoulder disorders distal biceps brachii tendon include insertional tendonitis partial complete tears tendon partial tears usually characterized pain enlargement abnormal contour complete tears occur avulsion tendinous portion biceps away insertion tuberosity radius often accompanied palpable audible pop immediate pain soft tissue softtissue mass sometimes encountered anterior aspect arm socalled reverse popeye deformity paradoxically leads decreased strength flexion elbow supination tears biceps brachii may occur athletic activities however avulsion injuries distal biceps tendon frequently occupational nature sustained forceful eccentric contraction biceps muscle treatment biceps tear depends severity injury cases muscle heal time corrective surgery applying cold pressure using antiinflammatory medications ease pain reduce swelling severe injuries require surgery postop physical therapy regain strength functionality muscle corrective surgeries nature typically reserved elite athletes rely complete biceps strengthened using weight resistance training examples well known biceps

plural form latin adjective biceps form general english use instead biceps used singular plural ie referring arms english form bicep attested back formation derived misinterpreting biceps english plural marker leonardo da vinci expressed original idea biceps acting supinator series annotated drawings made principle biceps supinator well role flexor elbow devised however function remained undiscovered medical community da vinci regarded teacher anatomy results publicly released movement rediscovered william cheselden subsequently recorded medical community rewritten several times
