neuroscience homeostatic plasticity refers capacity neurons regulate excitability relative network term homeostatic plasticity derives two opposing concepts homeostatic product greek words state condition plasticity change thus homeostatic plasticity means staying change homeostatic synaptic plasticity means maintaining synaptic basis learning respiration locomotion contrast hebbian plasticity associated learning although hebbian forms plasticity longterm potentiation longterm depression occur rapidly homeostatic plasticity relies protein synthesis take hours important mediators homeostatic synaptic plasticity homeostatic plasticity thought balance hebbian plasticity modulating activity synapse properties ion channels homeostatic plasticity neocortical circuits studied depth gina g turrigiano sacha nelson brandeis university first observed compensatory changes excitatory postsynaptic currents mepscs chronic activity synaptic scaling proposed potential mechanism homeostatic homeostatic plasticity used describe process maintains stability neuronal functions coordinated plasticity among subcellular compartments synapses versus neurons cell bodies versus recently proposed homeostatic synaptic scaling may play role establishing specificity associative homeostatic plasticity also maintains neuronal excitability realtime manner coordinated plasticity threshold refractory period voltagegated sodium homeostatic plasticity also important context central pattern generators context neuronal properties modulated response environmental changes order maintain appropriate neural httpsenwikipediaorgwikihomeostaticplasticity
