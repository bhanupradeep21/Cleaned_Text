though time graduated recognized passion science committed pursuing undergraduate degree university yaoundé kanmogne completed bachelor science zoology pursued masters science biochemistry university yaoundé completing degree two years following masters kanmogne worked laboratory instructor department biochemistry university kanmogne moved united kingdom pursue graduate training university studied molecular parasitology mentorship wendy c gibson exploring biology trypanosoma kanmogne used novel genetic technique time random amplification polymorphic dna rapd characterize genetic heterogeneity brucei gambiense isolates endemic areas work first show rapd method accurate rflp method characterizing genetic variation also achieving detailed genetic kanmogne also explored effective ways diagnose sleeping sickness caused brucei since levels developed novel pcr method highly sensitive could used effectively diagnose sleeping sickness levels trypanosomesml kanmogne completed graduate training

virus type infection west african patients kanmogne moved united states pursue postdoctoral training department pathology university oklahoma health sciences continuing study hiv kanmogne pursued master public health biostatistics epidemiology university oklahoma health sciences center mentorship ronald c kennedy kanmogne continued study hiv emphasis infiltration hiv central nervous system since exact mechanisms hiv invasion brain well subsequent neuronal cell death unknown kanmognes work explored susceptibility brain endothelial cells cortical neurons discovered neither cell type expressed known hiv receptors thus cell types mechanisms mediate cnshiv kanmogne explored using nonhuman primate nhp microglia study hiv pathogenesis found nhp microglia express receptors used study hiv addition studying hiv infection cns kanmogne also explored hiv infection lung since onset aids associated severe pulmonary found human lung microvascular endothelial cells major reservoir hiv lungs represent target lethal effects hiv viral kanmogne hired research assistant professor department pathology university oklahoma health science center continued study vascular biology hiv infection effects hiv infection central nervous kanmogne recruited university nebraska medical center became assistant professor department pharmacology experimental neuroscience well senior scientist

promoted full professor within kanmogne member american society virology international society university nebraska medical center kanmogne also principal investigator lab explores mechanisms brain invasion vascular biology hiv work led critical discoveries role blood brain barrier bbb interactions hiv well interactions influence immune response brain leading neuroaids including neurodegeneration aids associated found hiv affects biology brain endothelium proximity hivinfected peripheral macrophages brain lead increased immune signalling bbb facilitated infiltration peripheral leukocytes kanmogne also deeply committed extensive collaboration diversity currently collaborates several departments within university yaoundé cameroon university california san diego international research project explores viral genetic diversity hiv infections cameroon west hopes projects enhance ability healthcare workers cameroon west africa better diagnose treat since cameroon highest diversity hiv strains subtypes work exploring genetic variants hiv relation neurological symptoms help highlight potential disease trajectories associated subtype well open possibilities novel

explore cognitive impairments due hiv infection subsaharan africa developed novel methods team reported first normative data executive function verbal fluency cameroonians established ability use method future assessments cognitive function patients without hiv conducted crosssectional study hivassociated neurocognitive disorders hand using international hiv dementia scale among population found risk factors hand similar described studies underscoring need start assess risk factors means hands prevention order treat neurocognitive symptoms hiv therapeutics must enter brain kanmogne team developing novel nanomedicines achieve first developed nanoformulated crystalline antiretroviral therapy allows drugs passed bbb celltocell contact monocytes found therapy mice led decreased activation glial cells decreased viral load next developed method uses polyanhydride nanoparticles containing antioxidants internalized transferred monocytes hbmecs order protect neurons oxidative
