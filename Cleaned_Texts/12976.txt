canavan disease disease rare fatal autosomal degenerative disease causes progressive damage nerve cells loss white matter one common degenerative cerebral diseases caused deficiency enzyme aminoacylase one group genetic diseases referred leukodystrophies characterized degeneration myelin phospholipid layer insulating axon neuron associated gene located human chromosome symptoms common serious form canavan disease typically appear early infancy usually first three six months canavan disease progresses rapidly stage typical cases involving intellectual disability loss previously acquired motor skills feeding difficulties abnormal muscle tone ie initial floppiness hypotonia may eventually translate spasticity poor head control megalocephaly abnormally enlarged head paralysis blindness seizures may also exists much less common variant canavan disease generally much less serious involves later onset symptoms often mild nonspecific enough go unrecognized manifestations canavans variant seem effect lifespan typically limited minor cases speech motor skill development canavan disease inherited autosomal recessive fashion parents carriers chance affected child genetic counseling genetic testing recommended families two parental canavan disease caused defective aspa gene responsible production enzyme aspartoacylase decreased aspartoacylase activity prevents normal breakdown nacetylaspartate wherein accumulation nacetylaspartate lack metabolism interferes growth myelin sheath nerve fibers brain myelin sheath fatty covering surrounds nerve cells acts insulator allowing efficient transmission nerve impulsescitation diagnosis neonatalinfantile canavan disease relies demonstration high concentration nacetylaspartic acid naa urine mildjuvenile canavan disease naa may slightly elevated thus diagnosis relies molecular genetic testing aspa gene encoding enzyme cure canavan disease known standard course treatment treatment symptomatic supportive physical therapy may help improve motor skills educational programs may help improve communication skills seizures treated antiepileptic drugs gastrostomy used help maintain adequate food intake hydration swallowing difficulties also experimental treatment uses lithium citrate person canavan disease levels nacetylaspartate chronically elevated lithium citrate proven rat genetic model canavan disease

described myrtelle cowrote paper discussing case child died months old whose brain spongy white section canavan first identify degenerative disorder central nervous system later named canavan discovery gene canavan disease subsequent events generated considerable controversy greenbergs family two children affected canavan disease donated tissue samples reuben matalon researcher university

testcitation needed however relocated florida matalons new employer miami childrens hospital patented gene started claiming royalties genetic test forcing canavan foundation withdraw free testing subsequent lawsuit brought canavan foundation miami childrens hospital resolved sealed outofcourt case sometimes cited arguments appropriateness patenting genescitation needed research involving triacetin supplementation shown promise rat triacetin enzymatically cleaved form acetate enters brain readily negatively charged acetate defective enzyme canavan disease aspartoacylase converts nacetylaspartate aspartate acetate mutations gene aspartoacylase prevent breakdown nacetylaspartate reduce brain acetate availability brain development acetate supplementation using triacetin meant provide missing acetate brain development continue normallycitation needed team researchers headed paola leone university medicine dentistry new jersey tried procedure involving insertion six
