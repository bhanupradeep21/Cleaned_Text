cognitive behavioral training cbtraining sometimes referred structured cognitive behavioral training scbt organized process uses systematic highlystructured tasks designed improve cognitive functions functions working memory decision making attention thought inform whether person defaults impulsive behavior premeditated aim cbtraining affect persons decisionmaking process cause choose premeditated behavior impulsive behavior everyday scheduled trainings may hours long may weekly daily specific set time goal cbtraining show focusing repetitive increasingly difficult cognitive tasks transfer skills cognitive processes brain leading behavioral recent resurgence interest field invention new technologies greater understanding cognition roots cbtraining lie combination cognitive behavioral therapy cbt general cognitive training cognitive training seeks improve cognitive functions sake improved brain processing basic premise cbt behavior inextricably related beliefs thoughts two mentalities lies idea changing way person responds stimulus training possible change persons actions however positive effects cbtraining difficult prove throughout field lack randomized controlled trials rcts many studies lack standardization training methods definitions success make difficult compare studies find overall many clinical reviews conclude initial results expressing benefits cbtraining may overestimated data shows positive enough results continued research cognitive behavioral training cbtraining cognitivebased process designed aim systematically break emotionally driven dependencies behaviors replacing behaviors based rational testing computerized gamified bickel et al describe method training adaptivetraining programs rely computerized algorithms adjust intervention

trainings since testing repetitive inhibitory control training ict method cbtraining uses cues paired promoting inhibiting stimulus change cues general specific undesirable behavior use gono go stopsignal example cuespecific ict test used stice et als study designed limit unhealthy food consumption combining inhibitory signals images unhealthy food often nonfoodrelated working memory

behavioral therapy fundamental differences cbtraining cbt philosophy application cbtraining training therapy critical distinction unlike typical forms applications cbt cbtraining process finite cbt therapy patient plays large role determining direction therapy including intensity cbtraining course program often broken series progressive strategically ordered sessions designed guide participant process training brain away impulsive goal adjust automatic processes lead undesired behaviors repetitious training sessions designed promote desired cbtraining aims change participants behaviors seemingly unrelated tasks demonstrating near transfer application improved skills circumstances similar trained task far transfer application improved skills circumstances different trained addressing addictive behavior potentially destructive behavior compelling participant cbtraining uses approach urge conditioningdesensitization approach stands contrast commonly instinctive people urge avoidance seems counterintuitive first approach urge desensitization applied patients gambling addictions research shown person trying quit smoking instance instinct remove smoking paraphernalia presence sight
