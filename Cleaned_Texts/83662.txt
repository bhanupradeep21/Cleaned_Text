virotherapy treatment using biotechnology convert viruses therapeutic agents reprogramming viruses treat diseases three main branches virotherapy anticancer oncolytic viruses viral vectors gene therapy viral immunotherapy branches use three different types treatment methods gene overexpression gene knockout suicide gene delivery gene overexpression adds genetic sequences compensate low zero levels needed gene expression gene knockout uses rna methods silence reduce expression diseasecausing genes suicide gene delivery introduces genetic sequences induce apoptotic response cells usually kill cancerous slightly different context virotherapy also refer broadly use viruses treat certain medical conditions killing pathogens chester southam researcher memorial sloan kettering cancer center pioneered study viruses potential agents treat oncolytic virotherapy new idea early mid doctors noticing cancer patients suffered nonrelated viral infection vaccinated recently showed signs largely attributed production interferon tumour necrosis factors response viral infection oncolytic viruses designed selectively target lyse cancerous cellscitation needed studies conducted animal models evaluate use viruses treatment earliest human clinical trials oncolytic viruses believed oncolytic virus achieve goals two mechanisms selective killing tumor cells well recruitment host immune one major challenges cancer treatment finding treatments target tumor cells ignoring noncancerous host cells viruses chosen target specific receptors expressed cancer cells allow virus entry one example targeting multiple myeloma cells measles expression receptors often increased tumor viruses also engineered target specific receptors tumor cells viruses entered tumor cell rapid growth division tumor cells well decreased ability tumor cells fight viruses make advantageous viral replication compared nontumorous replication viruses tumor cells causes tumor cells lyse killing also release signal activate hosts immune system overcoming immunosuppression done disruption microenvironment tumor cells prevents recognition host immune tumor antigens dangerassociated molecular patterns also released lysis process helps recruit host immune currently many viruses used tested differing ability lyse cells activate immune system transfer genescitation needed clinical trials looking different viruses cancers doses routes administrations work done herpesvirus adenovirus vaccinia virus viruses include measles virus coxsackievirus polio virus newcastle disease virus methods delivery tested include intratumoral intravenous intraperitoneal types tumor currently study oncolytic viruses include cns tumors renal cancer head neck cancer ovarian cancer oncolytic virotherapy monotherapy also tested combination therapies including chemotherapy radiotherapy surgery fda approved marketing talimogene laherparepvec genetically engineered herpes virus treat melanoma lesions

associated common symptom reported flulike symptoms hsv virus used oncolytic virus retained native thymidine kinase gene allows targeted antiretroviral therapy event unwarranted side challenges include developing optimal method delivery either directly tumor site intravenously allowing target multiple clinical trials include tracking viral replication spread using various laboratory techniques order find optimal treatmentcitation needed another major challenge using oncolytic viruses therapy avoiding hosts natural immune system prevent virus infecting tumor oncolytic virus introduced host system healthy hosts immune system naturally try fight virus less virus able reach target site reduce efficacy oncolytic virus leads idea inhibiting hosts immune response may necessary early treatment brought safety concerns due safety concerns immunosuppression clinical trials excluded patients immunocompromised active viral infectionscitation needed viral gene therapy uses genetically engineered viral vectors deliver therapeutic genes cells genetic use viral material deliver gene starts engineering viral vector though molecular mechanism viral vector differ vector vector general principles consideredcitation needed diseases secondary genetic mutation causes lack gene gene added back diseases due overexpression gene viral genetic engineering may introduced turn viral gene therapy may done vivo ex former viral vector delivered directly organ tissue patient later desired tissue first retrieved genetically modified transferred back patient molecular mechanisms gene delivery andor integration cells vary based viral vector rather delivery drugs require multiple continuous treatments delivery gene potential create long lasting cell continuously produce gene successful clinical use viral gene therapy since specifically adenoassociated virus vectors chimeric antigen receptor tcell therapycitation needed vectors made adenoassociated virus one established products used clinical trials today initially attractive use gene therapy due known cause disease along several also engineered replicate delivery additional clinical trials involving aavgene therapy looks treat diseases haemophilia along various neurological cardiovascular muscular chimeric antigen receptor cell car cell type immunotherapy makes use viral gene editing car cell use ex vivo method lymphocytes extracted engineered virus typically gammaretrovirus lentivirus recognize specific proteins cell causes tlymphocytes attack cells express undesired protein currently two therapies tisagenlecleucel axicabtagene ciloleucel fdaapproved treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia diffuse large bcell lymphoma clinical trials underway explore potential benefits solid european commission

profitability longer authorized use currently still many challenges viral gene therapy immune responses viral gene therapies pose challenge successful however responses viral vectors immune privileged sites eye may reduced compared sites forms virotherapy prevention offtarget genome editing concern addition viral gene editing genome editing technologies crispr gene editing shown precise control delivery genome editing become reality also necessary consider ethical implications technology viral immunotherapy use virus stimulate bodys immune system unlike traditional vaccines attenuated killed virusbacteria used generate immune response viral immunotherapy uses genetically engineered viruses present specific antigen immune system antigen could species virusbacteria even human disease antigens example cancer antigenscitation needed vaccines another method virotherapy use attenuated inactivated viruses develop immunity disease attenuated virus weakened virus incites natural immune response host often undetectable host also develops potentially lifelong immunity due attenuated viruss similarity actual virus inactivated viruses killed viruses present form antigen host however longterm immune response viral immunotherapy context cancer stimulates bodys immune system better fight cancer cells rather preventing causes cancer one would traditionally think context vaccines vaccines cancer used treat mechanism dependent upon virus treatment oncolytic viruses discussed previous section stimulate host immune system release tumorassociated antigens upon lysis well disruption cancers microenvironment helps avoid host immune car cells also mentioned previous section another form viral immunotherapy uses viruses genetically engineer immune cells kill cancer viruses explored means treat infections caused one protozoa potential virotherapy treatments explored naegleria fowleri causes primary amebic meningoencephalitis pam mortality rate diseasecausing eukaryote one highest pathogenic fatality rates known chemotherapeutic agents target amoeba treating pam difficulty crossing bloodbrain barriers however drivenclarification needed evolution virulent viruses protozoal pathogens vvpps may able develop viral therapies easily access eukaryotic disease organism crossing bloodbrain barrier process analogous bacteriophages vvpps would also selfreplicating therefore require infrequent administration lower doses thus potentially reducing treatment methods protozoal disease may show great promise manner similar bacteriophage viral therapy notable hazard evolutionary consequence using viruses capable eukaryotic pathogenicity vvpps evolved mechanisms dna insertion replication manipulate eukaryotic surface proteins dna editing proteins vvpp engineering must therefore control viruses may able mutate thereby bind surface proteins manipulate dna infected hostcitation needed httpsenwikipediaorgwikivirotherapy
