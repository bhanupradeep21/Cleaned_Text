jet lag physiological condition results alterations bodys circadian rhythms caused rapid longdistance transmeridian travel example someone flying new york london ie west east feels time five hours earlier local time someone travelling london new york ie east west feels time five hours later local time phase shift traveling east west referred phasedelay circadian circle whereas going west east

new time zone recovery period one day per time zone crossed suggested guidelinecitation needed jet lag especially issue airline pilots aircraft crew frequent travellers airlines regulations aimed combating pilot fatigue caused jet lag term jet lag used arrival passenger jet aircraft uncommon travel far fast enough cause desynchronosis travel propellerdriven aircraft ship train slower limited distance jet flights thus contribute widely issue according study federal aviation administration aviator wiley post first write effects flying across time zones coauthored book around world eight symptoms jet lag quite varied depending amount time zone alteration time day individual differences sleep disturbance occurs poor sleep upon arrival andor sleep disruptions trouble falling asleep flying east early awakening flying west trouble remaining asleep cognitive effects include poorer performance mental tasks concentration dizziness nausea insomnia confusion anxiety increased fatigue headaches irritability problems digestion including indigestion changes frequency defecation consistency faeces reduced interest enjoyment symptoms caused circadian rhythm sync cycle well possibility internal desynchronisation jet lag measured simple analogue scales study shown relatively blunt assessing problems associated jet lag liverpool jet lag questionnaire developed measure symptoms jet lag several times day dedicated measurement tool used assess jet lag jet lag may require change three time zones occur though individuals affected little single time zone singlehour shift daylight saving symptoms consequences jet lag significant concern athletes travelling east west competitions performance often dependent combination physical mental characteristics affected jet lag often common concern international sporting events like olympics fifa world cup however many athletes arrive least weeks ahead events help adjust jet lag travel fatigue general fatigue disorientation headache

calculating jet lag number time zones crossed maximum possible time difference plus minus hours absolute time difference two locations greater hours one must subtract add number example time zone time
