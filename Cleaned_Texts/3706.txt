dichotic listening psychological test commonly used investigate selective attention lateralization brain function within auditory system used within fields cognitive psychology neuroscience standard dichotic listening test participant presented two different auditory stimuli simultaneously usually speech directed different ears one type test participants asked pay attention one stimuli later asked content either stimulus instructed attend stimulus instructed donald broadbent credited first scientist systematically use dichotic listening tests broadbent employed dichotic listening tests studies attention asking participants focus attention either left rightear sequence suggested due limited capacity human information processing system needs select channel stimuli attend deriving filter model early doreen kimura used dichotic listening tests draw conclusions lateral asymmetry auditory processing demonstrated example healthy participants rightear superiority reception verbal stimuli leftear superiority perception study others studies using neurological patients brain lesions concluded predominance left hemisphere speech perception predominance right hemisphere melodic late early donald michael haskins laboratories used dichotic listening technique presenting different nonsense syllables demonstrate dissociation phonetic speech auditory nonspeech perception finding phonetic structure devoid meaning integral part language typically processed left cerebral dichotic listening performance advantage one ear interpreted indicating processing advantage contralateral hemisphere another example sidtis found healthy adults leftear advantage dichotic pitch recognition experiment interpreted result indicating righthemisphere dominance pitch discrimination alternative explanation rightear advantage speech perception people righthanded put telephone right two explanations necessarily incompatible telephoning behavior could partly hemispheric asymmetry converse findings nonspeech eg environmental sounds readily interpretable framework early tim rand demonstrated dichotic perception haskins study first stimuli formant presented one ear second third formants presented opposite ear varied low high intensity ultimately comparison binaural condition peripheral masking avoided speech heard demonstration originally known rand effect later renamed dichotic release masking name demonstration continued evolve finally named dichotic perception dichotic listening around time jim cutting investigator haskins laboratories researched listeners could correctly identify syllables different components syllable presented different ears formants vowel sounds relation crucial differentiating vowel sounds even though listeners heard two separate signals neither ear receiving complete vowel sound could still identify syllable sounds dichotic fused words test dfwt modified version basic dichotic listening test originally explored johnson et al early wexler

nonaphasiac patients compared healthy controls study groups exposed dichotic trials pairs cv syllables patient asked state syllable heard best expected right lesioned patients showed right ear advantage like healthy control group left hemisphere lesioned patients displayed impairment compared right lesioned patients control group study researchers concluded dichotic listening neuronal circuitry also involves frontal lobes may critical aspect speech similarly westerhausen hugdahl analyzed role corpus callosum dichotic listening speech perception reviewing many studies concluded dichotic listening considered test functional interhemispheric interaction connectivity besides test lateralized temporal lobe language function corpus callosum critically involved topdown attentional control dichotic listening performance thus critical role auditory dichotic listening also used test hemispheric asymmetry language processing early doreen kimura reported dichotic verbal stimuli

shankweiler examine dichotic listening cvc syllable pairs six stop consonants b g p k paired six vowels variation initial final consonants analyzed rea strongest sound initial final consonants differ
