nutritional deficiency states several lead stomatitis example deficiencies iron vitamin vitamin niacin vitamin pyridoxine vitamin folic acid vitamin cobalamine may manifest stomatitis iron necessary upregulation transcriptional elements cell replication repair lack iron cause genetic downregulation elements leading ineffective repair regeneration epithelial cells especially mouth lips many disorders cause malabsorption cause deficiencies turn causes stomatitis examples include tropical aphthous stomatitis canker sores recurrent appearance mouth ulcers otherwise healthy individuals cause completely understood thought condition represents cell mediated immune response triggered variety factors individual ulcers aphthae recur periodically heal completely although severe forms new ulcers may appear parts mouth old ones finished healing aphthous stomatitis one common diseases oral mucosa thought affect general population symptoms range minor nuisance disabling impact eating swallowing talking severe forms cause people lose weight cure aphthous therapies aimed alleviating pain reducing inflammation promoting healing ulcers little evidence efficacy treatment used inflammation corners angles lips termed angular stomatitis angular cheilitis children frequent cause repeated liplicking adults may sign underlying iron deficiency anemia vitamin b deficiencies eg turn may evidence poor diets malnutrition celiac disease also angular cheilitis caused patients jaws rest overclosed due edentulousness tooth wear causing jaws come rest closer together completeunaffected dentition present causes skin folds around angle mouth kept moist saliva turn favours infection mostly candida albicans similar species treatment usually involves administration topical nystatin similar antifungal agents another treatment correct jaw relationship dental treatment eg dentures occlusal adjustment common condition present denture wearers appears reddened painless mucosa beneath denture cases associated candida species common form oral candidiasis treatment antifungal medication improved dental hygiene wearing denture sleep allergic contact stomatitis also termed allergic gingivostomatitis allergic contact type iv delayed hypersensitivity reaction occurs susceptible atopic individuals allergens penetrate skin allergens may different different individuals combine epithelialderived proteins forming haptens bind langerhans cells mucosa turn present antigen surface lymphocytes sensitizing antigen causing produce many specific clones second time specific antigen encountered inflammatory reaction triggered site allergic contact stomatitis less common allergic contact dermatitis mouth coated saliva washes away antigens acts oral mucosa also vascular better blood supply skin meaning antigens quickly removed area finally substantially less keratin oral mucosa meaning less likelihood haptens allergic contact stomatitis appears nonspecific inflammation may mistaken chronic physical may burning soreness mouth chronic exposure allergen may result lichenoid plasma cell gingivitis may also occur may accompanied glossitis allergens may cause allergic contact stomatitis individuals include cinnamaldehyde balsam peru peppermint mercury gold pyrophosphates zinc citrate free acrylic monomer nickel fluoride sodium lauryl allergens may originate many sources including various foods drink chewing gum toothpaste mouthwash dental floss dental fillings dentures orthodontic bands wires many substance containing allergen comes contact lips allergic contact cheilitis occur together allergic contact stomatitis diagnosis confirmed patch test management avoidance exposure migratory stomatitis geographic stomatitis atypical presentation condition normally presents tongue termed geographic tongue geographic tongue named atrophic erythematous areas depapillation migrate time giving maplike appearance migratory stomatitis mucosal sites mouth ventral surface undersurface tongue buccal mucosa labial mucosa soft palate floor mouth may afflicted identical lesions usually addition apart restricted tongue migratory stomatitis identical condition every regard geographic tongue another synonym geographic tongue uses term stomatitis stomatitis areata migrans inflammation mouth caused herpes simplex virus stomatitis may also caused chemotherapy radiation therapy oropharyngeal term mucositis sometimes used synonymously stomatitis however former usually refers mucosal reactions radiotherapy chemotherapy may occur anywhere gastrointestinal tract term necrotizing ulcerative gingivostomatitis sometimes used synonym necrotizing periodontal disease commonly termed necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis severe form also termed necrotizing stomatitis term necrotizing gingivostomatitis also sometimes also called smokers palatal condition may occur smokers especially pipe smokers palate appears dry cracked white keratosis minor salivary glands appear small red swollen bumps premalignant condition appearance reverses smoking chronic ulcerative stomatitis condition specific immunopathologic features first described characterized erosions ulcerations relapse remit lesions located buccal mucosa inside cheeks gingiva condition resembles oral lichen planus biopsied diagnosis made microscopic examination biopsy tissue direct immunofluorescence reveal presence antinuclear antibodies specifically directed form protein normally expressed within basal layer stratified treatment hydroxychloroquine terms plasma cell atypical
