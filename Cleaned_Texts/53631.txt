shigellosis infection intestines caused shigella symptoms generally start one two days exposure include diarrhea fever abdominal pain feeling need pass stools even bowels diarrhea may symptoms typically last five seven days may take several months bowel habits return entirely complications include reactive arthritis sepsis seizures hemolytic uremic shigellosis caused four specific types typically spread exposure infected occur via contaminated food water hands sexual contamination may spread flies changing diapers diagnosis stool risk infection reduced properly washing shigellosis usually resolves without specific rest sufficient fluids mouth bismuth subsalicylate may help symptoms however medications slow bowels loperamide severe cases antibiotics may used resistance commonly used antibiotics include ciprofloxacin report world health organization estimated shigellosis occurs least million people results deaths year cases occur developing young children commonly outbreaks disease may occur childcare settings also relatively common among united states half million cases occur signs symptoms may range mild abdominal discomfort fullblown dysentery characterized cramps diarrhea slimyconsistent stools fever blood pus mucus stools onset time hours recovery takes infections associated mucosal ulceration rectal bleeding drastic dehydration reactive arthritis hemolytic uremic syndrome possible sequelae reported aftermath shigellosiscitation needed common neurological symptom includes shigellosis caused bacterial infection bacterium genetically similar classified e three serogroups one serotype shigella probability infected given strain shigella varies around world instance sonnei common united states dysenteriae boydii rare shigella transmitted fecaloral route individuals infected disease whether exhibiting longterm carriers bacteria bacteria infect humans primates upon ingestion bacteria pass gastrointestinal tract reach small intestine begin multiply reach large large intestine bacteria cause cell injury beginning stages shigellosis via two main mechanisms direct invasion epithelial cells large intestine production enterotoxin enterotoxin unlike bacteria shigella destroyed gastric acid stomach result takes cells cause infectious dose several orders magnitude smaller species bacteria eg cholera caused bacterium vibrio cholerae infectious dose diagnosis shigellosis made isolating organism diarrheal fecal sample cultures shigella species negative motility generally lactose fermenters sonnei ferment typically produce gas carbohydrates exception certain strains flexneri tend overall biochemically inert shigella also urea hydrolysis negative inoculated triple sugar iron slant react follows ka gas indole reactions mixed positive negative exception sonnei always indole negative growth hektoen enteric agar produces bluishgreen colonies shigella bluishgreen colonies black centers salmonellacitation needed simple precautions taken prevent getting shigellosis wash hands handling food thoroughly cook food eating primary prevention methods improved sanitation personal food hygiene lowcost efficacious vaccine would complement since shigellosis spread quickly among children keeping infected children daycare hours symptoms disappeared decrease occurrence shigellosis currently licensed vaccine targeting shigella exists several vaccine candidates shigella various stages development including live attenuated conjugate ribosomal proteosome shigella longstanding world health organization target vaccine development sharp declines agespecific diarrheadysentery attack rates pathogen indicate natural immunity develop following exposure thus vaccination prevent disease feasible shigella species resistant many vaccination important part strategy reduce morbidity treatment consists mainly replacing fluids salts lost diarrhea replacement mouth satisfactory people may need receive fluids intravenously antidiarrheal drugs diphenoxylate loperamide may prolong infection antibiotics used severe cases certain populations mild symptoms elderly immunocompromised food service industry workers child care workers shigellaassociated diarrhea antibiotics shorten length usually avoided mild cases many shigella strains becoming resistant common furthermore effective medications often short supply developing countries carry majority disease burden shigella antidiarrheal agents may worsen sickness cases disease resolves within four eight days without antibiotics severe infections may last three six weeks antibiotics trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole ciprofloxacin may given person young old disease severe risk infection spreading people high additionally ampicillin amoxicillin effective treating disease previously first choice drug insufficient data estimated caused death children age five deaths people five years shigella also causes cases annually among travelers military personnel industrialized estimated cases shigellosis occur annually united infants elderly critically ill susceptible severe symptoms disease humans susceptible degree individuals acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids
