calliphora vomitoria known blue bottle orangebearded blue bottlebee species blow fly species family calliphoridae calliphora vomitoria type species genus calliphora common throughout many continents including europe americas africa fairly large flies nearly twice size housefly metallic blue abdomen long orange setae gena adult flies feed nectar females deposit eggs rotting corpses making important forensic insects eggs timing oviposition used estimate time death blue bottle flies typically mm long almost twice size housefly head thorax dull gray back head long yelloworange abdomen

relative calliphoridae species lucilia sericata chrysomya albiceps among abundant flies found temperature significant effect distribution case flies c vomitoria found abundantly spring summer least abundant fall preferred habitat c vomitoria varies depending season winter summer found mostly rural areas riparian areas lesser extent spring fall found riparian blue bottle flies complete cycle egg larva pupa adult development usually takes around larvae proteinrich theoretically used feed female blue bottle fly lays eggs feeds usually decaying meat garbage feces pale whitish larvae commonly called maggots soon hatch eggs immediately begin feeding carcasses dead animals decomposing matter days feeding fully grown time crawl away drier place burrow soil similar matter pupate tough brown cocoons pupal stage longest stage development two three weeks adults emerge pupal stage mate beginning cycle normal duration spent adult form averages days however cold weather pupae adults hibernate higher temperatures revive undergoing metamorphosis requires tremendous amount change fly cell death commonly believed programmed cell death apoptosis always beginning metamorphosis larvae stage salivary gland cells calliphora vomitoria larvae programmed selfdestruct enough feeding larvae come rest initial protein synthesis stage occurs culminating production high amounts protein occurs day day day cell death salivary gland cells occurs pattern synthesis destruction confused apoptosis dna degeneration seen cells shown vacuolate swell instead condensing shrinking case apoptosis instead selective expression dna synthesis occur programmed cell death salivary gland like blowflies c vomitoria colonize animal remains including humans adult c vomitoria feed nectar larvae feed corpses medium grow however shown feeding processed substrates food modified human consumption increasing shelf life taste salting curing smoking etc provided much better growth unprocessed substrates raw unmodified liver different substrates drastically affected growth c vomitoria best characterized specialist best utilizes processed substrates minced meats example close relative calliphora vicina generalist able utilize mixed substrates equal growth case overcrowding c vomitoria competition results compensation increased speed development leading smaller larvae adults complications forensics different parts body would grow different additionally shown fly larvae able colonize even buried remains growth rates similar surface buried usually flies lay eggs around wounds fresh corpses shortly death right pupal stage fly larvae leaves carrion burrow soil order pupate adult flies decaying carcasses found calliphoridae flies dominate especially c vomitoria spring fall c vomitoria primary species found carcasses cases c vomitoria shares carcasses calliphorid species lucilia bluebottle fly adults feed nectar pollinators flowers especially attracted flowers strong odors adapted smell like rotting meat plants pollinated fly include skunk cabbage symplocarpus foetidus american pawpaw asimina triloba dead horse arum helicodiceros muscivorus goldenrod species carrot insects tend fly packs order detect possible food sources efficiently one fly detects food disperses pheromone alert others blow flies like c vomitoria lay eggs carrion sites scarce places corpses end many eggs various species result high larval density arises fact many individuals around site pregnant females increase oviposition rate increases number offspring likely triggered contact chemical however large number larvae ends beneficial individual larvae feed secretion enzymes break tissues corpse aggregating large numbers secretions effective leading easier feeding additionally large aggregation helps generate heat keep larvae warm flies generally prefer warmer temperature one complication high number individuals competition still factor larvae periphery may left feeding end developmental cycle emerge undernourished suggested c vomitoria rarely fly night regardless presence existing corpse thus may deposit eggs corpses night relevant forensic science approximate time oviposition would median neurosecretory cells mnc brain calliphora species contain peptide hormones resemble insulin proven researchers able bind insulinlike peptides antibodies bovine insulin shows insect hormone structurally analogous prominent mammalian raises possibility insulinlike polypeptidelike materials serving central nervous system regulatory hormones metabolic regulatory terminal region tarsal segment c vomitoria contain pulvilli cushionlike hairy feet insects many arthropods located base two claws hair project ventral surface key adhesion abilities flies additionally large claws help hold irregular surfaces prevent falling calliphora vomitoria like blowflies also secrete nonvolatile lipids hairs important adhesion combination physical grip claws hairs surface tension created lipid secretions able adhere smooth surfaces flies among important insect evidence forensic science specifically obtaining time colonization toc post mortem interval calliphora species important temperate regions growth rate accordance temperature knowing temperature amount time since eggs laid estimated addition c vomitoria higher threshold temperature growth many species likewise present many regions limit usage though species survive cold temperatures continue development unless warmer roughly degradation carcasses divided six separate stages stage decomposition fresh stage bloated stage active decay stage advanced decay stage remains stage adult c vomitoria first starts appear carcasses bloated stage followed larvae days active decay stage blow fly larvae population reaches buried corpses information time since burial body kept abovebelow ground burial also collected identification c study flies however limited areas entomologists readily available life histories differ separate regions life histories differ subtle ways due differences climate temperature elevation restrictions thus considered proper time colonization toc post mortem interval pmi bluebottle fly also cause human animal myiasis parasitization living individual forensic scientists sometimes identify course work one case autopsy neglected calliphora vomitoria often species present carrion process identification correct species needed order avoid false estimates time death due different developmental cycles past simple morphological differences used differentiate species however difficult crime

simple method distinguishing blowfly species good post mortem interval pmi time death discovery corpse calliphora vomitoria important pmi estimations among first species lay eggs corpse two ways estimating pmi one killing larvae comparing larvaes length temperature standardized data another way calculate pmi calculate accumulated degree hoursdays adhd larva needs reach certain developmental
