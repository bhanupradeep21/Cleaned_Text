fish hides hypersaline lakes salterns salterns reach minimum salinity limits extreme halophiles waters become purple reddish color due high densities halophilic h salinarum also found highsalt food salt pork marine fish sausages ability h salinarum survive high salt concentrations led classification extremophile halobacteria singlecelled rodshaped microorganisms among ancient forms life appeared earth billions years ago membrane consists single lipid bilayer surrounded slayer made cellsurface glycoprotein accounts approximately cell surface proteins form lattice membrane sulfate residues abundant glycan chains glycoprotein giving negative charge negative charge believed stabilize lattice highsalt amino acids main source chemical energy h salinarum particularly arginine aspartate though able metabolize amino acids h salinarum reported unable grow sugars therefore need encode enzymes capable performing gluconeogenesis create sugars although h salinarum unable catabolize glucose transcription factor trmb proven regulate gluconeogenic production sugars found slayer glycoprotein survive extremely salty environments halophilic archaeal compatible solutes particular potassium chloride reduce osmotic potassium levels equilibrium environment h salinarum express multiple active transporters pump potassium extremely high salt concentrations protein precipitation occur prevent salting proteins h salinarum encodes mainly acidic proteins average isoelectric point h salinarum proteins highly acidic proteins overwhelmingly negative charge able remain solution even high salt h salinarum grow densities salt ponds oxygen quickly depleted though obligate aerobe able survive lowoxygen conditions utilizing light energy h salinarum expresses membrane protein acts lightdriven proton pump consists two parts protein bacterioopsin lightsensitive cofactor retinal upon absorption photon retinal changes conformation causing conformational change bacterioopsin protein well drives proton proton gradient formed thereby used generate chemical energy via atp synthase obtain oxygen h salinarum produce gas vesicles allow float surface oxygen levels higher light vesicles complex
