grafting horticultural technique whereby tissues plants joined continue growth together upper part combined plant called scion ˈsaɪən lower part called rootstock success joining requires vascular tissues grow together natural equivalent process inosculation technique commonly used asexual propagation commercially grown plants horticultural agricultural trades scion typically joined rootstock soil line however top work grafting may occur far line leaving understock consisting lower part trunk root system cases stock rootstock selected roots scion selected stems leaves flowers scion contains desired genes duplicated future production grafted plant stem grafting common grafting method shoot selected desired plant cultivar grafted onto stock another type another common form called bud grafting dormant side bud grafted onto stem another stock plant inosculated successfully encouraged grow pruning stem stock plant newly grafted bud successful grafting take place vascular cambium tissues stock scion plants must placed contact tissues must kept alive graft taken usually period weeks successful grafting requires vascular connection take place grafted tissues research conducted arabidopsis thaliana hypocotyls shown connection phloem takes place three days initial grafting whereas connection xylem take seven joints formed grafting strong naturally formed joints physical weak point often still occurs graft newly formed tissues inosculate existing structural tissue wood stock plant fuse approach grafting inarching used join together plants otherwise difficult join plants grown close together joined plant roots growth point scion stock retain respective parents may may removed joining also used pleaching graft successfully accomplished time bud grafting also called chip budding shield budding uses bud instead grafting roses common example bud grafting method bud removed parent plant base bud inserted beneath bark stem stock plant rest shoot cut extra bud starts growing stem stock plant removed examples roses fruit trees like peaches budwood stick several buds cut used bud grafting common method propagation citrus cleft grafting small cut made stock pointed end scion inserted stock best done early spring useful joining thin scion cm diameter thicker branch stock best former buds latter cm diameter branch stock split carefully middle form cleft cm deep branch vertical cleft cut horizontally end scion cut cleanly long shallow wedge preferably single cut wedge surface whittled third cut may made across end wedge make straight across slide wedge cleft edge stock centre wedge faces cambium layer bark wood preferable second scion inserted similar way side cleft helps seal cleft tape around top stock hold scion place cover grafting wax sealing compound stops cambium layers drying also prevents ingress water cleft whip grafting scion stock cut slanting joined grafted point bound tape covered soft sealant prevent dehydration infection germs common variation whip tongue graft considered difficult master highest rate success offers cambium contact scion stock common graft used preparing commercial fruit trees generally used stock less cm diameter ideal diameter closer cm scion roughly diameter stock stock cut one side shallow angle sharp knife stock branch main trunk rootstock cut surface face outward centre tree scion similarly sliced equal angle starting bud bud top cut side cut face whip tongue variation notch cut downwards sliced face stock similar cut upwards face scion cut act tongues requires skill make cuts scion stock marry neatly elongated z shape adds strength removing need companion rod first season see illustration joint taped around treated treesealing compound grafting wax whip graft without tongue less stable may need added support stub grafting technique requires less stock cleft grafting retains shape tree also scions generally buds process incision made branch cm long scion wedged forced branch scion angle parent tree crotch remains strong graft covered grafting compound graft taken branch removed treated centimeters graft fully removed graft strong fourflap graft also called banana graft commonly used pecans first became popular species oklahoma heralded maximum cambium overlap complex graft requires similarly sized diameters rootstock scion bark rootstock sliced peeled back four flaps hardwood removed looking somewhat like peeled banana difficult graft learn awl grafting takes least resources least time best done experienced grafter possible accidentally drive tool far stock reducing scions chance survival awl grafting done using screwdriver make slit bark penetrating cambium layer completely inset wedged scion incision veneer grafting inlay grafting method used stock larger cm diameter scion recommended thick pencil clefts made size scion side branch top scion end shaped wedge inserted wrapped tape scaffolding branches give strength rind grafting involves grafting small scion onto end thick stock thick stock sawn cm long barkdeep cut made parallel stock sawnoff end bark separated wood one sides scion shaped wedge exposing cambium sides pushed back stock flat side wood tree branches often roots species sometimes naturally graft called inosculation bark tree may stripped away roots make physical contact exposing vascular cambium allowing roots graft together group trees share water mineral nutrients via root grafts may advantageous weaker trees may also form larger rootmass adaptation promote fire resistance regeneration exemplified california black oak quercus additionally grafting may protect group wind damages result increased mechanical stability provided albino redwoods use root grafting form plant parasitism normal redwoods problem root grafts allow transmission certain pathogens dutch elm disease inosculation also sometimes occurs two stems tree shrub vine make contact common plants strawberries potato natural grafting rarely seen herbaceous plants types plants generally shortlived roots little secondary growth vascular occasionally socalled graft hybrid accurately graft chimera occur tissues stock continue grow within

small tree bears yellow flowers typical laburnum anagyroides purple flowers typical cytisus purpureus curious copperypink flowers show characteristics parents many species cactus also produce graft chimeras right conditions although often created unintentionally results often hard replicate grafting important flowering research leaves shoots plants induced flower grafted onto uninduced plants
