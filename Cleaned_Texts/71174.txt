swallowing function undergo changes well compromising patients oral feeding ability patients may experience distress frustration reluctance eat due swallowing despite high prevalence postoperative swallowing difficulties first days following laryngectomy patients recover swallowing function within laryngectomy patients aspirate due structural changes larynx may experience difficulty swallowing solid food may also experience changes appetite due significant loss senses taste order prevent development pharyngocutaneous fistula common practice reintroduce oral feeding seventh tenth day postsurgery although ideal timeline remains pharyngocutaneous fistula typically develops reintroduction oral feeding ph level presence amylase saliva harmful tissues liquids food whether reintroduction oral feeding earlier postoperative date decreases risk fistula remains unclear however early oral feeding within days operation conducive reduced length hospital stay earlier discharge
