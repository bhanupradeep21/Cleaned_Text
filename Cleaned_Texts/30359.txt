fatigue due shift work contributed several industrial disasters including three mile island accident space shuttle challenger disaster chernobyl alaska oil spill commissions final report exxon valdez

influence shift worker alertness hence safety air traffic controllers typically work day days per week research shown controllers remain position two hours even low traffic levels performance deteriorate rapidly typically placed position intervals minutes intervals practices policies include selecting appropriate shift schedule rota using employee scheduling software maintain setting length shifts managing overtime increasing lighting levels providing shift worker lifestyle training retirement compensation based salary last years employment encourage excessive overtime among older workers may less able obtain adequate sleep screening hiring new shift workers assesses adaptability shift work mandating minimum hours shifts effective strategy encourage adequate sleep workers allowing frequent breaks scheduling shifts instead shifts also minimize fatigue help mitigate negative health effects shift multiple factors need considered developing optimal shift work schedules including shift timing length frequency length breaks shifts shift succession worker commute time well mental physical stress even though studies support shifts associated increased occupational
