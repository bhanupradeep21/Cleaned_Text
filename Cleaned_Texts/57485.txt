prostaglandin also known dinoprostone naturally occurring prostaglandin oxytocic properties used dinoprostone used labor induction bleeding delivery termination pregnancy newborn babies keep ductus arteriosus babies used congenital heart defects surgery carried also used manage gestational trophoblastic may used within vagina injection synthesis within body begins activation arachidonic acid aa enzyme phospholipase activated aa oxygenated cyclooxygenase cox enzymes form prostaglandin endoperoxides specifically prostaglandin modified peroxidase moiety cox enzyme produce prostaglandin converted common side effects include nausea vomiting diarrhea fever excessive uterine babies may decreased breathing low blood caution taken people asthma glaucoma recommended prior works binding activating prostaglandin receptor results opening softening cervix dilation blood prostaglandin first synthesized approved medical use fda united states world health organizations list essential prostaglandin works well prostaglandin dinoprostone important effects labor inducing softening cervix causing uterine contraction also stimulates osteoblasts release factors stimulate bone resorption natural prostaglandins including important structure function ductus arteriosus fetuses allow ductus arteriosus remain open providing necessary connection pulmonary artery descending aorta allows blood bypass fetuss underdeveloped lungs transported placenta ductus arteriosus normally begins close upon birth due increase metabolism newborns congenital heart disease prostaglandins used keep ductus arteriosus open longer normal sustain healthy oxygen saturation levels although commonly used setting report oral used treat ductusdependent congenital heart diseases newborns delay surgical treatment pulmonary arteries addition used another report dilate ductus arteriosus newborns various cardiovascular defects allow better perfusion lungs hand postpartal synthesis newborns considered one cause patent ductus aerosol form serves bronchodilator use setting limited fact also causes similarly acts direct vasodilator acting smooth muscle cause dilation blood addition inhibits platelet also suppresses cell receptor signaling proliferation may play role resolution addition limits immune response preventing blymphocyte differentiation ability present prostaglandin variety functions within central nervous system peripheral nervous system interacts receptors increases body temperature resulting also predominant prostanoid contributes inflammation via enhancing edema leukocyte infiltration increased vascular permeability allowing blood flow inflamed area body acting receptors use nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids blocks activity resulting decrease production nsaids blocking decreasing production remediates fever additionally acting receptors component feeling pain via inflammatory binds receptors increase excitability via cation channels well inhibition hyperpolarizing potassium k channels increase membrane excitability result causes peripheral nerve endings report painful mentioned previously contributes inflammation bound receptors terms immunity prostaglandins ability regulate lymphocyte function affect tlymphocyte formation regulating apoptosis immature thymocytes addition suppress immune response inhibiting b lymphocytes forming antibodysecreting plasma cells process suppressed causes decrease humoral antibody response decrease production antibodies also roles inhibition cytotoxic tcell function cell division tlymphocytes development response physiologic psychologic stress prostaglandin involved several inflammation immunity pathways one abundant prostaglandins body prostaglandin involved almost typical inflammation markers redness swelling regulates responses binding g coupled protein prostaglandin receptors activation different ep receptors dependent type triggering stress stimuli results corresponding stress response activation via results suppression impulse behaviors response psychological stress prostaglandin involved regulating illness induced memory impairment via activation prostaglandin activation results regulation illness induced fever functionally similar also shown studies role hypothermia addition inflammatory effects prostaglandin shown antiinflammatory effects well due different actions varying prostaglandin serves significant role vascular smooth muscle tone regulation vasodilator produced endothelial cells promotes vasodilation smooth muscles increasing activity cyclic adenosine monophosphate camp decrease intracellular calcium levels via ip conversely prostaglandin also induce vasoconstriction via activation receptors activates pathway decreased camp within gastrointestinal tract activates smooth muscles cause contractions longitudinal muscle acting receptors contrast effects respiratory smooth muscle result prostaglandin along prostaglandins synthesized within cortex medulla kidney role renal within kidney maintain renal blood flow glomerular filtration rate gfr localized vasodilation prostanoids work increase medullary blood flow well inhibit sodium reabsorption within kidney tubules also assists kidneys systemic blood pressure control modifying water sodium excretion addition also thought activate increase renin release resulting elevation gfr sodium retention raise systemic blood pressure levels within setting labor delivery cervical ripening also known cervical effacement natural process occurs labor cervix becomes softer thinner dilated enabling fetus pass ripe cervix favorable prior induction labor common obstetric practice increases chances successful pharmacological methods sometimes required induce cervical ripening occur natural ripening cervix mediated prostaglandins thus common pharmacological method use external prostaglandins results systematic review metaanalysis literature found outpatient cervical ripening dinoprostone singleballoon catheters increase risk cesarean achieves cervical ripening softening stimulating uterine contractions well directly acting collagenase present cervix soften currently two formulations analog available use cervical ripening prepidil vaginal gel cervidil vaginal similar oxytocin terms successful labor induction time induction prostaglandin common pharmacological method termination pregnancy particularly second trimester missed abortion miscarriage fetus evacuate however feticidal induces abortion stimulating uterine recommended mg dinoprostone vaginal suppository administered every three five hours evacuate abortion occur within hours beginning administration dinoprostone dinoprostone longer given interventions would required dilation common side effect prostaglandin effect gastrointestinal smooth muscle resulting nausea vomiting diarrhea side effects include headache shivering suppository form prostaglandin associated increased severity symptoms fever also common side effect use prostaglandin administration prostaglandin stopped person experiences side effects insert gel forms shown minimal gastrointestinal effects associated increase stimulation uterus well fetal uterine hyperstimulation effectively treated stopping use prostaglandin monitoring parameters include sustained uterine contractions fetal babies may decreased breathing low blood care taken people asthma glaucoma recommended prior prostaglandin binds g proteincoupled receptors gpcrs cause various downstream effects cause direct contractions addition inhibits na absorption within thick ascending limb tal loop henle adhmediated water transport collecting tubules result blockage synthesis nsaids limit efficacy loop prostaglandin administered direct supervision physician careful
