subdivided three distinct phases repair phase early regenerative phase advanced regenerative phase although diversity exists among starfish terms physiology morphology amputation susceptibility generalized regenerative process note following section details regrowth starfishs arm following amputation unidirectional manner regeneration immediately following amputation starfish must seal coelomic cavities particularly perivisceral coelomic canal prevent fluid loss entrance foreign pathogens initially achieved emergency mechanism entire arm wall contracts swiftly powerfully form
