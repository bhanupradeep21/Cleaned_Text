gravitaxis form taxis characterized directional movement organism response different causes gravitaxis many microorganisms receptors like statocysts allow sense direction gravity adjust orientation accordingly however gravitaxis result also purely physical mechanism organs sensing direction gravity necessary example given microorganisms center mass shifted one end organism similar buoy massanisotropic microorganisms orient upwards gravity shown even asymmetry shape microorganisms sufficient cause gravitaxis different gravitropism way latter growth response organism gravity taxis behavioral response cell organism external stimulus movement characteristically directional movement may positive negative positive taxis one organism cell gravitates towards source stimulation attraction negative taxis organism cell moves away source stimulation repulsion seen many microorganisms including response planktonic larvae lithodes aequispinus king crab gravity another example show positive negative gravitaxis responses way move either upward negative downward positive gravitaxis also observed term coined gravi meaning gravity taxis movement organism response stimulus dictionary definition gravitaxis wiktionary httpsenwikipediaorgwikigravitaxis
