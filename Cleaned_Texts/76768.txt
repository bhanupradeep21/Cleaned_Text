extraocular muscles extrinsic ocular muscles seven extrinsic muscles human six extraocular muscles four recti muscles superior inferior oblique muscles control movement eye muscle levator palpebrae superioris controls eyelid elevation actions six muscles responsible eye movement depend position eye time muscle since small part eye called fovea provides sharp vision eye must move follow target eye movements must precise fast seen scenarios like reading reader must shift gaze constantly although voluntary control eye movement accomplished without conscious effort precisely integration voluntary involuntary control eye occurs subject continuing known however vestibuloocular reflex plays important role involuntary movement eye levator palpebrae superioris responsible raising upper eyelid voluntary involuntary action six extraocular muscles involved movements eye four recti straight muscles two oblique muscles four recti muscles named according relative positions attachment superior rectus muscle lateral rectus muscle medial rectus muscle inferior rectus muscle recti muscles almost equal length around mm lengths associated tendons two oblique muscles inferior oblique muscle superior oblique muscle movements extraocular muscles take place influence system extraocular muscle pulleys soft tissue pulleys orbit extraocular muscle pulley system fundamental movement eye muscles particular also ensure conformity listings law certain diseases pulleys heterotopy instability hindrance pulleys cause particular patterns incomitant strabismus defective pulley functions improved surgical four extraocular muscles origin back orbit fibrous ring called common tendinous ring four recti muscles four recti muscles attach directly front half eye anterior eyes equator named straight note medial lateral relative terms medial indicates near midline lateral describes position away midline thus medial rectus muscle closest nose superior inferior recti pull straight back eye muscles also pull slightly medially posterior medial angle causes eye roll contraction either superior rectus muscle inferior rectus muscle extent rolling recti less oblique opposite superior oblique muscle originates back orbit little closer medial rectus though medial getting rounder courses forward rigid cartilaginous pulley called trochlea upper nasal wall orbit muscle becomes tendinous passes pulley turning sharply across orbit inserts lateral posterior part globe thus superior oblique travels posteriorly last part path going top eye due unique path superior oblique activated pulls eye downward last muscle inferior oblique originates lower front nasal orbital wall passes inferiorly inferior rectus muscle path laterally posteriorly inserts lateral rectus muscle lateral posterior part globe thus inferior oblique pulls eye upward extraocular muscles supplied mainly branches ophthalmic artery done either directly indirectly lateral rectus muscle via lacrimal artery main branch ophthalmic artery additional branches ophthalmic artery include ciliary arteries branch anterior ciliary arteries rectus muscle receives blood two anterior ciliary arteries except lateral rectus muscle receives blood one exact number arrangement ciliary arteries may vary branches infraorbital artery supply inferior rectus inferior oblique muscles inferior rectus muscle medial rectus muscle inferior oblique muscle nuclei bodies nerves found brain stem nuclei abducens oculomotor nerves connected important coordinating motion lateral rectus one eye medial action one eye two antagonistic muscles like lateral medial recti contraction one leads inhibition muscles show small degrees activity even resting keeping muscles taut tonic activity brought discharges motor nerve extraocular muscles develop along tenons capsule part ligaments fatty tissue eye socket orbit three centers growth important development eye associated nerve hence subsequent nerve supply innervation eye muscles three cranial nerves development extraocular muscles dependent normal development eye socket formation ligament fully independent oculomotor nerve iii trochlear nerve iv abducens nerve vi coordinate eye movement oculomotor nerve controls muscles eye except superior oblique muscle controlled trochlear nerve iv lateral rectus muscle controlled abducens nerve vi means ability eye look inwards controlled trochlear nerve iv ability look outwards controlled abducens nerve vi movements controlled oculomotor nerve intermediate directions controlled simultaneous actions multiple muscles one shifts gaze horizontally one eye move laterally toward side move medially toward midline may neurally coordinated central nervous system make eyes move together almost involuntarily key factor study strabismus namely inability eyes directed one point two main kinds movement conjugate movement eyes move direction disjunctive opposite directions former typical shifting gaze right left latter convergence two eyes near object disjunction performed voluntarily usually triggered nearness target object seesaw movement namely one eye looking possible voluntarily effect brought putting prism front one eye relevant image apparently displaced avoid double vision noncorresponding points eye prism must move following image passing prism likewise conjugate torsion rolling anteroposterior axis front back occur naturally one tips ones head one shoulder torsion opposite direction keeps image vertical muscles show little inertia shutdown one muscle due checking antagonist motion vestibuloocular reflex reflex stabilizes gaze head moved reflex involves compensatory eye movements driven inhibitory excitatory signals table extraocular muscle innervation origins insertions primary actions muscles secondary tertiary actions also included upper eyelid damage cranial nerves may affect movement eye damage may result double vision diplopia movements eyes synchronized abnormalities visual movement may also seen examination jittering damage oculomotor nerve iii cause double vision inability coordinate movements eyes strabismus also eyelid drooping ptosis pupil dilation lesions may also lead inability open eye due paralysis levator palpebrae muscle individuals suffering lesion oculomotor nerve may compensate tilting heads alleviate symptoms due paralysis one eye muscles damage trochlear nerve iv also cause double vision eye adducted result eye move downwards properly especially downwards inward position due impairment superior oblique damage abducens nerve vi also result double due impairment lateral rectus muscle supplied abducens amblyopia also known lazy eye condition diminshed sight one eye ophthalmoparesis weakness paralysis one extraocular muscles initial
