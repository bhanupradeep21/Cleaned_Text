social sciences coordinated management meaning cmm provides understanding individuals create coordinate manage meanings process communication generally refers individuals establish rules creating interpreting meaning rules enmeshed conversation meaning constantly human communication viewed flexible open mutable process evolving ongoing joint interaction enables movement shifts evolving ways cmm embodies vision allows interpersonal connection open conversation among individuals groups applicable across multiple academic fields social scenarios simple terms cmm people manage process way

communicators apply rules order understand going social interaction based situation different rules applied order produce better patterns often times constitutive rules change regulative allow transformative empowerment self perspectives people rules discussed management sections cmm theory fairly complex study focusing complexity microsocial processes aspects daily overall concerned coordinate establish meaning interactions theory complicated teach andor present others best understood broken basics theory consists three key concepts broken several different building blocks fundamental building blocks cmm theory focus specifically flow communication people three different concepts experienced either consciously unconsciously coordination management meaning coordination refers degree persons perceive actions fitted together mutually intelligible sequence pattern exists two people attempt make sense sequencing messages people interaction recognize partners talking say conversation comes coordination scientists believe peoples desire coordination interaction arises subjectivity meaning means message may different meanings different people order avoid pitfall communication people work together share research shows sensemaking foundation coordination tokens within information connected means channel logic relationship emerge contributes sensemaking helps people establish common understanding develops coordination act formulating speech reaching initial coordination conversation coexists two parties actions person affect mutually affected person coevolving conversation unfolding action reflexively interpretable within various levels nested narrative meaning cases similar relational transformation thought emerge combination increased awareness strength regarding ones needs together increased appreciation compassion toward needs understanding taking place coordination relational transformation occurs recognition perspectives happening either concept coordination fact actions stand alone regard communication words actions use conversation come together produce patterns patterns also known stories lived influence behavior used interaction way collaborate pearce cronen quick point coordination imply commitment coordinate smoothly rather concept meant provide basis mindful side mindfulness also considered looking ethical production cmm example organizations interpersonal ethical analysis situations leads suggestion communicators gain proficient knowledge ethical principles considering strategic ambiguity viable approach organizational three possible outcomes coordination interaction fails achieve coordination achieve partially coordination possible solution move level meaning another level interactions guided defined rules interactants must understand social reality incorporate rules decide act given use rules individuals manage coordinate meanings conversation rules established dialogue interactants sufficiently common symbolic framework instance would ambiguous friend says hate friend really hate whomever heshe speaking heshe expressing hisher feelings moment rules help clarify explain kind meaning cmm theory sees conversation complex interconnected series events individual affects affected although primary emphasis cmm theory concept firstperson communication known participatory view concepts

management meaning states people organize meaning hierarchical manner theorists cmm agreement two points regarding hierarchical meaning first hierarchy meaning defines context regulative constitutive rules understood second contexts arranged hierarchy abstractness higher levels hierarchy help define may subsume lower interpreted contexts hierarchical understood looking contexts context always contextualizing hierarchal manner meanings mutually exclusive phase times messages misunderstood meaning produces separate orderings two important rules occur meaning produce mutually exclusive hierarchal ordering meaning constitutive regulative rules constitutive rules meaning employed social actors link different levels meaning hierarchies unfolding action occurringit addresses assign meaning addressed actions defined meaning exchange important messages different meanings people expressed nonbiased way expressed way one originally intends proving individuals tell stories particular vantage points narrative meaning hierarchies create also consider regulative rules regulative rules meaning structures temporal quality relate individuals manage unfolding sequence actions social coordination narratives messages exchanged meaning contexts recursively affect affected evolving actions ideally critical point conversation progresses six levels meaning listed lower level higher level content speech act episodes relationship life scripts cultural patterns six categories also assign moral value messages receive conscious unconscious consciously aware either obligatory legitimate undermined prohibited unconsciously aware caused probable random content message according cmm theory relates raw data information spoken aloud communication put simply content words used communicate content essentially basic building blocks language however important note content sufficient establish meaning another integral part cmm theory includes speech act speech acts communicate intention speaker indicate particular communication simplest explanation speech act actions perform speaking include compliments insults promises threats assertions cmm theory draws upon speech act theory breaks speech acts separate categories sounds utterances though speech act theory much detailed important understanding illocutionary perlocutionary utterances many different utterances speech acts including questions answers commands promises statements knowledge plays large part individual able participate communications exchange episode situation created persons conversation content take different meaning situation different example phrase used among close family friends may take entirely different meaning job interview interactions people may punctuate differently episode result people dealing differences punctuations subsequent episodes especially people situated bicultural multicultural situation identified number specific acts occurred equivalent situation culture would totally disrupted relationship higher level meaning relational boundaries parameters established attitudes building block fairly easy understand dynamic connects two individuals exchange information

several cmm texts describe building block script role individual plays movie life example individual may believe funny therefore may act according perspective engaged different conversations concept

complicated hierarchy meanings shift moment hierarchy meaning model addresses questions different contexts happening simultaneously layers foregrounding relevant shifting share story might personalizing much cmm theorists take hierarchy model step reinforcing importance interaction adding aspect time pearce stresses communication done alone furthermore usually occurs anothers actions therefore understanding past events impact individuals essential improving communication new model called serpentine model visually demonstrates communication back forth interaction participants rather simple transmission model addresses questions want make next turn marking beginning end episode would different went back embedded contexts illustrated hierarchy model represent stable hierarchy suggests higher levels subsume lower levels meanwhile sometimes lower levels reflect back affect meaning higher process termed loop cmm believes stronger contextual effect works higher levels lower levels weaker implicative effect works loops consistent hierarchy identified charmed loop kind interaction persons perceptions actions help reinforce others perceptions lower levels inconsistent higher levels called strange loop essentially strange loop repetitive interactional pattern alternates contradictory example alcoholic identifies alcoholic quits drinking since quit drinking convinces really alcoholic starts drinking makes alcoholic alternates contradictory perceptions alcoholic alcoholic charmed strange loop model also applications research regarding social construction male college student logical forces charmed strange loop model utilized studying male college students narratives describing memorable sexual experiences less commonly third variation called subversive loop texts contexts within subversive loop mutually invalidating prevent coherence coordination may result intentionally outrageous behavior efforts act uninterruptible ways refusal recognize possibility outsider understand situation model also commonly known luuutt model stands lived untold unheard unknown storytelling stories explained designated questions addresses questions storytelling story told heard known cmm theory regarding kind multitool providing framework structure different themes regard many qualitative studies using cmm illustrate utility framing findings people interpret messages know rules guide follow actions constitute appropriate responses focuses cultural influence get insights individuals negotiate complex messages occurring different levels since cmm attempts explain process group member make sense regular path messages carried group conversation according cmm individual perspective group approach conversation needs combine create better communication difficult especially people involved page coordinated management meaning helps bring purpose clarity conversation help extinguish blurred lines people prone misunderstanding others creating catastrophic miscommunication within relationship ultimately deteriorating connection cmm beneficial towards interpersonal relationships reason per columbia university theory allows people understand feelings also learning understand others creating harmony two end creates sustainable order provide criticism cmm theory important establish baseline accounts good study many scholars use different criteria determining makes theory relevant often surround following six cmm criticized broad scope highly abstract nature poole wrote difficult paint broad strokes time give difficult areas attention brenders also stated broad stroked approach human interaction cmm missed many linguistic international theoretical nuances necessary understanding communicative also criticized conceptual apparatus incomplete regard full examination material layering another common critique cmm says granted insufficient attention paid power cmm studies cmm theory seen interpretive theory pragmatic well systemic perspective cmm investigates power treating communication primary process constantly evolving instead abstract system instead foreground real conversations activities performed social agents relational context knowledge social injustice oppression comes critical reflexive understanding participants create meanings conjunction others via social oftentimes theorists say require critique critical angles unpacking theory research humanistic perspective cmm theory seen valuable seeks provide way clarify communication better interaction understanding utility lies people achieve meaning potential recurring conflicts influence self communication process promotes reform encouraging individuals explain particular viewpoints order reach understanding final point seen criticism positive critique pearce cronen constantly building upon cmm theory originally outlined constant corrections revisions theorists working toward improving examination communication interactions however new update minor course corrections alter terms meanings increasing complexity overall theory cmm guided research array contexts conclude cmm models allow us visualize express messages way whether similar
