medication insulin intake blood sugar checkup diet observance physical exercise really use diabetesrelated apps purposes recording diet medication intake blood glucose level promising improve health condition many products available help maintain records analyze trends related diabetes care support single diabetes tool one manufacturers glucose others intended interface many manufacturers diabetes management software free download used online others sale shareware simple easy use single user others powerful features support many users clinical emergence userfriendly mobile devices resulted renewed interest diabetes mobile applications review article currently available features compared evidencebased recommendations diabetes depending product selected variety include example shows logbook combine readings multiple meters one home another work school one place breakfast lunch dinner readings lined vertically help look trends logbook automatically colors box red low blood sugar blue high blood sugar example chart pattern easy visualize mornings tend bit high insulin needed night pattern lows occurring dinner perhaps dinner insulin afternoon basal rates could turned standard day data plots see example shows trends easy see blood glucose readings plotted level versus time day multiple days plotted top creating scatter points example shown easy see glycemic excursions high blood sugars following breakfast lunch identified improved using faster acting insulin injecting insulin minutes eating selecting carbohydrates eat slower peak bloodstream example shows pie charts quick way judge performance insulin doses throughout day relative goal keeping premeal blood glucose readings within boundaries subcharts automatically break breakfast lunch dinner late night well show premeal versus postmeal statistics example pie chart shown appears opportunity improve morning lows afternoon highs insulin adjustments example evaluates delivery insulin pump showing blood glucose plots along top carbohydrates eaten bubbles middle chart basal bolus insulin delivered bottom good example flexibility lifestyle afforded insulin pump user carbohydrates scheduled match insulin profiles yet glycemic excursions well controlled chart also easy see pump user meal forgot test blood glucose beforehand example shows control screen basal delivery insulin pump time day basal rate units per hour modified create custom basal rate pattern match insulin needs pump user icons shown save read data pc upload download pump example shows bolus control screen insulin carbohydrate ratio stored pump function meal eaten time day screen selects grams carbohydrate input parameter user pump calculate insulin bolus desired grams entered insulin carb ratio stored example shows data plot continuous glucose monitoring system cgms plot shows blood sugar levels meals also night bg testing methods using finger prick sample would typically miss data available samples cgms data new technology intended give immediate feedback finger sticks also predict extrapolation may happening soon give diabetic person chance correct high low blood sugar condition becomes urgent curve also illustrates dawn effect example shows data plot continuous glucose prediction system cgps plot shows blood sugar levels meals also night bg testing methods using finger prick sample would typically miss data available samples cgps new technology intended give immediate feedback finger sticks also predict may happening soon give person diabetes chance correct high low blood sugar condition becomes urgent globally estimated million adults living diabetes mellitus according latest data world health organization diabetes prevalence increasing rapidly previous estimates international diabetes federation put number million people diabetes number projected almost double type diabetes makes cases increases overall diabetes prevalence rates largely reflect increase risk factors type notably greater longevity overweight diabetes mellitus occurs throughout world common type diabetes developed countries greatest increase prevalence however occurring low middleincome countries including asia africa patients probably found increase incidence developing countries follows trend urbanization lifestyle changes including increasingly sedentary lifestyles less physically demanding work global nutrition transition marked increased intake foods high energydense nutrientpoor often high sugar saturated fats sometimes referred western pattern diet risk getting type diabetes widely found associated lower socioeconomic position across estimates diabetes resulted million deaths making leading cause death however another million deaths worldwide attributable high blood glucose increased risks associated complications eg heart disease stroke kidney failure often result premature death often listed underlying cause death certificates rather number people diabetes risen million million global prevalence diabetes among adults years age risen diabetes prevalence rising rapidly middle lowincome countries diabetes major cause blindness kidney failure heart attacks stroke lower limb amputation estimated million deaths directly caused diabetes another million deaths attributable high blood glucose half deaths attributable high blood glucose occur age years projects diabetes leading cause death healthy diet regular physical activity maintaining normal body weight avoiding tobacco use ways prevent delay onset type diabetes diabetes treated consequences avoided delayed diet physical activity medication regular screening treatment epidemiologic patterns demographic geographic biologic cultural factors populations presented gain insight etiology natural history risks complications data large epidemiologic studies worldwide indicate incidence increasing worldwide prevalence approximately us years age research risk factors active area research identify genetic environmental triggers could potentially targeted intervention significant advances made clinical care resultant improvements quality life clinical outcomes much needs done
