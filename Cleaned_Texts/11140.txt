cholesterol embolism occurs cholesterol released usually atherosclerotic plaque travels embolus bloodstream lodge embolism causing obstruction blood vessels away commonly causes skin symptoms usually livedo reticularis gangrene extremities sometimes kidney failure problems organs may arise depending site cholesterol crystals enter kidneys involved disease referred atheroembolic renal diagnosis usually involves biopsy removing tissue sample affected organ cholesterol embolism treated removing cause giving supportive therapy statin drugs found improve symptoms experienced cholesterol embolism depend largely organ involved nonspecific symptoms often described fever muscle ache weight loss embolism legs causes mottled appearance purple discoloration toes small infarcts areas gangrene due tissue death usually appear black areas skin assume marbled pattern known livedo pain usually severe requires opiates ulcerated plaque renal arteries manifestations appear lower extremities rarely ulcerated plaque aortic bifurcation cases changes occur one lower extremitycitation needed kidney involvement leads symptoms kidney failure nonspecific usually cause nausea reduced appetite anorexia raised blood pressure hypertension occasionally various symptoms electrolyte disturbance irregular heartbeat patients report hematuria bloody urine may detectable microscopic examination urine increased amounts protein urine may cause edema swelling skin combination symptoms known nephrotic emboli spread digestive tract reduced appetite nausea vomiting may occur well nonspecific abdominal pain gastrointestinal hemorrhage vomiting blood admixture blood stool occasionally acute pancreatitis inflammation central nervous system brain spinal cord peripheral nervous system may involved emboli brain may cause strokelike episodes headache episodes loss vision one eye known amaurosis emboli eye seen ophthalmoscopy known plaques emboli spinal cord may cause paraparesis decreased power legs cauda equina syndrome group symptoms due loss function distal part spinal cord loss control bladder rectum skin sensation around blood supply single nerve interrupted embolus result loss function muscles supplied nerve phenomenon called relatively unusual total number cases cholesterol emboli occur spontaneously usually happens people severe atherosclerosis large arteries aorta complication medical procedures involving blood vessels vascular surgery angiography coronary catheterization instance incidence furthermore cholesterol embolism may develop commencement anticoagulants thrombolytic medication decrease blood clotting dissolve blood clots respectively probably lead cholesterol emboli removing blood clots cover damaged atherosclerotic plaque cholesterolrich debris enter findings general investigations blood tests specific cholesterol embolism makes diagnosis difficult main problem distinction cholesterol embolism vasculitis inflammation small blood vessels may cause similar symptoms especially skin findings kidney worsening kidney function angiogram may also attributed kidney damage substances used procedure contrast nephropathy causes may lead similar symptoms include ischemic kidney failure kidney dysfunction due interrupted blood supply group diseases known thrombotic microangiopathies endocarditis infection heart valves small clumps infected tissue embolizing tests inflammation creactive protein erythrocyte sedimentation rate typically elevated abnormal liver enzymes may kidneys involved tests kidney function urea creatinine complete blood count may show particularly high numbers type white blood cell known eosinophils billion per liter occurs cases normal eosinophil counts rule examination urine may show red blood cells occasionally casts seen microscope increased levels protein third cases kidney involvement eosinophils also detected vasculitis suspected complement levels may determined reduced levels often encountered vasculitis complement group proteins forms part innate immune system complement levels frequently reduced cholesterol embolism limiting use test distinction vasculitis cholesterol microscopic examination tissue histology gives definitive diagnosis diagnostic histopathologic finding intravascular cholesterol crystals seen cholesterol clefts routinely processed tissue embedded paraffin cholesterol crystals may associated macrophages including giant cells eosinophilscitation needed sensitivity small core biopsies modest due sampling error process often patchy affected organs show characteristic histologic changes clinically diagnosed nonspecific tissue findings suggestive cholesterol embolization include ischemic changes necrosis unstableappearing complex atherosclerotic plaques cholesterolladen thin fibrous cap biopsy findings may diagnostic significant value help exclude alternate diagnoses eg vasculitis often made confidently based clinical criteriacitation needed treatment episode cholesterol emboli generally symptomatic ie deals symptoms complications reverse phenomenon kidney failure resulting cholesterol crystal emboli statins medication reduces cholesterol levels shown halve risk requiring phenomenon embolisation cholesterol first recognized danish pathologist dr peter ludvig panum published evidence eroded atheroma source emboli came american pathologist dr curtis flory reported phenomenon large autopsy series older individuals severe atherosclerosis httpsenwikipediaorgwikicholesterolembolism
