streptococcus pyogenes species grampositive aerotolerant bacteria genus streptococcus bacteria extracellular made nonmotile nonsporing cocci round cells tend link chains clinically important humans infrequent usually pathogenic part skin microbiota cause group streptococcal infection pyogenes predominant species harboring lancefield group antigen often called group streptococcus gas however streptococcus dysgalactiae streptococcus anginosus group possess group antigen well group streptococci grown blood agar typically produce small mm zones betahemolysis complete destruction red blood cells name group betahemolytic streptococcus gabhs thus also species name derived greek words meaning chain streptos berries coccus latinized kokkos pus pyoforming genes since number infections caused bacterium produce pus main criterion differentiation staphylococcus spp streptococcus spp catalase test staphylococci catalase positive whereas streptococci pyogenes cultured fresh blood agar plates pyr test allows differentiation streptococcus pyogenes morphologically similar betahemolytic streptococci including dysgalactiae subsp esquismilis pyogenes produce positive test estimated million gas

respiratory droplets skin contact contact objects surface dust contaminated bacteria less commonly transmission food bacteria cause variety diseases streptococcal pharyngitis rheumatic fever rheumatic heart disease scarlet fever although pharyngitis mostly viral origin pharyngitis cases children caused gas meanwhile pharyngitis adults streptococcal number pharyngitis cases higher children adults
