cushings syndrome collection signs symptoms due prolonged exposure glucocorticoids signs symptoms may include high blood pressure abdominal obesity thin arms legs reddish stretch marks round red face due facial fat lump shoulders weak muscles weak bones acne fragile skin heals women may hair irregular occasionally may changes mood headaches chronic feeling cushings syndrome caused either excessive cortisollike medication prednisone tumor either produces results production excessive cortisol adrenal cases due pituitary adenoma known cushings disease second common cause cushings syndrome number tumors often referred ectopic due placement outside pituitary may also cause associated inherited disorders multiple endocrine neoplasia type carney diagnosis requires number first step check medications person second step measure levels cortisol urine saliva blood taking test abnormal cortisol may measured late cortisol remains high blood test acth may cases treated due medications often slowly decreased still required slowly caused tumor may treated combination surgery chemotherapy andor pituitary affected medications may required replace lost treatment life expectancy usually surgery unable remove entire tumor increased risk two three cases per million persons caused overtly commonly affects people years women affected three times often mild degree overproduction cortisol without obvious symptoms however cushings syndrome first described american neurosurgeon harvey cushing cushings syndrome may also occur animals including cats dogs symptoms include rapid weight gain particularly trunk face sparing limbs central obesity common signs include growth fat pads along collarbone back neck buffalo hump lipodystrophy face moon face symptoms include excess sweating dilation capillaries thinning skin causes easy bruising dryness particularly hands mucous membranes purple red striae weight gain cushings syndrome stretches skin thin weakened causing hemorrhage trunk buttocks arms legs breasts proximal muscle weakness hips shoulders hirsutism facial malepattern hair growth baldness andor extremely dry brittle hair rare cases cushings cause hypocalcemia excess cortisol may also affect endocrine systems cause example insomnia inhibited aromatase reduced libido impotence men amenorrhoea oligomenorrhea infertility women due elevations androgens studies also shown resultant amenorrhea due hypercortisolism feeds back onto hypothalamus resulting decreased levels gnrh many features cushings seen metabolic syndrome including insulin resistance hypertension obesity elevated blood levels cognitive conditions including memory attention dysfunctions well depression commonly associated elevated may early indicators exogenous endogenous cushings depression anxiety disorders also striking distressing skin changes may appear cushings syndrome include facial acne susceptibility superficial fungus dermatophyte malassezia infections characteristic purplish atrophic striae signs include increased urination accompanying increased thirst persistent high blood pressure due cortisols enhancement epinephrines vasoconstrictive effect insulin resistance especially common acth production outside pituitary leading high blood sugar insulin resistance lead diabetes mellitus insulin resistance accompanied skin changes acanthosis nigricans axilla around neck well skin tags axilla untreated cushings syndrome lead heart disease increased mortality cortisol also exhibit mineralocorticoid activity high concentrations worsening hypertension leading hypokalemia common ectopic acth secretion hypernatremia increased na ions concentration plasma furthermore excessive cortisol may lead gastrointestinal disturbances opportunistic infections impaired wound healing related cortisols suppression immune inflammatory responses osteoporosis also issue cushings syndrome since osteoblast activity inhibited additionally cushings syndrome may cause sore aching joints particularly hip shoulders lower backcitation needed brain changes cerebral atrophy may atrophy associated areas high glucocorticoid receptor concentrations hippocampus correlates highly psychopathological personality cushings syndrome due excess acth may also result hyperpigmentation due melanocytestimulating hormone production byproduct acth synthesis proopiomelanocortin pomc alternatively proposed high levels acth βlipotropin γlipotropin contain weak msh function act melanocortin receptor variant cushings disease caused ectopic ie extra pituitary acth production example smallcell lung cushings syndrome caused increase cortisol level adrenal glands via adenoma hyperplasia negative feedback ultimately reduces acth production pituitary cases acth levels remain low hyperpigmentation cushings syndrome may result cause increased glucocorticoid levels whether due medication internal sources however consider glucocorticoid medicationinduced

excessive production acth adrenocorticotropic hormone excessive acth stimulates adrenal cortex produce high levels cortisol producing disease state cushings disease gives cushings syndrome cushings syndrome due cushings several possible causes cushings syndrome known including taking herbal supplements overthecounter list glutocoticoids common cause cushings syndrome use prescribed glucocorticoids treat diseases iatrogenic cushings syndrome glucocorticoids used treatment variety disorders including asthma rheumatoid arthritis also used immunosuppression organ transplants administration synthetic acth also possible acth less often prescribed due cost lesser utility rarely cushings syndrome also due use medroxyprogesterone exogenous cushings adrenal glands may often gradually atrophy due lack stimulation acth production suppressed glucocorticoid medication abruptly stopping medication thus result acute potentially lifethreatening adrenal insufficiency dose must hence slowly carefully tapered allow internal cortisol production pick cases patients never recover sufficient levels internal production must continue taking glucocorticoids physiological doses cushings syndrome childhood especially rare usually results use glucocorticoid endogenous cushings syndrome results derangement bodys system cortisol secretion normally acth released pituitary gland
