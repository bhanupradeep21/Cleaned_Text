genital herpes herpes infection genitals caused herpes simplex virus people either mild symptoms thus know symptoms occur typically include small blisters break open form painful flulike symptoms fever aching swollen lymph nodes may also onset typically around days exposure symptoms lasting infected outbreaks may occur generally disease typically spread direct genital contact skin surface secretions someone may occur sex including anal oral manual sores required transmission risk spread couple hsv classified two types historically common genital become common developed diagnosis may

recurs average four six times per year infection occurs per people recurrent genital herpes may treated suppressive therapy consists daily antiviral treatment using acyclovir valacyclovir suppressive therapy may useful least four recurrences per year quality evidence people lower rates recurrence probably also fewer recurrences suppressive suppressive therapy discontinued maximum one year reassess recurrence genital herpes spread viral shedding prior following formation ulcers risk spread couple year unprotected likelihood transferring genital herpes one person another decreased external condom use internal condom refraining sex active longer partner infection lower transmission infected person may decrease transmission risks maintaining daily dose antiviral infection genital herpes occurs every sexual herpes simplex virus hsv infection common routinely screened general population complete prevention transmission genital herpes difficult reduce chance contracting herpes simplex virus

contact transmission herpes simplex virus mother alternatively physicians use drug acyclovir treat pregnant women genital herpes weeks delivery prevent recurrence symptoms reduce risk transmission acyclovir approved purpose fda however acyclovirs manufacturer tracked pregnant women taken drug pregnancy evidence shows risks acyclovir may help reduce frequency symptomatic recurrence near term may definitively protect transmission cases may favorable particularly women prefer vaginal delivery instead cesarean sectioncitation needed cure disease skin lesions disappear without treatment within weeks treatment accelerates healing lesions reduces symptoms helps prevent reduce recurrent outbreaks disease antiviral medications provide clinical benefits symptomatic primary means management infected main goal use antiviral medications treat first outbreak prevent genital herpes recurrences improve quality life help suppress virus sexual transmission partners three fdaapproved antiviral medications clinical benefits controlling signs symptoms genital herpes used first clinical symptoms recurrent episodes used daily suppressive medications acyclovir valacyclovir famciclovir shown safe longterm use acyclovir antiviral medication reduces pain number lesions initial case genital herpes furthermore decreases frequency severity recurrent infections comes capsules tablets ointment however topical ointment acyclovir discouraged since offers minimal clinical benefits valacyclovir prodrug converted acyclovir body helps relieve pain discomfort speeds healing sores comes caplets advantage longer duration action famciclovir another antiviral drug belongs class famciclovir prodrug converted penciclovir body latter one active viruses longer duration action acyclovir comes first time individual experiences genital herpes may prolonged clinical illness severe genital furthermore mild clinical symptoms initially may experience severe recurrent infections later typical recommended regimens first clinical episodes genital herpes may something treatment longer days may recommended genital ulcers fully healed individuals experience symptomatic first episode genital herpes experience recurrence genital lesions point future asymptomatic shedding also occur individual may genital ulcerations present still possibly transmit virus partners important patients discussion primary care doctor options receiving either episodic treatment longterm suppressive suppressive therapy shown effective reducing recurrent genital herpes high tremendously help improving quality life since patients claim minimal symptomatic longterm use antivirals like acyclovir valacyclovir famciclovir shown safe effective furthermore longterm treatment genital herpes valacyclovir daily shown decrease rates important patients continue suppressive therapy conjunction consistent condom use sexual abstinence recurrent episodes decrease transmission decrease symptoms outbreak
