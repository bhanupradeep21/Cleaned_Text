labile hypertension occurs unexpected changes blood pressure term used describe people blood pressure measurements abruptly fluctuates abnormally high approximately hg returns normal patients labile hypertension may higher cardiac output lower total peripheral resistance behavioural lifestyle factors two main factors causes labile hypertension occur extrinsic factors physical activities insomnia intake sodium likely increase occurrence labile hypertension reduced arterial compliance baroreflex failure may contribute trigger response diagnosis typically hours ambulatory blood pressure monitoring measurements taken home without visit physician office labile hypertension primary risk factor may contribute stroke cardiovascular disease cvd prevention life threatening complications involves lifestyle changes avoidance smoking reducing amount salt caffeine alcohol intake set criteria treat labile hypertension many underlying mechanisms symptoms stressors main cause labile hypertension common treatment may involve prescription medications antianxiety tablets reduce emotional stressors otherwise well decrease risk labile hypertension two different types hypertension though underlying mechanisms blood pressure fluctuates normal abnormally high remains samecitation needed generally labile hypertension present physical symptoms fluctuations blood pressure elevation decrease blood pressure reading usually occurs without intervention however normal resting pressure remains abnormally excessive common signs symptoms present include headache heart palpitations flushing tinnitus ringing buzzing noise one ears weakness body dizziness diaphoresis may describe episodes abrupt onset evoked stress episodes symptoms may range half hour many hours frequently attacks ranged twice day monthscitation needed typically increase blood pressure may put strain heart possibly organs may cause damage blood vessels eyes heart uncontrollable increase blood pressure cause damage arteries present around kidneys thus restrict blood deliver due inconsistent fluctuations blood pressure cause additional problems people preexisting heart blood vessel conditions angina cerebral aneurysm aortic uncontrolled pressure blood lead complications vascular dementia narrowed arteries reduce limit blood flow braincitation needed important understand common blood pressure rise fall dramatically dealing stressors people everyday life normal others may serious possible causes alone conjunction cause labile hypertension following criteriacitation needed labile hypertension occur exposure everyday lifestyles include usage tobacco tobacco significantly increase blood pressure heart rate temporarily damage artery walls caused chemicals contained chemicals tobacco include nicotine carbon monoxide interferes cardiovascular system cvd nicotine stimulant releases vasopressin cause blood vessel constrict thus reduce amount blood flow carbon monoxide toxic chemical binds haemoglobin molecule blood carries oxygen decrease amount oxygen delivered cells cause damage organs body damage arterial walls cause vasoconstriction allowing arteries narrow increase risk heart drinking much alcohol moderately one drink women two drinks men cause damage heart researchers found heavy drinkers lead episodes tachycardia problem electrical signalling elevate heart rate frequent drinking lead blood clots may increase severity heart attack stroke ambulatory blood pressure monitoring noninvasive portable device monitor record blood pressure automatically specific time day especially focused people white coat syndrome reduce elevation blood pressure visit examination allow doctors identify results observe patients normally undergo ambulatory blood pressure monitoring suggested keep record periods awake asleep times medication intake periods exposed exercise allows clinicians eliminate transition periods blood pressure rapidly blood pressure reading recorded two numbers systolic diastolic systolic blood pressure represents amount pressure blood applying artery walls heartbeats whereas diastolic blood pressure shows heart resting beatscitation needed electrocardiogram ekg ecg clinical test measure record electrical conductivity heart helps determine defects heart electrical activity rhythm rate help assist diagnosis heart defects may affect heart rhythm tachycardia coronary artery blood flow eg ischemia electrodes placed surface skin connected amplifier detect electrical changes cardiac muscle depolarising repolarisingcitation needed specific set criteria treat labile hypertension condition yet well defined makes difficult doctors treat labile hypertension medications usually given patients hypertension generally doctors suggest people monitor observe blood pressure throughout day preferably hours commonly prescribed medications available today blood pressure may effective labile hypertension mainly caused anxiety occurrence short term situations doctors often prescribe antianxiety medications may help reduce stressors common medications reduce anxiety includescitation needed longterm treatment anxiety requires daily medication would include paroxetine paxil sertraline zoloft escitalopram lexapro citalopram celexa otherwise prescription drug called clonidine used lower blood pressure relaxing blood vessels prevent life threatening problems stroke heart attacks kidney problemscitation needed beta blockers medications often prevent paroxysmal labile hypertension interact sympathetic nervous system beta blockers help reduce blood pressure blocking effects hormone epinephrine also known adrenaline effect taking beta blockers help lower heart rate well help improve blood flow opening blood vessels widely doctors may prescribe beta blockers one medications help reduce blood pressure including diuretics calcium channel blockerscitation needed labile hypertension initially treated behavioural modifications behavioural factors mental activity individual emotional status managed anxiety one common forms mental illness increasing risks affect physical health problems therefore reduce stress anxiety reduction smoking alcohol decreasing intake salt regular aerobic activity examples therapy help manage cases labile hypertension reducing alcohol intake systolic blood pressure lower hg diastolic blood pressure mm hgcitation needed however doctors preferably suggest patients monitor blood pressure home modification lifestyle behavioural changescitation needed prevalence labile hypertension usa estimated million adults develop risks hemorrhagic labile hypertension common charlottesville virginia population average age labile hypertension found ageing one characteristics highly associates fluctuations blood pressure day night time systolic diastolic pressure alternates shows abnormal diurnal patterncitation needed httpsenwikipediaorgwikilabilehypertension
