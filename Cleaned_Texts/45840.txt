drydie antiparasitic agent eliminate possible effects light transferring ectoparasites since sparrows entrain tests temperature fluctuation sparrows remained entrained months enucleation point excess functional retina would degraded menaker ruled possible confounding menakers lab concluded sparrows able entrain environmental light cues results demonstrate retinal light receptors necessary
