anatomical terminology used uniquely describe aspects skeletal muscle cardiac muscle smooth muscle actions structure size location three types muscle tissue body skeletal smooth cardiac skeletal muscle voluntary muscle striated muscle tissue primarily joins bone tendons skeletal muscle enables movement bones maintains widest part muscle pulls tendons known belly muscle slip slip muscle either anatomical branching muscle rib connections serratus anterior muscle smooth muscle involuntary found parts body conveys action without conscious intent majority type muscle tissue found digestive urinary systems acts propelling forward food chyme feces former urine latter places smooth muscle found within uterus helps facilitate birth eye pupillary sphincter controls pupil cardiac muscle specific heart also involuntary movement additionally selfexcitatory contracting without outside well anatomical terms motion describe motion made muscle unique terminology used describe action set muscles agonist muscles antagonist muscles muscles cause inhibit agonist muscles also called prime movers since produce force control agonists cause movement occur example triceps brachii contracts producing shortening concentric contraction phase pushup elbow extension phase pushup triceps brachii actively controls elbow flexion producing lengthening eccentric contraction still agonist resisting gravity relaxing triceps brachii continues prime mover controller joint action another example dumbbell curl elbow elbow flexor group agonist shortening lifting phase elbow flexion lowering phase elbow flexor muscles lengthen remaining agonists controlling load movement elbow extension lifting lowering phase elbow extensor muscles antagonists see lengthen dumbbell lifting phase shorten dumbbell lowering phase important understand common practice give name muscle group eg elbow flexors based joint action produce shortening contraction however naming convention mean agonists shortening term typically describes function skeletal antagonist muscles simply muscles produce opposing joint torque agonist torque aid controlling motion opposing torque slow movement especially case ballistic movement example rapid ballistic discrete movement elbow throwing dart triceps muscles activated briefly strongly burst rapidly accelerate extension movement elbow followed almost immediately burst activation elbow flexor muscles decelerates elbow movement arrive quick stop use automotive analogy would similar pressing accelerator pedal rapidly immediately pressing brake antagonism intrinsic property particular muscle muscle group role muscle plays depending muscle currently agonist slower joint actions involve gravity agonist muscle antagonist muscle shorten lengthen using example triceps brachii pushup elbow flexor muscles antagonists elbow phase phase movement dumbbell curl elbow extensors antagonists lifting lowering antagonist agonist muscles often occur pairs called antagonistic pairs one muscle contracts relaxes example antagonistic pair biceps triceps contract triceps relaxes biceps contracts lift arm reverse motions need antagonistic pairs located opposite sides joint bone including abductoradductor pairs flexorextensor pairs consist extensor muscle opens joint increasing angle two bones flexor muscle opposite decreasing angle two bones however muscles always work way sometimes agonists antagonists contract time produce force per lombards paradox also sometimes joint action controlled agonist muscle antagonist slightly activated naturally occurs normally considered problem unless excessive uncontrolled disturbs control joint action called agonistantagonist coactivation serves mechanically stiffen joint muscles paired way example exception synergist muscles also called fixators act around joint help action agonist muscle synergist muscles also act counter neutralize force agonist also known neutralizers neutralizers help cancel neutralize extra motion produced agonists ensure force generated works within desired plane motion muscle fibers contract fully stretched lengthcitation needed thus short fibers pennate muscles suitable power rather range contraction required limitation range contraction affects muscles act several joints may unable shorten sufficiently produce full range movement simultaneously active insufficiency eg fingers fully flexed wrist also flexed likewise opposing muscles may unable stretch sufficiently allow movement take place passive insufficiency reasons often essential use synergists type action fix certain joints others moved effectively eg fixation wrist full flexion fingers clenching fist synergists muscles facilitate fixation action important difference helping synergist muscle true synergist muscle true synergist muscle one neutralizes undesired joint action whereas helping synergist one neutralizes undesired action also assists desired actioncitation needed muscle fixes holds bone agonist carry intended movement said neutralizing action good famous example hamstrings semitendinosus semimembranosus muscles perform knee flexion knee internal rotation whereas biceps femoris carries knee flexion knee external rotation knee flex rotating either direction three muscles contract stabilize knee moves desired way composite hybrid muscles one set fibers perform function usually supplied different nerves different set fibers example tongue composite muscle made various components like longitudinal transverse horizontal muscles different parts innervated different nerve supply number terms used naming muscles including relating size shape action location orientation number heads insertion origin muscle two places anchored one end connective tissue attachment called enthesis origin muscle bone typically proximal greater mass stable contraction muscles insertion example latissimus dorsi muscle origin site torso insertion arm muscle contracts normally arm moves due less mass torso case grabbing objects lighter body typical use lat pull machine reversed however chin torso moves meet arm head muscle also called caput musculi part end muscle origin attaches fixed bone muscles biceps one head insertion muscle structure attaches tends moved contraction muscle may bone tendon subcutaneous dermal connective tissue insertions usually connections muscle via tendon insertion bone tends distal less mass greater motion origin contraction intrinsic muscles origin part body act contained within extrinsic muscles origin outside part body
