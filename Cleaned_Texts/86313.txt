limb bud structure formed early vertebrate limb development result interactions ectoderm underlying mesoderm formation occurs roughly around fourth week development human embryo upper limb bud appears third week lower limb bud appears four days limb bud consists undifferentiated mesoderm cells sheathed result cell signaling interactions ectoderm underlying mesoderm cells formation developing limb bud occurs mesenchymal cells lateral plate mesoderm somites begin proliferate point create bulge ectodermal cells mesoderm cells limb bud come lateral plate mesoderm eventually differentiate developing limbs connective tissues cartilage bone moreover mesoderm cells come somites eventually differentiate myogenic cells limb limb bud remains active throughout much limb development stimulates creation positive feedback retention two signaling regions apical ectodermal ridge aer zone polarizing activity zpa mesenchymal signaling centers crucial proper formation limb correctly oriented corresponding axial polarity developing organism research determined aer signaling region within limb bud determines proximaldistal axis formation limb using fgf zpa signaling establishes anteriorposterior axis formation limb using shh additionally though known specific signaling region like aer zpa dorsalventral axis established limb bud competitive bmp signals dorsal ectoderm ventral ectoderm use signaling systems reciprocally sustain others activity limb development essentially autonomous signaling regions hox genes define features along anteriorposterior axis developing organism determine points along axis limb buds though limbs emerge different locations different species positions always correlate level hox gene expression along anteriorposterior limb buds must also rely signaling factors obtain forelimb hindlimb identity hox gene expression influences expression tbox proteins turn determine limb identity certain turn activation tbox protein activates signaling cascades involve wnt signaling pathway fgf limb development begins tbox proteins initiate expression proliferating mesenchymal cells lateral plate mesoderm form limb bud stabilize expression forelimb hindlimb expression stimulates expression ectodermal cells resulting formation apical ectodermal ridge well inducing secreted aer acts keep cells limb mesenchyme mitotically active state sustains production positive feedback loop limb mesenchymal cells aer maintains continued growth development entire addition limb outgrowth formation crucial signaling center zone polarizing activity zpa small posterior portion limb bud helps establish anteriorposterior polarity limb secretion protein sonic hedgehog zpa also plays important role initially specifying digit identity later maintaining proper aer morphology continued secretion ensure proper mitotic activity limb bud mesenchyme chickens specifies hindlimb status specifies forelimb mice however hindlimbs forelimbs develop presence either fact genes appears necessary specification developing hindlimb whereas absence results forelimb appear important specifically limb outgrowth within limb bud expression specific hox genes varies function position along anteriorposterior axis hox genes linked four chromosomal clusters hoxa hoxb hoxc physical position chromosome correlates time place expression statement supported knowledge hox gene expression initiated gastrulation primitive somitic mesoderm fgf signaling effects primitive somitic mesoderm cells different times depending axial location organism even specified anteriorposterior axis signals retinoic additional evidence role hox genes play limb development found researchers effected hox gene expressions zebrafish adding retinoic acid gastrulation experiment resulted duplication although excess retinoic acid alter limb patterning ectopically activating shh expression genetic studies mouse eliminate retinoic acid synthesis shown ra required limb chicken development wonderful example specificity hox gene expression regard limb development hoxc genes expressed anterior limbs chickens genes expressed posterior intermediate genes expressed upper lower limbs previously stated limb development essentially autonomous signaling centers aer zpa established however important know hox genes continue participate dynamic regulation limb development even aer zpa established limb bud complex communication ensues aersecreted fgf signals zpasecreted shh signals initiate regulate hox gene expression developing limb though many finer details remain resolved number significant connections hox gene expression impact limb development discovered pattern hox gene expression divided three phases throughout limb bud development corresponds three key boundaries proximaldistal limb development transition first phase second phase marked introduction shh signals transition third phase marked changes limb bud mesenchymal cells responds shh means although shh signaling required effects change time mesoderm primed respond three phases regulation reveal mechanism natural selection independently modify three limb segments stylopod zeugopod mimicking initial secretions lateral plate mesoderm cells limb development initiated signaling molecules implicated determining limbs identity expressed posteriorly near zpa highest levels shh signal expression occur experiments reveal limb mesenchyme contains necessary information concerning limb identity aer needed stimulate mesenchyme live destiny becoming arm leg etc zpa first specifies anteriorposterior
