formulation work american robin active mostly day winter grounds assembles large flocks night roost trees secluded swamps dense vegetation flocks break day birds feed fruits berries smaller groups summer american robin defends breeding territory less american robins diet generally consists around percent small invertebrates mainly insects earthworms beetle grubs caterpillars grasshoppers percent wild cultivated fruits ability switch berries allows winter much farther north north american thrushes flock fermented pyracantha berries eating sufficient quantities exhibit intoxicated behavior falling walking robins forage primarily ground softbodied invertebrates find worms sight sometimes pouncing pulling nestlings fed mainly earthworms softbodied animal prey areas robins particularly northwestern subspecies caurinus feed beaches taking insects small american robins common pests fruit orchards north due insectivorous frugivorous diet evolved lose sucrose unpalatable used humans american robin uses auditory visual olfactory possibly vibrotactile cues find prey vision predominant mode prey frequently seen running across lawns picking earthworms running stopping behavior distinguishing characteristic addition hunting visually also ability hunt hearing experiments shown find earthworms underground simply using listening typically take several short hops cock
