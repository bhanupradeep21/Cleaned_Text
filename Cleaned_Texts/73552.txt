charles spearman developed twofactor theory intelligence using factor research led develop concept g factor general intelligence also factor specific intellectual l l thurstone howard gardner robert sternberg also researched structure intelligence analyzing data concluded single underlying factor influencing general intelligence individuals however spearman criticized godfrey thomson claimed evidence crucial modern research still expanding theory investigating spearmans law diminishing adding connected concepts charles spearman developed statistical procedure called factor analysis factor analysis related variables tested correlation correlation related items evaluated find clusters groups spearman tested well people performed various tasks relating intelligence tasks include distinguishing pitch perceiving weight colors directions analyzing data collected spearman noted well one area also scored higher areas data spearman concluded must one central factor influences cognitive abilities spearman termed general intelligence due controversy structure intelligence psychologists also published relevant research charles spearman three others developed hypothesis regarding structure intelligence l l thurstone tested subjects different abilities data established seven primary mental abilities relating intelligence categorized spatial ability numerical ability word fluency memory perceptual speed verbal comprehension inductive reasoning researchers interested new research study analyzed thurstones data discovering scored high one category often well finding gives support underlying factor influencing namely g howard gardner suggested theory multiple intelligences intelligence formed multiple abilities recognized eight intelligences linguistic musical spatial intrapersonal interpersonal logicalmathematical bodilykinesthetic naturalist also considered possibility ninth intelligent ability existential gardner proposed individuals excelled one ability would lack another instead results showed eight intelligences correlate positively analysis gardner found logic spatial abilities language mathematics linked way giving support underlying g factor prominent almost intelligence robert sternberg agreed gardner multiple intelligences narrowed scope three triarchic theory intelligence analytical creative practical classified analytical intelligence problemsolving skills tests academics creative intelligence considered people react adaptively new situations create novel ideas practical intelligence defined everyday logic used multiple solutions decisions sternberg analyzed data relationship three intelligences surprised data resembled psychologists found three mental abilities correlated highly one another evidence one basic factor g primary psychologists agreed spearman general intelligence godfrey thomson wrote paper criticizing spearmans g object paper show cases brought forward professor spearman favor existence general ability means crucial true inconsistent existence common element neither inconsistent nonexistence essential point professor spearmans hypothesis existence general factor opponents agreed specific factors peculiar individual tests opponents agree group factors run tests difference professor spearman says single factor runs tests pooling tests group factors soon eliminated point reached correlations due general factor alone pp spearman originally came term general intelligence called g measure intelligence two theory intelligence spearman first researched experiment children small village school measuring three intellectual measures based teachers rankings address intellectual sensory two different sets measure school cleverness common sense common sense results showed average r intellectual sensory measures school cleverness commonsense three tasks intercorrelated data looked populations including high school spearman proposed intellectual sensory measure combined assessment general spearmans twofactor theory proposes intelligence two components general intelligence g specific ability explain differences performance different tasks spearman hypothesized component specific certain aspect intelligence regarding g spearman saw individuals level less general intelligence varied person person based specific behavior geneticist robert plomin described g saying g one reliable valid measures behavioral domain predicts important social outcomes educational occupational levels far better visualize g imagine venn diagram four circles overlapping middle overlapping circles would g influences specific intelligences represented four circles though specific number factors unknown relatively accepted mechanical spatial logical rising interest debate structure intelligence prompted spearman elaborate argue hypothesis claimed g made one single ability rather two genetically influenced unique abilities working together called abilities eductive reproductive suggested future understanding interaction two different abilities would drastically change individual differences cognition understood psychology possibly creating basis many researches currently using spearmans form intelligence testing current studies although studies currently using spearmans exact model intelligence testing adding modern concepts study spearman described functional relationship intelligence sensory discriminatory recent research determined overlap working memory general discriminatory abilities fluid work built expanded linked many factors related intelligence intelligence testing measuring g factor studied recently reexplore spearmans law diminishing study investigates g test scores likely decrease g research done investigate g scores made scores differential ability scales factors law diminishing returns compare spearmans law diminishing use linear nonlinear confirmatory factor analysis showing nonlinear model best described nonlinear model suggests g increases factor lowers overall score inaccurately represents general intelligence theory still greatly present todays modern psychology researchers examining theory recreating modern research g factor still frequently studied current research example study could use compared various similar intelligence measures scales wechsler intelligence scale children compared spearmans g shows decrease statistic research adapted incorporate modern psychological topics spearmans two factor theory intelligence nature versus nurture one topic cross studied spearmans g factor research shows although environmental factors influence g factor differently found affected influenced early life rather adulthood little genetic influence documented greatly influence g factor httpsenwikipediaorgwikitwofactortheoryofintelligence
