hypertensive disease pregnancy also known maternal hypertensive disorder group high blood pressure disorders include preeclampsia preeclampsia superimposed chronic hypertension gestational hypertension chronic maternal hypertensive disorders occurred million women pregnancies globally complicated hypertensive united states hypertensive disease pregnancy affects rates increased developing resulted deaths deaths one three major causes death pregnancy along post partum bleeding puerperal infections although many pregnant women high blood pressure healthy babies without serious problems high blood pressure dangerous mother baby women preexisting chronic high blood pressure likely certain complications pregnancy normal blood pressure however women develop high blood pressure pregnant often called gestational chronic poorlycontrolled high blood pressure pregnancy puts pregnant woman baby risk problems associated increased risk maternal complications preeclampsia placental abruption placenta separates wall uterus gestational diabetes women also face higher risk poor birth outcomes preterm delivery infant small hisher gestational age infant women greater risk developing hypertension pregnancy single test predict diagnose preeclampsia key signs increased blood pressure protein urine proteinuria symptoms seem occur preeclampsia include persistent headaches blurred vision sensitivity light abdominal sensations caused disorders also occur healthy pregnancies regular visits scheduled track blood pressure level protein urine order analyze blood tests detect signs preeclampsia monitor fetal development classification hypertensive disorders pregnancy uses categories recommended us national high blood pressure education program working group high blood pressure terminology preferred older widely used term pregnancyinduced hypertension pih newer terminology reflects simply relation pregnancy either onset first detection hypertension question causation pathogenetically interesting important point health care purposes classification treats hellp syndrome type preeclampsia rather parallel chronic hypertension type high blood pressure pregnant woman preexisting conception diagnosed early pregnancy persists significantly end pregnancy affects pregnancies primary disorder essential hypertension secondary another condition caused pregnancy diagnostic criteria chronic hypertension typically considered least two separate blood pressure readings taken least four hours apart systolic blood pressure diastolic blood pressure mmhg identified pregnancy weeks gestation persisting least weeks giving however controversy utility adopting lower thresholds diagnosis chronic hypertension consistent recent recommendations american college cardiology american heart association diagnosis hypertension chronic hypertension pregnancy considered mild blood pressures exceed mmhg systolic mmhg diastolic severe pressures mmhg systolic mmhg diastolic although controversy also exists appropriate cutoffs chronic hypertension progress severe forms disease important accurately diagnose condition early ideally prior pregnancy initiate management control parental blood often difficult many reproductive individuals may regularly visit doctor pregnant may initially present prenatal care second preeclampsia medical condition usually develops weeks gestation traditionally involves newly increased blood pressure blood pressure mmhg preeclampsia leading cause fetal complications include low birth weight preterm birth stillbirth women preeclampsia encouraged deliver child weeks gestation minimize risks severe preeclampsia also diagnosed woman increased blood pressure signs significant organ damage signs significant organ damage woman preeclampsia signs significant organ damage condition classified preeclampsia severe diagnosis made even patient proteinuria women preeclampsia severe features encouraged deliver child weeks gestation minimize risks severe preeclampsia also present seizures pregnant case patient would diagnosed eclampsiacitation needed proven way prevent women develop signs preeclampsia however closely monitored lessen avoid related way cure preeclampsiaeclampsia deliver abort eclampsia one particularly concerning form preeclampsia pregnant woman previously presented signs newly increased blood pressure begins experience new generalized seizures patients eclampsia experience complications associated complications include hellp syndrome acute kidney injury disseminated intravascular coagulation among hellp syndrome type preeclampsia severe features involves increased hemolysis increased liver enzymes low platelet women hellp syndrome high blood pressure proteinuria hellp syndrome cases present classical signs however like preeclampsia hellp syndrome also lead low birth weight premature birth hellp syndrome fetalneonatal mortality rate preeclampsia superimposed chronic hypertension occurs pregnant woman chronic hypertension develops signs preeclampsia typically defined new onset proteinuria mgdl dipstick least random urine specimens collected h apart within interval

thrombocytopenia platelet count impaired liver function newonset worsening renal insufficiency pulmonary edema persistent cerebral visual disturbances result superimposed preeclampsia diagnosed without proteinuria sudden increase previously wellcontrolled blood pressure accompanied severe features gestational hypertension provisional diagnosis involves newly increased blood pressure pregnant woman usually develops weeks gestation currently show signs proteinuria features associated gestational hypertension patients go develop form gestational hypertension normally resolve weeks case diagnosis gestational hypertension updated transient hypertension increased blood pressure resolve weeks postpartum diagnosis gestational hypertension updated chronic blood pressure control accomplished pregnancy medications control blood pressure certain medications may ideal blood pressure control pregnancy angiotensinconverting enzyme ace inhibitors angiotensin ii aii receptor controlling weight gain pregnancy help reduce risk hypertension limited evidence suggest calcium supplementation may reduce risk preeclampsia stillbirth unclear way definitively treat hypertensive disease pregnancy ie preeclampsiaeclampsia gestational hypertension etc deliver prevents development complications related disorder mother therefore first line approach management conditions consider

gestational age delivered management focused managing symptoms give fetus time women gestational hypertension studies found usage baby aspirin prevent progression condition preeclampsiaeclampsia reduce risk complications associated hypertensive disorders pregnant women chronic hypertension diagnosed early pregnancy evaluated identify underlying cause hypertension well possible existing endorgan damage caused hypertension cardiac kidney although cases chronic hypertension primary thus classified essential hypertension secondary causes renal vascular endocrine disorders must also considered especially patients chronic hypertension presenting abnormally instance young age refractory firstline endorgan damage underlying cause hypertension identified conditions must also women chronic hypertension pregnancy must closely monitored five times likely normal blood pressure develop preeclampsia much severe condition serious risks mother hypertensive disorders pregnancy major component care management associated involves use antihypertensive medication well restricting activity lower blood pressure reduce risk women preeclampsia eclampsia magnesium sulfate often prescribed prevent occurrence seizures gestational treatment continued time diagnosis several weeks postpartum given increased risk medical complications immediately following delivery recent systematic review found postpartum home blood pressure monitoring likely improves determination blood pressure measures overall patient effects high blood pressure pregnancy vary depending disorder factors preeclampsia general increase womans risk developing chronic hypertension heartrelated problems women normal blood pressure develop preeclampsia week first pregnancy shortterm complications including increased blood pressure usually go away within six weeks women chronic hypertension pregnancy increased risk complications premature birth low birthweight women high blood pressure complications pregnancy three times risk developing cardiovascular disease compared women normal blood pressure complications pregnancy monitoring pregnant womens blood pressure help prevent complications future
