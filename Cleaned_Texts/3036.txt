also pointed animal known continental beds may therefore scavenger similar vultures marabou attila ősi agreed istiodactylus able cut meat way added would able process food precisely occluding witton pointed teeth istiodactylus unlike enlarged recurved teeth pterosaurs rhamphorhynchines ornithocheirids ideal obtaining slippery prey instead razoredged teeth would better suited shearing food grabbing fish witton also discussed unpublished phd thesis german palaeontologist michael fastnacht wherein biomechanical calculations predicted istiodactylus filterfed manner similar ducks witton

suited filterfeeding dismissed idea ducklike lifestyle witton elaborated idea istiodactylus scavenger scavenging birds mosaic strong weak elements skulls struggle prey need able tear pull morsels cadavers birds also relatively small eyes compared predatory birds need search hiding animals make carefully judged attacks prey istiodactylus appears large jaw muscles therefore strong bite skull deep would helped resist bending pulling flesh individual bones skull instead slender shallow toothrows short indicates istiodactylus necessary reinforcements predation subdue struggling prey together features indicate istiodactylus fed large prey necessitated strong jaws processing yet also motionless enough strain jaws skull could controlled feeding eyes istiodactylus also seem proportionally small compared pterosaurs presumed predatory ornithocheirids witton concluded among pterosaurs istiodactylus appears bestadapted scavenging lifestyle envisioned istiodactylids would step back carcass powerful carnivores attracted would return finish remains animals martill suggested odontoid tip lower jaw istiodactylus served fill space tooth present completed arclike bite would necessary sever morsels would otherwise remain attached thread martill stated animals known teeth similar istiodactylus pointed similarity various types sharks reptiles including cookiecutter shark takes circular bites fish well prey much larger including whales istiodactylus may also taken circular bites prey larger dinosaurs crocodiles perhaps also fish example snapping backs near water martill stated many differences skull istiodactylus extant scavengers lack sharp pointed beak could made less capable tearing flesh long neck may provided enough pulling power claws fingers may used manipulate carcasses martill agreed istiodactylus likely scavenger would used robust teeth scrape meat bones indicated wearfacets toothtips proposed scratchmarks looked dinosaur bones also suggested scraping away last
