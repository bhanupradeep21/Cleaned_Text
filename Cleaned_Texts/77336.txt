plant reproduction production new offspring plants accomplished sexual asexual reproduction sexual reproduction produces offspring fusion gametes resulting offspring genetically different either parent asexual reproduction produces new individuals without fusion gametes resulting clonal plants genetically identical parent plant unless mutations occur asexual reproduction involve production fusion male female gametes asexual reproduction may occur budding fragmentation spore formation regeneration vegetative propagation asexual reproduction type reproduction offspring comes one parent thus inheriting characteristics parent asexual reproduction plants occurs two fundamental forms vegetative reproduction vegetative reproduction involves vegetative piece original plant producing new individuals budding tillering etc distinguished apomixis replacement sexual reproduction cases involves seeds apomixis occurs many plant species dandelions taraxacum species also nonplant organisms apomixis similar processes nonplant organisms see parthenogenesis natural vegetative reproduction process mostly found perennial plants typically involves structural modifications stem roots species leaves plant species employ vegetative reproduction means perennialize plants allowing survive one season next often facilitating expansion size plant persists location vegetative reproduction individuals gives rise clonal colony single ramet apparent individual clonal colony genetically identical others colony distance plant move vegetative reproduction limited though plants produce ramets branching rhizomes stolons cover wide area often growing seasons sense process one reproduction one survival expansion biomass individual individual organism increases size via cell multiplication remains intact process called vegetative growth however vegetative reproduction new plants result new individuals almost every respect except genetic major disadvantage vegetative reproduction transmission pathogens parent offspring uncommon pathogens transmitted plant seeds sexual reproduction apomixis though occasions needed seeds generated apomixis means asexual reproduction involving formation dispersal seeds originate fertilization embryos hawkweeds hieracium dandelions taraxacum species citrus kentucky blue grass poa pratensis use form asexual reproduction pseudogamy occurs plants apomictic seeds pollination often needed initiate embryo growth though pollen contributes genetic material developing forms apomixis occur plants also including generation plantlet replacement seed generation bulbils instead flowers new cloned individuals produced rhizome modified underground stem serving organ vegetative reproduction growing tips rhizome separate new plants eg polypody iris couch grass nettles prostrate aerial stems called runners stolons important vegetative reproduction organs species strawberry numerous grasses ferns adventitious buds form roots near ground surface damaged stems stumps cut trees old roots develop aboveground stems leaves form budding called suckering reproduction regeneration plant shoots arise existing root system species characteristically produce suckers include elm many members rose family bulbous plants onion allium cepa hyacinths narcissi tulips reproduce vegetatively dividing underground bulbs bulbs plants like potatoes solanum tuberosum dahlias reproduce vegetatively underground tubers gladioli crocuses reproduce vegetatively similar way corms gemmae single cells masses cells detach plants form new clonal individuals common liverworts mosses gametophyte generation filmy fern also present club mosses huperzia lucidula also found higher plants species drosera common form plant reproduction used people seeds number asexual methods used usually enhancements natural processes including cutting grafting budding layering division sectioning rhizomes roots tubers bulbs stolons tillers etc artificial propagation laboratory tissue cloning asexual methods often used propagate cultivars individual desirable characteristics come true fruit tree propagation frequently performed budding grafting desirable cultivars clones onto rootstocks also clones propagated stooling horticulture cutting branch cut mother plant internode rooted often help rooting liquid powder containing hormones full root formed leaves begin sprout anew clone selfsufficient genetically identical examples include cuttings stems blackberries rubus occidentalis african violets saintpaulia verbenas verbena produce new plants related use cuttings grafting stem bud joined onto different stem nurseries offer sale trees grafted stems produce four varieties related fruits including apples common usage grafting propagation cultivars onto already rooted plants sometimes rootstock used dwarf plants protect root damaging since vegetatively propagated plants clones important tools plant research clone grown various conditions differences growth ascribed environmental effects instead genetic sexual reproduction involves two fundamental processes meiosis rearranges genes reduces number chromosomes fertilization restores chromosome complete diploid number two processes different types plants algae vary many including land plants undergo alternation generations two different multicellular structures phases gametophyte sporophyte evolutionary origin adaptive significance sexual reproduction discussed pages evolution sexual reproduction origin function meiosis gametophyte multicellular structure plant haploid containing single set chromosomes cell gametophyte produces male female gametes process cell division called mitosis vascular plants separate gametophytes female gametophytes known mega gametophytes megalarge produce large egg cells male gametophytes called micro gametophytes microsmall produce small sperm cells fusion male female gametes fertilization produces diploid zygote develops mitotic cell divisions multicellular sporophyte mature sporophyte produces spores meiosis sometimes referred reduction division chromosome pairs separated form single sets mosses liverworts gametophyte relatively large sporophyte much smaller structure never separated gametophyte ferns gymnosperms flowering plants angiosperms gametophytes relatively small sporophyte much larger gymnosperms flowering plants megagametophyte contained within ovule may develop seed microgametophyte contained within pollen grain unlike animals plants immobile seek sexual partners reproduction evolution early plants abiotic means including water much later wind transported sperm reproduction first plants aquatic described page evolutionary history plants released sperm freely water carried currents primitive land plants liverworts mosses motile sperm swam thin film water splashed water droplets male reproduction organs onto female organs taller complex plants evolved modifications alternation generations evolved paleozoic era progymnosperms reproduced using spores dispersed wind seed plants including seed ferns conifers cordaites gymnosperms evolved million years ago pollen grains contained male gametes protection sperm process transfer male female parts believed insects fed pollen plants thus evolved use insects actively carry pollen one plant next seed producing plants include angiosperms gymnosperms heteromorphic alternation generations large sporophytes containing muchreduced gametophytes angiosperms distinctive reproductive organs called flowers carpels female gametophyte greatly reduced female embryo sac eight cells pollen grains contains greatly reduced male gametophyte consisting three four cells sperm seed plants nonmotile except two older groups plants cycadophyta ginkgophyta flagella flowering plants dominant plant reproduce sexual asexual means distinguishing feature reproductive organs contained flowers sexual reproduction flowering plants involves production separate male female gametophytes produce gametes anther produces pollen grains contain male gametophytes pollen grains attach stigma top carpel female gametophytes inside ovules located plants may either selfpollinate crosspollinate transfer pollen male gametophytes female stigmas occurs called pollination pollination occurs pollen grain germinates form pollen tube grows carpels style transports male nuclei ovule fertilize egg cell central cell within female gametophyte process termed double fertilization resulting zygote develops embryo triploid endosperm one sperm cell plus binucleate female cell female tissues ovule give rise surrounding tissues developing seed fertilized ovules develop seeds within fruit formed ovary seeds ripe may dispersed together fruit freed various means germinate grow next generation plants use insects animals move pollen one flower next developed greatly modified flower parts attract pollinators facilitate movement pollen one flower insect insect next flower flowers windpollinated plants tend lack petals sepals typically large amounts pollen produced pollination often occurs early growing season leaves interfere dispersal pollen many trees grasses sedges windpollinated plants number different means attract pollinators including color scent heat nectar glands edible pollen flower shape along modifications involving structures two conditions play important role sexual reproduction flowering plants first timing flowering size number flowers produced often plant species large showy flowers others produce many small flowers often flowers collected together large inflorescences maximize visual effect becoming noticeable passing pollinators flowers attraction strategies sexual expressions functional strategies used produce next generation plants pollinators plants coevolved often extraordinary degrees often rendering mutual benefit largest family flowering plants orchids orchidaceae estimated specialists include often highly specialized flowers attract particular insects pollination stamens modified produce pollen clusters called pollinia become attached insects crawl flower flower shapes may force insects pass pollen glued insect orchids even highly specialized flower shapes mimic shape insects attract attempt mate flowers even scents mimic insect pheromones another large group flowering plants asteraceae sunflower family close also highly modified inflorescences composed many individual flowers called florets heads florets one sex flowers pistillate functionally staminate made bisexual florets called homogamous include discoid liguliflorous type heads radiate heads may homogamous plants heads florets two sexual forms called heterogamous include radiate disciform head forms though radiate heads may heterogamous tooclarification needed ferns typically produce large diploids stem roots leaves fertile leaves sporangia produced grouped together sori often protected indusium spores deposited onto suitable moist substrate germinate produce short thin freeliving gametophytes called prothalli typically heartshaped small green color gametophytes
