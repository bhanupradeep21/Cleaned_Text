tooth ankylosis refers fusion tooth underlying bony support tissues species normal process occurs formation maintenance contrast humans tooth ankylosis pathological whereby fusion alveolar bone cementum tooth occurs humans rare phenomenon deciduous dentition even uncommon permanent ankylosis occurs partial root resorption followed repair either cementum dentine unites tooth root alveolar bone usually however root resorption necessarily lead tooth ankylosis causes tooth ankylosis remain uncertain large however evident incident rate ankylosis deciduous teeth much higher permanent risk factors tooth ankylosis generally classified genetic factors dental trauma diagnostic methods tooth ankylosis include use clinical examinations xray cone beam computerized tomography tooth ankylosis could several symptoms decreased tooth count prominent factors like gender sex may also lead incidence certain signs yet full mechanisms well evaluated general nongrowing subjects growing subjects would exhibit different signs individuals suffering ankylosis deciduous teeth risk losing teeth due failure tooth eruption facial growth would lead series functional esthetic problemscitation needed diagnosis clinical examination cbct image tooth ankylosis often treated removing crown affected early orthodontic interception also confirmed effective promoting recovery lost space well allowing eruption teeth current investigation probability used prevention tooth since ankylosis may hinder normal development teeth early diagnosis intercession important avoid progression deterioration particular abnormality found deciduous teeth among children adolescents would often result infraocclusion ankylosed tooth inclination teeth adjacent subsequently impaction permanent successor tooth would result light situation early interceptive orthodontic treatment confirmed effective promoting recovery lost space well allowing eruption teeth according reported case method provided positive results ameliorated situation tooth ankylosis recognised clinically loss physiological mobility high p note may also detected radiographically loss periodontal ligament space evidence replacement resorption ankylosis usually initially occurs labial lingual root surfaces making radiographic detection early stages difficult early diagnosis allows practitioner plan future complications signs symptoms patients varied mainly depending growing state teeth permanent deciduous factors age sex site infection may also lead occurrence specific signs symptoms roles wellstudied evaluated general symptoms include decreased tooth count abnormal tooth enamel curving fifth digit enlarged lower jaw abnormal dentition decreased tooth count frequent nongrowing subjects possess fully developed permanent teeth may observable symptoms alveolar support affected tooth lowered due continuous replacement resorption root process stop appearance root fractures shed crown changes dentition especially anterior teeth observed stage symptoms infraocclusion asymmetry smile arc may developedcitation needed however ankylosis posterior teeth happening nongrowing subjects may completely asymptomatic slow change height affected teeth may noticeable patient doctor compared happened anterior growing subjects symptoms also varied different growth aspects teeth including vertical sagittal transverse growth different children adolescentscitation needed generally symptoms severe earlier occurrence disease ankyloses occurring children traumainduced lead malposition affected teeth major symptomcitation needed moderate severe conditions growing subjects symptoms functional impairment due loss occlusal contacts results reduced vertical distance ankylosed teeth shift dental midline associated tipping adjacent teeth towards affected tooth likely alternatively open bite supraeruption opposing teeth may also noticed causes ankylosis teeth uncertain one common belief role genetic factors autosomal dominant inheritance pattern evidenced appearance family occurrence several families trauma inflammation infection may also responsible causing frequency ankylosis happen deciduous teeth far frequent permanent teeth ratio majority ankylosed teeth occur lower teeth twice often upper therefore strongly believed incidence may due different causes ankylosis permanent teeth first molar common affected teeth hard find precise cause complicated nature believed linked several different factors difficulty diagnosis many cases asymptomaticcitation needed cases several theories explaining cause dental trauma may major cause disease since lead luxation reported dental trauma cases hence replacement resorption situation ankylosis association tooth ankylosis orthodontic treatment also observed cases leakage etchant junction cementum enamel surgery damage junction tilting tooth may possible mechanisms relate disease treatmentcitation needed genetic factors may also involved causing disease supported occurrence ankylosed molars either primary permanent dentition close relativescitation needed possible explanation inheritance gene might process imitator ankylosis periodontal ligament gene transferred parents offsprings lead ankylosis ankylosis deciduous teeth may rarely occur commonly affected tooth mandibular lower second deciduous molar partial root resorption first occurs tooth fuses bone prevents normal exfoliation deciduous tooth typically causes impaction permanent successor tooth growth alveolar bone continues adjacent permanent teeth erupt ankylosed deciduous tooth appears submerge bone although reality changed position treatment extraction involved tooth prevent malocclusion periodontal disturbance dental healthy teeth periodontal ligament pdl fibroblasts block osteogenic cells within periodontium releasing locally acting regulators separates tooth root alveolar damage pdl disrupts process resulting bone growth across periodontal space fusion root may occur following dental trauma especially reimplanted severely intruded increasing extra oral dry time increases likelihood probability also increases severity intrusion known treatment arrest process ankylosis reason remove permanent tooth however teeth must removed reasons made significantly difficult remove ankylosis growing patients result infra occlusion teeth lead aesthetic functional deficit ankylosis teeth often associated metabolic abnormalities deficiencies verticalbone growth positive family history occurrence dental ankylosis cases would prominent risk factor since pathological condition could furthermore factors activities would contribute injuries inflammations infections would also increase risk developing ankylosis teeth ankylosis initiates extensive necrosis periodontal ligament formation bone invade denuded root surface area trauma believed cause ankylosis causing cell death root surface ankylosis may happen injured surface area reached needed damage root surface area trigger inflammatory response migration repopulation faster bone forming cells instead slower periodontal ligament fibroblasts cementoblasts occurring teeth root stage teeth termed ankylosed migration repopulation process termed replacement resorption continue thus teeth root become fused bone tissue adjacent diagnostic methods tooth ankylosis include use clinical examinations feasibility using cone beam computed tomography diagnose ankylosed teeth also explored discussed recent research examinations teeth carried identify typical features ankylosis features include varying percussion sound adjacent normal teeth lack however examinations always reliable although metal sound examination percussion usually used indicate presence ankylosis found onethird ankylosed teeth give metal sound percussion testcitation needed addition lack mobility definitive sign ankylosis tooth still mobile less root surface ankylosedcitation needed definitive diagnosis ankylosis believed given checking mobility targeted tooth applying orthodontic force ankylosed tooth show mobilitycitation needed early detection ankylosis radiographic examination effective produces means ankylosed site would apparent perpendicular xray therefore impossible identify ankylosis areas using xray instance buccal lingual root surfacecitation needed overcome difficulty cone beam computerized tomography cbct adopted provide image better clinical inspection recent research article retrospective cohort study conducted wide range teeth clinically diagnosed ankylosed collected histological sections tooth obtained cbct scan evaluated two specialists blinded details research ensure fairness objectivity result histologically established ankylosed teeth identified observers provided cbct image false positive results obtained concluded cbct scan used feasible effective diagnostic method comes detection tooth ankylosis however recommended treat cbct image sole model identification ankylosed teeth unless false positive results ankylosis primary fail eruption pfe give similar symptoms since cases targeted tooth positioned vertically unresponsive orthodontic force appliedcitation needed therefore ankylosis differentiated primary fail eruption ankylosed molar distal teeth respond orthodontic force normally thus used substitute ankylosed tooth extractedcitation needed surgical luxation sometimes used break ankylosis bridge restore occlusioncitation needed case pfe targeted molar treated osteotomy restore occlusion growing state patient one factors deciding treatment going used growing patients decoronation used decoronation removal tooth serves alternative surgery tooth extraction recommended extraction limits bone resorption therefore maintains sufficient growth alveolar bone enable tooth implantationcitation needed decoronation carried deciduous permanent teeth however patient young close puberty decoronation postponedcitation needed order maximize benefits decoronation regular monitoring intervention nongrowing patients decoronation generally recommended growth alveolar bone may inadequate future tooth implantcitation needed therefore said give ideal treatment result methods considered treating nongrowing patients followups often adopted cases late onset tooth ankylosis tooth growth insignificant surgical procedures needed treat ankylosed tooth long height difference adjacent teeth cases height difference significant tooth crown buildup recommended restore addition tooth crown buildup ankylosed teeth repositioning another conservative method surgical luxation bridge ankylosis broken mechanically tooth positioned slightly away original site allowed erupt temporary insertion splint orthodontic tooth repositioning also performed osteotomy distraction osteogenesis cases surgical luxation fails extraction ankylosed tooth considered growing nongrowing patients method usually serves last resort methods osteotomy distraction osteogenesis fail treat growing state patient sole factor deciding treatment ankylosed tooth infraocclusion severity bone resorption location target tooth well dentists preference affect option therefore treatment ankylosed tooth casespecific prevalence tooth ankylosis still unknown individuals genders regardless ethnic groups may affected due
