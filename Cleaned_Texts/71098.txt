apraxia motor disorder caused damage brain specifically posterior parietal cortex corpus causes difficulty motor planning perform tasks movements nature damage determines disorders severity absence sensory loss paralysis helps explain level children may born apraxia cause unknown symptoms usually noticed early stages development apraxia occurring later life known acquired apraxia typically caused traumatic brain injury stroke dementia alzheimers disease brain tumor neurodegenerative multiple types apraxia categorized specific ability andor body part affected term apraxia comes greek ἀ without πρᾶξις praxis several types apraxia include apraxia often due lesion located dominant usually left hemisphere brain typically frontal parietal lobes lesions may due stroke acquired brain injuries neurodegenerative diseases alzheimers disease dementias parkinsons disease huntingtons disease also apraxia possibly may caused lesions areas ideomotor apraxia typically due decrease blood flow dominant hemisphere brain particularly parietal premotor areas frequently seen patients corticobasal ideational apraxia observed patients lesions dominant hemisphere near areas associated aphasia research needed ideational apraxia due brain lesions localization lesions areas frontal temporal lobes would provide explanation difficulty motor planning seen ideational apraxia well difficulty distinguish certain constructional apraxia often caused lesions inferior nondominant parietal lobe caused brain injury illness tumor condition result brain although qualitative quantitative studies exist little consensus exists proper method assess apraxia criticisms past methods include failure meet standard psychometric properties researchspecific designs translate poorly nonresearch test measure upper limb apraxia tulia one method determining upper limb apraxia qualitative quantitative assessment gesture production contrast previous publications apraxic assessment reliability validity tulia thoroughly tulia consists subtests imitation pantomime nonsymbolic put index finger top nose intransitive wave goodbye transitive show use hammer discrimination differentiating well poorly performed tasks recognition indicating object corresponds pantomimed gesture tasks also often tested full apraxia evaluationcitation needed however strong correlation may seen formal test results actual performance everyday functioning activities daily living adls comprehensive assessment apraxia include formal testing standardized measurements adls observation daily routines selfreport questionnaires targeted interviews patients stated apraxia confused aphasia inability understand language however frequently occur together apraxia often accompanied aphasia many believe person displays aos patient also level aphasia treatment individuals apraxia includes speech therapy occupational therapy physical currently medications indicated treatment apraxia therapy generally treatments apraxia received little attention several reasons including tendency condition resolve spontaneously acute cases additionally nature automaticvoluntary dissociation motor abilities defines apraxia means patients may still able automatically perform activities cued daily life nevertheless patients experiencing apraxia less functional independence daily evidence treatment apraxia however literature review apraxia treatment date reveals although field early stages treatment design certain aspects included treat one method rehabilitative treatment found positively impact apraxia well review rehabilitative treatment consisted different contextual cues used teach patients produce gesture different contextual additional studies also recommended varying forms gesture therapy whereby patient instructed make gestures either using objects symbolically meaningful nonmeaningful gestures progressively less cuing patients apraxia may need use form alternative augmentative communication depending severity disorder addition using gestures mentioned patients also use communication boards sophisticated electronic devices single type therapy approach proven best way treat patient apraxia since patients case varies oneonone sessions usually work best though support family members friends since everyone responds therapy differently patients make significant improvements others make less overall goal treatment apraxia treat motor plans speech treating phoneme sound level individuals apraxia speech receive treatment focuses repetition target words rate speech overall goal treatment apraxia improve speech intelligibility rate speech articulation targeted prognosis individuals apraxia varies therapy patients improve significantly others may show little improvement individuals apraxia may benefit use communication aid however many people apraxia longer able independent limbkinetic andor gait apraxia avoid activities might injure otherscitation needed occupational therapy
