published paleontologist gregory erickson colleagues studied growth life history tyrannosaurids analysis bone histology determine age specimen died growth rates examined ages various individuals plotted size graph erickson shown long time juveniles tyrannosaurs underwent tremendous growth spurts four years midway lives rapid growth phase ended sexual maturity growth slowed considerably adult animals erickson examined daspletosaurus dinosaur park formation specimens show pattern compared albertosaurines daspletosaurus showed faster growth rate rapid growth period due higher adult weight maximum growth rate daspletosaurus kilograms lb per year based mass estimate kilograms short tons adults authors suggested higher adult weights daspletosaurus would change magnitude growth rate overall tabulating number specimens age group erickson colleagues able draw conclusions life history population albertosaurus analysis showed juveniles rare fossil record subadults rapid growth phase adults far common could due preservation collection biases erickson hypothesized difference due low mortality among juveniles certain size also seen modern large mammals like elephants low mortality
