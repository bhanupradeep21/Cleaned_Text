signaling network plant growth studied circadian clock sunflower heliotropism solar tracking sunflowers long stem made easy identify heliotropism following suns location sunflowers leaves stems moved east west light anticipating sunrise flowers moved west east dark thus plant clock played role since sunflowers pulvini organs controlled solar tracking plants harmer hypothesized stem growth may
