sheehans syndrome also known postpartum pituitary gland necrosis occurs pituitary gland damaged due significant blood loss hypovolemic shock ischemic necrosis usually childbirth leading decreased functioning pituitary gland pituitary gland endocrine organ meaning produces certain hormones involved regulation various gland located brain sits pocket sphenoid bone known sella pituitary gland works conjunction hypothalamus endocrine organs modulate numerous bodily functions including growth metabolism menstruation lactation even fightorflight endocrine organs release hormones specific pathways known hormonal axes example release hormone hypothalamus target pituitary trigger release subsequent hormone pituitarys released hormone target next organ hence damage pituitary gland downstream effects aforementioned bodily functions various signs symptoms sheehans syndrome caused damage pituitary thereby causing decrease one hormones normally secretes since pituitary controls many glands endocrine system partial complete loss variety functions may many signs symptoms sheehans considered nonspecific medical community words signs symptoms seen number different disease processes specific singular disease cases woman sheehan syndrome may relatively asymptomatic initially therefore diagnosis would made years later features hypopituitarism become rare instances syndrome present acutely unstable vital signs dangerously low blood glucose levels heart failure even hypopituitarism lead interruption following hormone pathways thyroid disorder secondary hypothyroidism adrenal gland adrenal insufficiency due glucocorticoid deficiency sex hormone gonadotropin deficiency prolactin hormone responsible lactation growth hormone rarely antidiuretic hormone deficiency central diabetes since damage pituitary cause deficiency one hormone pathways simultaneously possible mix signs symptoms listed sheehans syndromes common initial symptoms difficulties total

acutely chronically chronic case similar addisons disease symptoms including fatigue weight loss hypoglycemia low blood sugar levels low hemoglobin levels anemia hyponatremia low sodium levels develop several months acute adrenal insufficiency referred adrenal crisis lifethreatening occurs shortly inciting event ie significant blood loss postpartum context sheehans adrenal crisis signs symptoms include hypoglycemia hypotension weakness fatigue seizures severe growth hormone deficiency one common hormone deficiencies hypopituitarism seen sheehans low levels growth hormone may present low energy body aches subtle wrinkling skin around eyes symptoms antidiuretic hormone deficiency increased thirst excessive urination headache hematological changes might seen well anemia low platelets hyponatremia seen many cases sheehans syndrome result multiple etiologies drops thyroid hormones glucocorticoidadrenal hormones indirectly lead hyponatremia water retention blood loss trigger hyponatremia adh development syndrome inappropriate antidiuretic hormone patients sheehans syndrome documented literature although mechanism well stated sheehans syndrome caused damage pituitary thereby causing decrease one hormones normally secretes sheehans syndrome typically occurs excessive blood loss delivery postpartum hemorrhage although several risk factors may contribute syndrome appear exclusively linked childbirth sheehans syndrome reported pregnant patients experienced massive hemorrhage nonobstetrical pituitary gland grows higher metabolic demand pregnancy pituitary needs rev production certain hormones associated higher metabolic demand turn leads higher demand blood thus body enters state shock excessive blood loss postpartum delivery pituitary gland susceptible although vast majority cases sheehans syndrome occur setting massive blood loss cases documented acute sheehans syndrome occurring blood loss volumes considered possible predisposing factors sheehans syndrome may include disseminated blood coagulation dic hypotension small sella turcica size blood clots preexisting hypercoagulable atony uterus leading cause postpartum hemorrhage therefore uterine atony could induce sheehans syndrome seems arise certain factors compound cause pituitary injury physiologic enlargement pituitary gland conjunction interference blood supply ultimately result pituitary ischemia one cause pituitary growth associated risk sheehans syndrome hyperplasia lactotrophs produce prolactin hormone responsible milk hormonesecreting cells pituitary undergo rapid growth pregnant women well contribute glands anterior pituitary supplied low pressure portal venous anterior pituitary commonly affected sheehans syndrome structure portal venous system posterior pituitary involvement leading central diabetes insipidus much rarer typically reflects extensive damage organ severe suggested arrangement pituitarys blood supply contribute susceptibility injury highly vascularized pituitary tissue involves one rapid blood flow human body probably therefore tendency infarction even small degrees change pituitary intravascular pressure cause arrest blood ischemia may occur result vasospasm shock hypotension thrombosis direct vascular compression hypophyseal artery enlarged pituitary gland presence disseminated intravascular coagulation ie amniotic fluid embolism hellp syndrome also appears factor typically important clue leads diagnosis sheehans syndrome identifying deficiency one hormones produced directly indirectly pituitary gland extent hormone deficiency hormones affected depends extent damage pituitary hormonal assays measure levels hormones include limited tsh estrogen gonadotropin cortisol might difficult detect damage hormone pathways hormone
