source amnesia inability remember previously learned information acquired retaining factual branch amnesia associated malfunctioning ones explicit memory likely disconnect knowledge remembering context knowledge acquired due dissociation semantic episodic individual retains semantic knowledge fact lacks episodic knowledge indicate context knowledge gained memory representations reflect encoding processes acquisition different types acquisition processes eg reading thinking listening different types events eg newspaper thoughts conversation produce mental depictions perceptually differ one another brain making harder retrieve information learned placed different context source monitoring involves systematic process slow deliberate thought information originally learned source monitoring improved using retrieval cues discovering noting relations extended source amnesia rare phenomenon everybody experiences near daily basis much knowledge important remember knowledge rather however extreme examples source amnesia caused variety factors individuals frontal lobe damage deficits temporal context source memory also exhibit deficits frontal lobe appears frontal lobe damage difficulties recency temporal judgements eg placing events order unable properly attribute knowledge appropriate sources ie source amnesia individuals frontal lobe damage normal recall facts make significantly errors source memory control subjects effects becoming apparent shortly minutes learning experience individuals frontal lobe damage often mistakenly attribute knowledge source eg read somewhere saw tv etc rarely attribute learned course experiment appears frontal lobe damage causes disconnection semantic episodic memory individuals associate context acquired knowledge knowledge elderly individuals shown exhibit source amnesia compared younger individuals experiments individuals presented obscure even made trivia facts older people remember less information overall recall recognition tasks often misattribute source knowledge time periods long short effect potentially due neuronal loss associated aging occurring mainly frontal previously noticed frontal lobe damage cause source amnesia loss neurons area brain associated aging may well cause agerelated source amnesia alzheimers disease ad known associated frontal lobe implicated cause source laboratory conditions

compounded attributing ideasbeliefs external leads individuals schizophrenia exhibiting behaviours typical source amnesia misattribute source knowledge ideas beliefs post traumatic stress disorder ptsd characterized intrusive vivid recollections traumatic event impoverished episodic memory individuals ptsd experience memory distortions caused source amnesia well false memory construction unintentional integration information present original individuals condition experience less vivid decontextualized episodic memory events outside traumatic also individuals ptsd difficulties identifying source information overall ptsd may poorer recall source knowledge due deficits encoding process creates weaker relationships item depression associated overly generalized memories individuals depression perform poorly source memory attribution tasks compared nondepressed individuals show memory bias remembering negative information possibly due enhanced amygdala activity encoding emotional particularly negative overall relationship emotional arousal episode source memory evidence enhanced processing negative memories results poorer source thus individuals depressed would increased amounts source amnesia hypnosis cause source amnesia involves carrying hypnosis subjects remember posthypnotically experiences hypnosis tested asking individuals esoteric knowledge learned hypnosis individuals typically recall hypnotic experience whatsoever however tested obscure pieces knowledge able supply correct answer thus demonstrating source amnesia able recall knowledge lack capacity indicate context learned knowledge fact subjects often attribute knowledge obscure facts learning experiences hypnosis eg read somewhere somebody must told wisconsin card sorting test widely used clinical settings test cognitive impairments frontal lobe disorder associated source visuospatial component test devised two sets identical cards figures cards differ respect color quantity shape participants given pile additional cards asked match one one previous cards patients frontal lobe dysfunction ultimately source amnesia much greater difficulty finishing task successfully method verbal fluency test widely commonly used test assess frontal lobe dysfunction participants asked generate words beginning letters previously introduced eg generate word beginning given three trials one trial per letter goal say many different words possible begin given verbal fluency test assess damage prefrontal lobes associated patients source amnesia patients frontal lobe disorder trouble putting verbal items proper sequential order monitor personal behaviors well deficient judgment recency behaviors required proper recall source research shown stroop effect numerous

participant study experimenter test participants knowledge list minutes later presenting list studied words mixed randomly several lure words words semantically similar previously studied words new words participant successful task distinguished previously learned words lure words experiment tested multiple times participant different time periods eg months later tested months participants likely show source amnesia lure words newly presented words means confuse familiarity semantically similar words words studied original research suggests source amnesia results poor memory encoding particular context opposed poor retrieval context specific memory except within case content must encoded along context order two integrated since poor encoding may responsible source amnesia likely person able retrieve specific source memory future properly encoded makes difficult create treatments source amnesia information may integrated properly within brain certain prevention strategies studied order target atrisk populations teach prevent loss contextual memory well improve source memory general population source amnesia appears prevalent populations specific brain impairments possible individuals without deficits memory experience source amnesia may happen person encodes content integrate contextspecific information research suggests contextspecific information better recalled situations involve emotional stimuli suggests source memory may benefit thinking emotions related content order better encode source related information related theories flashbulb memory children likely correctly identify source information taught think relation speaker information holds true whether children think perceptual emotional ties speaker effect appears larger emotional context considered increase accurate source encoding without cost demonstrated children improved source encoding typically remembered less controls came recalling semantic nonsource suggests may tradeoff comes different types memory children able attend certain amount information one time older adults may memory impairments result natural aging process memory impairments may due degeneration frontal lobe age related common older adults experience increased source amnesia memories compared younger adults prevention source amnesia older adults may include memory training programs attempt increase cortical thickness brain research suggests even brains older adults may capable continuing one particular study older adults exposed long memory training programs memorytraining programs involved serial memory recall practice using mental imagery mnemonic device adults involved memorytraining program showed significant improvement source memory specifically addition memory benefits increased cortical thickness shown using mri research tested longitudinal study suggests older adults perhaps atrisk groups source amnesia could benefit explicit memory training exercises another way older adults avoid source amnesia think relationship content context experience preventative measure must taken information encoded order direct attention source aware relates content participants experiencing source amnesia performed level groups risk source amnesia strategies implicated suggesting experience memory deficit may integrate content context eyewitness testimonies integral aspect criminal court system judges juries depend evidence determine verdict however studies shown source amnesia interfere witnesss memory incorrect postevent information encountered results distorted memories source postevent information come leading questions statements made media since improper encoding causes source amnesia witnesses stressed distracted event fail pay attention susceptible encoding wrong details memory claiming seen things causes grave legal implications given result wrongful convictions therefore important interrogation practices carefully carried posthypnotic source amnesia phenomenon individual taught obscure information hypnosis asked recall information conscious state however remember knowledge taught studies shown subjects unable remember anything occurred
