hedonic treadmill also known hedonic adaptation observed tendency humans quickly return relatively stable level happiness despite major positive negative events life according theory person makes money expectations desires rise tandem results permanent gain happiness philip brickman donald campbell coined term essay hedonic relativism planning good society hedonic treadmill viewpoint suggests wealth increase level hedonic adaptation process mechanism reduces affective impact emotional events generally hedonic adaptation involves happiness set point whereby humans generally maintain constant level happiness throughout lives despite events occur process hedonic adaptation often conceptualized treadmill since matter hard one tries gain increase happiness one remain place hedonic adaptation occur variety ways generally process involves cognitive changes shifting values goals attention interpretation neurochemical processes desensitize overstimulated hedonic pathways brain possibly prevents persistently high levels intense positive negative process adaptation also occur tendency humans construct elaborate rationales considering deprived process social theorist gregg easterbrook calls abundance hedonic treadmill term coined brickman campbell article hedonic relativism planning good society describing tendency people keep fairly stable baseline level happiness despite external events fluctuations demographic idea relative happiness around decades brickman et al began approach hedonic pleasure within framework helsons adaptation level theory holds perception
