plateletpheresis accurately called thrombocytapheresis thrombapheresis though names rarely used process collecting thrombocytes commonly called platelets component blood involved blood clotting term specifically refers method collecting platelets performed device used blood donation separates platelets returns portions blood donor platelet transfusion lifesaving procedure preventing treating serious complications bleeding hemorrhage patients disorders manifesting thrombocytopenia low platelet count platelet dysfunction process may also used therapeutically treat disorders resulting extraordinarily high platelet counts essential thrombocytosis platelet transfusions traditionally given patients undergoing chemotherapy leukemia multiple myeloma aplastic anemia aids hypersplenism idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura itp sepsis bone marrow transplant radiation treatment organ transplant surgeries cardiopulmonary bypass platelet transfusions avoided thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ttp worsen neurologic symptoms acute renal failure presumably due creation new thrombi platelets consumed also avoided patients heparininduced thrombocytopenia hit disseminated intravascular coagulation diccitation needed adults platelets recommended levels less less central venous catheter placed less lumbar puncture major surgery platelet transfusions use platelets collected automated apheresis platelets also separated donations whole blood collected traditional blood donation several advantages separating platelets time collection first advantage wholeblood platelets sometimes called random platelets single donation numerous enough dose give adult patient must pooled several donors create single transfusion complicates processing increases risk diseases spread transfused blood human immunodeficiency viruscitation needed collecting platelets single donor also simplifies human leukocyte antigen hla matching improves chance successful transfusion since timeconsuming find compatible donors hlamatched transfusions collecting full dose single donor practical finding multiple compatible donorscitation needed plateletpheresis products also easier test bacterial contamination leading cause transfusionassociated deathscitation needed pooling whole blood platelets often done open system platelet containers connected way could expose platelets air pooled platelets must transfused promptly contamination time growcitation needed problems apheresis include expense equipment used collection whole blood platelets also require additional donor recruitment made blood donations also used packed red blood cells plasma componentscitation needed recipients category include undergoing chemotherapy myelophthisic anemia aids aplastic anemia indicated transfusions one thrombapheresis concentrate given recovery platelet function generally approximately twice weekly surgical bleeding due solely thrombocytopenia occurs platelets spontaneous bleeding occurs platelets thrombocytopenic patients develop dry bleeding petechiae ecchymoses suffer fatal hemorrhagic events unless first extensive mucosal bleeding wet bleeding therefore bleeding dry bleeding threshold transfusion conservative threshold used fever risk factors bleeding active bleeding prior surgery threshold unconfirmed helpful way determine whether patient recovering chemotherapyinduced thrombocytopenia measure reticulated platelets young rnacontaining platelets signifies patient starting make new plateletscitation needed recipients category include idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura druginduced thrombocytopenia platelet transfusions generally recommended group patients underlying cause involves antibodies destroy platelets therefore newly transfused platelets also destroyed platelet transfusion may used emergency bleeding situations platelets could used body immune system destroys disorders platelet function congenital acquired disorders mild may respond therapy desmopressin ddavp transfusion necessarily required however severe disorders glanzmann thrombasthenia transfusions large amount platelets may needed number transfusions may reduced patients given recombinant human factor viiamedical citation needed since underlying cause antibodies platelet glycoproteins iibiiia cardiopulmonary bypass surgery result destruction large proportion patients platelets may render remaining viable platelets dysfunctional indications transfusion patients controversial general guidelines recommend transfusing patients prophylactically bleeding excessively also giving desmopressincitation needed common aspirin similar drug class nsaids antiplatelet drugs commonly prescribed patients acute coronary syndromes clopidogrel ticlopidine surgery undertaken following administration drugs bleeding serious transfusion circumstances clearcut one use clinical judgment platelet count increase well platelet survival transfusion related dose platelets infused patients body surface area bsa usually values less would expected theoretical value cci clinically value closer cci less patients said refractoriness platelet transfusion separation individual blood components done specialized centrifuge see apheresis earliest manual forms thrombapheresis done separation platelets multiple bags whole blood collected donors blood sellers since blood bag usually ml ml contains relatively small number platelets take many dozen blood bags usually five ten bags depending size blood bags donors platelet count accumulate single unit platelets enough one patient greatly increases risks transfusion unit platelets separated donated whole blood called platelet concentratecitation needed modern automatic thrombapheresis allows blood donors give portion platelets keeping red blood cells least portion blood plasma therefore three units platelets generally harvested one sitting donor donors donate single double unit however occurrence triples increasing suitable donors recruitedcitation needed platelets shelf life five days platelet donors always needed centers experimenting sevenday platelets requires additional testing lack preservative solutions means product far effective fresh even though red blood cells also collected process many blood donation organizations takes much longer human body replenish loss addition though centers defer platelet donations red blood cells replenished cases blood plasma returned donor well however locations plasma processing facilities part donors plasma also collected separate blood bag see plasmapheresis example australia around platelets ml plasma might collected kg donor due higher relative density white blood cells collected unwanted component platelets since takes liters whole blood amount dozen blood bags generate dose platelets white blood cells one several donors also collected along platelets kg lb man liters blood incidentally collected white blood cells transfused platelets substantial rejection problems occur therefore standard practice filter white blood cells transfusion process leukoreduction early platelet transfusions used filter remove white blood cells time transfusion takes trained person minutes assemble equipment safest efficient means filtration living white blood cells release cytokines storage dead white blood cells break smaller fragments still stimulate dangerous response immune system addition simple filtration lead increased risks infection loss valuable platelets newer advanced thrombapheresis machines filter white blood cells separationcitation needed example marginally acceptable whole blood white blood cells dose platelets comes white blood cells seriously damage patients health dose singledonor platelets prepared using latest filters contain little white blood cells two types manual platelet apheresis plateletrich plasma prp widely used north america buffy coat bc widely used europe platelets clotting cells blood platelet donation therapy frequently needed cancer patients chemotherapy patients render unable generate platelets basic principles automatic platelet apheresis manual procedure whole procedure performed computercontrolled machine since donors blood processed sterile singleuse centrifuge unwanted components returned donor safely allows apheresis machine repeat drawcentrifugereturn cycle obtain platelets bulk machine length donation process means platelet donations done blood centers instead mobile blood drives country rules protect safety donor recipient typical set rules platelet donor must weigh least kg lb platelet count least x platelets per one unit greater platelets therefore takes liters blood platelet count produce one unit platelets regular donors higher platelet counts donors takes one liter blood produce unit since machine used perform procedure uses suction draw blood donors body people give whole blood may veins small platelet donation blood accounts body weight kg lb donor four liters blood donors platelets ever extracted one sitting replenished body three days newer apheresis machines separate maximum donation platelets minutes depending donors health condition short physical examination usually involves checking donors height weight body temperature blood pressure pulse rate haemoglobin concentration etc donor taken donation room sits reclining chair next machine technician cleans one arms iodine chlorhexidine disinfectant inserts catheter vein arm procedures arms used one draw blood return process takes one two hours blood pulled machine mixed anticoagulant sodium citrate spun around returned donor double needle procedures using arms tend shorter since blood drawn returned different catheters single needle procedures set volume drawn processed first part cycle returned second part donors blood undergoes repeated cycles draw return side effects donation platelets generally fall three categories blood pressure changes problems vein access effects anticoagulant donors calcium level blood pressure changes sometimes cause nausea fatigue dizziness venous access problems cause bruising referred hematoma donating supply calcium antacid tablets usually kept close replenish calcium lost anticoagulant works binding calcium blood donors levels calcium especially active calcium ions drop donation process lips may begin tingle may metallic taste since calcium enables function nervous system nerveendingdense areas lips susceptible least donation process unusually low calcium cause serious problems fainting nerve irritationcitation needed shortduration tetany acute hypocalcaemia usually due low calcium levels prior donation aggravated anticoagulant hypocalcaemia curtailed modestly increasing dietary calcium intake days prior donation serious problems extremely rare apheresis donors typically allowed sleep long donation process monitoredcitation needed aside procedure donating platelets different donating blood ways firstly donor must take aspirin antiplatelet medications clopidogrel plavix anywhere hours prior donation guidelines vary blood center aspirin prevent platelets adhering clot bleeding blood centers also prohibit taking nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug nsaid hours prior secondly platelet donations allowed anywhere every days contrast wholeblood donation eightweek longer waiting period along lines since platelet donation temporarily removes whole blood body may necessary wait eight weeks whole blood donation donate platelets although two weeks common us donor allowed donate platelets every seven days times period may lose red blood cells plasma period would maximum allowable number whole blood india per ministry health blood donation interval criteria apheresis requires least hours interval platelet plasmaapheresis donation done two times week limited times one thirdly additional tests may required becoming donor first time tests may establish platelet count newer automated platelet pheresis machines donation begins adjust accordingly quantity platelets drawn tests may also determine donors compatibility particular recipients human leukocyte antigen hla test multiparous women may excluded becoming donors due heightened trali risk tests usually involve nothing involved drawing several tubes blood adverse conditions happen plateletpheresis donation hypocalcemia hematoma formation vasovagal reactions risk conditions normally reduced predonation education donors change apheresis machine repeated platelet donations short intervals cause
