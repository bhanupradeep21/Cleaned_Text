conditioned place preference cpp form pavlovian conditioning used measure motivational effects objects motivation comes pleasurable aspect experience brain reminded context surrounded measuring amount time animal spends area associated stimulus researchers infer animals liking paradigm also used measure conditioned place aversion identical procedure involving aversive stimuli instead procedures usually involve mice rats procedure used measure extinction reinstatement conditioned stimulus certain drugs used paradigm measure reinforcing properties two different methods used choose compartments conditioned biased vs unbiased biased method allows animal explore apparatus compartment least prefer one drug administered one prefer one vehicle method allows animal choose compartment get drug vehicle comparison unbiased method allow animal choose compartment get drug vehicle instead researcher chooses humans also shown develop conditioned place preferences example people taking therapeutic

commercial automated tracking systems measure time however manual measurement also used statistical testing used determine whether significant difference time present compared either control group preconditioning time group baseline strength conditioning inferred magnitude difference amount time taken response show standard conditioned place preference procedure unconditioned stimulus rewarding rodents likely approach compartment contains cues associated alternatively unconditioned stimulus aversive rodents likely escape avoid compartment contains cues associated timing presentation unconditioned stimulus determine whether place preference aversion example trials testing drugs abuse animal experiences initial pleasurable effects drug conditioning context result likely conditioned
