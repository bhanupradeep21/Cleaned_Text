antihypertensives class drugs used treat hypertension high blood antihypertensive therapy seeks prevent complications high blood pressure stroke heart failure kidney failure myocardial infarction evidence suggests reduction blood pressure mmhg decrease risk stroke ischaemic heart disease reduce likelihood dementia heart failure mortality cardiovascular many classes antihypertensives lower blood pressure different means among important widely used medications thiazide diuretics calcium channel blockers ace inhibitors angiotensin ii receptor antagonists arbs beta blockers type medication use initially hypertension subject several large studies resulting national guidelines fundamental goal treatment prevention important endpoints hypertension heart attack stroke heart failure patient age associated clinical conditions endorgan damage also play part determining dosage type medication several classes antihypertensives differ side effect profiles ability prevent endpoints cost choice expensive agents cheaper ones would equally effective may negative impacts national healthcare best available evidence favors lowdose thiazide diuretics firstline treatment choice high blood pressure

several large studies various national guidelines considerations include factors age race medical united states recommends drug one four following classes good choice either initial therapy addon treatment thiazidetype diuretics calcium channel blockers ace inhibitors angiotensin ii receptor first large study show mortality benefit antihypertensive treatment vanhlbi study found chlorthalidone largest study antihypertensive lipidlowering treatment prevent heart attack trial allhat concluded chlorthalidone thiazidelike diuretic effective lisinopril angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor amlodipine calcium channel allhat showed doxazosin alphaadrenergic receptor blocker higher incidence heart failure events doxazosin arm study stopped subsequent smaller study show slight advantages thiazide diuretic outcomes observed allhat study actually showed slightly better outcomes aceinhibitors older white male thiazide diuretics effective recommended best firstline drug much affordable therapies yet prescribed often newer drugs chlorthalidone thiazide drug strongly supported evidence providing mortality benefit allhat study chlorthalidone dose mg used titration mg subjects achieve blood pressure control mg chlorthalidone repeatedly found stronger effect lowering blood pressure hydrochlorothiazide hydrochlorothiazide chlorthalidone similar risk hypokalemia adverse effects usual doses prescribed routine clinical patients exaggerated hypokalemic response low dose thiazide diuretic suspected hyperaldosteronism common cause secondary medications role treating hypertension adverse effects thiazide diuretics include hypercholesterolemia impaired glucose tolerance increased risk developing diabetes mellitus type thiazide diuretics also deplete circulating potassium unless combined potassiumsparing diuretic supplemental potassium authors challenged thiazides first line however merck manual geriatrics notes thiazidetype diuretics especially safe effective current uk guidelines suggest starting patients age years africanafrocaribbean ethnicity firstly calcium channel blockers thiazide diuretics whilst younger patients ethnic groups started aceinhibitors subsequently dual therapy required use aceinhibitor combination either calcium channel blocker thiazide diuretic triple therapy three groups need arise add fourth agent consider either diuretic eg spironolactone furosemide alphablocker prior demotion betablockers first line agents uk sequence combination therapy used first letter drug classes known abcd choice drugs large degree determined characteristics patient prescribed drugs side effects cost drugs uses sometimes presence symptoms warrant use one particular antihypertensive examples include guidelines indicate reasons choose one drug others certain individual hypertensive disorders pregnancy constitute significant risk factor maternal fetal outcomes necessitating antihypertensive treatment however current data concerning safety utero exposure antihypertensive medication controversial studies recommend administration certain agents others underline possible adverse effects fetal development general amethyldopa βblockers calcium channel blockers first second treatment line hypertension pregnancy however aceis arbs diuretics mostly contraindicated potential risk outweighs benefits administration additionally several drugs avoided due lack data regarding women often concerned safety antihypertensives result many take treatment prescribed shared decisionmaking aids shown reduce womens uncertainty taking antihypertensives increase number women taking chlorothiazide discovered first known instance effective antihypertensive treatment using primaquine vaccinations trialed may become treatment option high blood pressure future moderately successful studies similar vaccines antihypertensive drugs older people latest evidence evidence effect due discontinuing vs continuing medications used treating elevated blood pressure prevention heart disease older adults allcase mortality incidence heart findings based low quality evidence suggesting may safe stop antihypertensive medications however older adults stop medications without talking healthcare among people aged frailty antihypertensives increase chance admitted hospital dying fall likely lead serious fall prevent stroke heart
