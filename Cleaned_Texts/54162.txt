neurosyphilis infection central nervous system patient syphilis era modern antibiotics majority neurosyphilis cases reported hivinfected patients meningitis common neurological presentation early syphilis tertiary syphilis symptoms exclusively neurosyphilis though neurosyphilis may occur stage infection diagnose neurosyphilis patients undergo lumbar puncture obtain cerebrospinal fluid csf analysis csf tested antibodies specific treponema pallidum antigens preferred test vdrl test sometimes supplemented fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test historically disease studied tuskegee study often cited example unethical human experimentation study done approximately africanamerican men untreated syphilis followed compared approximately men without syphilis study began without informed consent subjects continued united states public health service researchers failed notify withheld treatment patients despite knowing penicillin found effective cure neurosyphilis four

primary secondary latent tertiary important note neurosyphilis may occur stage infectioncitation needed meningitis common neurological presentation early syphilis typically occurs secondary stage arising within one year initial infection symptoms similar forms meningitis common associated neurosyphilitic meningitis cranial nerve palsy especially facial nearly part eye may involved common form ocular syphilis uveitis forms include episcleritis vitritis retinitis papillitis retinal detachment interstitial meningovascular syphilis usually occurs late syphilis may affect early disease due
