lyme disease spread humans bite infected ticks tick population affected weather climate many factors determine tick population densities well diseased population densities ticks single factor determine likelihood exposure tickborne overall primary host determine localities ticks thrive however studies conducted correlate tick population climate change behavior weather patterns ticks parasites carry myriad infectious diseases depend species overall climate determinate tick population daily weather subtle effect spread tickborne disease mindful daily weather patterns vigilantly avoiding exposure ticks reduces human exposure lyme larvae fed drop host molt nymphs nymphs overwinter activity almost completely ceases late spring emerge following year may june july emergence new generation larvae hatch allowing nymphs transmit tickborne disease new generations hosts increases possibility next generation larvae also become infected nymphs usually attach feed small mammals birds feeding nymphs drop molt adults reappear fall year adults seek medium large mammalian hosts primarily deer adulthood reached ticks longer hibernate winter may become active warm winter incidence lyme disease tied many factors including climate certain regions worldwide supply proper conditions ticks flourish ticks like habitats least humidity practice host questing temperatures greater order find microclimates suitable ticks use thermoreceptors detect proper one region especially suitable climate ticks northeastern united states region part temperate humid presenting ideal conditions tick survival climate change could affect ticks variety ways s√ºss et al lists following possible changes tick populations due increased temperature brought global climate many changes could potentially increase lyme disease incidence pose threat human populations especially eastern half united states addition climate seasonal weather variations strong effect tick populations changes temperature precipitation year year affect lyme disease incidence multiple studies shown correlation amount precipitation incidence lyme disease nymph ticks feed infect host lyme disease lose ability effectively control water year little precipitation many ticks may die following feeding loss water regulatory nymph ticks died never reach adulthood lay eggs two years later offspring nymph tick population reduced thus lyme disease incidence also schauber et al also suggests similar tie lagged precipitation measured palmer hydrologic drought index lyme disease incidence northeastern united addition direct effects nymph tick populations summer precipitation may also factor controlling population ticks primary host whitefooted decreased rainfall summer months may also decrease amount vegetation available mice populations eat order sustain thus follows decrease rainfall may decrease population ticks primary host thus reduce tick populations lyme disease incidence subak proposes link human behavior precipitation could another factor lyme disease northeastern united states summer weather especially hot dry may disincline people outdoor fact subak found link dry conditions decreased lyme disease incidence late summer months northeast united temperature may also play role lyme disease incidence schauber et al found positive correlation mean summer temperature rate lyme disease northeastern united additionally subak suggests may also relationship warmer winters increased lyme study discovered tentative link warmer winter weather lagged one year lyme disease moderate winter may increase survival whitefooted mouse host allowing increased tick populations spring warmer winter temperatures may also allow adult tick activity winter cause increase nymph populations following outdoor activities tend take place fair weather conditions ticks thrive populations nymphal stage stage commonly transmits lyme highest late spring early directly preceding months greatest number reported cases lyme disease typical summer outerwear consists shorter garments enable ticks greater exposure skin tick saliva immunosuppressive shut bodys response would alert body tickss presence allows ticks remain attached extended period time feeding increasing probability disease number different methods shown mitigate exposure lyme disease individuals practice diligence ticks removal exposure reduction techniques resilient risks contracting lyme risk reduction attained observance daily weather since ticks use number host seeking techniques weather ticks able detect hosts bright sunny days shadows contrast greatly surrounding brightly lit wearing light colored clothing days reduces risk ticks exposure reducing contrast conducting outdoor activities overcast slightly foggy days also reduces shadow detection since contrast surroundings ticks detect odor breezy days remaining downwind prime ticks habitats minimize scent ticks seek hosts temperatures risk exposure
