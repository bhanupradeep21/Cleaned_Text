difficulties infants may also cleft deletion syndrome gives characteristic appearance affected individuals potentially including microphthalmia small eyes hypertelorism wideset eyes thin forehead high palate underdeveloped midface small mouth small nose broad flat nasal bridge short neck low hairline irregular wrongly positioned teeth lowset ears micrognathia small jaw tooth enamel defects short

needed although cure deletion syndrome symptoms managed usually involvement neurologist rehabilitation physician occupational therapist physiotherapist psychotherapist nutritionist special education professional andor speech therapist treatment deletion syndrome ever identical due variations disease use personalized teams members different medical fields vital patient affected childs growth particularly slow growth hormone treatment used augment growth plastic surgeries repair cleft palates surgical repair monitoring pediatric cardiologist manage cardiac defects skeletal neurological genitourinary gastrointestinal ophthalmic abnormalities definitively treated surgery endocrine abnormalities often managed medically even child responding well medical treatment important utilize special educators speech occupational therapists physiotherapists help child develop skills aid hisher life affected individuals may somewhat shortened lifespan without treatment maximum lifespan without treatment years deletion detected bone marrow biopsy multiple myeloma chemo treatments recent years ability extend life expectancy without limitations depending response treatments uncommon adults deletion syndrome need support services maintain activities daily living including adult day care services housing incredibly rare fewer cases although rare deletions involving chromosome among commonly observed chromosome partial monosomy appears affect females slightly frequently males since disorder originally reported cases recorded medical age onset vary patient patient differences
