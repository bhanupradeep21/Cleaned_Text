indolent cell lymphoproliferative disorder gastrointestinal tract indolent cell lymphoproliferative disorder gi tract itcldgt rare recently recognized disorder mature cell lymphocytes accumulation abnormally gastrointestinal tract gi accumulation causes various lesions eg polyps thickened mucosal folds small areas redness superficial ulcerations mucosal layer lining gi tract individuals itcldgt commonly complain chronic gi tract symptoms nausea vomiting diarrhea abdominal pain rectal carbonnell et first described case indolent gi tract lymphoproliferation disorder defined lymphocytes involved cells expressing glycoprotein surface membranes subsequent studies reported patients similar indolent gi tract disorder involved cells expressed either neither surface membrane glycoprotein disorder resembled certain aggressive gi tract lymphomas variably termed indolent lymphoma indolent cell lymphoproliferative disorder gastrointestinal however disease differed aggressive lymphomas mimicked prolonged usually nonprogressive course furthermore disorders lesions consisted normalappearing cells proliferated slowly usually caused little tissue world health organization provisionally classified itcldgt extranodal ie usually involving lymph nodes indolent disorder various subtypes cells proliferate gi usually acting like benign disease itcldgt malignant features normalappearing

oncogenic mutations recent study cells patients tcell disease carried fusion gene consists fusion gene position long g arm chromosome location abbreviated gene position short q chromosome disorder two patients fusion gene progressed malignant abnormalities expression andor activity well various fusion associated development progression various myeloproliferative lymphoproliferative malignancies findings suggest gene may contribute malignant progression perhaps development numerous genetic abnormalities occur tcells itcldgt unlike fusion gene limited single cases abnormalities include trisomy chromosome fusion bcell maturation antigen genes loses chromosomal areas involved formation fusion gene one copy number variations diverse areas different roles abnormalities itcldgt unclearcitation

tcells reported cases cells express cluster differentiation protein complex vary expression cluster differentiation glycoprotein well glycoprotein component cell receptor individuals itcldgt therefore pathological accumulations either rarely single case cell disease reported may differences presentation course malignant potential itcldgt based different expressions requires study unlike certain types cell lymphomas mistaken cells itcldgt express neutral cell adhesion molecule infected virus therefore express viruss latency proteins latency origin cells unknown thought tcells derive mucosal helper cytotoxic lymphocytes respectively cells may cause rare cases disorder exhibit cytology morphology features latter two mucosal cell histological analysis tissues biopsied gi tract generally reveals dense infiltrates small mature lymphocytes mucosa may usually epithelium cells sometimes extend muscularis mucosa invade lesions may contain reactive plasma cells eosinophils granulomas

using immunofluorescence diagnosis indolent cell lymphoproliferative disorder gi tract depends identifying presentation clinical course laboratory histological findings given previous four future studies may find diagnosis supported demonstrating presence fusion gene cells suspicious inspection entire gi tract endoscopy colonoscopy generally finds mucosal redness erosions small superficial ulcerations occasional small fissures diverticula rarely tumorlike masses deep lesions may localized occur multiple sites extend throughout gi common small intestine also occur stomach esophagus oral cavity eg palate whole body computed tomography scans ie ct scans frequently find enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes ie lymph nodes attached intestinal mesentery may show evidence liver spleen andor organ involvement cases advancing advanced malignant lymphoma positron emission tomography scans ie pet scans positron emission tomography scans ie petct scans likewise often show mesenteric lymph nodes itcldgt exhibit modestly increased metabolic biochemical activity cases progressing overt malignant disease show increased activity inspection patients peripheral blood smearss bone marrow tissues may identify excessive numbers itcldgts cells thereby likewise indicate progressing malignant radical differences prognoses treatments itcldgt distinguished malignant inflammatory autoimmune
