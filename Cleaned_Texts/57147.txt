methods treatment individuals vaginal atresia first method treatment recommended would selfdilation vagina doctor may first recommend patient first attempts create vagina process self dilation technique consists using vaginal dilators small round tubes vary size similar size shape vaginal dilators may pressed alongside vaginal area regular basis order open vaginal canal franks procedure technique used progressive series vaginal dilators inserted dimple vagina using pressure widen space exists bladder rectummedical citation needed franks procedure performed directly patient therefore requiring surgery anesthesia proceduretechnique take months complete regular compliance necessary overall success rate females use franks procedure procedure work surgery would next method

born without complete vagina still regular sized uterus likely able become pregnant baby however female born tiny uterus without uterus able ovaries may normal case egg may fertilized donors partners

new developing form treatment fertility options researched daily always new method pain associated rokitanskymayerküsterhauser syndrome comes menstruation related cramping treated several ways individuals syndrome may born uterine remnant tiny uterus become filled blood pelvic cavity causing medical professional assess severity uterine remnant within patient determine removal uterus cure
