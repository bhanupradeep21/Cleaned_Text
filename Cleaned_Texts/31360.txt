terminus next residue inner loop closed tryptathionine linkage cysteine addition αamanitin decorated modified amino acid side chains gives high affinity rna polymerase ii early methods detect alphaamanitin included thinlayer chromatography tlc solvent systems used tlc alphaamanitin betaamanitin would travel different rates thus allowing individual identification toxin another early method meixner test also known wieland test would detect amatoxins also yielded false positives compounds capillary zone electrophoresis also developed adequately sensitive clinical samples sufficient mushroom recently use highperformance liquid chromatography hplc become preferred method allows better resolution reproducibility higher range detectors paired hplc uv mass spectrometry early
