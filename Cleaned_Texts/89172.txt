texas health science center houston uthealth later evan pugh professor biology pennsylvania state university director institute molecular evolutionary genetics working nei affiliated department biology temple university adjunct laura h carnell professor acting alone working students continuously developed statistical methods studying molecular evolution taking account discoveries molecular biology also developed concepts evolutionary theory advanced theory mutationdriven together walter fitch nei cofounded journal molecular biology evolution society molecular biology evolution nei first show mathematically presence gene interaction natural selection always tends enhance linkage intensity genetic loci maintain linkage observed average recombination value per genome generally lower higher organisms lower organisms attributed observation theory linkage recent molecular data indicate many sets interacting genes hox genes immunoglobulin genes histone genes often existed gene clusters long evolutionary time observation also explained theory linkage modification also showed unlike r fishers argument deleterious mutations accumulate rather quickly chromosome duplicate genes finite considering rates amino acid substitution gene duplication gene inactivation predicted higher organisms contain large number duplicate genes nonfunctional genes called prediction shown correct many multigene families pseudogenes discovered notable contribution early proposal new measure genetic distance neis distance populations use studying evolutionary relationships populations closely related later developed another distance measure called da appropriate finding topology phylogenetic tree also developed statistics measuring extent population differentiation types mating system using gst collaborators presented mathematical formulation population bottleneck effects clarified genetic meaning bottleneck proposed statistical measure called nucleotide widely used measuring extent nucleotide polymorphism also developed several different models speciation concluded reproductive isolation species occurs passive process accumulation interspecific incompatibility early great controversy mechanism protein evolution maintenance protein polymorphism nei collaborators developed various statistical methods testing neutral theory molecular evolution using polymorphism data analysis allele frequency distribution relationship average heterozygosity protein divergence species etc showed large portion protein polymorphism explained neutral exception major histocompatibility complex mhc loci show extraordinarily high degree polymorphism reasons accepted neutral theory using genetic distance theory k roychoudhury showed genetic variation europeans asians africans percent total genetic variation human population estimated europeans asians diverged years ago two populations diverged africans years conclusion supported many later studies using larger numbers genes populations estimates appear still roughly correct finding could considered early indication outofafrica theory human originscitation needed around nei students initiated study inference phylogenetic trees based distance data developed statistical method testing accuracy phylogenetic tree examining statistical significance interior branch lengths developed neighbor joining minimumevolution methods tree also developed statistical methods estimating evolutionary times molecular phylogenies collaboration sudhir kumar koichiro tamura developed widely used computer program package phylogenetic analysis called neis group invented simple statistical method detecting positive darwinian selection comparing numbers synonymous nucleotide substitutions nonsynonymous nucleotide applying method showed exceptionally high degree sequence polymorphism mhc loci caused overdominant although various statistical methods test developed later original methods still widely nei students studied evolutionary patterns large number multigene families showed generally evolve following model gene families process fast caused random events gene duplication gene deletion generates genomic drift gene copy number nei long maintained view driving force evolution mutation including types dna changes nucleotide changes chromosomal changes genome duplication natural selection primarily force eliminating less fit genotypes ie theory mutationdriven conducted statistical analyzes evolution genes controlling phenotypic characters immunity olfactory reception obtained evidence supporting
