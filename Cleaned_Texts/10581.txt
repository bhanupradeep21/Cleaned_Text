individuals focus big picture goals sufficiently control daytoday tasks frequently must developing using trusted system deals daytoday inputs individual free mental space begin moving next allen recommends scheduling weekly review reflecting six different levels perspective gained reviews drive ones priorities project priorities project level turn determine priority individual tasks
