large size variation specimens rhamphorhynchus taken represent species variation however paper bennett argued species actually represent yearclasses single species rhamphorhynchus muensteri flaplings adults following interpretation bennett found several notable changes occurred r muensteri animal juvenile rhamphorhynchus relatively short skulls large eyes toothless beaklike tips jaws shorter juveniles adults rounded blunt lower jaw tips eventually becoming slender pointed animals grew adult rhamphorhynchus also developed strong upward hook end lower jaw number teeth remained constant juvenile adult though teeth became relatively shorter stockier animals grew possibly accommodate larger powerful prey pelvic pectoral girdles fused animals aged full pectoral fusion attained one year shape tail vane also changed across various age classes rhamphorhynchus juveniles vane shallow relative tail roughly oval lancetshaped growth progressed tail vane became diamondshaped finally triangular largest smallest known rhamphorhynchus specimen wingspan millimeters however likely even small individual capable flight bennett examined two possibilities hatchlings altricial requiring period parental care leaving nest precocial hatching sufficient size ability flight precocious bennett suggested clutches would small one two eggs laid per clutch compensate relatively large size hatchings bennett speculate possibility likely though discovery pterosaur embryo avgodectes strongly ossified bones suggests pterosaurs general precocial able fly soon hatching minimal parental theory contested histological study rhamphorhynchus showed initial rapid growth followed prolonged period slow published ontogenetic analyses indicated rhamphorhynchus could fly soon hatching supporting theory precociality species also suggested juveniles may occupied different sequential niches throughout growth determined rhamphorhynchus specimens fit discrete yearclasses bennett able estimate growth rate one year comparing size oneyearold specimens twoyearold specimens found average growth rate first year life rhamphorhynchus slightly faster growth rate alligators growth likely slowed considerably sexual maturity would taken three years attain maximum adult growth rate much slower rate seen large pterodactyloid pterosaurs pteranodon attained nearadult size within first year life additionally pterodactyloids determinate growth meaning animals reached fixed maximum adult size stopped growing previous assumptions rapid growth rate rhamphorhynchoids based assumption needed warmblooded sustain active flight warmblooded animals like modern birds bats normally show rapid growth adult size determinate growth evidence either rhamphorhynchus bennett considered findings consistent ectothermic metabolism though recommended studies needed done coldblooded rhamphorhynchus bennett suggested may basked sun worked muscles accumulate enough energy bouts flight cooled ambient temperature active save energy like modern though rhamphorhynchus often depicted aerial piscivore recent evidence suggests much like modern aquatic birds probably foraged swimming like several
