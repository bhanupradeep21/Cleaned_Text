arteriovenous malformations lead high blood flow loss von willebrand factor lead much extensive bleeding people aortic stenosis also gastrointestinal bleeding invariably hypothesized defects high molecular weight von willebrand factor could actually cause arteriovenus malformations intestinal angiodysplasia rather making existing angiodysplasic lesions bleed hypothesis complicated extremely high rates intestinal angiodysplasia older people also highest rate aortic stenosis thus requires research heydes syndrome known gastrointestinal bleeding angiodysplasic lesions due acquired

another study done usa looking angiodysplasia rather gi bleeding found prevalence aortic stenosis compared control disease mainly found older adults rare case heydes syndrome reported american internist edward c heyde originally described syndrome letter new england journal medicine reporting ten patients heyde graduated johns hopkins school medicine served three years army medical corps world war ii joined vancouver clinic vancouver washington practicing medicine years died october needed years following initial description plausible explanations could found association aortic valve stenosis gastrointestinal bleeding indeed association questioned number several studies demonstrated statistically significant association aortic stenosis gastrointestinal king et al even noted successful resolution bleeding symptoms aortic valve replacement people compared people bleeding treated however potential causal association two conditions remained elusive controversialcitation needed several hypotheses association proposed prominent idea causal relationship aortic stenosis gastrointestinal bleeding common conditions elderly sometimes overlap hypotheses included hypoxia colonic mucosa bowel ischemia due low blood flow discounted later another early hypothesis note proposed greenstein et al suggested gi bleeding could caused thinning wall cecum due abnormal pulse

hypothesis however eclipsed newer research acquired von willebrands diseasecitation needed important role depletion von willebrand factor aortic stenosis first proposed warkentin et noted known association aortic stenosis addition cardiac diseases acquired von willebrands disease type corrected surgical replacement aortic valve also noted von willebrands disease known cause bleeding angiodysplasia based facts hypothesized acquired von willebrands disease true culprit behind gastrointestinal bleeding aortic stenosis also proposed possible mechanism acquired von willebrands disease noting von willebrand factor active high shear vessels meaning small vessels blood flows rapidly used fact hypothesize may mean von willebrand factor activated narrowed stenotic aortic valve thus cleared circulation much higher rate healthy individualscitation needed hypothesis received strong support publication report vincentelli et al demonstrated strong association von willebrand factor defects severity aortic valve also showed defects resolved within hours following aortic valve replacement surgery remained resolved people although people von willebrand factor defects returned six
