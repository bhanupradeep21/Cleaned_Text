forfarella genus chasmataspidid group extinct aquatic arthropods fossils discovered deposits early devonian period single type species f mitchelli known one specimen found scotland united kingdom known bmnh poorly preserved type locality uncertain although might kelly den stream section near village arbirlot forfarella small reaching centimetres inches length nearly rectangular head eyes unknown possibly represented tubercle fossil abdomen consisted almost trapezoidal preabdomen long tapering postabdomen telson posteriormost division body preserved probably short appendages known fragments probably swimming paddles forfarella used swim actively fossil forfarella purchased fossil collection sent natural history museum london decades later paleontologist studied determined chasmataspidid naming forfarella mitchelli however paleontologist never formally published findings would group three paleontologists formally described forfarella forming part family diploaspididae similar diploaspis devonian genera although speculated forfarella may existed silurian well lacustrine animal meaning lived lakes like chasmataspidids f mitchelli small arthropod size known specimen estimated centimetres inches carapace dorsal plate head wide subrectangular almost rectangular broader long cm wide cm long details surface preserved exception tubercle left anterior corner carapace distinguished placed plane polarized light tubercle likely represents lateral eye appendages limbs known two fragments left right sides probably belonging sixth last pair left one length cm width cm

subtrapezoidal narrowed posteriorly vague impressions distinguish second third fourth tergites dorsal half segments first one postabdomen segments also tapered posteriorly longer tergites distinguishable fossil length approximately cm telson posteriormost division body probably short contemporary specimen two cracks prosoma head preabdomen well dark patches probably corresponding forfarella known one single poorly preserved specimen bmnh found dundee within old red sandstone near arbroath scotland united kingdom according label associated fossil purchased collection person surnamed mitchell along colleagues one fossil collectors area near forfar usually specify exact type locality tracking problematic studying fossils label comparing fossils mitchells collection details origins concluded subsequent study kelly den stream section south village arbirlot could original site however following purchase fossil forfarella instantly registered natural history museum london like fossils mitchells british paleontologist charles waterston borrowed still unregistered specimen well four fossils juvenile eurypterids describe noted chasmataspidid nature would become holotype forfarella registered coined name forfarella mitchelli however waterston would never publish description returning fossil museum three years later would labeled name given paleontologist thus forfarella mitchelli remained nomen manuscriptum taxonomic name appears informally published despite turbulent history fossil paleontologists jason dunlop lyall anderson simon j braddy formally proposed described forfarella mitchelli first time new genus chasmataspidid name suggested waterston kept avoid future confusion anderson also studied troublesome specimen allegedly national museum scotland later discovering could represent another specimen forfarella however upon examination discovered chasmataspidid poorly preserved undetermined arthropod forfarella classified part family diploaspididae one two families order chasmataspidida includes one single species f mitchelli early devonian time forfarella described members diploaspididae defined small chasmataspidids subrectangular semicircular carapace tapering postabdomen short excluding last one uncertain forfarella possessed features regarding chasmataspidids forfarella considerably similar diploaspis casteri although longer postabdomen perhaps taphonomic distortion defect product fossilization organism specimen genus also resembled devonian chasmataspidids differed ordovician chasmataspis much larger genal spines spines protruding posterolateral corners carapace differentiated forfarella rest chasmataspidids dimensions body size shape carapace distinctive subtrapezoidal preabdomen even forfarellas affiliation diploaspididae genus included date phylogenetic analysis specimen forfarella discovered early devonian deposits found old red dundee formation fossil preserved gray siltstone lithology physical characteristics rocks fossil similar laminate fishbearing beds tealing scottish village near suspected type locality however exact location recollected still thought forfarella devonian chasmataspidids sixth pair appendages modified paddles would made active furthermore deposits forfarella found lacustrine formed bottom ancient lake type chasmataspidids subsequently invaded freshwater habitats maybe due late devonian extinction new species diploaspis praecursor described unlike two species silurian goes devonian extending fossil range genus also suggests could specimens
