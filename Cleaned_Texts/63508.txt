fungicides pesticides used kill parasitic fungi commonly chemical compounds may include biocontrols fungistatics fungi cause serious damage agriculture resulting critical losses yield quality profit fungicides used agriculture fight fungal infections animals fungicides also used control oomycetes taxonomicallygenetically fungi although sharing similar methods infecting fungicides either contact translaminar systemic contact fungicides taken plant tissue protect plant spray deposited translaminar fungicides redistribute fungicide upper sprayed leaf surface lower unsprayed surface systemic fungicides taken redistributed xylem vessels fungicides move parts plant locally systemic move fungicides bought retail sold liquid form common active ingredient present weaker concentrates high potent fungicides fungicides powdered form usually around sulfur toxic active ingredients fungicides include neem oil rosemary oil jojoba oil bacterium bacillus subtilis beneficial fungus ulocladium oudemansii fungicide residues found food human consumption mostly postharvest fungicides dangerous human health vinclozolin removed ziram also fungicide toxic humans longterm exposure fatal number fungicides also used human health care fungicides classified according mechanism action moa specifically biological process target site block fungicide resistance action committee frac assigns chemicals classes according moa subdivides according similarities examples commercial fungicides within class given common fungal crop pathogens known suffer mycoviruses likely common plant animal viruses although well studied given obligately parasitic nature mycoviruses likely detrimental hosts thus potential pathogens respond use fungicides evolving resistance field several mechanisms resistance identified evolution fungicide resistance gradual sudden qualitative discrete resistance mutation normally single gene produces race fungus high degree resistance resistant varieties also tend show stability persisting fungicide removed market example sugar beet leaf blotch remains resistant azoles years longer used control disease mutations high selection pressure fungicide used low selection pressure remove absence fungicide instances resistance occurs gradually shift sensitivity pathogen fungicide seen resistance polygenic accumulation many mutations different genes small additive effect type resistance known quantitative continuous resistance kind resistance pathogen population revert sensitive state fungicide longer applied little known variations fungicide treatment affect selection pressure evolve resistance fungicide evidence shows doses provide control disease also provide largest selection pressure acquire resistance lower doses decrease selection cases pathogen evolves resistance one fungicide automatically obtains resistance others phenomenon known cross resistance additional fungicides typically belong chemical family act way similar mechanism detoxification sometimes negative crossresistance occurs resistance one chemical class fungicides increases sensitivity different chemical class fungicides seen carbendazim diethofencarb also recorded incidences evolution multiple drug resistance pathogens resistance two chemically different fungicides separate mutation events example botrytis cinerea resistant azoles dicarboximide fungicides several routes pathogens evolve fungicide resistance common mechanism appears alteration target site particularly defense single site action fungicides example black sigatoka economically important pathogen banana resistant qoi fungicides due single nucleotide change resulting replacement one amino acid glycine another alanine target protein qoi fungicides cytochrome presumed disrupts binding fungicide protein rendering fungicide ineffective upregulation target genes also render fungicide ineffective seen dmiresistant strains venturia resistance fungicides also developed efficient efflux fungicide cell septoria tritici developed multiple drug resistance using mechanism pathogen five abctype transporters overlapping substrate specificities together work pump toxic chemicals addition mechanisms outlined fungi may also develop metabolic pathways circumvent target protein acquire enzymes enable metabolism fungicide harmless substance fungicide resistance action committee several recommended practices try avoid development fungicide resistance especially atrisk fungicides including strobilurins frac assigns groups fungicides classes crossresistance likely usually active ingredients share common mode frac organized croplife products always used isolation rather mixture alternate sprays another fungicide different mechanism action likelihood pathogens developing resistance greatly decreased fact resistant isolates one fungicide killed words two mutations would required rather one effectiveness technique demonstrated metalaxyl phenylamide fungicide used sole product ireland control potato blight phytophthora infestans resistance developed within one growing season however countries like uk marketed mixture resistance problems developed slowly fungicides applied absolutely necessary especially atrisk group lowering amount fungicide environment lowers selection pressure resistance develop manufacturers doses always followed doses normally designed give right balance controlling disease limiting risk resistance developmentcitation needed higher doses increase selection pressure singlesite mutations confer resistance strains carry mutation eliminated thus resistant strain propagate lower doses greatly increase risk polygenic resistance strains slightly less sensitive fungicide may survive better use integrative pest management approach disease control rather relying fungicides alone involves use resistant varieties hygienic practices removal potato discard piles stubble pathogen overwinter greatly reducing titre pathogen thus risk fungicide
