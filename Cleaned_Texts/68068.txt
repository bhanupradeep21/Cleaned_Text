development animal model autism one approach researchers use study potential causes given complexity autism etiology researchers often focus single features autism using animal one common rodent models norway rat rattus recent research used house mouse mus musculus model autism social species strains mice used include mu opioid receptor knockout mice well knockout mice latter also used animal models fragile x norway rat used example mady hornig implicate thiomersal current scientific consensus convincing scientific evidence supports major scientific medical bodies institute world health well governmental agencies us food drug fda centers disease control cdc reject role thiomersal autism neurodevelopmental disorders behaviors measured models include approach olfactory pheromones emitted mice approach familiar new conspecifics reciprocal social interactions ultrasonic vocalizations communal nesting sexual parenting behaviors territorial scent marking aggressive behaviors well motor behaviors social interaction measured mouse interacts stranger mouse introduced opposite side test researchers university florida used deer mice study restricted repetitive behavior compulsive grooming behaviors may caused specific gene addition craig powell university texas southwestern medical center grant autism currently using mice examine potential role neuroligin gene mutations causing autism much research done use rat model show borna virus exposure valproic acid maternal immune may cause autism another goal use rodent models study autism identify mechanism autism develops researchers developed autism severity score measure degree severity mices autism well use scent marking vocalization models communication observed mice lacking gene oxytocin exhibit deficits social interaction may possible develop treatments autism based abnormalities environmental factors asd looking environmental factors autistic spectrum disorder rodents helps us understand neuropathology disorder compared humans environmental factors studied animal rodent models seen influence brain development play role cns neuropathology example one study found possible environmental contributor autism may agents like prenatal exposure air pollution birth difficulty leading periods oxygen deprivation brain alter serotonin levels early development study also found parent exhibits autism offspring likely autistic well since older men higher number dna mutations sperm mutations usually found offspring older men last major result study observed environmental factors pregnancy may impact immune system well developing nervous system plays part creating neurodevelopmental disorders like since environmental factors occur time developmental process much variability neural behavioral phenotype autism environment cause unknown changes brain development rodents dont live habitat therefore might develop different changes brain expected maternal immune activation also associated increased risk development neurodevelopmental maternal immune activation inflammatory pathways activated pregnancy usually infection inflammatory pathways involve release cytokines immune signaling proteins injection polyic immunostimulant mimics viral infection pregnant rodents shown induce inflammatory response brain offspring induce structural brain changes offspring bring behavioral changes hyperactivity aggressive behavior less social behavior addition viral infection lipopolysaccharides lps used mimic bacterial infection rodents order observe effects offspring lps similar effects polyic immune system offspring increasing inflammatory state offspring lasted adulthood indicating longlasting effects maternal immune overall recent studies make case infection pregnancy environmental risk factor neurodevelopmental disorders asd schizophrenia rodents genetic phenotypic factors asd six autismrelated genes linked x chromosome comes autistic spectrum first gene linked autism fragile x mental retardation gene example rodents gene exhibit elevated cortical spine densities similar found autism well decreased social behaviors another gene linked autism methylcpg binding protein type gene rodent models disruption rodents usually normal sixteenth week age start develop extreme anxiety field reduced nest building poor social interactions symptoms third fourth genes linked autism neuroligin nlgn genes one study found mutations nlgn genes lead loss neuroligin processing stimulate formation synapses feature autistic spectrum fifth sixth genes linked autism tuberous sclerosis genes mutations one two genes cause multiple benign tumors grow multiple tissues like lastly many abnormalities found autistic spectrum disorders involve mtor signaling pathway gaba containing neurons immune system human autism spectrum disorder understanding human neurodevelopmental disorders often requires adequate models understand overall nature disorder general impacts disorder makes brain naturally disorder different implications comes genetic makeup phenotypically genotypically generally impacts particular brain regions autism spectrum disorder asd generally seen reduced developmental growth within brain specifically reduced gray matter within medial temporal lobe mtl amygdala hippocampus located critical understanding autism region brain controls emotions learning symptomatically linked asd addition supports need animal models establish greater understanding effects particular brain regions genetics development measures take prevent onset neuropathology underdeveloped synapse autism spectrum disorder asd caused developmental delays cause brain lower connectivity within particularly important regions synapses within brain critical importance development young children especially critical period autistic brains often delayed early critical periods causing complications within brains developmental stages ability create stronger synapses basic communication stimulus furthermore brains lessened development cognitive delays usually observable within genetics grey matter within rodent models established good examples brains akin humans makeup additionally similar social interactions relationships humans shows social development symptoms often used diagnose asd rodents used models compared normal developed brains replicate asd rodents lesioned prior birth using prenatal valproate vpa rodents experience similar symptoms developmental changes occur humans asd humans asd identified singlegene mutation particularly simple changes rodents human brains impact greatly ability develop neuropathology gaba receptors rodents especially mice excellent animal models autism similar social relationships neuroscience exposed prenatal valproate vpa pregnancy mice born basic deformities developmental delays seen symptomatically comparable easier study since lifespan mice rodents shorter able understand genetics minute effects test methods reduce onset disorder allows researchers develop new treatment methods quickly effectively help humans spectrum additionally rodents may trace back particular models developmental delays occur relation gaba neurotransmitter generally seen inhibitory prior birth early development brain often excitatory neurons establish proper brain chemistry development specific times called critical periods brain capable acquiring neural connections usually leads new behavioral psychological skills gabas change excitatory inhibitory well neurotransmitter changes critical developmental stages impact development brain goes critical period early growth limited slowed even stunted early additionally later brains development measured complete incorrectly may limit ability improve connectivity overall brains circuitry communication often limited poor within asd using rodent models study limitations come increases researchers understanding disorder potential ways prevent
