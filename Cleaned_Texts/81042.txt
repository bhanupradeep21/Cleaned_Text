panthoot loud structurally complex vocalization call generally divided four distinct successive phases introduction buildup climax introductory phase begins soft breathy lowfrequency hoos transition buildup phase series increasingly rapid lowfrequency inandout following buildup phase call quickly builds climax consisting loud highfrequency screams eventually slow letdown phase similar structure buildup decreasing amplitude pace call male female chimpanzees produce unique vocalizations highranking adult males predominantly frequently emitting panthoot often produced jointly males complementary behaviour known chorusing opposed producing calls loud longdistance vocalizations produced numerous purposes variety different circumstances panthoot chorusing used aid formation social

production individuals living forest ecosystems must modify structure panthoot reduce effects degradation attenuation transmission call due high number trees obstructing pathway travelling obstructions increase possibility refraction scattering sound waves therefore increasing rate attenuation decreasing effectiveness counteract effects individuals living within forest habitat produce
