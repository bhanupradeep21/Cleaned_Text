biology metabolism program division intramural research eunice kennedy shriver national institute child health human development national institutes health lippincottschwartz received phd johns hopkins university performed postdoctoral training richard klausner nichd nih bethesda lippincottschwartzs research revealed organelles eukaryotic cells dynamic selforganized structures constantly regenerate intracellular vesicle traffic rather static also pioneer developing live cell imaging techniques study dynamic interactions molecules cells including photobleaching techniques allow investigation subcellular localization mobility transport routes turnover important cellular proteins related membrane trafficking compartmentalization lippincottschwartzs lab also tests mechanistic hypotheses related protein organelle functions dynamics utilizing quantitative measurements kinetic modeling simulation along craig blackstone lippincottschwartz utilized advanced imaging techniques reveal accurate picture peripheral endoplasmic reticulum structured findings may yield new insights genetic diseases affecting proteins help shape endoplasmic additionally lippincottschwartzs laboratory demonstrated golgi enzymes constitutively recycle back endoplasmic reticulum recycling plays central role maintenance biogenesis inheritance golgi apparatus mammalian within lippincottschwartz lab current projects include several cell biological areas example protein transport cytoskeleton interaction organelle assembly disassembly cell polarity generation also projects analyzing dynamics proteins fluorescently labeled proteins labeled using several live cell imaging techniques frap fcs lippincottschwartz dedicated recent lab research photoactivation localization microscopy palm allows viewing molecular distributions high densities jennifer lippincottschwartz born october manhattan kansas father professor physical chemistry university periodic table could

biology lippincottschwartz attended swarthmore college majored psychology philosophy graduated honors swarthmore college taught science girls high school kenya two years returning usa entering masters program biology stanford university worked dna repair laboratory philip entered biochemistry phd program johns hopkins university worked douglas fambroughs lab carnegie institution studied dynamics lysosomal membrane graduating johns hopkins lippincottschwartz joined richard klausners lab national institutes health using drug brefeldin perturb membrane trafficking showed membranes cycle endoplasmic reticulum leading recognition cellular organelles dynamic selforganized structures constantly regenerate intracellular vesicle lippincottschwartz became staff fellow national institute child health human development nih time lippincottschwartz began developing techniques use green fluorescent protein gfp visualize cellular trafficking pathways living refined technique fluorescence recovery photobleaching frap use studying dynamics membrane proteins method gfptagged membrane proteins subjected photobleaching small area cell cell imaged discover long takes nonbleached proteins replace bleached ones ie long takes fluorescence recover work thought membrane proteins organelles er golgi plasma membrane fixed place however frap technique proved molecules within cells move quite rapidly able diffuse lippincottschwartz subsequently introduced photoactivatable gfp increases fluorescence allowed lippincottschwartz postdoc george patterson track transport cargo molecules golgi great leading realization cargo transport ordered sequential process instead apparently separate membranous stacks golgi single continuous structure proteins rapidly equilibrate lippincottschwartzs work photoactivatable gfp led collaboration eric betzig howard hughes medical institutes janelia farm research campus ability turn gfp fluorescence used develop one first superresolution imaging technologies photoactivation localization microscopy development superresolved fluorescence microscopy recognized award nobel prize chemistry eric betzig along william e moerner stanford university
