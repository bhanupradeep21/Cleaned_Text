oleandrin cardiac glycoside found poisonous plant oleander nerium oleander main phytochemical oleander oleandrin associated toxicity oleander sap similar properties oleander used traditional medicine presumed therapeutic purposes treating cardiac insufficiency clinical evidence oleander constituents including oleandrin safe effective oleandrin approved regulatory agencies prescription drug dietary structure oleandrin contains central steroid nucleus unsaturated lactone ring structure dideoxy arabinose group addition steroid ring substitute acetyloxy group sugar forming glycoside loleandrose oleandrin resembles much glycosides like ouabain digoxin less effect digoxin however like derivate oleandrigenin potent glycoside oleandrin derivate oleandrigenin formed n oleander plant oleandrin leaves parts plant also produced lab using cell cultures oleandrin synthesis along metabolites stimulated untransformed plant cell cultures supplementation phytohormone however enough produce large quantities early cell death transgenic cultures agrobacteria able synthesize great quantities oleandrin metabolites oleander plants fit pharmaceutical oleandrin apart pure form also closely related structural similar glycosides alkaloids less characteristics although oleandrigenin formed human plasma found volunteers injected oleandrin suggesting formed human lipophilic properties oleandrin easily absorbed gastrointestinal tract oral clearance slow plasma concentration obtains maximum twenty minutes oral intake halflife hours halflife iv administration half excreted mostly feces also main route excretion biliary excretion feces mainly liver exposed excretion urine smaller route kidneys less exposed also accumulation heart explains potential cardiac properties cardiac glycoside oleandrin interferes essential processes within cell important inhibition nak protein enables cell exchange cations na k intercellular extracellular spaces instance electric signaling made possible nerve cells oleandrin binds specific amino acids protein causing lose apart potent toxic compound results oleandrin human clinical research support use treatment cancer due considerable toxicity use oleander constituents oleandrin regarded unsafe potentially use oleander may cause contact dermatitis headache nausea lethargy high blood levels potassium symptoms appearing within hours one fatality blood concentration oleandrin related cardiac glycoside oleander plant estimated practice adult cases wherein oleander leaves unknown oleandrin concentration proved fatal also lethal case child consumed one symptoms oleandrin poisoning cause gastrointestinal cardiac gastrointestinal effects consist nausea abdominal pain vomiting well higher salivation diarrhea may contain first symptoms heart may affected tachyarrhythmia bradyarrhythmia premature ventricular contractions atrioventricular blockage also xanthopsia yellow vision burning sensation mucous membranes eyes gastrointestinal tract respiratory paralysis reactions poisonings plant also affect central nervous system symptoms include drowsiness tremors shaking muscles seizures collapse even coma lead oleander sap cause skin irritations severe eye inflammation irritation allergy reactions characterized dermatitis administered diagnosis oleandrin poisoning mainly based description plant much ingested time since ingestion three methods used detecting oleandrin blood fluorescence polarization immunoassay widely used test slower lower sensitivity digoxin immunoassay digoxin direct analytic technique like liquid chromatographyelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry used medical legal oleander toxicity treated aggressively including needed gastric lavage induced onset symptoms may vary way intake teas made leaves root n oleander give rise acute onset eating raw leaves causes slower onset management oleandrin poisoning done following lack evidence weighs efficacy versus activated charcoal still used since binds toxins gastrointestinal tract reduce absorption uncertain whether repeated administration activated charcoal effective theory interrupting enterohepatic cycling treatment used digoxin poisoning another cardiac supportive care like monitoring vitals electrolyte fluid balance important patients may present hypovolemic due vomiting diarrhea severely elevated potassium also electrolyte balance vital since patients low cardiac glycoside levels still die adequate digoxin fab antibody treatment disturbed electrolyte treatment slow heart rate heart rhythm irregularities may require intravenous isoprenaline moderate cases prolonging pr interval progression av dissociation cardiac pacing effectiveness interventions unknown associated sideeffects therefore consultation cardiologist recommended managing significant n oleander induced use antidigoxin fab iv proven successful cases oleandrin dose mg used digoxin poisoning dose mg recommended oleandrin poisoning due lower binding affinity antibody patients receiving adequate dose antidigoxin fab show good response resolving serious arrhythmias two hours fifty percent cases treated patients showed rapid increase heart rate significant decline serum potassium reason antidigoxin fab sparingly used developing countries high cost even though effective although oleander used traditional medicine treating various disorders evidence safe effective medicinal pandemic donald trumps secretary housing urban development ben carson mypillow ceo mike lindell major trump booster investor company develops oleandrin promoted
