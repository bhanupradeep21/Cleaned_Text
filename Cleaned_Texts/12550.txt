marine life past present future released initially supported funding alfred p sloan foundation project successful generating many times initial investment additional support substantially increased baselines knowledge often underexplored ocean realms well engaging different researchers first time global collaborative community united common goal described one largest scientific collaborations ever according jesse ausubel senior research associate program human environment rockefeller university science advisor alfred p sloan foundation idea census marine life originated conversations dr j frederick grassle oceanographer benthic ecology professor rutgers university grassle urged talk ausubel former colleagues woods hole oceanographic institution time unaware ausubel also program manager

might one result workshops broadening initial concept census fishes comprehensive census marine results workshops plus associated invited contributions formed basis special issue oceanography magazine later year workshop washington dc addressed formation ocean biogeographic information system obis would serve collate existing knowledge distribution organisms ocean form information management component census began formal sense announcement may eight grants totaling million us create obis reported science magazine meanwhile international scientific steering committee formed envisaged half dozen pilot field programs period along obis another project called history marine animal populations hmap would provide initial activities census followed additional series field programs culminating analysis integration phase operation census additional nonfield project added future marine animal populations fmap concentrated forecasting future life oceans using modeling simulation tools general method working project proposals would debated within scientific steering committee recommended funding formal submission would made sloan foundation funding support principal investigators pis project coordinator meetings project participants additional synthesis education outreach since sloan foundation approval dependent promises contributions additional sources projects encouraged bring additional resources board operation foundation funds committed effectively leveraged many times provide much substantial program would otherwise possible core infrastructure components foundation also supported census international scientific steering committee secretariat us national committee education outreach network lift projects visibility engage nations census ultimately estimated cost

david penman coauthors wrote census inception visionary leader grassle able convince small group colleagues need project find likeminded individual ausubel saw opportunity sloan foundation take key role bring census fruition leadership sought problems solve identified issue could addressed conventional national funding mechanisms could approached largescale collaborative endeavour sloan foundation saw opportunity facilitate new science would also contribute knowledge wide societal census consisted three major component themes organized around questions largest component census involved investigating currently lives worlds oceans field projects sampled biota one six realms global oceans using range technologies projects field projects complemented three nonfield census projects namely hmap fmap obis series national regional implementation committees nrics also established progress involvement particular countries regions census activities towards end project additional teams created education outreach mapping vizualization products synthesis group coordinated final outcomes publications etc lifespan census involved scientists countries spent days sea participating censusbadged well uncounted nearshore sampling events addition many thousands records previously known species census scientists found marine species potentially new science completed formal descriptions census scientists visited many parts global ocean learn species ranging size blue whale minute zooplankton microbes bacteria viruses sampled worlds coldest regions warm tropics deepsea hydrothermal vents coastal ecosystems tracked movements fish interrogated historical records learn ocean used like influence humans employed forecasting methods predict may happen ocean life future one largest scientific collaborations ever conducted census produced scientific papers many thousands information products million species distribution records freely available via well tangible scientific legacy census instrumental building global community researchers many never collaborated brought together auspices census new approach collaborative research ian poiner outgoing chair census said census changed views things could done shared problems shared review census commissioned alfred p sloan foundation david penman coauthors wrote prior census fragmented research community marine biodiversity researchers active coordinated national international research programs taxonomic research particular underfunded scattered disparate organizations culture collaboration data sharing unlike oceanographic community marine biology characterized small research projects leading publications little experience willingness openly collaborate share data addition recognized openaccess data portal marine biodiversity data unlike physical science oceanographic community recognized data depository common standards sharing marine biodiversity summarizing remarks penman et al writing stated census statistical measure great success large number scientific papers published still published census participants alone would sufficient instead census achieved truly global science biology profess provide complete census life ocean substantially increase baselines knowledge often underexplored ocean realms knowledge base future research surveys add data shared webbased services obis may able derive estimates population diversity distribution abundance selected groups organisms regions future compilation data show far knowledge moved undoubtedly much research marine biodiversity would carried last decade without census would lacked global reach access data technologies made census census steering committee received international cosmos prize recognition decade
