polypharmacy polypragmasia umbrella term describe simultaneous use multiple medicines patient term polypharmacy often defined regularly taking five medicines standard definition term also used context person prescribed medications polypharmacy may consequence multiple longterm conditions also known multimorbidity common people cases excessive number medications time worrisome especially people older many chronic health conditions increases risk adverse event many cases polypharmacy avoided appropriate polypharmacy practices encouraged decrease risk adverse appropriate polypharmacy defined practice prescribing person multiple conditions complex health needs ensuring medications prescribed optimized follow best evidence prevalence polypharmacy estimated depending definition used age group studied geographic polypharmacy continues grow importance aging populations many countries experiencing fast growth older population years growth result babyboomer generation getting older increased life expectancy result ongoing improvement health care services adults intellectual disability also exposed level polypharmacy increasing past decades research usa shows percentage patients greater yearsold using medications increased similarly research uk found number older people taking plus medication quadrupled nearly polypharmacy necessarily illadvised many instances lead negative outcomes poor treatment effectiveness often harmful helpful presenting much risk little benefit therefore health professionals consider situation requires monitoring review validate whether medications still necessary concerns polypharmacy include increased adverse drug reactions drug interactions prescribing cascade higher prescribing cascade occurs person prescribed drug experiences adverse drug effect misinterpreted new medical condition patient prescribed another polypharmacy also increases burden medication taking particularly older people associated medication polypharmacy often associated decreased quality life including decreased mobility patient factors influence number medications patient prescribed include high number chronic conditions requiring complex drug regimen systemic factors impact number medications patient prescribed include patient multiple prescribers multiple pharmacies may communicate whether advantages polypharmacy taking single medications monotherapy outweigh disadvantages risks depends upon particular combination diagnosis involved given use multiple drugs even fairly straightforward illnesses indicator poor treatment necessarily overmedication moreover well accepted pharmacology impossible accurately predict side effects clinical effects combination drugs without studying particular combination drugs test subjects knowledge pharmacologic profiles individual drugs question assure accurate prediction side effects combinations drugs effects also vary among individuals genomespecific pharmacokinetics therefore deciding whether reduce list medications deprescribe often simple requires experience judgment practicing clinician clinician must weigh pros cons keeping patient medication however thoughtful wise review ideal often happen owing problems poorly handled care transitions poor continuity care usually siloed information overworked physicians clinical staff interventionism polypharmacy typically regarded undesirable prescription multiple medications appropriate therapeutically beneficial appropriate polypharmacy described prescribing complex multiple conditions way necessary medicines used based best available evidence time preserve safety polypharmacy clinically indicated chronic conditions example diabetes mellitus discontinued evidence benefit prescribed drugs longer outweighs potential harm described often certain medications interact others positive way specifically intended prescribed together achieve greater effect single agents alone particularly prominent field anesthesia pain management atypical agents antiepileptics antidepressants muscle relaxants nmda antagonists medications combined typical analgesics opioids prostaglandin inhibitors nsaids others practice pain management drug known analgesia sparing effect people greatest risk negative polypharmacy consequences include elderly people people psychiatric conditions patients intellectual developmental people taking five drugs time multiple physicians pharmacies people recently hospitalized people concurrent people live rural communities people inadequate access impaired vision dexterity marginalized populations may greater degrees polypharmacy occur frequently younger age uncommon people dependent addicted substances enter remain state polypharmacy prescription drug misusers reported using multiple note however term polypharmacy variants generally refer legal drug use asprescribed even used negative critical context measures taken limit polypharmacy truly legitimate appropriate needs emerging area research frequently called deprescribing reducing number medications part clinical review effective healthcare clinical pharmacists perform drug therapy reviews teach physicians patients drug safety polypharmacy well collaborating physicians patients correct polypharmacy problems similar programs likely reduce potentially deleterious consequences polypharmacy adverse drug events nonadherence hospital admissions drugdrug interactions geriatric syndromes programs hinge upon patients doctors informing pharmacists medications prescribed well herbal overthecounter substances supplements occasionally interfere prescriptiononly medication staff residential aged care facilities range views attitudes towards polypharmacy cases may contribute increase medication risk polypharmacy increases age although evidence may decrease slightly age poorer health strong predictor polypharmacy age although unclear whether polypharmacy causes poorer health polypharmacy used poorer appears possible risk factors polypharmacy may different younger middleaged people compared older use polypharmacy correlated use potentially inappropriate medications potentially inappropriate medications generally taken mean agreed upon expert consensus beers criteria medications generally inappropriate older adults risks outweigh examples include urinary anticholinergics used treat incontinence associated risks anticholinergics include constipation blurred vision dry mouth impaired cognition many older people living long term care facilities experience polypharmacy underprescribing potentially indicated medicines use high risk medicines also polypharmacy associated increased risk falls elderly certain medications well known associated risk falls including cardiovascular psychoactive evidence risk falls increases cumulatively number although often practical achieve withdrawing medicines associated falls risk halve individuals risk future falls every medication potential adverse sideeffects every drug added additive risk sideeffects also medications interactions substances including foods medications herbal older adults potentially risk major drugdrug older adults higher risk drugdrug interaction due increased number medications prescribed metabolic changes occur new drug prescribed risk interactions increases exponentially doctors pharmacists aim avoid prescribing medications interact often adjustments dose medications need made avoid interactions example warfarin interacts many medications supplements cause lose pill burden number pills tablets capsules common dosage forms person takes regular basis along associated efforts increase number like storing organizing consuming understanding various medications ones regimen use individual medications growing faster pill recent study found older adults long term care taking average tablets every poor medical adherence common challenge among individuals increased pill burden subject also increases possibility adverse medication reactions side effects drugdrug interactions high pill burden also associated increased risk hospitalization medication errors increased costs pharmaceuticals treatment adverse events finally pill burden source dissatisfaction many patients family high pill burden commonly associated antiretroviral drug regimens control also seen patient instance adults multiple common chronic conditions diabetes hypertension lymphedema hypercholesterolemia osteoporosis constipation inflammatory bowel disease clinical depression may prescribed dozen different medications combination multiple drugs associated increased risk adverse drug reducing pill burden recognized way improve medication compliance also referred adherence done deprescribing risks benefits weighed considering whether continue includes drugs bisphosphonates osteoporosis often taken indefinitely although evidence use five ten patient educational programs reminder messages medication packaging use memory tricks also seen improve adherence reduce pill burden several include associating medications mealtimes recording dosage box storing medication special place leaving plain sight living room putting prescription sheet development applications also shown benefit use polypill regimen combination pill hiv treatment opposed multipill regimen also alleviates pill burden increases selection longacting active ingredients shortacting ones may also reduce pill burden instance ace inhibitors used management hypertensionmedical citation needed

captopril may appropriate way limit pill burdenmedical citation needed common intervention help people struggling polypharmacy deprescribing confused medication simplification attempt reduce number medicines rather reduce number dose forms administration deprescribing refers reducing number medications person prescribed includes identification discontinuance medications benefit longer outweighs elderly patients commonly done patient becomes frail treatment focus needs shift preventative deprescribing feasible effective many settings including residential care communities preventative measure

comorbid health conditions dementia matchd tool available specifically people dementia also cautions polypharmacy complex medication barriers faced physicians people taking medications made challenging apply deprescribing strategies physicians include fear consequences deprescribing prescribers confidence skills knowledge deprescribe reluctance alter medications prescribed specialists feasibility deprescribing lack access patients clinical notes complexity multiple patients prescribed require medication barriers include attitudes beliefs medications inability communicate physicians fears uncertainties surrounding deprescribing influence physicians family barriers include health professionals carers residential care believing medicines people multiple longterm conditions multimorbidity polypharmacy deprescribing represents complex challenge clinical guidelines usually developed single conditions cases tools guidelines like beers criteria stoppstart could used safely clinicians patients might benefit stopping medication need clarity much clinicians beyond guidelines responsibility need take could help prescribing deprescribing complex cases factors help clinicians tailor decisions individual access detailed data people care including backgrounds personal medical goals discussing plans stop medicine already first prescribed good relationship involves mutual trust regular discussions progress furthermore longer appointments prescribing deprescribing would allow time explain process deprescribing explore related concerns support making right effectiveness specific interventions improve appropriate use polypharmacy pharmaceutical care computerised decision support due low quality current evidence surrounding high quality evidence needed make conclusions
