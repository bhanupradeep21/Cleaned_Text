pneumocystis pneumonia pcp also known pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia pjp form pneumonia caused yeastlike fungus pneumocystis pneumocystis specimens commonly found lungs healthy people although usually cause however source opportunistic infection cause lung infections people weak immune system predisposing health conditions pcp seen people hivaids account pcp cases using medications suppress immune system people cancer autoimmune inflammatory conditions chronic lung signs symptoms may develop several days may include shortness breath andor difficulty breathing gradual onset fever drynonproductive cough weight loss night chills uncommonly infection may progress involve visceral organs liver spleen pneumothorax wellknown complication also condition similar acute respiratory distress syndrome ards may occur patients severe pneumocystis pneumonia individuals may require risk pcp increases tcell levels less cellsμl immunosuppressed individuals manifestations infection highly disease attacks interstitial fibrous tissue lungs marked thickening alveolar septa alveoli leading significant hypoxia fatal treated aggressively situation lactate dehydrogenase levels increase gas exchange compromised oxygen less able diffuse blood leading hypoxia along high arterial carbon dioxide levels stimulates hyperventilatory effort thereby causing dyspnea breathlessnesscitation

including commensal trichomonas tenax trichomonas vaginalis tritrichomonas foetus exhibit amoeboid form without flagellum makes difficult identify amoeboid transformation argument favor deleterious action nevertheless remains diagnosis confirmed characteristic appearance chest xray arterial oxygen level strikingly lower would expected symptoms gallium scans also useful diagnosis abnormal cases often positive chest xray becomes abnormal chest xray typically shows widespread pulmonary infiltrates ct scan may show pulmonary cysts confused cystforms pathogencitation needed chest xray increased opacification whiteness lower lungs chest radiographs two patients show ground glass opacities left xray shows much subtle groundglass appearance right xray shows much gross groundglass appearance

inflammation causes exacerbation symptoms days treatment begins steroids used far commonly used medication trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole patients unable tolerate treatment due allergies medications used alone combination include pentamidine trimetrexate dapsone atovaquone primaquine pafuramidine maleate investigation clindamycin treatment usually period days pentamidine less often used major limitation high frequency side effects include acute pancreatic inflammation kidney failure liver toxicity decreased white blood cell count rash fever low blood sugarcitation needed disease pcp

disease acts like infection epidemiology presentday therapeutic measures seem definite pneumocystis pneumonia pneumocystis orthographically correct one uses genus name per se uses common noun based reason example group streptococcus group streptococcus valid synonyms pcp include pneumocystis osis pneumocystis iasis interstitial plasma cell older species name pneumocystis carinii applies pneumocystis species found still common usage result pneumocystis pneumonia pcp also known pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia incorrectly pneumocystis carinii regarding nomenclature name pneumocystis pneumonia pcp changed p carinii pneumonia p jirovecii pneumonia first asked whether pjp replace pcp however short name pcp already well established among physicians managed patients pneumocystis
