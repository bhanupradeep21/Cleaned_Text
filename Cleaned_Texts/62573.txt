digoxin better known digitalis sold brand name lanoxin among others medication used treat various heart frequently used atrial fibrillation atrial flutter heart digoxin one oldest medications used field cardiology works increasing myocardial contractility increasing stroke volume blood pressure reducing heart rate somewhat extending time frame digoxin taken mouth injection digoxin half life approximately hours given average doses patients normal renal function excreted mostly unchanged urine common side effects include breast enlargement side effects generally due excessive side effects may include loss appetite nausea trouble seeing confusion irregular greater care required older people poor kidney unclear whether use pregnancy digoxin cardiac glycoside family first isolated foxglove plant digitalis world health organizations list essential commonly prescribed medication united states million common indications digoxin atrial fibrillation atrial flutter rapid ventricular especially older less active though beta blockers andor calcium channel blockers may preferred patients younger active ones without heart failure hemodynamic early observational studies showed increased risk death patients taking digoxin despite attempt allow risk factors death socalled propensity score however systematic reviews focusing randomised controlled trials digoxin ensured similarity patients digoxin showed difference evidence suggested increased mortality patients taking digoxin due worse heart disease taking cardiac arrhythmias may also occur patients prescribed digoxin alongside thiazides loop digitalis ie extracts including digoxin plant genus digitalis first drug used treat dropsy swollen symptom heart failure following discovery william alongside diuretics mainstay treatment heart failure century since introduction drugs better outcomes fewer adverse effects generally used heart failure associated atrial fibrillation rapid ventricular certain circumstances may used specialist guidance addition instead recommended firstline treatments ace inhibitor beta blocker mineralocorticoid antagonist inhibitor effective tolerated digoxin also used intrafetally amniotically abortions late second trimester third trimester pregnancy typically causes fetal demise measured cessation cardiac activity within hours occurrence adverse drug reactions common owing narrow therapeutic index margin effectiveness toxicity gynaecomastia enlargement breast tissue mentioned many textbooks side effect thought due estrogenlike steroid moiety digoxin systematically sought evidence equivocal combination increased atrial arrhythmogenesis inhibited atrioventricular av conduction example paroxysmal atrial tachycardia av block socalled pat block said pathognomonic diagnostic digoxin digoxin lead cardiac arrhythmias given thiazides loop diuretics coadministration digoxin drugs thiazides loop diuretics cause hypokalemia low serum levels potassium blood exacerbates potential cardiac arrythmias low levels potassium reduces amount k atpase pump increase calcium levels much leads also cause visual disturbances well dizziness fainting several drugs associated adrs concommitant use include verapamil amiodarone quinidine tetracycline erythromycin overdose usual supportive measures needed arrhythmias prove troublesome malignant hyperkalemia occurs inexorably rising potassium level due paralysis cell membranebound atpasedependent nak pumps specific antidote antidigoxin antibody fragments digoxin trade names digibind mechanism action drugs digibind digifab used adverse events occur use digoxin fab regions antibodies created digoxin expedite excretion drug urine therefore amount digoxin body decreases quickly gets excreted rapidly digoxins primary mechanism action involves inhibition sodium potassium adenosine triphosphatase nak atpase mainly inhibition causes increase intracellular sodium levels resulting decreased activity sodiumcalcium exchanger normally imports three extracellular sodium ions cell transports one intracellular calcium ion cell reversal exchanger triggered increase intracellular sodium results increase intracellular calcium concentration available contractile proteins increased calcium concentrations lead binding calcium troponin c results increased inotropy increased intracellular calcium lengthens phase phase cardiac action potential leads decrease heart increased amounts also leads increased storage calcium sarcoplasmic reticulum causing corresponding increase release calcium action potential leads increased contractility force contraction heart without increasing heart energy expenditurecitation needed inhibition sodium pump may also improve baroreceptor sensitivity heart failure may explain neurohormonal effects digoxin also important parasympathetic effects particularly atrioventricular increase magnitude myocardial contractility duration contraction slightly increased use antiarrhythmic drug comes direct indirect parasympathetic stimulating properties vagus nerve stimulation slows conduction av node increasing refractory period cardiac myocytes slowed av node gives ventricles time fill contracting negative chronotropic effect synergistic direct effect cardiac pacemaker cells arrhythmia affected pumping function heart improves owing improved filling overall heart rate decreased stroke volume increased resulting net increase blood pressure leading increased tissue perfusion causes myocardium work efficiently optimized hemodynamics improved ventricular function curve electrical effects include brief initial increase action potential followed decrease k conductance increases due increased intracellular amounts ions refractory period atria ventricles decreased increases sinoatrial av nodes less negative resting membrane potential made leading increased irritability conduction velocity increases atria decreases av node effect upon purkinje fibers ventricles negligible automaticity also increased atria av node purkinje fibers ecg changes seen people taking digoxin include increased pr interval due decreased av conduction shortened qt interval also wave may inverted accompanied st depression may cause av junctional rhythm ectopic beats bigeminy resulting ventricular tachycardia fibrillation digoxin also receptor muscarinic digoxin usually given orally also given iv injection urgent situations iv injection slow heart rhythm monitored iv therapy may better tolerated less nausea digoxin long distribution halflife cardiac tissue delay onset action number hours halflife hours patients normal renal function digoxin given daily usually μg μg dosescitation needed digoxin elimination mainly renal excretion involves pglycoprotein leads significant clinical interactions pglycoprotein inhibitor drugs examples commonly used patients heart problems include spironolactone verapamil amiodarone patients decreased kidney function halflife considerably longer along decrease vd volume distribution calling reduction dose switch different glycoside digitoxin available united states much longer elimination halflife around seven days eliminated livercitation needed effective plasma levels vary depending medical indication congestive heart failure levels ngml recommendation based post hoc analysis prospective trials suggesting higher levels may associated increased mortality rates heart rate control atrial fibrillation plasma levels less defined generally titrated goal heart rate typically digoxin levels considered therapeutic heart rate control ngml suspected toxicity ineffectiveness digoxin levels monitored plasma potassium levels also need closely controlled see side effects quinidine verapamil amiodarone increase plasma levels digoxin displacing tissue binding sites depressing renal digoxin clearance plasma digoxin must monitored carefully coadministeredcitation needed study looked see digoxin affected men women differently found digoxin reduce deaths overall result less hospitalization women took digoxin died frequently women took placebo digoxin increased risk death women difference death
