genetic purging reduction frequency deleterious allele caused increased efficiency natural selection prompted purging occurs many deleterious alleles express harmful effects homozygous present two copies inbreeding related individuals mate produce offspring likely homozygous deleterious alleles appear often making individuals less fit genetically ie pass fewer copies genes future generations put another way natural selection removes inbred children offspring deleterious alleles gene pool purging deleterious alleles purging reduces overall number recessive deleterious alleles decline mean fitness caused inbreeding inbreeding depression fitness term purge sometimes used selection deleterious alleles general way would avoid ambiguity use purifying selection general context reserve purging strict meaning defined deleterious alleles segregating populations diploid organisms remarkable trend least partially recessive means occur homozygosis double copies reduce fitness twice occur heterozygosis single copy words part potential deleterious effect hidden heterozygosis expressed homozygosis selection efficient occur homozygosis since inbreeding increases probability homozygous increases fraction potential deleterious effect expressed therefore exposed selection causes increase selective pressure partially recessive deleterious alleles known purging course also causes reduction fitness known inbreeding depression purging reduce average frequency deleterious alleles across genome value expected noninbred although reduction usually compensate negative effects several beneficial consequences fitness consequence reduction socalled inbreeding load means purging inbreeding expected less harmful immediate consequence reduction actual inbreeding depression fitness due

standard measure inbreeding gives probability given neutral locus individual inherited two copies gene common ancestor ie probability homozygous descent simple conditions f easily computed terms population size genealogical information f often denoted using lowercase f confused coancestry coefficient however prediction fitness decline rarely applies since derived assuming selection fitness precisely target trait natural selection thus wrights inbreeding coefficient f neutral loci apply deleterious alleles unless inbreeding increases fast change gene frequency governed random sampling ie genetic drift therefore decline fitness predicted using instead standard inbreeding coefficient f purged inbreeding coefficient g gives probability homozygous descent partially recessive deleterious

homozygosis average purged inbreeding coefficient approximated using recurrent expression also predictive equations used genealogical information example genetic purging consider large population recessive lethal alleles segregating low frequency many loci individual carries average one alleles although individuals carry least one lethal alleles almost none carry two copies lethal therefore since lethals considered completely recessive ie harmless heterozygosis cause almost deaths assume population size reduces small value say remains small many generations inbreeding increases probability homozygous one lethal alleles also increases causing fitness decline however lethals begin occur homozygosis natural selection begins purging figure right gives expected decline fitness
