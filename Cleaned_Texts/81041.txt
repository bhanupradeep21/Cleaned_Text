medicine nebulizer american nebuliser british drug delivery device used administer medication form mist inhaled lungs nebulizers commonly used treatment asthma cystic fibrosis copd respiratory diseases disorders use oxygen compressed air ultrasonic power break solutions suspensions small aerosol droplets inhaled mouthpiece device aerosol mixture gas solid liquid particles various asthma guidelines global initiative asthma guidelines gina british guidelines management asthma canadian pediatric asthma consensus guidelines united states guidelines diagnosis treatment asthma recommend metered dose inhalers place nebulizerdelivered european respiratory society acknowledge although nebulizers used hospitals home suggest much use may recent evidence shows nebulizers effective metereddose inhalers mdis mdi spacer may offer advantages children acute findings refer specifically treatment asthma efficacy nebulisers generally copd copd especially assessing exacerbations lung attacks evidence indicate mdi spacer delivered medicine effective administration medicine european respiratory society highlighted risk relating droplet size reproducibility caused selling nebulizer devices separately nebulized solution found practice could vary droplet size changing inefficient nebulizer system highly efficient two advantages attributed nebulizers compared mdis spacers inhalers ability deliver larger dosages faster rate especially acute asthma however recent data suggests actual lung deposition rates addition another trial found mdi spacer lower required dose clinical result compared nebulizer see clark et al beyond use chronic lung disease nebulizers may also used treat acute issues like inhalation toxic substances one example treatment inhalation toxic hydrofluoric acid hf calcium gluconate firstline treatment hf exposure skin using nebulizer calcium gluconate delivered lungs aerosol counteract toxicity inhaled hf vapors lung deposition characteristics efficacy aerosol depend largely particle droplet size generally smaller particle greater chance peripheral penetration retention however fine particles μm diameter chance avoiding deposition altogether exhaled task group lung dynamics concerned mainly hazards inhalation environmental toxins proposed model deposition particles lung suggested particles μm diameter likely deposit mouth throat μm diameter transition mouth airway deposition occurs particles smaller μm diameter deposit frequently lower airways appropriate pharmaceutical nebulizing processes modeled using computational fluid commonly used nebulizers jet nebulizers also called jet nebulizers connected tubing supply compressed gas usually compressed air oxygen flow high velocity liquid medicine turn aerosol inhaled patient currently seems tendency among physicians prefer prescription pressurized metered dose inhaler pmdi patients instead jet nebulizer generates lot noise often db use less portable due greater weight however jet nebulizers commonly used hospitals patients difficulty using inhalers serious cases respiratory disease severe asthma main advantage jet nebulizer related low operational cost patient needs inhale medicine daily basis use pmdi rather expensive today several manufacturers also managed lower weight jet nebulizer half kilogram one half pounds therefore started label portable device compared competing inhalers nebulizers noise heavy weight still biggest draw back jet medical company boehringer ingelheim also invented device named respimat soft mist inhaler new technology provides metered dose user liquid bottom inhaler rotated clockwise degrees hand adding build tension spring around flexible liquid container user activates bottom inhaler energy spring released imposes pressure flexible liquid container causing liquid spray nozzles thus forming soft mist inhaled device features gas propellant need batterypower operate average droplet size mist measured micrometers could indicate potential efficiency problems inhaled medicine reach lungs subsequent trials proven case due low velocity mist soft mist inhaler fact higher efficiency compared conventional arguments launched towards european respiratory society ers clarifyexpand definition nebulizer new soft mist inhaler technical terms could classified hand driven nebulizer hand driven ultrasonic wave nebulizers invented new type portable nebulizer technology inside ultrasonic wave nebulizer electronic oscillator generate high frequency ultrasonic wave causes mechanical vibration piezoelectric element vibrating element contact liquid reservoir high frequency vibration sufficient produce vapor create aerosols ultrasonic vibration instead using heavy air compressor weight around grams oz another advantage ultrasonic vibration almost silent examples modern type nebulizers omron beurer nebulizer new significant innovation made nebulizer market around creation ultrasonic vibrating mesh technology vmt technology meshmembrane laser drilled holes vibrates top liquid reservoir thereby pressures mist fine droplets holes technology efficient vibrating piezoelectric element bottom liquid reservoir thereby shorter treatment times also achieved old problems found ultrasonic wave nebulizer much liquid waste undesired heating medical liquid also solved new vibrating mesh nebulizers available vmt nebulizers include pari respironics beurer nebulizer aerogen price ultrasonic vmt nebulizers higher models using previous technologies manufacturers continue also sell classic jet nebulizers accept medicine form liquid solution often loaded device upon use corticosteroids bronchodilators salbutamol albuterol usan often used sometimes combination ipratropium reason pharmaceuticals inhaled instead ingested order target effect respiratory tract speeds onset action medicine reduces side effects compared alternative intake usually aerosolized medicine inhaled tubelike mouthpiece similar inhaler mouthpiece however sometimes replaced face mask similar used inhaled anesthesia ease use young children elderly pediatric masks often shaped like animals fish dogs dragons make children less resistant nebulizer treatments many nebulizer manufacturers also offer pacifier attachments infants toddlers mouthpieces preferable patients able use since facemasks result reduced lung delivery aerosol losses use corticosteroid theoretically possible patients develop yeast infection mouth thrush hoarseness voice dysphonia although conditions clinically rare avoid adverse effects clinicians suggest person used nebulizer rinse mouth true bronchodilators however patients may still wish rinse mouths due unpleasant taste bronchodilating drugs first powered
