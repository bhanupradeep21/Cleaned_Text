affect infusion model aim theoretical model field human psychology developed social psychologist joseph paul forgas early attempts explain affect impacts ones ability process information key assertion aim effects affect tend exacerbated complex situations demand substantial cognitive processing simpler words situations become complicated unanticipated mood becomes influential driving evaluations responses forgas defined term affect infusion process whereby affectively loaded information exerts influence becomes incorporated judgmental process entering judges deliberations eventually coloring judgmental words process determines degree mood affect judgement according aim affect mood emotion exerts notable influence information processing resulting response behaviors well example person receives inordinately large electric bill respond differently relaxing stressfree day stuck traffic two hours latter circumstance person experience high levels affect infusion agitated state made worse upon seeing electric bill assumption aim effect generally occur strongly complexity situation increases highly complex situations exhibit number qualities amount effort needed process information whether situation familiar entirely new severely situation affects person common activities tend produce high affect infusion include choosing whether drink take drugs selecting getting know new partner explaining conflict allocating rewards according forgas varying levels affect infusion seen continuum four alternative processing strategies markers along continuum strategies represent different degrees severity mood exerts influence identifying strategies two important differentiating factors considered several factors related judgment target context judger influence processing strategy least intensive four direct access processing involves reproducing stored reaction repeating response given similar situation according aim influence mood cognition least severe type processing motivated processing usually involves specific targeted search strategies direct informational goal mind strategy also involves little influence mood individual question fairly clear idea information needs although higher continuum direct access processing heuristic processing assumes affective processing emotional processing occurs outside awareness people simply making sense emotional reactions happen thus affective experience provides people information including tendencies implicit judgments process also known affectasinformation also called systematic processing strategy involves elaborate cognitive processing appears highest continuum powerfully affected mood reason substantive processing apt infused affect mood affect stage cognition process attention encoding retrieval association taken whole forgas identified two overarching conditions mood likely affect information processing mood relatively complex sum many smaller emotional experiences single cause pinpointing realworld influence easy task scholars used aim examine number social phenomena variety results one area research involving aim concerns models role understanding individuals propensity risk taking since risky behavior trigger complex varied set emotional responses elation fear acceptance etc persons mood might expected play substantial unpredictable role choice take heavy risks person good mood might likely appraise risk positively willing accept consequences advance even bad mood could likely rebel cultural norms take risk anywaycitation needed relationship examined particular experiment attempting manipulate persons mood order produce infusion hypothesis risk taking tendency greater individuals happy mood sad participants experiment exposed one three priming movies happy sad neutral measured risktaking scale researchers divided sample two units separation one age old young mood valence happy neutral sad data confirm hypothesis younger older participants also confirmed aim legitimate instrument studying complexities mood another study examined aim relates specific type risk behavior gambling investigated mood affects individuals sustained inclination gamble especially among nonregular researchers separated regular nonregular gamblers measured moods affected experiences gaming floor specifically expected nonregular gamblers good mood persistent nonregular gamblers bad mood gambling new unfamiliar experience complete bright lights colors feature average casino requires great deal information processing making especially unattractive someone bad mood research confirmed notion addition used positively identify depression causal factor addictive gambling casino become familiar environment striving deeper understanding aim scholars examined different types behavior expected affect mood emotion strongly influences information means exact science behavioral consequences affect usually indirect varied able show affective states subtle cognitively mediated influence ways people perform inhibit complex strategic behaviors p words emotion influences thinking behavior subtle ways person strongly positive mood may confident use direct interpersonal behaviors would bad mood may feel untouchable due many good things happened approach complex situations increased level assurance research shown effect becomes greater situation becomes complex sense aim potential instrument propaganda campaigns promote link positive affect desired behavior example many failed attempts dissuade adolescents smoking involved morbid gloomy advertisements serve depress viewers according aim messages establish comfortable atmosphere focus consequences smoking benefits smoking would probably successful along clearer understanding effect mood persons information processing aim also provides guide researchers design experiments investigate effect sending persuasive messages subjects one important area research involves concept mood congruence results mood compare mood found mood congruence occurs person exhibits positive relationship mood dependent variable essentially strength mood increases decreases performance measured variable increases decreases correspondingly conversely mood incongruence occurs person exhibits negative relationship mood dependent variable thus mood increases performance decreases vice distinction used study relationship moods personal goals mood congruent mood generally positive relationship goal motivation presents major opportunity designers public health according line thought establishing positive mood state within emotional feel message psychologically connecting state desired behavior would critical messages efficacy aim also provided useful insights fields consumer research aim helped explain males females differ processing advertising happy sad mood states httpsenwikipediaorgwikiaffectinfusionmodel
