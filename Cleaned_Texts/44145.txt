deletion syndrome also known syndrome pms genetic disorder caused deletions rearrangements q terminal end long arm chromosome abnormal genetic variation region presents significant manifestations phenotype typical terminal deletion may diagnosed deletion syndrome disagreement among researchers exact definition deletion developmental synaptopathies consortium defines pms caused mutations definition appears exclude terminal requirement include definition supported many first described deletion prototypical terminal deletion uncovered karyotype analysis many terminal interstitial deletions small availability dna microarray technology revealing multiple genetic problems simultaneously diagnostic tool choice falling cost whole exome sequencing eventually whole genome sequencing
