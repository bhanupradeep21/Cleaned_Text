progress report preventative treatments developed prevention management wide variety diseases conditions including type type ii diabetes congestive heart failure obesity alzheimers disease dementia asthma substance abuse adhd hypertension anxiety depression several digital therapeutics often employ strategies rooted cognitive behavioral although digital therapeutics employed numerous ways term broadly defined treatment therapy utilizes digital often internetbased health technologies spur changes patient use digital products improve health outcomes dates far back term use since around first mention term peerreviewed research publication dr cameron sepah formally defined field digital therapeutics evidencebased behavioral treatments delivered online increase accessibility effectiveness

patients beginning digital therapeutics alliance states digital therapeutics dtx deliver evidencebased therapeutic interventions patients driven high quality software programs prevent manage treat broad spectrum physical mental behavioral digital therapeutics different wellness apps medication reminders require rigorous clinical evidence substantiate intended use impact disease state often used preventive measure patients risk developing serious conditions instance patient prediabetes may prescribed digital therapeutics method change diet behavior could otherwise lead diabetes digital therapeutics also used treatment option existing conditions instance patient type ii diabetes use digital therapeutics manage disease methodology uses variety digital implements help manage monitor prevent illnesses atrisk patients include mobile devices technologies apps sensors desktop computers various internet things implements collect wide variety data ranging big small digital therapeutics theoretically collect high volume data variety sources also collects smaller data capturing personalized physiological parameters behavior patterns social geographical patterns recorded multiple digital digital therapeutics used variety conditions single methodology used practice digital therapeutics many approaches use methods based upon cognitive behavioral therapy spur patients make lifestyle changes reinforced gamification peer support cases telehealth coaching psychotherapy method used manage improve outcomes numerous conditions including type ii diabetes alzheimers disease dementia congestive heart failure chronic obstructive pulmonary disease asthma lung disease obesity substance abuse adhd insomnia hypertension anxiety depression methodologies simple psychoeducation sending notifications designed alter behavior patients risk obesity complex administering ingestible radio tag communicates external sensor monitor efficacy given diabetes obesity prevention management major focus field digital connected devices like insulin pumps blood glucose meters wearable devices send data unified system therapy also uses selfreported data like diet lifestyle also often used monitor potential heart lung conditions change behaviors like smoking poor diet lack digital therapeutics also used treat patients psychological neurological symptoms example patients disorders like adhd depression anxiety receive cognitive behavioral therapy via mobile one study looked efficacy avatarbased therapeutic interventions reduce depressive another study analyzed seven clinical trials demonstrate efficacy digital therapeutic significantly reducing blood preliminary study suggested mobile mindfulness app may able decrease acute stress improving general consensus among researchers field digital therapeutics discipline requires clinical data investigation fully variety studies conducted evaluate efficacy impact behavior change techniques utilize digital platform metaanalysis studies comprising total sample size participants researchers discovered digital therapeutics statistically small significant effect healthrelated behavior study also showed broader use theory behavior change techniques modes delivery especially regular notifications improved efficacy given individual studies also showed benefits patients instance diabetes prevention program using digital therapeutics saw participants lose average baseline body weight year years undergo reduction levels year another weight loss pilot program using digital therapeutics reported mean weight loss pounds baseline significant average drop systolic diastolic blood pressure mmhg mmhg respectively study also saw slight statistically insignificant drop total cholesterol ldl
