david grimaldi provided first description undescribed ant american museum novitates journal article naming sphecomyrma age fossils estimated million russian palaeoentomologist gennady dlussky elevated subfamily family level renaming sphecomyrmidae accommodate sphecomyrma fossil insects studied throughout soviet placement shortlived wilson new morphological evidence elevated family back subfamily level studied cretaceous ants put sphecomyrma however dlussky russian palaeoentomologist elena b fedoseeva retained classification sphecomyrma remained reasons first segments antenna short geniculate elbowed structure mandibles geniculate antennae allow brood food manipulation even sociality impossible classify sphecomyrma relatives ants despite authors notes cite study ants manipulate items antennae may implied apices feature found antenna may far away mandibles close distance apices mandibles would allow manipulation food antennation another issue whether metapleural gland present unique feature found despite previous claims made dlussky saying sphecomyrmines including sphecomyrma likely solitary confirmed existence metapleural gland newly collected fossils confirms sphecomyrma relatives definitely evidence dlussky eventually reinstated sphecomyrma subfamily members formicidae although sources published formally recognise sphecomyrminae family additional doubts surrounding nature sphecomyrma relatives emerged paper concluded fossil ants found cretaceous amber new jersey closer wasps ants quickly dismissed due overwhelming evidence supporting placement within formicidae fact authors cited unpublished cladograms disregarded key diagnostic traits synapomorphies found ants genus considered primitive within family body presents wasplike structure several antlike characteristics antlike characteristics however primitive compared modern ants thus intermediate primitive ants aculeate wasps presence metapleural gland nodiform structure resembling node segment

wasp instead exactly known group wasps ancestors sphecomyrma members family thynnidae particularly genus methocha strikingly similar sphecomyrma wilson placed genus closest tiphiidae among extant wasps later study published derived ants later clade recently ants including sphecomyrma considered evolved lineage within aculeate wasps study suggests sister group apoidea sister group lineage
