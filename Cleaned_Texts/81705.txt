neuroconstructivism theory states phylogenetic developmental processes interaction crucially ontogeny play vital role brain progressively sculpts gradually becomes specialized developmental time supporters neuroconstructivism annette karmiloffsmith argue innate modularity mind notion brain composed innate neural structures modules distinct evolutionarily established functions instead emphasis put innate domain relevant biases biases understood aiding learning directing attention modulelike structures therefore product experience innate biases neuroconstructivism therefore seen bridge jerry fodors psychological nativism jean piagets theory cognitive development neuroconstructivism arisen direct rebuttal psychologists argue innate modularity modularity brain would require prespecified pattern synaptic connectivity within cortical microcircuitry specific neural instead annette karmiloffsmith suggested microconnectivity brain emerges gradual process ontogenetic proponents modular theory might misled seemingly normal performances individuals exhibit learning disability tests may appear cognitive functioning may impaired specified areas may functional flaw test many standardized tasks used assess extent damage within brain measure underlying causes instead showing static endstate complex alternative explanation account normal test scores would ability individual compensate

chronic stress well mindset behaviour never resolved power neuroplasticity allows modify shape function brain throughout lifespan brain limited constraint within body brain receives input receptors body eg somatosensory system visual system auditory system etc receptors provide brain source information result manipulate brains neural activation patterns thus structure leading constraining
