biologist scientist conducts research biologists interested studying life earth whether individual cell multicellular organism community interacting usually specialize particular branch eg molecular biology zoology evolutionary biology specific research focus eg studying malaria biologists involved basic research aim advancing knowledge natural conduct research using scientific method empirical method testing discoveries may applications specific purpose biotechnology goal developing medically useful products modern times biologists one academic degrees bachelors degree plus advanced degree like masters degree like scientists biologists found working different sectors economy academia nonprofits private industry francesco redi founder biology recognized one greatest biologists robert hooke english natural philosopher coined term cell suggesting plant structures resemblance honeycomb charles darwin alfred wallace independently formulated theory evolution natural selection described detail darwins book origin species published darwin proposed features living things including humans shaped natural processes descent accumulated modification leading divergence long periods time theory evolution current form affects almost areas separately gregor mendel formulated principles inheritance became basis modern genetics james watson francis crick described basic structure dna genetic material expressing life building work maurice wilkins rosalind franklin suggested structure dna double helix ian wilmut led research group first cloned mammal adult somatic cell finnish dorset lamb named undergraduate degree biology typically requires coursework molecular cellular biology development ecology genetics microbiology anatomy physiology botany additional requirements may include physics chemistry general organic biochemistry calculus statistics students aspire researchoriented career usually pursue graduate degree master doctorate eg phd whereby would receive training research head based apprenticeship model existence since students graduate programs often receive specialized training particular subdiscipline biologists work basic research formulate theories devise experiments advance human knowledge life including topics evolution biochemistry molecular biology neuroscience cell biology biologists typically conduct laboratory experiments involving animals plants microorganisms biomolecules however small part biological research also occurs outside laboratory may involve natural observation rather experimentation example botanist may investigate plant species present particular environment ecologist might study forest area recovers fire biologists work applied research use instead accomplishments gained basic research knowledge particular fields applications example applied research may used develop new pharmaceutical drugs treatments medical diagnostic tests biological scientists conducting applied research product development private industry may required describe research plans results nonscientists position veto approve ideas scientists must consider business effects work swift advances knowledge genetics organic molecules spurred growth field biotechnology transforming industries biological scientists work biological scientists manipulate genetic material animals plants attempting make organisms including humans productive resistant disease basic applied research biotechnological processes recombining dna led production important substances including human insulin growth hormone many substances previously available large quantities produced biotechnological means substances useful treating diseases working various genome chromosomes associated genes projects isolate genes determine function work continues lead discovery genes associated specific diseases inherited health risks sickle cell anemia advances biotechnology created research opportunities almost areas biology commercial applications areas medicine agriculture environmental remediation biological scientists specialize study certain type organism specific activity although recent advances blurred traditional classificationswhy biologists typically work regular hours longer hours uncommon researchers may required work odd hours laboratories locations especially field depending nature research many biologists depend grant money fund research may pressure meet deadlines conform rigid grantwriting specifications preparing proposals seek new extended funding marine biologists encounter variety working conditions work laboratories others work research ships work underwater must practice safe diving working around sharp coral reefs hazardous marine life although marine biologists obtain specimens sea many still spend good deal time laboratories offices conducting tests running experiments recording results compiling data biologists usually exposed unsafe unhealthy conditions work dangerous organisms toxic substances laboratory must follow strict safety procedures avoid contamination many biological scientists botanists ecologists zoologists conduct field studies involve strenuous physical activity primitive living conditions biological scientists field may work warm cold climates kinds weather highest honor awarded biologists nobel prize physiology medicine awarded since royal swedish academy sciences another significant award crafoord prize biosciences established httpsenwikipediaorgwikibiologist
