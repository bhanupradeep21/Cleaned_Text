internal working model attachment psychological approach attempts describe development mental representations specifically worthiness self expectations others reactions self model result interactions primary caregivers become internalized therefore automatic john bowlby implemented model attachment theory order explain infants act accordance mental representations important aspect general attachment theory internal working models guide future behavior generate expectations attachment figures respond ones example parent rejecting childs need care conveys close relationships avoided general resulting maladaptive attachment styles influential figure idea internal working model attachment bowlby laid groundwork concept inspired psychoanalysis especially object relations theory recent research ethology evolution informationprocessing psychoanalytic theory idea inner representational world proposed freud well internalization relationships fairbairn winnicott according freud first schemata evolve experiences regarding need fulfilment via attachment argued resulting mental representation internal copy external world made memories thinking serves role experimental action fairbairn winnicott proposed early patterns relationships become internalized govern future however ethologicalevolutionary aspects theory received attention bowlby interested separation distress bonding animals noticed many infant behaviours organized around goal maintaining proximity proposed human infants like mammals must attachment motivationalbehavioural system enhances chances ainsworth observed motherinfant interaction came conclusion individual differences reaction separation could explained simple absence presence caregiver must result cognitive however bowlby developed attachment theory cognitive psychology still beginning neisser proposed theory mental representation based schemas later led development schema theory said scripts might base structure internal working term internal working model however coined quite early craik called internal working model elaborate modern version psychoanalytical idea internal essence claimed humans carry smallscale representation model reality potential actions within summary bowlby remodelled freud work relationship development terms newer fields research evolutionary biology ethology informationprocessing theory drawing craik idea representations formation use dynamic models piaget theory cognitive several hypothesized functions internal working model attachment terms evolutionary origins inherent functioning bowlby proposed proximityseeking behaviour evolved selection context survival healthy internal working model helps infant maintain proximity caregiver face threat especially important species prolonged periods development like humans due relative immaturity infant birth offspring manages maintain close relationship caregiver seeking proximity survival close emotional bond caregiver therefore crucial protection physical harm thus internal working model mediates regulation enforced via motivationalbehaviour system motivating infant caregiver seek specifically caregiving regulated behavioural processes complementary infant proximityseeking eg baby smiles adult feels reward adequate internal model representation self caregiver also serves adaptive function ensuring appropriate interpretation prediction well response craik especially emphasized organisms capable forming complex internal working models higher chances better internal working model simulate reality better individual capacity plan according bowlby individuals form models world self within models initially product specific experiences reality aid future attention perception interpretation world turn creates certain expectations possible future events allowing foresightful appropriate behaviour hence adequate representations self caregivers serves adaptive lastly infant sure availability attachment figure less prone fear due supportive presence secure base function caregiver makes exploration environment hence learning felt security primary goal working ainsworth researched secure base phenomenon strange situation procedure infant uses mother secure attachment system provides child sense security form base supports exploration environment hence securely attached child turn achieve balance intimacy corresponds balance attachment system serves function protection exploration system facilitates function attachment styles explained terms imbalance intimacy independence preoccupation one goals overriding chronic goal intimacy preoccupied children independence selfprotection dismissive children case fearful child conflicting chronic goal achieving intimacy independence time approachavoidance conflict due relative inflexibility comparison secure attachment internal working model functions largely outside conscious awareness subconscious aspects might especially important function selfprotection serve defence mechanism face contradicting models one operates within subconscious prevent threat self mostly case dismissiveavoidant attachment conflicting ideas caregiver loving neglecting cause defence mechanism downplaying need intimacy relying attachment figure emphasizing infants develop different types internal working models dependent two factors responsiveness accessibility parent worthiness self loved supported thus age three years infants developed several expectations attachment figures react need help start evaluate likely self worth support internalized representations self attachment figures relationships constructed result experiences primary caregivers guides individual expectations relationships throughout life subsequently influencing social behavior perception others development essentially four different internal working models defined based positive negative images self children feel securely attached seek parent secure base willing explore environment adulthood hold positive model self others therefore feeling comfortable intimacy autonomy contrary adults develop fearfulavoidant internal working model negative self negative others construct defense mechanisms order protect rejected others consequently avoid intimate relationships third category classified preoccupied model indicating combination negative selfevaluation appreciation others makes overly dependent environment finally dismissiveavoidant adults aim independence view valuable autonomous rarely open mainly rely due lack trust internal working models considered result generalized representations past events attachment figure thus forming internal working model child takes account past experiences caregiver well outcomes past attempts establish contact one important factor establishment generalized representations caregiver accordingly child whose caretaker exhibits high levels parental sensitivity responsiveness reliability likely develop positive internal working model self conversely frequent experiences unreliability neglect attachment figure foster emergence negative internal working models self infants shown possess social cognitive capacities necessary form internal working models initial development may occur within first year established internal working models assumed remain largely consistent time developing primarily complexity internal working models young children may include representations past instances caregiver responsiveness availability older childrens adults internal working models may integrate advanced cognitive abilities imagination hypothetical future however changes internal representations attachment relationships occur likely happen upon repeated experiences incompatible internal working model place one way happen major periods meaning weeks months absence attachment prolonged absence childs expectation caregivers availability respond continuously violated results change behaviour toward caregiver upon reunion reflecting changes childs internal working model internal working models subject intergenerational transmission meaning parents internal working model patterns may passed indeed high correlations found security early infant attachment parental internal working model central aspect intergenerational transmission internal working models caretakers influenced behaviour toward children internal working models instance parent secure consistent internal working model likely interpret infants attachment signals appropriately whereas parent insecure internal working model less likely latter case infant might drawn construct negative working model self relationship furthermore parent negative poorly organized inconsistent working model might fail provide useful feedback parentinfant dyad relationships thus disrupting infants forming welladapted working model early result negative disorganized internal working model employed infant one mechanism attachment thus internal working models attachment transmitted joint reminiscing past events memories instance mothers securely attached tend communicate past events elaborate ways mothers securely reminiscing together past events securely attached mothers engage elaborate reasoning child thereby stimulating development elaborate coherent internal
