snoring vibration respiratory structures resulting sound due obstructed air movement breathing sleeping sound may soft loud unpleasant snoring sleep may sign first alarm obstructive sleep apnea osa research suggests snoring one factors sleep deprivation snoring result relaxation uvula soft tissues relax enough partially block airway resulting irregular airflow snoring attributed one following snoring known cause sleep deprivation snorers around well daytime drowsiness irritability lack focus decreased also suggested cause significant psychological social damage multiple studies reveal positive correlation loud snoring risk heart attack chance stroke though snoring often considered minor condition snorers sometimes experience severe impairment lifestyle betweensubjects trial armstrong et al discovered statistically significant improvement marital relations snoring surgically corrected confirmed evidence gall et cartwright fitzpatrick et studies associated loud snoring development carotid artery amatoury et demonstrated snoring vibrations transmitted carotid artery identifying possible mechanism snoringassociated carotid artery damage atherosclerotic plaque development researchers also found amplification snoring energy within carotid lumen certain frequencies adding scenario vibration carotid artery snoring also lends potential mechanism atherosclerotic plaque rupture consequently ischemic researchers also hypothesize loud snoring could create turbulence carotid artery blood generally speaking increased turbulence irritates blood cells previously implicated cause atherosclerosis plausibility initial evidence support snoring independent source carotid arterycardiovascular disease additional research required clarify far certain treatment completely stop snoring almost treatments snoring revolve around lessening breathing discomfort clearing blockage air passage medications usually helpful treating snoring symptoms though help control underlying causes nasal congestion allergic reactions doctors therefore often recommend lifestyle changes firstline treatment stop reason snorers advised lose weight stop fat pressing throat stop smoking smoking weakens clogs throat avoid alcohol sedative medications bedtime relax throat tongue muscles turn narrow sleep side prevent tongue blocking throat number treatment options also used stop snoring range overthecounter aids nasal sprays nasal strips nose clips lubricating sprays oral appliances antisnore clothing pillows unusual activities playing many overthecounter snoring treatments stopsnoring rings wristworn electrical stimulation bands scientific evidence support claims myofunctional therapy incorporates oropharyngeal tongue exercises reduces snoring adults based subjective questionnaires objective sleep studies snoring intensity reduced orthopedic pillows least intrusive option reducing snoring pillows designed support head neck way ensures jaw stays open slightly forward helps keep airways unrestricted possible turn leads small reduction snoring specially made dental appliances called mandibular advancement splints advance lower jaw slightly thereby pull tongue forward common mode treatment snoring appliances proven effective reducing snoring sleep apnea cases apnea mild mandibular advancement splints often tolerated much better cpap continuous positive airway pressure cpap machine often used control sleep apnea snoring associated relatively safe medical treatment keep airway open device pumps controlled stream air flexible hose mask worn nose mouth cpap usually applied cpap mask placed nose andor mouth air pressure required keep airway open delivered attached cpap machine like air compressor air cpap delivers generally normal air concentrated oxygen machine utilizes air pressure air splint keep airway open obstructive sleep apnea airway rear throat prone closure surgery also available method correcting social snoring procedures uvulopalatopharyngoplasty attempt widen airway removing tissues back throat including uvula pharynx surgeries quite invasive however risks adverse side effects dangerous risk enough scar tissue could form within throat result incisions make airway narrow prior surgery diminishing airspace velopharynx scarring individual trait difficult surgeon predict much person might predisposed scarring currently american medical association approve use lasers perform operations pharynx uvula radiofrequency ablation rfa relatively new surgical treatment snoring treatment applies radiofrequency energy heat soft tissue back throat soft palate uvula causing scarring tissue beneath skin healing results stiffening treated area procedure takes less one hour usually performed outpatient basis usually requires several treatment sessions radiofrequency ablation frequently effective reducing severity snoring often eliminate bipolar radiofrequency ablation technique used coblation tonsillectomy also used treatment snoring pillar procedure minimally invasive treatment snoring obstructive sleep apnea united states procedure fda indicated procedure three six dacron material used permanent sutures strips inserted soft palate using modified syringe local anesthetic procedure initially approved insertion three pillars soft palate found significant dosage response pillars appropriate candidatescitation needed result outpatient operation typically lasts minutes soft palate rigid possibly reducing instances sleep apnea snoring procedure addresses one common causes snoring sleep apnea vibration collapse soft palate soft part roof mouth factors contributing snoring sleep apnea conditions nasal airway enlarged tongue likely need combined treatments
