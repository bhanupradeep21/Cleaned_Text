ambulocetus functional legs could support animals bodyweight land holotype robust radius ulna forearm bones forearm measures cm length head radius somewhat triangular probably means forearm locked

streamlined hydrodynamic body ambulocetus pubic symphysis connecting two pubic bones base pelvis together indicates animal could support weight land modern cetacean pubis bone lacks functions anchor abdominal urogenital leg proportions ambulocetus similar otters seals american mammalogist alfred brazier howell predicted similar proportions transitional cetacean femur measures cm length similar presumably cursorial capable running mesonychian pachyaena archaeocete femora generally much shorter femoral head spherical maximum width cm similar indocetus much larger mesonychians trochanteric fossa supporting lateral rotator group hip quite deep femur seem supported particularly strong extensor flexor femoral condyles ambulocetus quite long compared archaeocetes mesonychians suggesting knee capable hyperflexion bending tibia overall similar mesonychians feet huge probably longer femur toes also relatively fourth digit measuring cm length fifth digit slightly shorter much less robust fourth phalanges toes short end convex like seals phalanges hands feet flattened may streamlined allow webbed robustness cheek teeth well cusp arrangement suggests involved crushing fact premolars molars involved crushing indicates ambulocetus required large area crushing biting large prey items similarly broad powerful snout makes unlikely pursuing small quick prey items would required narrow snout like dolphins gharials snout also long may precluded ability crush bone would reduced structural integrity tip anatomy cheek teeth resembles mesozoic marine reptiles fed armoured fish large fish reptiles ammonites teeth may used grip onto prey firmly therefore thewissen suggested ambulocetus likely ambush predator jaw adapted handle struggling prey unusually deep pterygoids potentially functioned dissipate force prey eyes ambulocetus placed top head similar crocodiles animals prefer keep body submerged eyes peeking water nasal canal bony walls extending throat much like crocodiles keep nasal airways open animal killing prey either drowning thrashing around pieces prey subsequently torn forceful thrashing head body motions feet anchoring crocodile place thewissen believed ambulocetus used similar feeding tactic though ambulocetus probably capable chewing unlike crocodiles ambulocetus may attacked large mammals approached waters edge semiaquatic mammals including early possibly herbivorous sirenians manatees dugong probably amphibious anthracobunids two seem rather common coasts indian subcontinent could mean regular prey items since ambulocetus found marine deposits animals would come drink possible hunted river deltas recorded kuldana formation ambulocetus probably went fish reptiles given opportunity though may agility commonly catch thewissen hypothesised ambulocetus dragpowered swimmer used huge feet primary propulsion mechanism much like modern river otters including giant otter species genera lontra lutra based length known tail vertebrae ambulocetus may inflexible tail would made tail inefficient primary propulsion mechanism due poorer lever arm modern cetaceans relatively short tail vertebrae ambulocetus therefore likely tail fluke nonetheless drag powered swimmers still powerful tails producing lift tails river otters size thoracolumbar series using river otters model ambulocetus pelvic alternating beats hindlimbs without engaging also undulated moved tail like sea otter pelvic paddling may done surface move slow moderate speeds higher speeds fully submerged undulation spine would become prominent though feet still would acted primary propulsion based pelvis robust forelimbs thewissen believed ambulocetus capable venturing onto land efficient remingtonocetids protocetids unclear latter two capable bearing
