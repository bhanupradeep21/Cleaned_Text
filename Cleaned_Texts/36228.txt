biological dispersal refers movement individuals animals plants fungi bacteria etc birth site breeding site natal dispersal well movement one breeding site another breeding dispersal dispersal also used describe movement propagules seeds spores technically dispersal defined movement potential lead gene act dispersal involves three phases departure transfer settlement different fitness costs benefits associated simply moving one habitat patch another dispersal individual consequences individual fitness also population dynamics population genetics species understanding dispersal consequences evolutionary strategies species level processes ecosystem level requires understanding type dispersal dispersal range given species dispersal mechanisms involved biological dispersal correlated population density range variations species location determines expansion biological dispersal may contrasted geodispersal mixing previously isolated populations whole biotas following erosion geographic barriers dispersal gene flow lieberman albert reis dispersal distinguished animal migration typically roundtrip seasonal movement although within population genetics literature terms migration dispersal often used interchangeably furthermore biological dispersal impacted limited different environmental conditions leads wide range consequences organisms present environment ability adapt dispersal methods environment organisms motile throughout lives others adapted move moved precise limited phases life cycles commonly called dispersive phase life cycle strategies organisms entire life cycles often predicated nature circumstances dispersive phases general two basic types due population density dispersal may relieve pressure resources ecosystem competition resources may selection factor dispersal mechanisms dispersal organisms critical process understanding geographic isolation evolution gene flow broad patterns current geographic distributions biogeography distinction often made natal dispersal individual often juvenile moves away place born breeding dispersal individual often adult moves away one breeding location breed elsewhere broadest sense dispersal occurs fitness benefits moving outweigh costs number benefits dispersal locating new resources escaping unfavorable conditions avoiding competing siblings avoiding breeding closely related individuals could lead inbreeding also number costs associated dispersal thought terms four main currencies energy risk time energetic costs include extra energy required move well energetic investment movement machinery eg wings risks include increased injury mortality dispersal possibility settling unfavorable environment time spent dispersing time often spent activities growth reproduction finally dispersal also lead outbreeding depression individual better adapted natal environment one ends social animals many birds mammals dispersing individual must find join new group lead loss social dispersal range refers distance species move existing population parent organism ecosystem depends critically ability individuals populations disperse one habitat patch another therefore biological dispersal critical stability ecosystems urban areas seen unique affects dispersal range dispersal abilities different organisms plant species urban environments largely provide novel dispersal vectors animals physical factors ie wind water etc played role dispersal centuries motor vehicles recently considered major dispersal vectors tunnels connect rural urban environments

led introduction different invasive species direct planting wind dispersal turn rivers next invasive plant species become vital dispersal vectors rivers could seen connect urban centers rural natural environments seeds invasive species shown transported rivers natural areas located downstream thus building upon already established dispersal distance contrast urban environments also provide limitations certain dispersal strategies human influence urbanization greatly affects layout landscapes leads limitation dispersal strategies many organisms changes largely exhibited pollinatorflowering plant relationships pollinators optimal range survival limited leads limited supply pollination sites subsequently leads less gene flow distantly separated populations turn decreasing genetic diversity likewise urbanization shown impact gene flow distinctly different species ex mice bats similar ways two species may different ecological niches living strategies urbanization limits dispersal strategies species leads genetic isolation populations resulting limited gene flow urbanization greater affect mice dispersal also led slight increase inbreeding among bat species ever evenly randomly distributed within across landscapes general species significantly vary across landscape association environmental features influence reproductive success population spatial patterns environmental features eg resources permit individuals escape unfavorable conditions seek new allows organism test new environments suitability provided within animals geographic range addition ability species disperse gradually changing environment could enable population survive extreme conditions ie climate change climate changes prey predators adapt survive poses problem many animals example southern rockhopper penguins able live thrive variety climates due penguins phenotypic however predicted respond dispersal adaptation explained due long life spans slow microevolution penguins subantarctic different foraging behavior subtropical waters would hard survive keeping fast changing climate behaviors took years dispersal barrier may result dispersal range species much smaller species distribution artificial example habitat fragmentation due human land use contrast natural barriers dispersal limit species distribution include mountain ranges rivers example separation ranges two species chimpanzee congo river hand human activities may also expand dispersal range species providing new dispersal methods eg ballast water ships many dispersed species become invasive like rats stinkbugs species also slightly positive effect human settlers like honeybees animals capable locomotion basic mechanism dispersal movement one place another locomotion allows organism test new environments suitability provided within animals range movements usually guided inherited behaviors formation barriers dispersal gene flow adjacent areas isolate populations either side emerging divide geographic separation subsequent genetic isolation portions ancestral population result allopatric speciation seed dispersal movement transport seeds away parent plant plants limited vegetative reproduction consequently rely upon variety dispersal vectors transport propagules including abiotic biotic vectors seeds dispersed away parent plant individually collectively well dispersed space time patterns seed dispersal determined large part specific dispersal mechanism important implications demographic genetic structure plant populations well migration patterns species interactions five main modes seed dispersal gravity wind ballistic water animals numerous animal forms nonmotile sponges bryozoans tunicates sea anemones corals oysters common either marine aquatic may seem curious plants successful stationary life land animals answer lies food supply plants produce food sunlight carbon generally abundant land water animals fixed place must rely surrounding medium bring food least close enough grab occurs threedimensional water environment much less abundance atmosphere marine aquatic invertebrates whose lives spent fixed bottom less anemones capable getting moving new location conditions warrant produce dispersal units may specialized buds motile sexual reproduction products even sort alteration generations certain cnidaria corals provide good example sedentary species achieve dispersion broadcast spawning corals reproduce releasing sperm eggs directly water release events coordinated lunar phase certain warm months corals one many species given reef release single several consecutive nights released eggs fertilized resulting zygote develops quickly multicellular planula motile stage attempts find suitable substratum settlement unsuccessful die fed upon zooplankton bottom dwelling predators anemones corals however untold millions produced succeed locating spots bare limestone settle transform growth polyp things favorable single polyp grows coral head budding new polyps form colony majority animals motile motile animals disperse spontaneous independent locomotive powers example dispersal distances across bird species depend flight hand small animals utilize existing kinetic energies environment resulting passive movement dispersal water currents especially associated physically small inhabitants marine waters known zooplankton term plankton comes greek πλαγκτον meaning wanderer drifter many animal species especially freshwater invertebrates able disperse wind transfer aid larger animals birds mammals fishes dormant eggs dormant embryos cases dormant adult stages tardigrades rotifers copepods able withstand desiccation adult dormant stages many taxa cladocera bryozoa hydra copepoda disperse dormant eggs embryos freshwater sponges usually special dormant propagules called gemmulae dispersal many kinds dispersal dormant stages able withstand desiccation low high temperature also action digestive enzymes transfer digestive tracts birds animals high concentration salts many kinds toxicants dormantresistant stages made possible longdistance dispersal one water body another broad distribution
