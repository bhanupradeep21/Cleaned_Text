palaeopropithecus primarily lived trees stay away predators well gain valuable resources survive properly trees palaeopropithecus long powerful arms legs significantly long fingers toes allow hang upside branches used swing branch branch travel across jungle madagascar long arms made much easier grab hold various trees branches making travel arboreal level easier laurie godrey states extinct sloth lemurs madagascar thus animals exhibit odd behavioral combination specialized leapers adept climbers long arms palaeopropithecus hook like extremities hands feet benefited palaeopropithecus enabling hook bodies onto foliage stabilize traversed trees palaeopropithecus average weighed pounds pounds weight heavier modern lemurs could potentially caused species fall hanging branches forcing species make sufficient use long arms legs palaeopropithecus eating habits different modern lemurs teeth palaeoprophithecus indicate animal folivorous eat leaves tougher eat hard foods nuts seeds helped fill generalized niche multiple food resources rely oncitation needed anatomy bones generally curved sixtydegree bend major bones legs arms bones much denser normal addition curved structure bones allowed palaeopropithecus easier capability swing branch branch curvature indicates sloth lemurs one suspensory clades mammals ever curved bones also helped gain torque speed allowing reach branches great distances relatively small body palaeopropithecus large compared modern lemur great degree curve smaller stature inverse relationship bigger animal smaller bone degree biomechanical theory suggests bone curvature palaeopropithecus hand bones linked functional demands organisms environment curved phalanges phalanges palaeopropithecus commonly associated gripping function needed

survive low quality highly fibrous staple fallback foods lifehistory strategy low maternal input slow returns unpredictable periodically stressful palaeopropithecus suspensory known strepsirhines would feed suspensory locomotion ground would ungainly probably quite rare except creep across ground one feeding tree next presented gaps forest canopy large hooklike claws optimal palaeopropithecus likely active behavior based morphology limbs engaged hanging upside four limbs slothlike posture high frequency indicated morphology lumbar high degree phalangeal regarded among suspensory clades mammals ever palaeopropithecus became extinct exactly clear however scientists suggested could recent five hundred years reason behind extinction several species palaeopropithecus attributed presence humans island madagascar earliest evidence dates back yr scientists found fossils palaeopropithecus appeared cut marks suggesting flesh removal sharp object indicating species hunted earliest colonists island madagascar source first evidence early human butchery palaeopropithecus found hon paul ayshford methuen traveled madagascar expressly collect bones extinct lemurs oxford slow locomotion habits palaeopropithecus likely made easy target human predators would consume food well use bones along relatively large lemurs became targets active day humans along diurnal nature another factor led extinction slow reproductive rate killed faster could introduction humans madagascar brought change island yet experience lifestyles human beings believe hunting problem brought madagascar humans possibility humans bringing livestock may affected species although would disastrous could finished species small amount competition could offset balance also introduction manmade charcoal fire island caused considerable damage forests palaeopropithecus lived based radiocarbon dating found palaeopropithecus survived last millennium human intervention definitely damaged
