iaa alkylating agent used peptide mapping purposes actions similar iodoacetate commonly used bind covalently thiol group cysteine protein form disulfide also used ubiquitin studies inhibitor deubiquitinase enzymes dubs alkylates cysteine residues dub active site iodoacetamide irreversible inhibitor cysteine peptidases mechanism inhibition occurring alkylation catalytic cysteine residue see schematic comparison acid derivative iodoacetate iodoacetamide reacts substantially faster observation appears contradictory standard chemical reactivity however presence favourable interaction positive imidazolium ion catalytic histidine negatively charged carboxylgroup iodoacetate reason increased relative activity commonly used sample preparation de novo peptide sequencing protein mass spectrometry recent critics suggest avoid use httpsenwikipediaorgwikiiodoacetamide
