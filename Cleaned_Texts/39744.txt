tutin poisonous plant derivative found new zealand tutu plants several species genus coriaria acts potent antagonist glycine powerful convulsant used scientific research glycine receptor sometimes associated outbreaks toxic honey poisoning bees feed honeydew exudate sapsucking passion vine hopper scolypopa australis insect vine hoppers feeding sap tutu bushes toxic honey rare event likely occur comb honey eaten directly hive harvesting honeydew passionvine hoppers feeding tutu tutin first discovered honey contaminant late century missionaries overseas introduced western honey bee apis mellifera new zealand decades later people eating local honey would suffer symptoms like vomiting headaches point neurotoxin studied early toxic effects fully toxin known come tutu plant however neither nectar pollen tutu plant contain toxin two parts honey bees ingest eventually found passion vine hopper scolypopa australis pest insect extracts sap young shoots tutu plant releases secretions honeydew contain tutin honeybees consume honeydew supplementary food source thereby contaminating honey produce outbreaks tutin poisoning would periodically appear point onwards late family hospitalized due severe symptoms caused homegrown honey tutin tutin polyoxygenanted polycyclic sesquiterpene picrotoxane tutin one series chemically pharmacologically similar compounds mostly studied

two main structures tutin conjugates found chemical synthesis could achieved via βoglycosylation reaction tutin activated sugar multiple methods oglycosylation published synthesis complex glycosides anomeric gaba γaminobutyric acid major inhibitory neurotransmitter central nervous system mammals tutin antagonist gaba receptors inhibiting receptors sedative effect neurotransmitter lessened leading intensive stimulation nervous system based extensive data tutin determined noncompetitive using allosteric apart gaba receptor inhibition vitro studies also shown tutin inhibitory effect glycine receptors neurons spinal cord receptors inhibitory functions comparable gaba lastly investigation similar toxins shown blockers ligandgated ion channels therefore suspected tutin could also possess antagonistic properties ion laboratory animal studies absorption distribution metabolism excretion tutin available according fitchett malcolm mcnaughton goodwin systemic absorption purified tutin oral ingestion appears rapid animals clinical signs consistent neurotoxicity found appear within less minutes mice one hour dogs animals received nonlethal doses showed rapid recovery suggesting fast onset time toxicity following consumption tutin containing honey contrary highly variable median onset time hours found confirmed cases onset times ranging half hour hours tutin toxic effect mammals insects looked whether would make useful rodenticide rats lethal effect within one hour dose rate mgkg body weight however recommended specific toxin humans also toxic effect although exact doses remain unknown people incapacitated hospitalised even died getting tutin system study conducted six men given tutin dose μgkg body weight although effects hardly felt volunteers unusual serum concentrations observed peak tutin concentration observed one hour ingestion second larger prolonged peak observed around hours ingestion reasons observation yet side effects tutin intoxication include headaches nausea vomiting dizziness biological activities tutin reported nearly identical picrotoxane sesquiterpenes picrotoxinin symptoms tutin poisoning example preliminary depression salivation fall frequency pulse increased breathing convulsions effect due action medulla oblongata basal ganglia effects tutin poisoning described salivation diminished heart beat increased respiratory activity later predominantly clinic seizures early stages limited fore part results published acute toxicity studies various animals limited value uncertainty impurity profile administered tutin instance palmerjones reported mgkg tutin via oral administration rats administration via subcutaneous sc intraperitoneal ip routes showed higher acute toxicity approximately little known lethal dose average human though tests performed various animal species instance intraperitoneal injection tutin rats shown concentrations mgkg lethal whilst mgkg nonlethal rats showing symptoms muscle spasms general documented human exposure tutin implied dose milligram causes nausea vomiting healthy full grown tutin known cause death sheep cattle belonging settlers new zealand therefore extensive research effects tutin different animal species done early century symptoms injection less animals included rapid breathing salivation seizures eventually death minimal lethal dose cats dogs found around mgkg small rodents like rats rabbits guinea pigs minimal lethal dose little higher around mgkg young animals minimal lethal dose lower birds thought immune tutin poisoning feed berries turin plant research became clear birds high minimal lethal dose around mgkg absolute immunity apparent immunity natural circumstances order reach dose mgkg birds need eat berries physically relatively high lethal dose explained way birds digest food crop part throat many birds food stored going stomach veins go directly systemic circulation instead first liver like mammalsclarification needed
