elephant small currently accepted estimates size argentavis comparison extant birds suggests laid one two eggs mass somewhat kg lb smaller ostrich egg every two years climate considerations make likely birds incubated winter mates exchanging duties incubating procuring food every days young independent months fully mature aged dozen years mortality must low maintain viable population less birds may died year large size ability fly argentavis suffered hardly predation mortality mainly old age size structure wings inferred magnificens flew mainly soaring using flapping flight short periods probable used thermal currents well estimated minimal velocity wing magnificens metres per second fts kilometres per hour especially takeoff would depended wind although legs strong enough provide running jumping start wings simply long flap effectively bird height however skeletal evidence suggests breast muscles powerful enough wing flapping extended argentavis may used mountain slopes headwinds take probably could manage even gently sloping terrain little effort may flown lived much like modern andean condor scanning large areas land aloft carrion climate andean foothills argentina late miocene warmer drier today would aided bird staying aloft atop thermal updrafts studies condor flight indicate argentavis fully capable flight normal conditions modern large soaring birds spend little time flapping wings regardless argentavis territories measured probably square kilometres sq mi birds screened food possibly utilizing generally direction avoid slowed adverse winds species seems less aerodynamically suited predation relatives probably preferred scavenge carrion possible habitually chased metatherian carnivores thylacosmilidae kills largest land predators miocene south america giant grounddwelling terror birds phorusrhacids phorusrhacids probably formidable rivals argentavis faced largest species weighing three times much teratorn unlike extant condors vultures teratorns generally long eaglelike beaks believed active predators seemingly true well argentavis teratorns likely far less ponderous considering substantial size differences argentavis may used wings size intimidate metatherian mammals small phorusrhacids argentavis may also ambushed small live prey ie large rodents small armadillos young large animals ground sloths species wouldve
