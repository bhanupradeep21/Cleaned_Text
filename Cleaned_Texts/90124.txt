integrated threat theory itt also known intergroup threat theory psychology sociology attempts describe components perceived threat lead prejudice social groups theory applies social group may feel threatened way whether social group majority minority group society theory deals perceived threat rather actual threat perceived threat includes threats members group believe experiencing regardless whether threats actually exist example people may feel economic wellbeing threatened outgroup stealing jobs even reality outgroup effect job opportunities still perception job security threat increase levels prejudice outgroup thus even false alarms threat still real consequence prejudice itt first proposed walter g stephan cookie white stephan original theory four components realistic threats symbolic threats intergroup anxiety negative realistic threats threats pose danger ingroups wellbeing include threats physical safety health threats economic political power threats existence group component originally developed part realistic conflict theory donald campbell symbolic threats arise perceived difference values worldview ingroup outgroup difference make ingroup feel outgroup poses threat group morals standards beliefs attitudes threats thus strongly tied groups sense identity category derived gordon allports discussion relationship ones values ones identity proposed since values important reject groups disagree also based research esses et al found groups negative feelings towards outgroup outgroup interfered ingroups intergroup anxiety refers expectation interacting someone different group negative experience people intergroup anxiety fear feel uncomfortable embarrassed unsafe judged either members outgroup people ingroup creating itt framework stephan stephan conducting research intergroup concept intergroup anxiety also draws aversive racism theory argues subconscious negative feelings black americans important part racism stereotypes strategy simplifying complex situation relying popular preset itt predicts negative preset judgments another group lead prejudice component itt draws research found belief negativelyrated stereotypical traits linked higher levels prejudice stereotyped stephan stephan acknowledged research found links prejudice general thus seems general stereotypes assume positive things groups negative aspects stereotypes relevant prejudice stephan renfro proposed updated version theory reduced four components two basic types realistic symbolic categories negative stereotypes intergroup anxiety removed basic framework theory found better understood subtypes threat lead either realistic symbolic threats rather standing separate example intergroup anxiety based expectations physical danger realistic threat well expectations damage ones identity symbolic since itt makes causal claim perceived threat causes prejudice studies using experimental design necessary researchers taken task experimentally manipulate types realistic perceived threat order examine cause prejudice example esses et al esses et al carried research studies manipulated research participants understanding economic threat posed immigrants esses et al canadian undergraduate student participants read one two editorials written one editorial discussed new group immigrants mention job market editorial discussed group emphasized success finding jobs despite scarcity jobs canada studied effects perception economic threat type realistic threat attitudes immigrants reported willingness help immigrants results showed participants read editorial emphasized competition less favorable attitudes towards immigrants less likely approve programs empower esses et al carried similar experiments similar editorials results showed participants read articles emphasized tough job market negative attitudes towards immigrants less supportive immigration canada less supportive programs empower data research studies provide support causal influence realistic threat prejudice causal influence symbolic threat prejudice partially explored study branscombe wann focused perceived threat ingroup identity participants undergraduate females us answered questionnaires levels pride american identity beginning study manipulated participants perceived threat ingroup identity using video clips either showed american russian boxer beating match seeing one version video participants completed questionnaire measured desire distance outgroup case russians results study showed increased perception threat ingroup identity raises desire distance oneself provides experimental evidence perception threat ingroup identity may causes greater prejudice towards outgroups however experimental research necessary order firmly widely establish causal role realistic symbolic threats prejudice several factors lead increased decreased levels group perceived threat updated itt theory draws findings contact hypothesis claims important equality groups power dynamics two groups shown influence groups relate perceive highpower groups likely influence threaten groups lowpower groups often vulnerable influence threats groups thus lowpower groups tend alert perceive threats high power groups corenblum stephan found example native canadians felt threatened white canadians white canadians felt however highpower groups perceive threat another group react strongly lowpower likely lose threat real resources allow counter two groups relatively equal power status especially sensitive feeling threatened competition resources stephan renfro predicted important group membership ingroup members sense personal identity likely people feel threatened uncomfortable interacting groups according prediction people strong ingroup identification likely focused differences groups thus giving motivation hold negative stereotypes groups believe group may link personal importance group membership larger culture groups live collectivistic cultures example place greater emphasis importance group membership compared individualistic culture also influence perceived threat groups cultures level uncertainty avoidance hofstede bond define uncertainty avoidance degree people feel threatened ambiguous situations created beliefs institutions try avoid stephan renfro thus suggest cultures hold norms laws important likely perceive threat unfamiliar research topics better inform role culture intergroup relationships itt used research various social groups including immigrants muslims tourists multiple studies intergroup relations focused immigrants example ward masgoret built upon itt combination instrumentive model group conflict test model attitudes toward immigrants using participants new participants filled questionnaires measured multicultural ideology intergroup anxiety contact immigrants perceived intergroup threat attitudes toward immigrants results supported model suggesting increased contact immigrants multicultural ideology related lower levels perceived threat immigrants turn directly related positive attitudes towards croucher used itt framework explore reasons dominant groups france germany great britain sometimes resist muslim immigrants efforts assimilate data collected questionnaires included measures symbolic threats realistic threats stereotypes perception immigrants motivation assimilate multigroup ethnic identity results supported theory dominant groups felt threatened immigrants less thought immigrants wanted assimilate similarly rohmann et al used itt framework examine relationship perceived threat dominant groups expectation immigrant groups attitude acculturation research included two studies one german participants asked expectations french turkish immigrants germany another german participants asked expectations two fictitious groups based paragraphlong descriptions results studies suggest levels perceived threat higher dominant groups expect immigrant group different attitudes acculturation dominant group tausch et al examined muslim relations hindus india itt incorporated research order examine factors important perceived threat minority muslim majority hindu groups india data collected survey given muslim hindu students university measured contact quantity contact quality perceived relative status two groups realistic threats symbolic threats intergroup anxiety preference social distance ingroup results showed symbolic threat important hindus levels perceived threat realistic threat important muslims levels perceived gonzalez et al carried similar research netherlands examining prejudice dutch youth members majority muslim minority country data collected questionnaire given high schoolers different cities measured support multicultural ideologies frequency contact muslims ingroup identification realistic economic threat symbolic threats stereotypes prejudicial attitudes towards results showed prejudicial attitudes related higher perception symbolic threats belief uenal applied itt framework better understand factors involved presence islamophobic conspiracy stereotypes europe data collected online survey given german university students measured ambiguity intolerance belief clash civilizations realistic threats symbolic threats levels ambiguity intolerance found related increased conspiracy stereotypes increased perceptions symbolic threat belief clash civilizations found related higher levels realistic symbolic threat higher levels belief conspiracy stereotypes higher education levels showed opposite trends related lower levels perceived threat lower levels belief conspiracy tourism bring different groups contact thus subject research intergroup relations using itt example ward berno used itt contact
