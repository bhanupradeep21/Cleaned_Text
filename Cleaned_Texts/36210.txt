retribution attitude poles towards jewish refugees one take account fact decisions possible granting aid taken situation significant parts polish nation exterminated entire ethnic polish population remained threat nazi first months german governments already made polish society aware even minor violations occupation order punished absolute cruel punishment addition germans deliberately tried publicise retribution meted people supporting jews thus intimidating polish society discouraging taking support many historians believe fear german retribution one important factors discouraging poles helping jewish important factors significant number jewish minority low assimilation rate antisemitism war poverty historians come conclusion main motivation helping jews desire jan tomasz gross came conclusion hiding fugitives could particularly risky occupation opinion people would endanger lives loved ones sake income gunnar paulsson compared minimum number poles involved rescuing jews number people reported killed gkbzpnpipn concluded probability death reason taking account remaining threats poles german occupation exposed decided helping jews practice extent risky offences occupation order draconian rules applied massive scale instead trivialising population led bereavement created climate lawlessness hiding jews simply became one many illegal activities people routinely risked lives principle collective responsibility also opposite effect denunciation jew brought danger polish guardians meant violation occupational order solidarity historians estimated however percentage poles acting solely financial grounds several percent marcin urynowicz points german terror effectively intimidating wide circles polish society hence real threats faced person assistance requested direct connection level fear felt conclusion thanks understanding phenomenon learn much better situation pole faced dilemma help person danger longer important whether person asked help actually risking something given time place matters whether person subjected longterm stress anxiety able overcome weaknesses overcome something much deeper feeling fear whether able experience terror invader targeted directly loved ones barbara engelking points fear german repression grew especially cases executions poles suspected supporting jewish refugees certain area events often major impact situation jews known cases demonstrative repressive actions carried germans even threat severe punishments reached goal intimidating local population significantly reducing aid cases fear denunciation severe penalties resulted expulsion fugitives hands germans also happened poles various reasons could want hide jewish fugitives preferred murder instead allowing seek refuge according one jewish survivors story massacre ulma family made shocking impression local population bodies jews later found markowa area polish caregivers murdered fear however according historian mateusz szpytma crime took place neighbouring sietsza village addition probably two years ulmas marek arczyński believed conditions nazi occupation terror unprecedented elsewhere saving jews poland grew act special sacrifice however polish society people willing take risk gunnar paulsson estimated poles involved various forms aid warsaw alone teresa prekerowa estimated number helpers marcin urynowicz władysław bartoszewski least several hundred according jan żaryn number poles participating directly indirectly rescue jews could reach even one million according richard lukas least difficult determine number jews survived german occupation hiding among poles shmuel krakowski claimed thousand people survived aryan side israel gutman estimated thousand jews survived occupied territory poland thousand thousand survived thanks help poles according estimates teresa prekerowa thousand thousand jews survived hiding among polish population without grzegorz berendt estimated occupied poland thousand jews aryan side survived gunnar paulsson hand estimated thousand jews hiding occupied poland nearly thousand managed survive war according thousand jews hiding warsaw alone nearly thousand saved marek arczyński pointed occupied country nazis use farreaching repressive cruel terror help jewish population historians also formulated similar opinions contrary widespread stereotype poland however occupied country europe aid jews threatened death penalty principle collective responsibility helping jews hiding introduced germans occupied territories ussr occupied balkan states e countries pretext fighting partisans abandoned observance rules humanitarian law hand much less risk associated helping jews occupied countries western europe states allied third granting aid jews usually

organise public protests deportations jewish calculations teresa prekerowa show adult polish population involved helping western europe number helpers similarly small though risk associated activities incomparably assuming percentage population european countries made jews survived holocaust poland differ average occupied states hand netherlands jews lived antisemitic sentiments much weaker poland
