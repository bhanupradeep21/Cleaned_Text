subacute thyroiditis refers temporal classification different forms thyroiditis based onset temporal classification thyroiditis includes presentation symptoms acute subacute chronic also classification systems thyroiditis based factors clinical symptoms underlying broadly three categories thyroiditis present subacute fashion including subacute granulomatous thyroiditis subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis druginduced three categories inflammation thyroid gland causing damage thyroid follicular cells produce secrete thyroid hormone often results three phases thyroid dysfunction beginning initial thyrotoxicosis followed hypothyroidism resolution back normal thyroid thyrotoxic stage individuals usually complain fever myalgia may associated anterior neck pain among hypothyroid stage may asymptomatic experience mild cases thyroid dysfunction transient people recover symptomatic treatment among different classification systems thyroiditis onset symptoms used classify thyroiditis acute subacute three types thyroiditis occur subacute manner include subacute granulomatous thyroiditis subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis druginduced subacute granulomatous thyroiditis affects women men often follows viral upper respiratory tract infection many implicated viruses including coxsackievirus epsteinbarr virus recently among subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis also called painless silent thyroiditis occurs individuals underlying autoimmune disease considered variant hashimotos thyroiditis subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis occurs months postpartum called postpartum thyroiditis increased incidence women presence thyroid peroxidase tpo antibodies prior pregnancy women preexisting type diabetes postpartum thyroiditis recur subsequent druginduced thyroiditis occur individuals receiving certain therapies amiodarone interferonalpha lithium tyrosinekinase inhibitors immunotherapies among drugs individuals may develop subacute lymphocytic three types thyroiditis inflammation thyroid gland leads clinical symptoms three phases initial thyrotoxic phase followed hypothyroid phase reaching euthyroid phase normal thyroid function timing phase varies every person experiences three thyrotoxic phase follicular cells thyroid gland damaged leading release preformed thyroid hormone symptoms thyrotoxicosis damage follicles impairs ability produce secrete thyroid hormones leads hypothyroid inflammation resolves thyroid follicles regenerate begin produce thyroid hormones subacute granulomatous thyroiditis infiltration neutrophils immune cells cause damage thyroid follicular cells damage leads formation granulomas multinucleated giant cells associated contrast subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis characterized infiltration lymphocytes causing damage thyroid gland similar hashimotos symptoms subacute thyroiditis depend etiology subacute granulomatous thyroiditis may history viral infection preceding onset presenting symptom usually anterior neck pain may unilateral bilateral radiation jaw ears individuals also experience dysphagia due diffusely enlarged thyroid often associated systemic symptoms fever malaise arthralgia thyrotoxic phase last weeks may experience mild symptoms associated elevated thyroid hormones leaks damaged thyroid gland phase one experience diaphoresis tremors heat intolerance weight upon examination thyroid gland often firm diffusely enlarged tender palpation thyroid may smooth thyroid hormone stores depleted third individuals enter hypothyroid phase may last six months neck pain hypothyroid phase little people return normal thyroid function within one year symptom onset however individuals develop permanent individuals may also relapse subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis thyroid gland tender palpation hence name painless silent thyroid gland may firm finely nodular may may diffusely subacute granulomatous thyroiditis initial transient thyrotoxic phase last months followed hypothyroid phase thyrotoxic symptoms usually mild individuals hypothyroid phase symptomatic hypothyroid phase patient may experience cold intolerance fatigue weight gain depression hypothyroidism may may resolve develop druginduced thyroiditis may clinical course similar subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis forms diagnosis subacute thyroiditis made clinically eliciting risk factors associated symptoms physical workup differentiate etiologies subacute thyroiditis include thyroid function tests tfts inflammatory markers complete blood count cbc thyroid additionally radioactive iodine uptake raiu scan performed thyrotoxic stage help differentiate causes subacute granulomatous thyroiditis prodrome viral illness painful thyroid symptoms thyrotoxicosis may thyroid function test evolve three phases thyrotoxicosis hypothyroidism euthyroid state thyrotoxic phase thyroid stimulating hormone tsh low high normal levels thyroid hormones inflammatory markers creactive protein crp erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr raiu low thyrotoxic phase helps distinguish subacute granulomatous thyroiditis cause thyrotoxicosis graves white blood count usually normal mildly elevated thyroid antibodies thyroid imaging fine needle aspiration fna usually needed subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis thyroid function tests also evolve phases raiu low thyrotoxic distinguished subacute granulomatous thyroiditis lack pain presence tpo thyroglobulin tg antibodies normal inflammatory fine needle aspiration fna performed patients also thyroid nodule rule thyroid goal treatment subacute thyroiditis help reduce pain symptoms druginduced thyroiditis management begins discontinuation offending drug followed symptomatic line treatment pain high doses nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids ibuprofen acetylsalicylic acid aspirin may also used high doses symptoms severe relief nsaids acetylsalicylic acid corticosteroids prednisone beta blockers propranolol used severe symptoms related elevated thyroid hormone three categories subacute role antithyroid drugs since thyrotoxic phase due transient thyroid hormone levothyroxine may needed patients develop hypothyroid annual followup recommended individuals due risk recurrence
