inverse polymerase chain reaction inverse pcr variant polymerase chain reaction used amplify dna one known sequence one limitation conventional pcr requires primers complementary termini target dna method allows pcr carried even one sequence available primers may designed inverse pcr especially useful determination insert locations example various retroviruses transposons randomly integrate genomic identify sites entered known internal viral transposon sequences used design primers amplify small portion flanking external genomic dna amplified product sequenced compared dna databases locate sequence disrupted inverse pcr method involves series restriction digests ligation resulting looped fragment primed pcr single section known sequence like polymerase chain reaction processes dna amplified thermostable dna polymerase finally sequence sequenced pcr product compared sequence databases used case chromosome crawling httpsenwikipediaorgwikiinversepolymerasechainreaction
