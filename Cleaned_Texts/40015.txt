mate desertion occurs one parents abandon current offspring thereby reduce stop providing parental care often deserting parent attempts increase breeding opportunities seeking another mate form mating strategy behavior exhibited insects birds mammals typically males likely desert males females observed practice mate desertion mate desertion involves decision alreadymated individual either continue providing parental care making decision parent must balance investment terms current future reproductive success choosing optimal strategy one provides greatest net benefit towards lifetime reproductive success current success measured number surviving offspring whereas future success measured potential successfully produce offspring future tradeoffs costs benefits reflected two major conflicts driving mate desertion parentoffspring conflict level parental investment parent provide sexual conflict mates provide care much care provided according evolutionary biologist robert trivers parental investment defined investment parent individual offspring increases offsprings chance surviving hence reproductive success cost parents ability invest offspring investment includes investing gametes feeding protecting young also known brooding often amount parental investment necessary maximize fitness differs parent offspring thereby creating parentoffspring conflict increasing parental investment increases current offsprings likelihood survive reproduce investment comes expense parents ability invest future offspring therefore uniparental care equally effective biparental care natural selection favor mate desertion allowing deserter either remate conserve resources future reproduction however decision mate deserts first creates varying reproductive outcomes males females leading sexual conflict parental investment occurs deserted organism pays costs parental care deserter shares benefits reproductive success current offspring also gains benefits additional mating theoretically males females would expected evolve adaptations response sexual conflict would ultimately lead sexually antagonistic coevolution male female traits penduline tits remiz pendulinus uniparental care dominant either sex capable desertion egg laying period typically females care time males care time parents desert time condemning offspring system males build elaborate nests usually desert nests filled females result response females adopted two counteradaptive behaviors function deceive male regarding clutchs progress females conceal eggs burying aggressively attack males approach nest egg laying period studies shown high correlation length time male stays deserting number days female keeps eggs relationship suggests egg burial evolved adaptive female behavior attempts control information males use decide whether desert one partner deserts remaining partner three options first may attempt raise young usually occurs investment required one parent successfully raise current offspring maturity less needed produce new offspring result remaining partner forced situation trivers coined cruel bind deserter effectively forces partner stay gaining benefit deserted parents continued investment cost additional mating opportunities deserted parent second cost raising offspring alone high cost remating low deserted individual may choose desert offspring well attempt breed cases second deserter may even take part filial cannibalism reaping lost investment eating offspring nourishment example scissortail sergeant fish abudefduf sexfasciatus male parental care dominant males undergo brood cycling alternate mating parental phases broods artificially reduced early breeding phase male scissortail sergeants likely cannibalise eggs return mating phase primarily reduced broods indicate decreased current reproductive lastly deserted individual may also attempt trick another mate helping provide care young circumventing cruel instance female cuckolds male deceiving raising another males offspring benefits reducing amount care must provide conserving resources future reproduction response evolution counteradaptations allow males guard female deception would expected evolutionarily maladaptive organism invest unrelated two explanations proposed evidence mate desertion males commonly observed nature first costs lost mating opportunities higher males males greater variance reproductive success lifetime reproductive success depends number mating thus often benefit desertion second mode fertilization often influences degree parental care turn influences sex desert generally speaking male parental care predicted external fertilization female parental care predicted internal fertilization pattern parental care best explained association hypothesis argues association embryos predisposes sex parental example species mate desertion males prominent females reproduce internal fertilization thus responsible carrying eggs intimate connection allows female offer better care offspring males comparative separation makes much less likely able adequately care young furthermore inherent internal fertilization fact impossible females desert sex bearing offspring theory females often position leave young males leave much less offer sticking around conversely organisms practice external certain species often primary caretakers young natural selection tends favor desertion costs low benefits high benefits include increased mating opportunities breeding season reduced energetic costs associated parental care whereas costs include decreased mating opportunities reduced future reproductive success timing probability mate desertion shown influenced variety factors instance desertion either sex favored remating opportunities high food young abundant predation low current offspring older require little parental investment smaller average size deserters contribution parental care another factor shown influence probability mate desertion biased operational sex ratio defined ratio sexually active males sexually active females convict cichlid fish males likely desert femalebiased sex ratio males higher chance remating increasing reproductive success furthermore probability male desertion particular species also increased low predation high predation leads biparental care offspring survival mature offspring smaller average offspring another population cichlids aequidens coeruleopunctatus brood reduction leading earlier male mate desertion also observed deserting male save energy also increases chance breeding thus reproductive success similarly coopers hawks female desertion offspring found closely related likelihood offspring survival future reproductive success females weak physical condition likely abandon offspring complete migration increasing breeding chances opportunities following whiskered terns majority deserters female related provisioning rate females providing food less likely mammals aardwolves shown practice male mate desertion response female lastly ambisexual mate desertion sexes desert nearly equal frequencies observed snail kites mate desertion either sex depends food supply snail kites likely desert snails abundant rate nesting success high thus mating strategies exhibited snail kites somewhat plastic depending varying environmental game theory helps explain parents less likely desert offspring taking account costs benefits associated decisions john lazarus developed wellknown game theory model mate desertion different outcomes predicted using payoff matrix particular model benefits desertion depend ability deserter gain additional mating opportunities deserted partners lazaruss model mate desertion defines conditions lead three possible cases parents stay parents desert one parent stays one parent deserts parents stay offspring neither gains benefits deserting mate parents desert individual time offering maximal benefit based parent leaves one parent deserts deserter leave time benefits high costs low variables used describe different fitness levels achieved parent case one parents choose stay either male female total payoff deserter less reproductive success obtained parents provide care therefore neither benefits deserting case two arises parents desert normally payoff desertion higher one sex model assumes males benefit desertion females mf though case species payoff male receives deserting exceeds reproductive success providing care young desert point males reproductive success females reproductive success eventually payoff female deserting exceed benefits caring alone point also expected desert leaving brood parental care lastly case three occurs one parent deserts stays model assumption mf male desert first payoff deserting greater benefits investing offspring point males reproductive success females reproductive success however contrast case two female never benefit deserting payoff never exceeds benefits obtained caring alone consequently situations females benefits deserting low remain raise brood maximizing reproductive success httpsenwikipediaorgwikimatedesertion
