active fastswimming pelagic lifestyle fusiform body luniform caudal fin although exact morphology unlike extant fish closely resemble billfish scombrids tuna furthermore much like billfish many scombrids pentanogmius possessed many small teeth would allowed prey relatively small pelagic fish crustaceans cephalopods however currently known specimen pentanogmius preserves stomach
