follicular hyperplasia fh type lymphoid hyperplasia classified lymphadenopathy means disease lymph nodes caused stimulation b cell compartment abnormal cell growth secondary follicles typically occurs cortex without disrupting lymph node follicles pathologically polymorphous often contrasting varying size follicular hyperplasia distinguished follicular lymphoma polyclonality lack protein expression whereas follicular lymphoma monoclonal expresses lymphadenopathies follicular hyperplasia show various symptoms fever chills night sweats unexplained weight loss prominent localizing symptoms non age nongender although human lymph nodes seen naked eye press skin sometimes feel swelling pressure swelling lymph nodes range pea sized golf ball sized depending given condition person reactive lymph nodes throughout multiple areas body cause swelling pain warmth tendernessmedical citation needed following examples potential causes reactive lymphadenopathies predominantly follicular microorganisms infect lymph nodes causing pain inflammation including redness tenderness bacterial fungal viral infections including bartonella staphylococcal granulomatous adenoviral lyme disease associated follicular autoimmune related diseases associated rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus dermatomyositis sj√∂gren syndrome immunoglobulin g related diseases immunemediated fibroinflammatory conditions affect many organs body chronic inflammatory disorders kimura disease also outcome inflamed enlarged lymph nodes bacteria treponema pallidum parasites toxoplasma gondii cause enlargement lymph nodes well related causes lymphoproliferative conditions known castleman disease progressive transformation germinal centers cause lymph node enlargement environmental conditions may also play role animal insect exposure chronic medication usage immunization status patients occupational history metal work coal mining may expose silicon follicular hyperplasia common children young adults limited age also common among elderly nonsex children often experience reactive lymph nodes younger due new exposure environmental pathogens even without development infectionmedical citation needed clinically follicular hyperplasia lymphadenopathy usually restricted single area body also several parts body well follicular hyperplasia one common types lymphadenopathies associated paracortical sinus specific pathology follicular hyperplasia fully understood yet known however stimulation b cell compartment abnormal cell growth secondary follicles key factors pathology follicular hyperplasia typically occurs cortex without disrupting lymph node also described condition may stem primary reactive lymphoid proliferations may triggered unidentified antigens sort chronic irritation ultimately causing lymph node lymph node enlargement occur many reasons first lymph nodes function act filter reticuloendothelial system contain multilayered sinus exposing b cell lymphocytes macrophages found within blood immune system recognizes foreign proteins order mount attack requires help blood cells reaction responding cell lines become duplicated response foreign attack therefore increase size node size considered abnormal exceeds cm however differs children localized specific adenopathy often occur clusters groups lymph nodes migrate various areas body lymph nodes distributed within areas body enlarged reflect location lymphatic drainage node appearance range tender fixed mobile discrete matted important note reactive lymph nodes necessarily bad thing fact good indication lymphatic system working hard lymph fluids build lymph nodes way trap harmful bacteria harmful pathogens body prevent spreading areasmedical citation needed substances present within interstitial fluids microorganisms antigens even cancer enter lymphatic vessels forming lymphatic fluids lymph nodes help filter fluids removing material towards direction blood circulation antigens presented lymphocytes inside node trigger response cause proliferation cell enlargement also referred reactive follicular hyperplasia distinguished among diseases observing density lymph follicle low magnification lymph nodes reactive follicles contain extensions outside capsule follicles present throughout entire node obvious centroblasts absence diminishing mantle zones immunohistochemistry help distinguish difference patient follicular lymphoma follicular reactive follicular hyperplasia express proteins b cell germinal centers absent light chain reaction immunostaining flow cytometry well absent ig localized specific lymphadenopathies evaluated etiologies associated lymphatic drainage patterns complete lymphatic physical examination generalized lymphadenopathy may may ruled protein expression usually absent follicular hyperplasia prominent follicular lymphomas comparison stains include germinal center markers useful compare determining proper positive cells metalloproteinase activate deactivate peptides proteolytic official diagnosis follicular hyperplasia might include imagining pet scan tissue biopsy depending clinical location also location common blood panel test may help rule possible diagnosis lymphomas based number red white platelet cells found blood patient low blood cell counts indication lymphoma another indication lymphoma compared follicular hyperplasia high levels lactic dehydrogenase ldh creactive proteins crpmedical citation needed lymph node biopsy may reveal official diagnosis lymphoma ruling follicular hyperplasia determined rate proliferationmedical citation needed factors identify etiology patient include age duration lymphadenopathy external exposures associated symptoms location beta blockers atenolol ace inhibitors like captopril cause certain lymphadenopathies individuals captopril analog proline completely inhibits angiotensin converting enzymes ace result decreases angiostatin ii production also inhibit tumor angiogenesis mmps endothelial cell migration ultimately cause lymph node carbamazepine anticonvulsant works decreasing nerve impulses brought seizures serious side effects allergic skin reactions low blood cell counts anticonvulsant medications phenytoin primidone also cause lymph node enlargement due changes blood drug administrationmedical citation needed medications pyrimethamine quinidine trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole antibiotics also change blood chemistry administration cause lymph node enlargement hydralazine allopurinol medications prescribed patients lower blood pressure vasodilators causing blood cells dilatecitation needed family history regional exam epidemiological cues usually useful information utilize treatment options help classify patients condition either low risk high risk low risk meaning patient exposed malignancy serious disease high risk means patient risk malignancy serious illness recommended physician observe changes symptom resolutions within weeks lymphadenopathy resolve next step would getting proceeding tissue sample effective treatment follicular hyperplasia surgical removal lesion initial conformation disease based patients biopsy typically follicular hyperplasia categorized benign lymphadenopathy usually almost always treatable progresses therefore follicular hyperplasia patients tend live long life condition either treated goes away follicular hyperplasia becomes problematic left untreated increasing risks developing various types follicular hyperplasia one common types benign typically found children young adults however ages subject follicular hyperplasia including elderly lymphadenopathies follicular hyperplasia usually localized also generalized non gender specific lymphadenopathies observed local usually involving specifically head neck estimated patients present lymphadenopathy estimated chance developing rate childhood malignancy associated lymphadenopathy low however increases age majority reported cases children usually caused infections benign etiologies one study patients underwent nodal biopsy resulted benign selflimited causes found nearly patients younger years age also case nearly patients ages years old patients older years age lymphadenopathies last weeks one year develop progression cancer cells low chance neoplastic recent study year old woman examined medical professionals department oral maxillofacial surgery tokyo medical university hospital treat existing condition inflamed mass cells noted patients bottom left gum line sample biopsy obtained patients mouth indicated results showed benign lymphoid tissues investigation microscope revealed lymphocytic tissues composed scattered lymphoid follicles obvious germinal centers well differentiated lymphocytes surrounded defiant mantle zones immunochemical staining revealed positivity lymphoid particles study significant able diagnose rare case follicular lymphoid hyperplasia derived unusual origin site mouth however unable
