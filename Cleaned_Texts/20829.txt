since sometimes location srus lesions much finger could reach means constipation stools may hard another possible mechanism people constipation certain anatomical anomalies likely end using excessive straining defecation prolonged straining may cause direct trauma rectal patients srus dyssynergic defecation previously termed failure relaxation paradoxical contraction puborectalis muscle defecation

conservative measures first line treatment patients symptoms mild moderate symptoms significant anatomical conservative measures may improve symptoms prevent condition getting conservative measures fail severe disease symptoms significant anatomical defects surgical options may improvement symptoms always equate healing ulcer seen conservative management focussed education patient behaviour modification indicated conservative management may also involve treatment psychological avoidance analreceptive sex prevent trauma biofeedback targets pelvic floor behaviours enables reprogramming autonomic nerologic pathways associated treatment particularly helpful dyssynergic defecation research studies shown improved blood flow rectal mucosa biofeedback overall rate complete resolution
