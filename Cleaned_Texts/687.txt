antibody immunoglobulin structure made two heavychains two lightchains chains held together disulfide bonds arrangement processes put together different parts antibody molecule play important role antibody diversity production different subclasses classes antibodies organization processes take place development differentiation b cells controlled gene expression transcription translation coupled
