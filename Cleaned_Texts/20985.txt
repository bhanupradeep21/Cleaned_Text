trachea pl tracheae tracheas also known windpipe cartilaginous tube connects larynx bronchi lungs allowing passage air present almost animals lungs trachea extends larynx branches two primary bronchi top trachea cricoid cartilage attaches larynx trachea formed number horseshoeshaped rings joined together vertically overlying ligaments trachealis muscle ends epiglottis closes opening larynx swallowing trachea begins form second month embryo development becoming longer fixed position time epithelium lined columnshaped cells hairlike extensions called cilia scattered goblet cells produce protective mucins trachea affected inflammation infection usually result viral illness affecting parts respiratory tract larynx bronchi called croup result cough infection bacteria usually affects trachea cause narrowing even obstruction major part respiratory tract obstructed trachea prevents air entering lungs tracheostomy may required trachea obstructed additionally surgery mechanical

mucus helps moisten protect mucus lines ciliated cells trachea trap inhaled foreign particles cilia waft upward toward larynx pharynx either swallowed stomach expelled phlegm selfclearing mechanism termed mucociliary trachea surrounded rings hyaline cartilage rings incomplete two cartilages often unite partially completely sometimes bifurcated extremities rings generally highly elastic may

also helps warm humidify filter air reaches lungs trachea made rings cartilage help keep open prevent collapsing inside trachea lined mucous membrane produces mucus help trap dirt dust particles cilia tiny hairs line mucous membrane help move mucus trapped particles trachea inflammation trachea known tracheitis usually due infection usually caused viral bacterial infections occurring almost entirely commonly infections occur inflammation parts respiratory tract larynx bronchi known however bacterial infections may also affect trachea alone although often associated recent viral viruses cause croup generally parainfluenza viruses influenza viruses b also causing croup usually causing serious infections bacteria may also cause croup include staphylococcus aureus haemophilus influenzae streptococcus pneumoniae moraxella causes bacterial infection trachea commonly staphylococcus aureus streptococcus patients hospital additional bacteria may cause tracheitis include escherichia coli klebsiella pneumoniae pseudomonas person affected tracheitis may start symptoms suggest upper respiratory tract infection cough sore throat coryzal symptoms runny nose fevers may develop affected child may develop difficulty breathing swelling airway cause narrowing airway causing hoarse breathing sound called stridor even cause complete people affected bacterial tracheitis require use mechanical ventilation treatment may include endoscopy purposes acquiring microbiological specimens culture sensitivity well removal dead tissue associated infection treatment situations usually includes trachea may narrowed compressed usually result enlarged nearby lymph nodes cancers trachea nearby structures large thyroid goitres rarely result processes unusually swollen blood scarring tracheobronchial injury intubation inflammation associated granulomatosis polyangiitis may also cause narrowing trachea tracheal obstruction invariably causes harsh breathing sound known camera inserted via mouth trachea called bronchoscopy may performed investigate cause management obstructions depends cause obstructions result malignancy may managed surgery chemotherapy stent may inserted obstruction benign lesions narrowing resulting scarring likely surgically one cause narrowing tracheomalacia tendency trachea collapse increased external pressure airflow increased breathing due decreased due congenital causes due things develop birth compression nearby masses swelling congenital tracheomalacia occur association abnormalities bronchomalacia laryngomalacia abnormal connections trachea oesophagus amongst congenital tracheomalacia often improves without specific intervention required interventions may include beta agonists muscarinic agonists enhance tone smooth muscle surrounding trachea positive pressure ventilation surgery may include placement stent removal affected part dogs particularly miniature dogs toy dogs tracheomalacia well lead tracheal collapse often presents honking gooselike trachea may injured trauma vehicle accident intentionally another wilfully inflicting damage example practiced martial tracheal intubation refers insertion tube procedure

tracheal rings formed complete rings rather horseshoe shaped rings rings smaller normal cshaped rings cause narrowing stenosis trachea resulting breathing difficulties operation called slide
