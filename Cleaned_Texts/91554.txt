dariers disease dar rare inherited skin disorder presents multiple greasy crusting thick brown bumps merge autosomal dominant disorder discovered french dermatologist ferdinandjean darier mild forms disease common consisting solely skin rashes flare certain conditions high humidity high stress tightfitting clothes short stature combined poorlyformed fingernails contain vertical striations diagnostic even mild forms dar symptoms usually appear late childhood early adulthood ages years vary lifespan severe cases characterized dark crusty patches skin mildly greasy emit strong odor patches also known keratotic papules keratosis follicularis dyskeratosis follicularis often appear scalp forehead upper arms chest back knees elbows behind mutations single gene responsible development dariers disease encodes protein calcium pump localized membranes endoplasmic reticulum er nearly cells sarcoplasmic reticulum sr muscle cells er protein processing transport begins

transduction pathways required signaling cells removing nearly ions cytoplasm storing ersr large number mutant alleles identified association dariers disease one study families sporadic cases found specific novel mutations associated dar symptoms study reported loose imperfect correlation severity mutations severity condition significant variability disease severity members family carrying mutation also reported study suggesting genetic modifiers contribute phenotypic penetrance certain mutation inherited autosomal dominant pattern means one allele needs mutated order express trait also means someone born one parent dar chance inheriting mutant allele disease lossoffunction mutations typically display recessive inheritance gainoffunction hyperactive function proteins characteristic dominant mutations observation one mutated allele sufficient produce clinical symptoms suggests proper gene dosage necessary maintaining homeostasis means two wild type copies needed proper cell function provides logical basis dominant phenotypes arising lossoffunction alleles mutations haploinsufficiency mutations means one functional copy functional gene results reduced level protein expression sufficient wild type function making enough coded protein cell function properly however significant variability disease severity mutations expressed even within families mutation currently unclear current research reduction expressionactivity causes clinical symptoms restricted epidermis one hypothesis researchers given cell types express additional backup pumps compensate reduced function expression protein skin cells rely exclusively gene calcium sequestration meaning affected reduction mentioned cases dar result somatic mutations epidermal stem cells cases referred instances
