interindividual differences perception describes effect differences brain structure factors culture upbringing environment perception humans interindividual differing person person variability usually regarded source noise research however recent years become interesting source study sensory mechanisms understand human behavior help modern neuroimaging methods fmri eeg individual differences perception could related underlying brain mechanisms helped explain differences behavior cognition across population common methods include studying perception illusions effectively demonstrate different aspects culture genetics environment influence human behavior motion quartet bistable stimulus consists two dots change position frame frame position change either interpreted horizontal vertical movement viewers experience switch viewing interpretations depending aspect ratio two dots positions one state perceived longer often aspect ratio one illusion biased towards vertical perception reason might way human brain processes signals eyes visual system right half eyes field view processed left hemisphere left half right hemisphere stimulus moving vertically involves one field view one hemisphere stimulus moving vertically one field view involves hemispheres requires communication delay caused additional signalling might cause also individual differences way motion quartet perceived people require different aspect ratio perceive axes movement others study using diffusion tensor imaging showed differences structure corpus callosum primary connection two hemispheres might origin exist variety illusions make objects appear bigger smaller compared real size two illusions ebbinghaus ponzo illusions ebbinghaus illusion makes dot seem bigger surrounded smaller dots ponzo illusion exploits human perspective processing making dot appear bigger seems farther away schwarzkopf et found size primary visual cortex effect magnitude illusions larger subjects surface area less subjects fell illusion hypothesized due fact larger dedicated portion visual field means lesser effect later fixedsize visual areas ones responsible illusion mcgurk effect auditory illusion people perceive different syllable incongruent audiovisual speech presented auditory syllable ba presented mouth movement ga result listener perceives syllable da however according gentilucci cattaneo everyone perceives illusion population susceptible one psychological models explains interindividual differences speech perception fuzzy logic model speech according model categorization process carried processing speech sounds listening stimulus features acoustic signal analyzed subsequently signal compared features stored memory finally sound classified category best fits however classification may blurred boundary respectively category sound belongs result final decision may depend integration multiple sources information mcgurk effect presented auditory visual components speech separately evaluated integrated perceive mcgurk effect visual information higher influence perception ambiguous audiovisual information thus sound classified da many studies concluded area responsible perception phenomenon left superior temporal area critical multisensory integration visual auditory information speech perception moreover correlation activation sts perception mcgurk

bloodoxygenlevel dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging bold fmri used measure brain activity perceivers nonperceivers mcgurk effect presented congruent audiovisual syllables mcgurk audiovisual syllables auditory ba visual ga producing perception da nonmcgurk incongruent syllables auditory ga visual ba producing auditory perception ga researchers found positive correlation amplitude response left sts probability perceiving mcgurk effect words subject weakest sts activation incongruent speech smallest probability experiencing mcgurk percept whereas subject strongest sts response highest beauchamp et al highlight critical role left sts audiovisual applied single pulses transcranial magnetic stimulation tms sts mcgurk perceivers presentation mcgurk stimuli perception mcgurk effect decreased subjects reported perceiving auditory syllable following beauchamp et al conclude left sts crucial audiovisual integration thus perception mcgurk effect moreover another suggests basis interindividual differences perception mcgurk effect lies eye movements subject viewing talkers face experimenters carried eye tracking study measured eye movements participants viewing audiovisual speech found people spent time fixating mouth talker likely perceive mcgurk effect rarely fixated mouth speaker interindividual differences also researched tritone paradox illusion illusion subject successively listens two tones separated half octave tone made set harmonics octave relation listener decide two tones descending ascending relation according diana perception tones influenced language spoken listener listener circular representation pitch sounds common culture based develops pitch range speaking voice determines orientation pitch class respect height given tone range taken highest position along circle depending second tone person perceives pattern ascending descending found people california tone highest position pitchclass circle around c whereas people southern england around g according results deutsch hypothesized orientation pitchclass circle respect height similar individuals linguistic group varies individuals different linguistic groups illusions found deutsch whose interpretation depends interindividual differences phantom words illusion consists continuous presentation two meaningless syllables order experience illusion necessary listener sits two loudspeakers one left right syllables presented offset time way one syllable coming left syllable coming right loudspeaker shown period time people start hearing words according deutsch perceived words depend language spoken listener knowledge expectations according shinncunningham information incomplete contradictory perceptual system often fills gaps plausible interpretations way allows new information efficiently processed several studies shown differences individuals play significant role determining stimulus perceived differences among people turn greatly influenced ones sociocultural contexts research indicates cultural factors influence process perception lowerlevel object perception attention deployment also higherorder functions theory mind emotion two major cultures analyzed studies mostly western east asian cultures considerable differences social structure practices western culture referred analytical culture whereas eastern culture referred holistic specifically individualism freedom predominant values western societies turn demand interpretation object absolute terms independent context contrast eastern culture known emphasis collectivism interdependence interpretation object often relation pioneer study examining cultural differences visual perception conducted kitayama et al findings study provide behavioural evidence cultural factors affect visual perception attention deployment study americans japanese taken subjects visual stimulus shown subjects consisted square figure line hanging centre framed line test first absolute condition task redraw line centre square absolute length new square box independent size second relative condition task redraw line proportionally similar context new square box results show americans perform better absolute task requires analytical processing stimulus independent context whereas japanese performed better relative task demands holistic processing stimulus relation context line findings hedden colleagues used visual stimuli investigate neural activity help fmri participants study asked judge length vertical line either including contextual information ignoring results revealed separate brain regions employed performing task either incorporating contextual information avoiding based ones culture areas associated attentional control frontal parietal region brain highly activated subjects performed task incongruent cultural pattern activity frontoparietal region enhanced east asians ignore contextual information similar enhancement happened americans incorporate contextual information findings illustrate function neural mechanisms also modulated extent ones followup fmri study gutchess welsh boduroglu park confirmed previous findings using rather complex stimulus consists object pictures object background pictures background pictures without object particular study done eastasian americans nonasian americans though performance subject groups equally good activity involved brain areas significantly different nonasian americans higher activation object processing areas ventral visual cortex object recognition task whereas eastasian
