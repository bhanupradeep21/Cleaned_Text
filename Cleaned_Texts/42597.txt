urethrotomy operation involves incision urethra especially relief stricture often performed outpatient setting patient usually discharged hospital surgery center within six hours procedures inceptioncitation needed urethrotomy also referred dviu direct visual internal urethrotomy popular treatment male urethral strictures however performance characteristics poor success less first subsequent urethrotomies patients expected experience failure longer followup expected longterm success rate urethrotomy approach beginning several urology residency programs northeastern section united states began advocating use urethrotomy initial treatment young stricture patient versus urethral dilatation theorized onetotwo years relief stricture disease allow practitioner patient plan effective treatment regimen without concern undergoing multiple dilatations cloud judgment patient furthermore urethroplasty selected patient minimal scar tissue developed site stricture urethrotomy patient opposed patient undergone conventional dilatation routecitation needed diagnosis confirmed either cystoscopy prior urethrography patient placed lithotomy position urinary meatus cleansed appropriate surgical cleansing agent scrub usually containing povidoneiodine surgically draped iv antibiotic antiinfective medication administered conjunction intravenous normal saline allowed run administration prescribed dose completed often procedural sedation chosen adjunct patient comfort patient received intravenous anxiolytic medication sometime prior surgical preparation medication usually benzodiazepine often diazepam midazolam employed urological surgeon anesthesia practitioner may also choose administer narcotic analgesic fentanyl citrate depending level discomfort anticipated surgeon cases usually longer strictures present rapidly metabolized hypnotic agent propofol may selected allows immediate induction shortterm general anesthesia noteendotracheal intubation also necessary general anesthesia administered constant monitoring vital signs including pulse oximetry cardiac monitoring ecg body temperature blood pressure carried anesthesia practitioner patient discharged postoperatively postsurgical recovery topical anesthetic usually viscous lidocaine instilled urethra penile crown clamp applied least five minutes removed immediately prior insertion cystoscope equipped transurethral injection system containing local anesthetic often plain lidocaine plain bupivicaine urological surgeon inject anesthetic twelve oclock four oclock eight oclock positions face stricture using infiltrative technique ensuring entire length stricture medicated cystoscope injection system withdrawn sufficient time allowed local anesthetic take effect usually fivetoten time rigid urethrotome flexible cystoscopeurethrotome combination inserted guided face stricture small blade towards tip instrument deployed using trigger mechanism cut stricture locations determined surgeon upon completion internal incisions instrument withdrawn appropriately sized foley catheter inserted repair urinary bladder locked place filling balloon positioned inside bladder near urethral junction sterile water foley catheter serves two purposes first provides drainage urine produced kidneys secondly secures incised areas holding open three seven days permit thorough healing urethra catheter attached urinary catheter drainage system large bag leg bag via clear polypropylene prior discharge surgical facility patient instructed proper care urinary drainage system monitor signs infection limitations physical activity necessary safety patient success procedure course oral antibiotics antiinfective agents prescribed additionally urinary analgesic phenazopyridine urinary analgesicantispasmodic combination containing methanamine methylene blue hyoscyamine sulfate offered palliative medications may sometimes prescribed often necessary usually minimal discomfort steps taken surgery reduce discomfort recovery suggested wear loose fitting undergarments procedure chance catheter procedure mens cotton boxers work well comfort containing bleeding may occur note bleeding urethrotomy expected last hours purchasing cheap black dark grey undergarments help postsurgery anxiety lightcolored undergarments make bleeding appear worse actually undergarments thrown use additionally applying waterbased lubricant catheter allowing run coat opening urethra prevent catheter rubbing irritating urethral opening lastly preparing lean meals surgery grilled chicken salad good idea ease recovery hours surgerycitation needed surgeon remove catheter three seven days surgery completed baseline uroflowmetric study performed patient instructed return thirty days followup evaluation evaluation include another uroflowmetric study complete urinalysis followup visits scheduled sixmonth intervals determined practitioner responsible treatment become common practice urologists prescribe selfcatheterization weekly intervals posturethrotomy patient voiding using sterile technique lubricated foley catheter passed urethra surgically modified area bladder allowed remain place ten minutes catheter carefully withdrawn discarded patient instructed void soon possible helps cleanse urethra blood waterbased lubricant lessen possibility infection although formal studies conducted appear improvement intervals subsequent urethrotomies improvement uroflowmetric data patients undergone many leading urologists united states consider urethrotomy almost totally ineffective providing longterm resolution urethral stricture disease advocate excision damaged area followed either surgical anastomosis patent urethral ends grafting similar tissue harvested elsewhere patients costeffectiveness procedure come question may issue urology study undertaken urology department university washington essentially concluded statistical correlation length stricture cost versus benefit ratio subsequent urethrotomies performed prior performance urethroplasty males suffering bulbar urethrotomy much simpler operation requiring much less recovery time open surgical excision simple short stricture even initially successful may still require repeated post operative self dilation simpler urethrotomy often requires may longer complicated stricture may better treated open procedure shorter simpler one urethrotomycitation needed comparing two surgical procedures uk trial found urethrotomy urethroplasty effective treating urethral stricture bulbar region time
