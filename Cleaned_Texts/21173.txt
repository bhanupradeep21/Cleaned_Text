reduced affect display sometimes referred emotional blunting emotional numbing condition reduced emotional reactivity individual manifests failure express feelings either verbally nonverbally especially talking issues would normally expected engage emotions condition expressive gestures rare little animation facial expression vocal additionally reduced affect symptomatic autism

schizophrenia blunted affect show different regional brain activity fmri scans presented emotional stimuli compared individuals schizophrenia without blunted affect instance individuals schizophrenia without blunted affect show activation following brain areas shown emotionally negative pictures midbrain pons anterior cingulate cortex insula ventrolateral orbitofrontal cortex anterior temporal

defining characteristic presentation schizophrenia reiterate individuals decrease observed vocal facial expressions well use one study flat affect schizophrenia found flat affect common men associated worse current quality life well adverse effect course study also reported dissociation reported experience emotion supporting suggestion made elsewhere blunted affect including flattened facial expressiveness lack vocal inflection often disguises individuals true thus feelings may merely unexpressed rather lacking hand lack emotions due mere repression real loss contact objective world gives observer specific impression queerness remainders emotions substitutes emotions usually refer rage extreme cases complete dissociation affective support idea study examining emotion dysregulation found individuals schizophrenia could exaggerate emotional expression healthy controls could participants asked express whatever emotions clip film participants schizophrenia showed deficits behavioral expression still debate regarding source flat affect schizophrenia however literature indicates abnormalities dorsal executive ventral affective systems argued dorsal hypoactivation ventral hyperactivation may source flat authors found deficits mirror neuron system may also contribute flat affect deficits may cause disruptions control facial expression another study found speaking individuals schizophrenia flat affect demonstrate less inflection normal controls appear less fluent normal subjects appear express using complex syntax whereas flat affect subjects speak fewer words fewer words per sentence flat affect individuals use contextappropriate words sad happy narratives similar controls likely flat affect result deficits motor expression opposed emotional processing moods display compromised subjective autonomic contextual aspects emotion left posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd previously known cause negative feelings depressed mood reexperiencing hyperarousal however recently psychologists started focus attention blunted affects also decrease feeling expressing positive emotions ptsd blunted affect emotional numbness considered one consequences ptsd causes diminished interest activities produce pleasure anhedonia produces feelings detachment others restricted emotional expression reduced tendency express emotions behaviorally blunted affect often seen veterans consequence psychological stressful experiences caused blunted affect response ptsd considered one central symptoms posttraumatic stress disorders often seen veterans served combat ptsd
