pharyngeal arches also known visceral arches structures seen embryonic development vertebrates recognisable precursors many structures fish arches known branchial arches gill arches human embryo arches first seen fourth week development appear series outpouchings mesoderm sides developing pharynx vasculature pharyngeal arches known aortic arches fish branchial arches support gills vertebrates pharyngeal arches derived three germ layers primary layers cells form neural crest cells enter arches contribute features skull facial skeleton bone however existence pharyngeal structures neural crest cells evolved indicated existence neural crestindependent mechanisms pharyngeal arch first anterior pharyngeal arch gives rise oral jaw second arch becomes hyoid jaw fish posterior arches
