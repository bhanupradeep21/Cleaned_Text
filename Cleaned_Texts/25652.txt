hydrogen fluoride form due elimination fluoride proton acid indirectly dangerous humans skin contact hydrogen fluoride cause immediate reaction water produces hydrofluoric soman organophosphorus nerve agent mechanism action similar tabun nerve agents inhibit acetylcholine esterase ache forming adduct enzyme via serine residue enzyme adducts may decomposed hydrolytically example action oximes thereby regenerate enzyme second reaction type one op complex undergoes subsequent reaction usually described aging complex aged longer regenerated common oxime reactivators rate process dependent op

inhibits ache also substrate esterases reaction soman esterases allows detoxication compound metabolic toxification reactions known soman soman hydrolyzed socalled aesterase specific diisopropylfluorophosphatase esterase also called somanase reacts anhydride bond phosphorus fluorine accounts hydrolysis fluoride somanase also hydrolyses methyl group soman resulting formation pinacolyl methylphosphonic acid pmpa less potent ache soman also bind esterases eg ache cholinesterase che carboxylesterases carbe binding soman loses fluoride binding ache che soman also loses phosphoryl group leading formation methylphosphonic acid mpa binding carbe reduce total concentration soman blood thus resulting lower toxicity furthermore carbe involved detoxication hydrolysing
