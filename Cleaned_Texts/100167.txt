lucy shapiro born july new york city american developmental biologist professor developmental biology stanford university school medicine virginia dk ludwig professor cancer research director beckman center molecular genetic shapiro founded new field developmental biology using microorganisms examine fundamental questions developmental biology work furthered understanding basis stem cell function generation biological ideas revolutionized understanding bacterial genetic networks helped researchers develop novel drugs fight antibiotic resistance emerging infectious shapiro presented national medal pioneering discovery bacterial cell controlled integrated genetic circuit functioning time space serves systems engineering paradigm underlying cell differentiation ultimately generation diversity organisms lucy shapiro born brooklyn new york city eldest three daughters mother elementary school teacher father ukrainian immigrant attended new york citys high school music arts major fine shapiro enrolled brooklyn college double major fine arts biology intention becoming medical part experimental honors program able design curriculum encouragement theodore talked way honors organic chemistry class spatial scientific interests reinforced visualized spatial properties organic molecules three received ab fine arts biology brooklyn college fall shapiro hired lab technician j thomas august jerard hurwitz department microbiology new york university nyu school hurwitz codiscoverer dnadependent rna shapiro given task looking rnadependent rna polymerase using rna phage norton zinder successful detecting activity enzyme copying rna shapiro became graduate student nyu tom august advisor department subsequently joined newly created department molecular biology albert einstein college medicine shapiro also attended summer courses cold spring harbor laboratory cshl long shapiro earned phd albert einstein college medicine thesis replication bacteriophage shapiro published reflections early days brooklyn life science journal biological annual review shapiro initially planned postdoctoral work elsewhere offered faculty position einstein bernard horecker horecker proposed take three months think fundamental questions direction future research life shapiro identified positional information key research area asking spatial information genetically encoded translated create threedimensional organization form different daughter cells cell division cell organizes threedimensional structure shapiro launched lab einstein shapiro remained albert einstein college medicine assistant professor associate professor professor became chair department molecular director einsteins division biological named lola saul kramer endowed chair molecular biology albert einstein college medicine shapiro served higgins professor chair microbiology college physicians surgeons columbia shapiro became professor founding chair department developmental biology stanford university school medicine stanford joseph grant professor school medicine becoming virginia dk ludwig professor cancer research shapiro became director beckman center molecular genetic medicine stanford university school confident talking science excellent need intimidated anyone says shapiro particularly important women six months postdoctoral student albert einstein college medicine shapiro asked join faculty establish lab asked wanted work shapiro decided fascinated onedimensional genetic code dna could translated threedimensional shapiro wanted go beyond testtube studies extracted cell contents examine threedimensional structure behavior actual living found simplest organism could set learn multiple components living cell work selected singlecelled organism caulobacter crescentus began attempting identify specific biological processes controlling cells students discovered overturned accepted beliefs bacterial cell biology cell cycle caulobacter divides asymmetrically two daughters one swarmer cell taillike flagellum helps swim daughter stalk anchors surface swarmer cells become stalked cells short period motility chromosome replication cell division occur stalked cells rather containing evenly dispersed mixture proteins single celled caulobacter resembles highly organized factory specific machinery regulating step cell cycle ensure changes occur developmentally appropriate times dna copied per cycle particular group molecules single dna copy placed half cell mechanisms constricts cells middle separate two shapiro first researcher show bacterial dna replication occurs spatially organized way cell division dependent spatial late shapiro graduate student michael laub able study genetic basis cell cycle progression consequently identification three regulatory proteins dnaa gcra ctra controlled complex temporal spatial behaviors affecting large numbers genes dickon alley janine maddock showed chemoreceptor proteins occupy specific areas within cell shapiro christine jacobswagner well janine maddock showed signaling phosphokinases also specific positions cell poles using timelapse microscopy fluorescent tags shapiro demonstrated chromosomal regions duplicated orderly locationspecific manner involving much higher degree spatial organization previously studying regulation cell cycle asymmetric cell division cellular differentiation shapiros work led much deeper understanding genetic molecular processes cause identical bacterial cells split different cell types basic processes underlie life singlecell bacteria multicellular process caulobacter cell cycle also show similarities stem cell division two distinct cells arise one differs parent cell since work harley mcadams applied insights analysis techniques field electrical circuitry bacteria examine biological systems work genomebased computational modelling particular examination regulatory networks becoming increasingly important systems examining cell cycle control logic caulobacter state machine leads understanding bacterial cell cycle regulation whole cell shapiro founded anacor pharmaceuticals physicist developmental biologist harley mcadams chemist stephen benkovic pennsylvania state design develop new types antibiotics developed novel class small molecules involving boron atom produced one two new antifungal agents created last approved fda treatment toe nail fungus kerydin second drug crisaborole developed treat atopic dermatitis shapiro benkovic fink schimmel founded boragen llc use boron containing library crop shapiro advised clinton administration second bush administration belongs center international security cooperation freeman spogli institute international studies stanford particularly concerned potential impact emerging infectious number issues make infectious diseases particularly significant concern one issue development antibioticresistant microbes emerging result overuse antibiotics since shapiro involved development drugs attack particular bacteria mechanisms drug resistance prevent drugresistant strains developing another concern introduction bacteria previously unexposed populations due increased travel population expansion previously unexplored areas climate includes development zo√∂notic diseases travel one species another address either naturally occurring intentionally developed biological threats essential understand mechanisms involved internally cells populations cells environments shapiro emphasizes importance understanding complexity living
