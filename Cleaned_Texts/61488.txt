european algae biomass association eaba since served head scientific production astaxanthin haematococcus haematococcus pluvialis microalgae extensively researched ability accumulate large quantities astaxanthin pigment potent naturally occurring synthetic version pigment currently used obtaining pinkcolored salmon fish production pigment haematococcus pluvialis enhanced due various environmental stresses limit growth cell light conditions production process characterized transition cells color green red along various chemical biochemical changes within cell widely studied recent years defining conditions pigment accumulated studying biosynthetic process examining possible role pigment protecting cell oxidative stress damage one outcome work development twostage process production astaxanthin algae allowed grow optimal conditions green stage biomass subjected stress conditions high light nutrient deprivation one main challenges largescale production biomass susceptibility infections especially growth medium poor nutrients enabling growth various fungi foreign algae indeed one main pests cause collapse haematococcus pluvialis culture fungus prof boussibas lab fungus researched isolated defined new species paraphyzoderma fungi specific parasite haematococci cells following cultivation sterile conditions life cycle defined mode infection studied results showed special proteins lectins present zeospheres fungi recognize specific sugar moieties upon algal cell wall infection process begins interaction lectins sugar moieties end collapse algae culture prof boussibas researches spanning ten years work basis establishment astaxanthin production plant haematococcus microalgae kibbutz ketura arava valley algatech active since cloning bti bacterial genes anabaena cyanobacteria eradication tropical diseases bacillus thuringiensis bt group bacteria important agent used biological pest control bt gram positive aerobic bacterium sporulation stage produces endotoxin protein crystal high toxicity specificity various insect larvae bt toxins termed insecticidal crystal proteins icps active within intestine thus must digested target organism order act subspecies bacillus thuringienesis israelensis bti isolated prof joel margalit colleagues specific pesticide mosquito larvae black flies transfer large number tropical sometimes fatal diseases subspecies produces crystal composed four main proteins encoded four genes situated single plasmid within bacterium however use bti biological pesticide limited due low survivability rate natural water ponds one ways overcome survivability hurdle clone genes encoding toxin organisms adapted harsh environments question due large species diversity high abundancy natural ponds rice fields cyanobacteria high potential serve carriers endotoxin genes pest control mosquito larvae moreover cyanobacteria able float upper layer water stable varying environmental conditions well throughout entire growth cycles mosquitos feed cyanobacteria lethal combination bti genes cloned prof boussibas laboratory anabaena pcc pioneering work yielded transgenic cyanobacteria stably expressing four different bti genes transgenic lines stable high toxicity larvae moreover survived field conditions longer periods time commercially available bti pesticide since clones considered genetically modified organisms gmo widespread use technology still limited project lasted several years included training many research students several prestigious research grants obtained project example fruitful cooperation two groups leading field prof zaritskys lab prof boussibas transgenic cyanobacteria isolated recent years prof boussibas researches focusing genetic methods improving microalgae aim produce valuable products carotenoids pufa polyunsaturated fatty one results researches development genetic engineering system inserting genes genomes two microalgal species high economical value haematococcus pluvialis increasing production rate astaxanthin parietochloris incisa metabolic engineering pufa prof boussiba led research projects cooperation researchers israel worldwide recent years partner large number projects umbrella program european union recently managed giavap project genetically improved algae valuable ten european two industrial companies israel abroad took part project aimed genetic modification microalgae production valuable meuro prof boussiba also partner israeli consortium solar fuels israeli centers research excellence bengurion university awarded
