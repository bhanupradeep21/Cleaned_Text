sexual fruiting bodies perithecia formed two mycelia different mating type come together see figure like ascomycetes n crassa two mating types case symbolized evident morphological difference mating

starvation appears necessary expression genes involved sexual protoperithecium consists ascogonium coiled multicellular hypha enclosed knotlike aggregation hyphae branched system slender hyphae called trichogyne extends tip ascogonium projecting beyond sheathing hyphae air sexual cycle initiated ie fertilization occurs cell usually conidium opposite mating type contacts part trichogyne see figure

occurring mycelial sheath enveloped ascogonium develops wall perithecium becomes impregnated melanin blackens mature perithecium flaskshaped structure mature perithecium may contain many asci derived identical fusion diploid nuclei ordinarily nature perithecia mature ascospores ejected rather violently air ascospores heat resistant lab require heating minutes induce germination normal strains entire sexual cycle takes days mature ascus containing eight ascospores pairs adjacent spores identical genetic constitution since last division mitotic since ascospores contained ascus sac holds

segregation pattern features n crassa found useful study genetic events occurring individual meioses mature asci perithecium separated microscope slide spores experimentally manipulated studies

repair cancer see adaptive function meiosis see meiosis mating n crassa occur strains different mating type suggests degree outcrossing favored natural selection haploid multicellular fungi n crassa meiosis occurring brief diploid stage one complex processes haploid multicellular vegetative stage although physically much larger diploid stage characteristically simple modular construction little differentiation n crassa recessive mutations affecting diploid stage life cycle quite frequent natural mutations homozygous diploid stage often cause spores maturation defects produce barren fruiting bodies ascospores sexual spores majority homozygous mutations cause abnormal meiosis eg disturbed chromosome pairing disturbed pachytene number genes affecting diploid stage estimated least total number genes thus outcrossing promoted necessity union opposite mating types likely provides benefit masking recessive mutations would otherwise deleterious sexual spore formation see complementation
