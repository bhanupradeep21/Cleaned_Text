pharmacology clearance c l displaystyle cltot pharmacokinetic parameter representing efficiency drug elimination rate elimination substance divided parameter also indicates theoretical volume plasma substance would completely removed per unit time usually clearance measured lh quantity reflects rate drug elimination divided plasma concentration excretion hand measurement amount substance removed body per unit time eg mgmin μgmin etc clearance excretion substance related thing concept clearance described thomas addis graduate university edinburgh medical school substances body cleared various organs including kidneys liver lungs etc thus total body clearance equal sum clearance substance organ eg renal clearance hepatic clearance lung clearance total body clearance many drugs however clearance solely function renal excretion cases clearance almost synonymous renal clearance renal plasma clearance substance specific clearance depends substance handled nephron clearance function glomerular filtration secretion peritubular capillaries nephron reabsorption nephron back peritubular capillaries clearance variable zeroorder kinetics constant amount drug eliminated per unit time constant firstorder kinetics amount drug eliminated per unit time changes concentration drug clearance refer volume plasma substance removed ie cleared per unit time cases intercompartmental clearances discussed referring redistribution body compartments plasma muscle clearance substance volume plasma contains amount substance removed plasma per unit referring function kidney clearance considered amount liquid filtered blood gets processed kidneys amount blood cleaned per time units volumetric flow rate volume per unit time however refer real value kidney completely remove substance total renal plasma mass transfer physiologically volumetric blood flow dialysis machine andor kidney one several factors determine blood concentration removal substance body factors include mass transfer coefficient dialysate flow dialysate recirculation flow hemodialysis glomerular filtration rate tubular reabsorption rate kidney physiologic interpretation clearance steadystate clearance ratio mass generation blood plasma concentration definition follows differential equation describes exponential decay used model kidney function hemodialysis machine function definitions follows c displaystyle frac dcdt first derivative concentration respect time ie change concentration time derived mass balance clearance substance sometimes expressed inverse time constant describes removal rate body divided volume distribution total body water steadystate defined mass generation rate substance equals mass removal rate divided concentration blood important relationship clearance

substances exhibit substantial plasma protein binding clearance generally dependent total concentration free proteinbound free plasma substances primarily free concentrations regulated thus remains extensive protein binding increases total plasma concentration free proteinbound decreases clearance compared would case substance bind however mass removal rate depends concentration free substance independent plasma protein binding even fact plasma proteins increase concentration distal renal glomerulus plasma filtered bowmans capsule relative increases concentrations substanceprotein nonoccupied protein equal therefore give net binding dissociation substances plasma proteins thus giving constant plasma concentration free substance throughout glomerulus also would case without plasma protein binding sites kidneys however clearance made membrane transport proteins rather filtration extensive plasma protein binding may increase clearance keeping concentration free substance fairly constant throughout capillary bed inhibiting decrease clearance caused decreased concentration free substance capillary equation derived mass balance words equation states since equation rewritten one lumps gen terms together ie gen displaystyle dot mdot mtextindot mtextgen divides δ displaystyle delta result difference equation one applies limit δ displaystyle delta tto one obtains differential equation using product rule rewritten one assumes volume change significant ie c v displaystyle cfrac result equation general solution differential equation solution differential equation time infinity steady state equation rewritten equation makes clear relationship mass removal clearance states constant mass generation concentration clearance vary inversely one another applied creatinine ie creatinine clearance follows equation serum creatinine doubles clearance halves serum creatinine quadruples clearance quartered renal clearance measured timed collection urine analysis composition aid following equation follows directly derivation substance c creatinine endogenous chemical excreted filtration clearance approximation glomerular filtration rate inulin clearance less commonly used precisely determine glomerular filtration rate note equation valid steadystate condition substance cleared constant plasma concentration ie steadystate k must obtained full solution
