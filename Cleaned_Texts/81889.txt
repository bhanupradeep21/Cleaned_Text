algae bioreactor used cultivating micro macroalgae algae may cultivated purposes biomass production seaweed cultivator wastewater treatment fixation aquariumpond filtration form algae algae bioreactors vary widely design falling broadly two categories open reactors enclosed reactors open reactors exposed atmosphere enclosed reactors also commonly called photobioreactors isolated varying extents atmosphere specifically algae bioreactors used produce fuels biodiesel bioethanol generate animal feed reduce pollutants nox flue gases power plants fundamentally kind bioreactor based photosynthetic reaction performed chlorophyllcontaining algae using dissolved carbon dioxide sunlight carbon dioxide dispersed reactor fluid make accessible algae bioreactor made transparent material first microalgae cultivation unicellular chlorella vulgaris dutch microbiologist martinus beijerinck later world war ii germany used open ponds increase algal cultivation use protein first experiments aim cultivating algae conducted carnegie institution science washington experiments monocellular chlorella cultivated adding minerals goal research cultivation algae produce cheap animal algae primarily eukaryotic photoautotrophic organisms perform oxygenic photosynthesis types algae classified lightharvesting pigments give green algae species also known chlorophyta often used bioreactors due high growth rate ability withstand variety environments bluegreen algae also known cyanobacteria classified prokaryotic photoautotrophs due lack nucleus light provides essential energy cell needs metabolize nitrogen phosphorus essential nutrients wavelengths intensities light important available also important factor growth due lower concentration atmosphere supplementary added seen bubble column pbr microalgae also possess ability take excess nitrogen phosphorus starvation conditions essential lipid amino acid synthesis higher temperatures ph also common factors may vary species species important correct environmental conditions designing bioreactors sort bioreactors divided two broad categories open systems photobioreactors prb difference two reactors exposure surrounding environment open systems fully exposed atmosphere pbrs limited exposure atmosphere simplest system yields low production operation cost ponds need rotating mixer avoid settling algal biomass however systems prone contamination due lack environmental modified version simple pond raceway pond uses paddle wheels drive flow certain pond continuously collecting biomass providing carbon dioxide nutrients back pond typically raceway ponds large due low water less common systems include incline cascade system flow gravitydriven retention tank gets pumped back start system yield high biomass densities also entails higher operating nowadays basic types algae photobioreactors differentiated determining factor unifying parameter available intensity sunlight energy plate reactor simply consists inclined vertically arranged translucent rectangular boxes often divided two parts affect agitation reactor fluid generally boxes arranged system linking connections also used making process fillingemptying introduction gas transport nutritive substances introduction flue gas mostly occurs bottom box ensure carbon dioxide enough time interact algae reactor fluid typically plates illuminated sides high light penetration disadvantages flat plate design limited pressure tolerance high space tubular reactor consists vertically horizontally arranged tubes connected together algaesuspended fluid circulates tubes generally made transparent plastics borosilicate glass constant circulation kept pump end system introduction gas takes place endbeginning tube system way introducing gas causes problem carbon dioxide deficiency high concentration oxygen end unit circulation ultimately making process inefficient growth microalgae walls tubes inhibit penetration light bubble column photo reactor consists vertically arranged cylindrical columns made transparent material introduction gas takes place bottom column causes turbulent stream enable optimum gas exchange bubbling also acts natural agitator light typically sourced outside column however recent designs introduce lights inside column increase light distribution cultivation algae photobioreactor creates narrow range industrial application possibilities three common pathways cultivated biomass algae may used environmental improvements biofuel production power already established research facilities
