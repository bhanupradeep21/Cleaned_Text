symmetry biology refers symmetry observed organisms including plants animals fungi bacteria external symmetry easily seen looking organism example face human plane symmetry centre pine cone displays clear symmetrical spiral pattern internal features also show symmetry example tubes human body responsible transporting gases nutrients waste products cylindrical several planes symmetry biological symmetry thought balanced distribution duplicate body parts shapes within body organism importantly unlike mathematics symmetry biology always approximate example plant leaves considered symmetrical rarely match exactly folded half symmetry one class patterns nature whereby nearrepetition pattern element either reflection rotation sponges placozoans represent two groups animals show symmetry ie asymmetrical body plans multicellular organisms exhibit defined form symmetry types symmetry possible body plans radial cylindrical bilateral biradial spherical classification viruses organism remains controversial viruses also contain icosahedral symmetry importance symmetry illustrated fact groups animals traditionally defined feature taxonomic groupings radiata animals radial symmetry formed one four branches georges cuviers classification animal meanwhile bilateria taxonomic grouping still used today represent organisms embryonic bilateral symmetry organisms radial symmetry show repeating pattern around central axis separated several identical pieces cut central point much like pieces pie typically involves repeating body part times around axis referred tetramerism pentamerism hexamerism octamerism respectively organisms exhibit left right sides top bottom surface front back george cuvier classified animals radial symmetry taxon radiata generally accepted assemblage different animal phyla share single common ancestor polyphyletic radially symmetric animals symmetrical axis extending center oral surface contains mouth center opposite aboral end animals phyla cnidaria echinodermata generally show radial although many sea anemones corals within cnidaria bilateral symmetry defined single structure radial symmetry especially suitable sessile animals sea anemone floating animals jellyfish slow moving organisms starfish whereas bilateral symmetry favours locomotion generating streamlined body many flowers also radially symmetric actinomorphic roughly identical floral structures petals sepals stamens occur regular intervals around axis flower often female reproductive organ containing carpel style threefold triradial symmetry present trilobozoa late ediacaran period fourfold tetramerism appears jellyfish aurelia marginalis immediately obvious looking jellyfish due presence four gonads visible translucent body radial symmetry ecologically important allowing jellyfish detect respond stimuli mainly food danger directions flowering plants show fivefold pentamerism many flowers fruits easily seen arrangement five carpels seed pockets apple cut transversely among animals echinoderms sea stars sea urchins sea lilies pentamerous adults five arms arranged around mouth bilaterian animals however initially develop mirror symmetry larvae gain pentaradial symmetry hexamerism found corals sea anemones class anthozoa divided two groups based symmetry common corals subclass hexacorallia hexameric body plan polyps sixfold internal symmetry number tentacles multiple six octamerism found corals subclass octocorallia polyps eight tentacles octameric radial symmetry octopus however bilateral symmetry despite eight arms icosahedral symmetry occurs organism contains subunits generated faces equilateral triangle corners within icosahedron symmetry many viruses including canine parvovirus show form symmetry due presence icosahedral viral shell symmetry evolved allows viral particle built repetitive subunits consisting limited number structural proteins encoded viral genes thereby saving space viral genome icosahedral symmetry still maintained subunits factors example tomato bushy stunt virus protein subunits copies structural although viruses often referred spherical show true mathematical spherical symmetry early century ernst haeckel described haeckel number species radiolaria whose skeletons shaped like various regular polyhedra examples include circoporus octahedrus circogonia icosahedra lithocubus geometricus circorrhegma dodecahedra shapes creatures obvious names tetrahedral symmetry present callimitra agnesae spherical symmetry characterised ability draw endless great finite number symmetry axes body means spherical symmetry occurs organism able cut two identical halves cut runs organisms center true spherical symmetry found animal body organisms show approximate spherical symmetry include freshwater green alga bacteria often referred spherical shape bacteria categorized based shapes three classes cocci sphericalshaped bacillus rodshaped spirochetes spiralshaped cells reality severe oversimplification bacterial cells curved bent flattened oblong spheroids many due huge number bacteria considered cocci coccus single cell unlikely show true spherical symmetry important distinguish generalized use word spherical describe organisms ease true meaning spherical symmetry situation seen description viruses spherical viruses necessarily show spherical symmetry usually icosahedral organisms bilateral symmetry contain single plane symmetry sagittal plane divides organism two roughly mirror image left right halves approximate reflectional symmetry animals bilateral symmetry classified large group called bilateria contains animals comprising phyla million described species bilaterians asymmetrical features example human heart liver positioned asymmetrically despite body external bilateral bilateral symmetry bilaterians complex trait develops due expression many genes bilateria two axes polarity first anteriorposterior ap axis visualised imaginary axis running head mouth tail end organism second dorsalventral dv axis runs perpendicular ap development ap axis always specified dv known second embryonic axis ap axis essential defining polarity bilateria allowing development front back give organism direction front end encounters environment rest body sensory organs eyes tend clustered also site mouth develops since first part body encounter food therefore distinct head sense organs connected central nervous system tends pattern development distinct head tail called cephalization also argued development ap axis important locomotion bilateral symmetry gives body intrinsic direction allows streamlining reduce drag addition animals flowers plants also show bilateral symmetry plants referred zygomorphic include orchid orchidaceae pea fabaceae families figwort family leaves plants also commonly show approximate bilateral symmetry biradial symmetry found organisms show morphological features internal external bilateral radial symmetry unlike radially symmetrical organisms divided equally along many planes biradial organisms cut equally along two planes could represent intermediate stage evolution bilateral symmetry radially symmetric animal group

biradial symmetry especially considering internal external features common originally accounted like traits organisms symmetry indeed asymmetry evolves due advantage organism process natural selection involves changes frequency symmetryrelated genes throughout time early flowering plants radially symmetric flowers since many plants evolved bilaterally symmetrical flowers evolution bilateral

expression genes allows expression influence developmental pathways relating example antirrhinum majus cycloidea expressed early development dorsal domain flower meristem continues expressed later dorsal petals control size shape believed evolution specialized pollinators may play part transition radially symmetrical flowers bilaterally symmetrical symmetry often selected evolution animals unsurprising since asymmetry often indication unfitness either defects development injuries throughout lifetime apparent mating females species select males highly symmetrical features example facial symmetry influences human judgements human additionally female barn swallows species adults long tail streamers prefer mate males symmetrical symmetry known selection evolutionary history different
