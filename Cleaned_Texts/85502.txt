ventriculitis inflammation ventricles brain ventricles responsible containing circulating cerebrospinal fluid throughout brain ventriculitis caused infection ventricles leading swelling inflammation especially prevalent patients external ventricular drains intraventricular ventriculitis cause wide variety shortterm symptoms longterm side effects ranging headaches dizziness unconsciousness death treated early treated appropriate combination antibiotics order rid patient underlying infection much current research involving ventriculitis focuses specifically around defining disease causes allow much advancement also lot attention paid possible treatments prevention methods help make disease even less prevalent dangerous great deal variety symptoms associated ventriculitis symptoms vary based number different factors including severity inflammation underlying cause individual patient patients often present headaches painful cranial pressure neck pain early progression disease patients advanced infection known complain many neurological effects dizziness vertigo confusion slurred speech advanced cases lead mental instability nausea vomiting rigors temporary loss consciousness many patients ventriculitis also experience degree hydrocephalus buildup cerebrospinal fluid due inability ventricles reabsorb correctly circulate brain abscess another common disorder resulting inflammation left untreated ventriculitis lead serious inhibition mental function even death symptoms vary greatly part underlying causing infection inflammation cause number effects mentioned previously base infection could cause symptoms dont necessarily ventriculitis one challenges doctors face diagnosing ventriculitis distinguishing indicative symptoms spite wide variety possible presentations disease great deal emphasis put research better faster ways diagnose ventriculitis without delay inherent microbiological testing cerebrospinal progression disease also largely dependent nature specific case depending underlying infection way entered brain type timing treatment infection may spread withdraw order months days ventriculitis serious condition treated early ensure little lasting damage possible ventriculitis caused infection ventricles causing immune response lining turn leads inflammation ventriculitis truth complication initial infection abnormality underlying infection come form number different bacteria viruses data seems point staphylococci leading bacterial cause infection leading ventriculitis present generally concern way infection entered ventricles brain natural state protected infection barrier serves keep pathogens entering sensitive areas brain however natural defenses bypassed hospital setting brain suddenly exposed host potentially harmful bacteria viruses patients invasive brain surgery procedures considered risk experiencing ventriculitis two procedures particular studied extensively due high rate ventriculitis contractions post operation first group consists patients external ventricular drain implanted allow physicians reduce intracranial pressure experience duration drain implanted varies necessity however longer drain likely infection second group consists patients implanted intracranial stent groups patients much higher rate ventriculitis general populace though little supporting evidence due lack definition ventriculitis frequent misdiagnosis nearly patients external ventricular drain experience infectionbased meningitis ventriculitis commonly diagnosed using variety tests procedures physician suspects patient ventriculitis first step typically ascertain presence inflammation using computed tomography ct magnetic resonance imaging mri technology take picture brain scans allow physicians check intraventricular debris pus abnormal periventricular subependymal signal intensity enhancement ventricular lining indicate likelihood mris reported highly effective sensitive detecting indicators even early stage determining whether patient shows signs ventriculitis doctor may choose pursue specific useful diagnosis find cause ventriculitis done obtaining sample cerebrospinal fluid commonly via procedure called lumbar puncture spinal tap patients implanted external ventricular drain cerebrospinal fluid collected drains output sample fluid obtained battery tests featuring gram staining performed identify offending pathogen infection agent test also determine resistance pathogen may antibiotics identifying viral bacterial cause ventriculitis doctors able effectively treat inflammation infection procedure fairly effective rarely able isolate anaerobic organisms may causing inflammation giving cause research procedural though present similar symptoms often occur tandem meningitis ventriculitis two different diseases physicians must able distinguish two meningitis inflammation protective lining central nervous system called meninges similar pathologies cause two types inflammation difficult differentiate using chemical testing show different visual effects mri ct scans hence use validation patient fact ventriculitis another similar condition treatment ventriculitis critical left untreated could lead severe brain damage even death cases currently commonly employed treatments ventriculitis involve antibiotic regimen targeting underlying infection causing inflammation typically physician order patient placed broadspectrum antibiotics order manage symptoms control infection cerebrospinal fluid samples analyzed specific bacterial viral cause found doctor change treatment accordingly debate effective antibiotics best ways introduce drugs eg intravenously orally etc however agreed drug effectiveness limited difficulty noninvasively allowing drugs enter cerebrospinal intracranial pressure reach unsafe levels patient may need cerebrospinal fluid drained implanted external ventricular drains one common ways manage monitor intracranial pressure however several risks involved invasive procedure including risk infection great deal research focused around prevention ventriculitis crucial procedure involving exposing brain performed utmost care infections brain dangerous potentially deadly patients undergo procedures often monitored closely next several days ensure infections instance even small headache treated seriously also necessary monitor intracranial pressure patients often enough observe significant changes could indicate presence infection ensuing ventriculitis important measure pressure often however could fact lead infection due poor definition condition ventriculitis still great deal known dangerous condition similar conditions meningitis encephalitis thoroughly researched ventriculitis loose grouping conditions characterized fact lining ventricles inflamed solid definition accepted across medical community research subject slow however common research ventriculitis focused main points causation demographic information effectiveness treatments prevention methods one key areas research ventriculitis discovering defining exactly causes many bacterial viral infections could cause inflammation ventricles researchers trying define common pathogens risk levels associated various medical operations procedures symptoms vary much casebycase answering questions allow doctors better understand ventriculitis better treat prevent well currently little understanding increased risk ventriculitis undergone neurosurgery procedures involving brain exposure even current clinical practices cant predict patients order predict populations focused researchers must gather case information diagnosed ventriculitis present essence medical community must compile data many details possible case generalized conclusions may drawn little currently known ventriculitis defined affects even less known prevention methods treatment fairly standard infection degree prevention different matter one popular theory use prophylactic antibiotics administered insertion external ventricular drains ventricular stents hope preventing results studies less inconclusive due lack standardized protocol
