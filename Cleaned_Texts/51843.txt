director phil robb lead designer chris ashton cofounders turtle rock studios alongside michael team heritage developing competitive multiplayer games valves counterstrike series left dead according robb team wanted build cooperative multiplayer game gave team chance play family friends together instead found offered enjoyable experience competitive multiplayer concept evolve completed development first left dead however evolve project put hold turtle rock thought technology time advanced enough handle games turtle rock studios merged valve early split away later year company reestablished staff members new company turtle rock studios hoped make use popularity left dead franchise create something ambitious massive people forgot eighth generation video game consoles released team realized could create almost anything wanted reviewed previous projects eventually chose evolve seemed straightforward concept team also considered new project proving ground project could show ability build largescale game beyond providing assistance development evolve officially began early evolve inspired hunting games cabelas big game hunter deer hunter members turtle rock studios including robb ashton thought gameplay hunting games animaltracking seldom incorporated action result came original concept evolve players failed hunting animals could attacked targets instead typical big game animals elephants lions team imagined king changed alien monster team picked scifi setting allowing add creative unrealistic things game team also took concept boss battles expanded upon using concept key idea developing evolve team envisioned evolve video game version goal evolve create experience new video game evolve carried game mechanics left dead others discarded team originally thought could added artificial intelligence system evolves wildlife later scrapped thought core experience offered evolve tracking hunting monster instead getting attacked wildlife constantly team also thought would become irritation added many complex mechanics developer also intentionally chose make evolve actionpacked time introduced segments would require players slow track monster robb explained design team wanted create contrast players could appreciate action chaotic moments experiencing less exciting design team deciding number hunters match chose four believed optimal number team players would lose track stats health players also allowed players work collaboratively character would get left behind neglected team monsters perspective design team thought four hunters engaging combat monster would provide challenge monster could find difficulties keeping track hunters would make match feel hunter team divided several different classes makes senses according turtle rock order showcase features abilities different classes class different variations appearances costume colors designed make characters recognizable memorable another reason design team wanted monster adapt use different strategies dealing different hunters turtle rock considered way effectively extend evolves replayability would add variety originally four hunter characters evolve design team experimented freetoplay model list characters expanded titular evolve game mechanic inspired bomb planting mode counterstrike series monsters started relatively weak creature could defeated easily becomes stronger gains skills evolves early playtesters complained game mechanic thought would bring unfair disadvantage hunters since evolve like monster however design team still chose maintain game mechanic thought would create engaging experience ashton added game mechanics create turning tables feeling hunters thought sudden change strategy offensive defensive could help deliver dynamic experience monster originally intended play firstperson perspective later shifted thirdperson perspective development firstperson control system considered clumsy confusing first person perspective took control away players design team considered designing thirdperson gameplay challenge prior experience creating games hand design team implemented firstperson gameplay hunters evolves development started design team thought firstperson perspective would provide sense tension players would able see behind evolves environments based earths design team wanted create world felt believable players regions made geological sense early concept design found extreme result design team drew inspiration realworld design team wanted evolve set lush forests hunters monsters could hide design team tried using source game engine create forest landscape ultimately failed design team researched cryteks cryengine powers games like far cry crysis design team felt far cry crysis set new standards ingame environments decided utilize cryengine evolves maps designed dark mysterious various characters hide well presenting sense surprise players evolve multiplayerfocused design team put less time focus developing evolves narrative conversations characters reduced multiplayer mode design team thought would negatively impact conversations players however story narrative became significant singleplayer mode evolve adapt traditional storytelling methods use campaign mode instead players learn hunters backstory fictional world shear slowly progressing evolve playing different characters would also lead different conversations dialogues evolve features cthulhuinspired artstyle result much wildlife intentionally designed feature tentacles robb previously drawn lot esoteric monster designs publisher thq time thought designs looked unique would benefit game team began developing marketing monsters stereotypical original goliath based lobster changed hybrid king kong
