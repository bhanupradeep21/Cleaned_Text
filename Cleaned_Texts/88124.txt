mainly spread via bite mosquitoes aedes also sexually transmitted potentially spread blood infections pregnant women spread diagnosis testing blood urine saliva presence viruss rna person sick blood antibodies symptoms present prevention involves decreasing mosquito bites areas disease occurs proper use efforts prevent bites include use insect repellent covering much body clothing mosquito nets getting rid standing water mosquitoes effective health officials recommended women areas affected zika outbreak consider putting pregnancy pregnant women travel specific treatment paracetamol
