asexual reproduction type reproduction involve fusion gametes change number chromosomes offspring arise asexual reproduction either unicellular multicellular organisms inherit full set genes single parent thus newly created individual genetically physically similar parent exact clone parent asexual reproduction primary form reproduction singlecelled organisms archaea bacteria many eukaryotic organisms including plants animals fungi also reproduce vertebrates common form asexual reproduction parthenogenesis typically used alternative sexual reproduction times reproductive opportunities limited komodo dragons monitor lizards reproduce prokaryotes reproduce without formation fusion gametes mechanisms lateral gene transfer conjugation transformation transduction likened sexual reproduction sense genetic recombination prokaryotes archaea bacteria reproduce asexually binary fission parent organism divides two produce two genetically identical daughter organisms eukaryotes protists unicellular fungi may reproduce functionally similar manner mitosis also capable sexual reproduction multiple fission cellular level occurs many protists eg sporozoans algae nucleus parent cell divides several times mitosis producing several nuclei cytoplasm separates creating multiple daughter apicomplexans multiple fission schizogony appears either merogony sporogony gametogony merogony results merozoites multiple daughter cells originate within cell sporogony results sporozoites gametogony results microgametes cells divide budding example bakers yeast resulting mother daughter cell initially smaller parent budding also known multicellular level animal example reproduces budding buds grow fully matured individuals eventually break away parent organism internal budding process asexual reproduction favoured parasites toxoplasma gondii involves unusual process two endodyogeny endopolygeny daughter cells produced inside mother cell consumed offspring prior also budding external internal occurs worms like taenia echinococcus worms produce cysts produce invaginated evaginated protoscolex budding vegetative propagation type asexual reproduction found plants new individuals formed without production seeds spores thus without syngamy examples vegetative reproduction include formation miniaturized plants called plantlets specialized leaves example kalanchoe bryophyllum daigremontianum many produce new plants rhizomes stolon example strawberry plants reproduce forming bulbs tubers example tulip bulbs dahlia tubers examples individuals clones clonal population may cover large many multicellular organisms produce spores biological life cycle process called sporogenesis exceptions animals protists undergo meiosis immediately followed fertilization plants many algae hand undergo sporic meiosis meiosis leads formation haploid spores rather gametes spores grow multicellular individuals called gametophytes without fertilization event haploid individuals produce gametes mitosis meiosis gamete formation therefore occur separate multicellular generations phases life cycle referred alternation generations since sexual reproduction often narrowly defined fusion gametes fertilization spore formation plant sporophytes algae might considered form asexual reproduction agamogenesis despite result meiosis undergoing reduction ploidy however events spore formation fertilization necessary complete sexual reproduction plant life cycle fungi algae also utilize true asexual spore formation involves mitosis giving rise reproductive cells called mitospores develop new organism dispersal method reproduction found example conidial fungi red algae polysiphonia involves sporogenesis without meiosis thus chromosome number spore cell parent producing spores however mitotic sporogenesis exception spores plants many algae produced fragmentation form asexual reproduction new organism grows fragment parent fragment develops mature fully grown individual fragmentation seen many organisms animals reproduce asexually include planarians many annelid worms including turbellarians sea stars many fungi plants reproduce asexually plants specialized structures reproduction via fragmentation gemmae mosses liverworts lichens symbiotic union fungus photosynthetic algae cyanobacteria reproduce fragmentation ensure new individuals contain symbionts fragments take form soredia dustlike particles consisting fungal hyphae wrapped around photobiont cells clonal fragmentation multicellular colonial organisms form asexual reproduction cloning organism split fragments fragments develop mature fully grown individuals clones original organism echinoderms method reproduction usually known due many environmental epigenetic differences clones originating ancestor might actually genetically epigenetically agamogenesis form reproduction involve male gamete examples parthenogenesis apomixis parthenogenesis form agamogenesis unfertilized egg develops new individual documented parthenogenesis occurs wild many invertebrates eg water fleas rotifers aphids stick insects ants bees parasitic wasps vertebrates mostly reptiles amphibians fish also documented domestic birds genetically altered lab plants engage parthenogenesis well process called apomixis however process considered many independent reproduction method instead breakdown mechanisms behind sexual parthenogenetic organisms split two main categories facultative obligate facultative parthenogenesis females reproduce sexually many advantages sexual reproduction facultative parthenotes reproduce asexually forced typically occurs instances finding mate becomes difficult example female zebra sharks reproduce asexually unable find mate ocean parthenogenesis previously believed rarely occur vertebrates possible small animals however discovered many species recent years today largest species documented reproducing parthenogenically komodo dragon feet long heterogony form facultative parthenogenesis females alternate sexual asexual reproduction regular intervals see alternation sexual asexual reproduction aphids one group organism engages type reproduction use asexual reproduction reproduce quickly create winged offspring colonize new plants reproduce sexually fall lay eggs next however aphid species obligate obligate parthenogenesis females reproduce one example desert grassland whiptail lizard hybrid two species typically hybrids infertile parthenogenesis species able develop stable gynogenesis form obligate parthenogenesis sperm cell used initiate reproduction however sperms genes never get incorporated egg cell best known example amazon molly obligate parthenotes males species depend males closely related species sailfin molly apomixis plants formation new sporophyte without fertilization important ferns flowering plants rare seed plants flowering plants term apomixis often used agamospermy formation seeds without fertilization used include vegetative reproduction example apomictic plant would triploid european dandelion apomixis mainly occurs two forms gametophytic apomixis embryo arises unfertilized egg within diploid embryo sac formed without completing meiosis nucellar embryony embryo formed diploid nucellus tissue surrounding embryo sac nucellar embryony occurs citrus seeds

freshwater crustacean daphnia reproduces parthenogenesis spring rapidly populate ponds switches sexual reproduction intensity competition predation increases monogonont rotifers genus brachionus
