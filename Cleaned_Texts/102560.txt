pemphigus vulgaris rare chronic blistering skin disease common form pemphigus pemphigus derived greek word pemphix meaning classified type ii hypersensitivity reaction antibodies formed desmosomes components skin function keep certain layers skin bound desmosomes attacked layers skin separate clinical picture resembles blister blisters due acantholysis breaking apart intercellular connections autoantibodymediated time condition inevitably progresses without treatment lesions increase size distribution throughout body behaving physiologically like severe burn advent modern treatments mortality disease close today mortality rate treatment due introduction corticosteroids primary nevertheless pemphigus vulgaris fourth common cause death due skin disorder thus still deemed potentially fatal disease mainly affects middleaged older adults years old historically higher incidence pemphigus vulgaris commonly presents oral blisters buccal palatine mucosa especially also includes cutaneous blisters mucosal surfaces conjunctiva nose esophagus penis vulva vagina cervix anus may also affected flaccid blisters skin frequently seen sparing skin covering palms blisters commonly erode leave ulcerated lesions erosions positive nikolsky sign induction blistering normal skin edge blister indicative severe pain chewing lead weight loss pemphigus autoimmune disease caused antibodies directed desmoglein desmoglein present desmosomes loss desmosomes results loss cohesion keratinocytes epidermis disruption barrier function served intact skin process classified type ii hypersensitivity reaction antibodies bind antigens bodys tissues histology basal keratinocytes usually still attached basement membrane leading characteristic appearance called tombstoning transudative fluid accumulates keratinocytes basal layer suprabasal split forming blister resulting known positive nikolskys sign contrasting feature bullous pemphigoid thought due antihemidesmosome antibodies detachment occurs epidermis dermis subepidermal bullae clinically pemphigus vulgaris characterized extensive flaccid blisters mucocutaneous erosions severity disease well mucosal lesions believed directly proportional levels desmoglein milder forms pemphigus like foliacious erythematoses antidesmoglein heavy disease arises often middleaged older people usually starting blister ruptures easily also start blisters mouth lesions become quite extensive rare disease diagnosis often complicated takes long time early disease patients may erosions mouth blisters skin blisters itchy painful theoretically blisters demonstrate positive nikolskys sign skin sloughs slight rubbing always reliable gold standard diagnosis punch biopsy area around lesion examined direct immunofluorescent staining cells acantholytic lacking normal intercellular connections hold together also seen tzanck smear cells basically rounded nucleated keratinocytes formed due antibody mediated damage cell adhesion protein desmoglein pemphigus vulgaris easily confused impetigo candidiasis considered pathogenic diagnosis confirmed testing infections cause conditions lack response antibiotic corticosteroids immunosuppressive medications historically employed reduce pemphigus symptoms yet steroids associated serious longlasting side effects use limited much possible intravenous immunoglobulin mycophenolate mofetil methotrexate azathioprine cyclophosphamide also used varying degrees success established alternative steroids monoclonal antibodies rituximab increasingly used
