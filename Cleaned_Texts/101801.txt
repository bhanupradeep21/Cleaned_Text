brachyhyops extinct genus entelodont artiodactyl mammal lived eocene epoch western north america southeastern asia including mongolia china first fossil remains brachyhyops recorded late eocene deposits beaver divide central wyoming discovered paleontology crews carnegie museum natural history early century type species brachyhyops wyomingensis based single skull named eh colbert officially described latter half century additional specimens north america recorded saskatchewan far south texas indicating brachyhyops broad distribution welldispersed throughout western north america recent discoveries eocene deposits mongolia lead recognition second species brachyhyops b notable oldest specimens brachyhyops middle eocene age recorded exclusively southern asia whereas specimens late eocene occur northern part implies genus brachyhyops likely originated southern asia migrated north eventually dispersed western north america crew members carnegie museum paleontological expedition discovered holotype brachyhyops wyomingensis cm uppermost beds eocene white river formation member known big sand draw sandstone lentil beaver divide specimen consists single exceptionally well preserved severely distorted isolated skull mandibles post cranial material since initial discovery several partial specimens brachyhyops recorded within north america asia currently four species brachyhyops recognized two asia two within north america include brachyhyops trofimovi mongolia b neimongoliensis northern china b viensis saskatchewan canada wyoming new mexico usa lastly b wyomingensis wyoming utah texas usa holotype cm brachyhyops wyomingensis diagnosed edwin h colbert medium sized skull relatively short snout length comparable skull modern peccary portion skull behind eye socket greater compared portion skull front eye socket due short size snout dentition indicating upper jaw number incisors canines premolars molars respectively compared b wyomingensis helohyus chaeropotamus achaenodon parahyus based tooth shape mandibles preserved holotype specimen therefore dentition lower jaws could determined overall width skull broad widely separated parietal crests addition zygomatic arches deepened expanded behind eye socket contributing wide skull shape similar entelodonts rear portion eye socket closed situated directly last two molars articulation surfaces lower jaws glenoids broad shallow situated around occlusal line upper cheek teeth paroccipital processes short parietals weakly developed basicranium occiput considered basal brachyhyops artiodactyl poorly resolved evolutionary status continues subject revision initially classified brachyhyops strictly within bunodontids based bunodontlike tooth shape recent studies revised evolutionary relationship brachyhyops recognized basal entelodontid might represent origin clade also includes members oligocene archaeotherium miocene daeodon brachyhyops named colbert also said type species b wyomingensis assigned artiodactyla colbert assigned suina effinger assigned entelodontidae carroll eoentelodon synonymized subjectively brachyhyops lucas emry brachyhyops yunnanensis however vislobokova determined eoentelodon distinct brachyhyops closely related proentelodon another primitive entelodont found slightly older middle eocene strata mongolia placed eoentelodon proentelodon subfamily fossils uncovered texas uintah county utah saskatchewan canada well jiangsu china oldest fossil material assigned brachyhyops early upper eocene age recorded six asian localities predominantly mongolia china lone exception single location kazakhstan currently two localities southern asia yield oldest brachyhyops material known first locality situated northwestern yunnan southern china specimens brachyhyops sp recorded early middle late middle eocene xiangshan formation brachyhyops specimens lower middle eocene recorded northern asia instead four remaining localities younger late eocene age include southeastern mongolian taxa b trofimovi ergilin dzo formation khoer dzan locality brachyhyops sp ergilin dzo formation ergilin dzo single taxon b neimongolensis recorded upper eocene ulan gochu formation northern lastly material assigned eoentelodon sp revised brachyhyops sp tsubamoto et recorded lower aksyir svita eastern kazakhstan later correlated late eocene ergilian asian land mammal age alma emry et lucas et brachyhyops oldest entelodont north america recorded exclusively late eocene late duchesnean early chadronian age geographic range restricted western north america spans saskatchewan canada far south big bend texas usa total nine localities yielded brachyhyops material cypress hills formation saskatchewan canada suggests early chadronian age approximately represents type locality brachyhyops viensis well northernmost area brachyhyops specimens recorded apparently undocumented brachyhyops specimen recorded late eocene white river formation montana however exact museum location specimen housed remains three localities wyoming yielded brachyhyops material include partial skull roof maxilla lower white river formation late eocene flagstaff rim wyoming based size tooth shape specimens assigned b next locality wyoming type locality b wyomingensis recorded big sand draw lentil white river formation beaver divide comprises single skull without mandibles third locality yielded cranial fragments assigned b viensis recorded lower strata white river formation canyon creek approximately km east beaver additional brachyhyops wyomingensis material recorded single location northeastern utah namely lapoint member duchesne river formation age approximately based radioisotopic dates nearby volcanic two localities within new mexico yielded brachyhyops material include single molar lower jaw assigned b viensis recorded within duchesnean interval galisteo formation north central new mexico late duchesnean additional specimen recorded upper baca formation mariano mesa west central new mexico also situated within duchesnean specimen comprises single premolar four molars single right lower jaw assigned b wyomingensis based shape dimensions teeth final locality within north america located transpecos texas usa contains well documented records brachyhyops wyomingensis late duchesnean porvenir local fauna situated volcanic ash radioisotopically dated fact stratigraphic overlap northern southern asian brachyhyops specimens suggests brachyhyops originated southern asia early late middle eocene continuously dispersed northern asia long term exposure beringian land bridge late eocene promoted continuous intercontinental dispersal asia north america resulting dispersal diversification brachyhyops across western north america late dentition brachyhyops heterodont forms complex set different teeth including incisors large canines premolars molars used capture process wide variety food items including meat vegetation despite heterodont tooth condition considerable amount debate regarding diet brachyhyops various entelodontids similar dentition archaeotherium daeodon researchers proposed different dietary hypotheses based heterodont dentition shape teeth interpreting entelodontids rooting piglike even active based wear grooves dentition studying wellpreserved fossils reevaluated interpretations performed several modeled analyses regarding wear patterns dentition structure skull particular growth series muscle reconstruction skull concluded omnivorous diet archeaotherium likely brachyhyops scavenging active hunting appears played possible role habitat brachyhyops occurred appears savannahwoodland open grassland lived alongside diversity herbivores
