brown rats possess metacognition mental ability previously found humans analysis suggested may following simple operant conditioning brown rats capable producing ultrasonic vocalizations pups young rats use different types ultrasonic cries elicit direct maternal search well regulate mothers movements although pups produce ultrasounds around rats age days days old significantly reduce ultrasound

multiple ejaculation also means males mate multiple females exhibit ejaculatory series several oestrous females males also copulate shorter intervals group mating females often switch dominant males
