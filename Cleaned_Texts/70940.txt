input may best space adaptation syndrome space sickness kind motion sickness occur ones surroundings visually appear motion without corresponding sense bodily motion incongruous condition occur space travel changes gforces compromise ones spatial according science daily gravity plays major role spatial orientation changes gravitational forces transition weightlessness space voyage influence spatial orientation require adaptation many physiological processes balance system plays part long adaptation incomplete coupled nausea visual illusions sleep deprivation also increase susceptibility space sickness making symptoms worse according sensory conflict hypothesis space sickness opposite kinds motionrelated disorientation occur presence gravity known terrestrial motion sickness becoming carsick seasick airsick cases contrast space sickness ones surroundings seem visually immobile inside car airplane cabin decks ones body feels motion contemporary motion sickness medications counter various forms motion disorientation including space sickness temporarily suppressing vestibular system rarely used space travel considered better allow space travelers adapt naturally first one seven days rather suffer drowsiness side effects medication taken longer period however transdermal dimenhydrinate antinausea patches typically used whenever space suits worn vomiting space suit could fatal obscuring vision blocking airflow space suits generally worn launch landing nasa crew members always extravehicular activities evas evas consequently usually scheduled first days mission allow crew adapt transdermal dimenhydrinate patches typically used additional backup measure space sickness opposite cause compared terrestrial motion sickness two conditions opposite nonmedicinal remedies idea sensory conflict implies direct remedy motion sickness general resolve conflict resynchronizing one sees one feels kinds terrestrial motion sickness achieved viewing ones surroundings window case seasickness going deck observe seas space sickness relief available via opposite move restricting ones vision small area book small screen disregarding overall surroundings adaptation process complete simply close ones eyes nauseated feeling reduced intensity adjustment period research indicates blindness provide relief motion sickness occur exposure physical motion visual motion virtual motion without functioning vestibular system fully sea sickness car sickness space motion sickness symptoms vary mild nausea disorientation vomiting intense discomfort headaches nausea often reported varying degrees extreme reaction yet recorded felt senator jake garn space shuttle flight nasa later jokingly began using informal garn scale measure reactions space sickness cases symptoms last days asked origins garn robert e stevenson jake garn sick pretty sick dont know whether tell stories like anyway jake garn made mark astronaut corps represents maximum level space sickness anyone ever attain mark totally sick totally incompetent one garn guys get maybe tenth garn high within astronaut corps forever remembered garns purpose mission part subject experiments space motion predicting whether someone experience space sickness possible someone suffers car sickness may suffer space sickness vice excellent physical condition garn become sick vomit comet three astronauts skylab suffered nausea although three skylab illness affected work first days worrying nasa experienced aviators space travelers suffer space sickness garn began piloting age piloted variety military aircraft nasa charles walker became ill flight despite flown shuttle skylab crew quickly eating six smaller meals instead three larger ones becoming used skylab crew became sick despite antinausea steven smith estimated four shuttle flights threw space sickness occurs space flight also continue days landing vestibular system adapted august soviet cosmonaut gherman titov became first human experience space sickness
