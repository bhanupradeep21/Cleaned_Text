diplopia good extraocular mobility may closely followed ophthalmology without clinically observed signs symptoms common medical causes blowout fracture may two prevailing theories orbital fractures occur first theory hydraulic theory hydraulic theory states force applied globe results equatorial expansion globe due increasing hydrostatic pressure eventually released weaker point orbit medial inferior walls theoretically mechanism lead fractures medial wall floor since medial wall slightly thinner mm vs however known pure blowout fractures frequently involve orbital floor may attributed honeycomb structure numerous bony septa ethmoid sinuses support lamina papyracea thus allowing withstand sudden rise intraorbital hydraulic pressure better orbital second prevailing theory known
