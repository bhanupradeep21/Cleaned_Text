tissue engineering oral mucosa combines cells materials engineering produce threedimensional reconstruction oral mucosa meant simulate real anatomical structure function oral mucosa tissue engineered oral mucosa shows promise clinical use replacement soft tissue defects oral defects divided two major categories gingival recessions receding gums toothrelated defects non toothrelated defects non toothrelated defects result trauma chronic infection defects caused tumor resection ablation case oral cancer common approaches replacing damaged oral mucosa use autologous grafts cultured epithelial sheets autologous grafts used transfer tissue one site another body use autologous grafts prevents transplantation rejection reactions grafts used oral reconstruction preferably taken oral cavity gingival palatal grafts however limited availability small size leads use either skin transplants intestinal mucosa able cover bigger tissue shortage donor site morbidity common problem may occur using autologous grafts tissue obtained somewhere oral cavity intestine skin risk graft able lose original donor tissue characteristics example skin grafts often taken radial forearm lateral upper arm covering extensive defects positive aspect using skin grafts large availability skin however skin grafts differ oral mucosa consistency color keratinization pattern transplanted skin graft often continues grow hair oral cavity better understand challenges building fullthickness engineered oral mucosa important first understand structure normal oral mucosa normal oral mucosa consists two layers top stratified squamous epithelial layer bottom lamina propria epithelial layer consists four layers depending region mouth epithelium may keratinized nonkeratinized nonkeratinized squamous epithelium covers soft palate lips cheeks floor mouth keratinized squamous epithelium present gingiva hard keratinization differentiation keratinocytes granular layer dead surface cells form stratum corneum cells terminally differentiate migrate surface basal layer progenitor cells located dead superficial surface lamina propria fibrous connective tissue layer consists network type iii collagen elastin fibers main cells lamina propria fibroblasts responsible production extracellular matrix basement membrane forms border epithelial layer lamina propria cell culture techniques make possible produce epithelial sheets replacement damaged oral mucosa partialthickness tissue engineering uses one type cell layer monolayers multilayers monolayer epithelial sheets suffice study basic biology oral mucosa example responses stimuli mechanical stress growth factor addition radiation damage oral mucosa however complex multilayer structure proliferating differentiating cells monolayer epithelial sheets shown fragile difficult handle likely contract without supporting extracellular matrix monolayer epithelial sheets used manufacture multilayer cultures multilayer epithelial sheets show signs differentiation formation basement membrane fibroblasts common cells extracellular matrix important epithelial morphogenesis fibroblasts absent matrix epithelium stops proliferating continues differentiate structures obtained partialthickness oral mucosa engineering form basis fullthickness oral mucosa engineering advancement tissue engineering alternative approach developed fullthickness engineered oral mucosa fullthickness engineered oral mucosa better simulation vivo situation take anatomical structure native oral mucosa account problems tissue shortage donor site morbidity occur using fullthickness engineered oral mucosa main goal producing fullthickness engineered oral mucosa make resemble normal oral mucosa much possible achieved using combination different cell types scaffolds obtain best results type origin fibroblasts keratinocytes used oral mucosa tissue engineering important factors hold account fibroblasts usually taken dermis skin oral mucosa kertinocytes isolated different areas oral cavity palate gingiva important fibroblasts keratinocytes used earliest stage possible function cells decreases time transplanted keratinocytes fibroblasts adapt new environment adopt function risk losing transplanted tissue cells adapt properly adaptation goes smoothly donor tissue cells resemble cells native tissue scaffold matrix serves temporary supporting structure extracellular matrix initial architecture cells grow threedimensionally desired tissue scaffold must provide environment needed cellular growth differentiation must provide strength withstand mechanical stress guide growth moreover scaffolds biodegradable degrade rate tissue regenerates optimally replaced host tissuecitation needed numerous scaffolds choose choosing
