pitch perceptual property sounds allows ordering frequencyrelated commonly pitch quality makes possible judge sounds higher lower sense associated musical pitch major auditory attribute musical tones along duration loudness pitch may quantified frequency pitch purely objective physical property subjective psychoacoustical attribute sound historically study pitch pitch perception central problem psychoacoustics instrumental forming testing theories sound representation processing perception auditory pitch auditory sensation listener assigns musical tones relative positions musical scale based primarily perception frequency vibration audio pitch closely related frequency two equivalent frequency objective scientific attribute measured pitch subjective perception sound wave individual person directly measured however necessarily mean people agree notes higher lower oscillations sound waves often characterized terms frequency pitches usually associated thus quantified frequencies cycles per second hertz comparing sounds assessed sounds pure tones ones periodic sinusoidal waveforms complex aperiodic sound waves often assigned pitch according american national standards institute pitch auditory attribute sound allowing sounds ordered scale low high since pitch close proxy frequency almost entirely determined quickly sound wave making air vibrate almost nothing intensity amplitude wave high pitch means rapid oscillation low pitch corresponds slower oscillation despite idiom relating vertical height sound pitch shared least english one many deep conceptual metaphors involve updown exact etymological history musical sense high low pitch still unclear evidence humans actually perceive source sound slightly higher lower vertical space sound frequency increased cases pitch complex sounds speech musical notes corresponds nearly repetition rate periodic nearlyperiodic sounds reciprocal time interval repeating similar events sound pitch complex tones ambiguous meaning two different pitches perceived depending upon actual fundamental frequency precisely determined physical measurement may differ perceived pitch overtones also known upper partials harmonic otherwise complex tone composed two sine waves hz may sometimes heard three pitches two spectral pitches hz derived physical frequencies pure tones combination tone hz corresponding repetition rate waveform situation like percept hz commonly referred missing fundamental often greatest common divisor frequencies pitch depends lesser degree sound pressure level loudness volume tone especially frequencies hz hz pitch lower tones gets lower sound pressure increases instance tone hz loud seems one semitone lower pitch barely audible hz pitch gets higher sound gets results obtained pioneering works w later investigations ie cohen shown cases apparent pitch shifts significantly different errors averaged remaining shifts followed directions stevenss curves small less frequency ie lower pitches lower frequency octave middle c frequency half middle c hz scale square equal millisecond oscillogram middle c hz pure tone higher pitches higher frequency oscillogram octave middle c frequency twice middle c hz theories pitch perception try explain physical sound specific physiology auditory system work together yield experience pitch general pitch perception theories divided place coding temporal coding place theory holds perception pitch determined place maximum excitation basilar membrane place code taking advantage tonotopy auditory system must effect perception high frequencies since neurons upper limit fast phaselock action however purely placebased theory account accuracy pitch perception low middle frequency ranges moreover evidence nonhuman primates lack auditory cortex responses pitch despite clear tonotopic maps auditory cortex showing tonotopic place codes sufficient pitch temporal theories offer alternative appeals temporal structure action potentials mostly phaselocking modelocking action potentials frequencies stimulus precise way temporal structure helps code pitch higher levels still debated processing seems based autocorrelation action potentials auditory however long noted neural mechanism may accomplish necessary operation true least one model shows temporal delay unnecessary produce autocorrelation model pitch perception appealing phase shifts cochlear however earlier work shown certain sounds prominent peak autocorrelation function elicit corresponding pitch certain sounds without peak autocorrelation function nevertheless elicit complete model autocorrelation must therefore apply signals represent output cochlea via auditorynerve interspikeinterval theories pitch perception hold pitch inherent octave ambiguities therefore best decomposed pitch chroma periodic value around octave like note names western pitch height may ambiguous indicates octave pitch justnoticeable difference jnd threshold change perceived depends

aural illusions several tritone paradox notably shepard scale continuous discrete sequence specially formed tones made sound sequence continues ascending descending forever musical instruments make notes clear pitch unpitched percussion instruments class percussion instruments produce particular pitches sound note definite pitch one listener possibly relatively easily discern pitch sounds definite pitch harmonic frequency spectra close harmonic sound generated instrument produces many modes vibration occur simultaneously listener hears numerous frequencies vibration lowest frequency called fundamental frequency frequencies harmonics important class overtones frequencies integer multiples fundamental whether higher frequencies integer multiples collectively called partials referring different parts make total spectrum sound note indefinite pitch one listener finds impossible relatively difficult identify pitch sounds indefinite pitch harmonic spectra altered harmonic characteristic known inharmonicity still possible two sounds indefinite pitch clearly higher lower one another instance snare drum sounds higher pitched bass drum though indefinite pitch sound contains higher frequencies words possible often easy roughly discern relative pitches two sounds indefinite pitch sounds indefinite pitch neatly correspond specific pitch pitch standard also concert
