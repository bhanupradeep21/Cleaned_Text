juvenile idiopathic arthritis jia formerly known juvenile rheumatoid arthritis common chronic rheumatic disease childhood affecting approximately juvenile context refers disease onset years age idiopathic refers condition defined cause arthritis inflammation within jia autoimmune noninfective inflammatory joint disease cause remains poorly understood characterised chronic joint inflammation jia subset childhood arthritis unlike transient forms childhood arthritis jia persists least six weeks children lifelong condition differs significantly forms arthritis commonly seen adults osteoarthritis rheumatoid arthritis terms cause disease associations prognosis prognosis children jia improved dramatically recent decades particularly introduction biological therapies shift towards aggressive treatment strategies jia treatment aims normal physical psychosocial functioning achievable goal children arthritis means inflammation within joint usually recognised swelling pain stiffness restricted joint movement symptoms jia vary individual individual mainly jia umbrella term several subtypes jia differ according number affected joints severity disease presence absence inflammation parts bodycitation needed key clinical feature jia persistent swelling affected joints joint affected large joints knee ankle commonly involvement small joints hands feet likely many joints affected polyarthritis swollen joints may also feel warmer touch swelling may difficult detect clinically especially joints spine sacroiliac joints shoulder hip jaw imaging techniques ultrasound mri useful identify inflammationcitation needed joint pain important symptom although children experience minimal pain children first sign arthritis may limping especially young children often good changing move joint pain learn move hurt example child push using inflamed wrist climbing instead putting weight forearm morning stiffness improves later day common feature implies inflammatorytype joint pain versus mechanicaltype joint paincitation needed swelling pain usually result limited movement affected joints example knee held bent causing limp unable make full fist limited movement may reduce childs ability fully participate activities undertake usual tasks used selfcare jia subtypes nonspecific symptoms unwell may present lethargy fatigue poor appetite children systemic jia usually present fever classic rash may become quite ill late effects arthritis include joint contractures stiff bent joints loss movement due joint damage limb length discrepancies muscle wasting children jia vary degree affected particular symptomscitation needed eye disease jia associated inflammation front eye specifically iridocyclitis form chronic anterior uveitis affects one six children jia eye involvement occurs commonly girls joints involved oligoarthritis positive antinuclear antibody usually follows onset arthritis may detected time arthritis occasionally may occur joint involvement factors linking eye joint disease clearly understood two necessarily follow course complication usually asymptomatic without symptoms occur joints active detected experienced optometrist ophthalmologist using slit lamp look inflammatory cells fluid inside eye children jia require referral regular slit lamp screening examinations poorly controlled chronic anterior uveitis may result permanent eye damage including blindnesscitation needed systemic jia children systemic jia subtype often experience extraarticular manifestations including fever rash enlarged lymph nodes enlarged liver spleen serositis jia chronic disorder neglected lead serious complications however regular followup modern treatments complications reduced outcomes improved inflammation treated damage joint cartilage bone advent modern therapies complications jia become much less children jia may reduced overall rate growth especially disease involves many joints body may due combination disease well treatments particularly corticosteroid use paradoxically limbs large joint knee inflamed may increased growth short term leading limblength discrepancy ie one arm leg slightly longer due increased blood supply bony growth plates surrounding inflamed joints bone density bone strength may reduced combination inflammation corticosteroid use reduced physical activity musculoskeletal complications may include joint contractures muscle weakness muscle wastingcitation needed uveitis left untreated result scarring glaucoma cataracts even blindness regular monitoring allows early detection treatment steroid eye drops usually first line treatment anterior uveitis however treatments many also treat arthritis eg methotrexate biologics may required keep inflammation control minimise steroid use longer term long term steroid use cause contribute development macrophage activation syndrome mas severe potentially lifethreatening complication occur patients systemic subtype jia mas involves uncontrolled activation immune system sometimes referred cytokine storm present sepsislike picture fever rash enlarged liver spleen enlarged lymph nodes cardiorespiratory compromise recognised series characteristic changes laboratory parameters including high ferritin paradoxically low erythrocyte sedimentation ratecitation needed cause jia remains unknown however disorder meaning bodys immune system starts attack destroy cells tissues particularly joints apparent reason immune system thought provoked changes environment combination mutations many associated andor causes differential expression genes experimental studies shown certain mutated viruses may able trigger jia disease appears common girls common cause jia word idiopathic suggests unknown area active current understanding jia suggests arises genetically susceptible individual due environmental diagnosis jia difficult part joint pain children common may many causes characteristic feature arthritis joint swelling sometimes always associated pain presence joint stiffness another typical feature particularly present morning improving activitycitation needed single test confirm diagnosis jia combination presenting signs symptoms blood tests necessary medical imaging used make diagnosis blood tests may measure levels inflammatory markers well presence specific immune markers may include antinuclear antibody rheumatoid factor protein antibody serological markers may negative children jia often present healthy children interpreted isolation context clinical presentation many children jia normal blood work xrays may required ensure joint pain swelling fracture cancer infection congenital abnormality cases fluid joint aspirated analysed assist making diagnosis test assist ruling causes arthritis infectioncitation needed current classification system international league associations rheumatology ilar recognizes seven distinct subtypes jia based presentation within first six months subtype specific pattern features outlined table descriptions seventh category included table undifferentiated includes patient jia meet criteria subtypes meets criteria two subtypes skeleton oligoarticular pauciarticular jia common jia subtype occurs four joints involved first six months disease two subtypes oligoarticular arthritis exist persistent oligoarthritis four joints affected throughout whole disease course extended oligoarthritis four joints affected first six months disease patients subtype often young typically aged two three years female preponderance commonly involved joint knee affected joints may include ankles wrists elbows others antinuclear antigen ana positive patients oligoarthritis associated higher risk associated eye disease uveitis particularly younger prefixes oligo pauci mean fewcitation needed several disorders diseases present symptoms like jia causes include limited infectious example septic arthritis osteomyelitis postinfectious conditions reactive arthritis acute rheumatic fever geographic areas lyme disease hematologic neoplastic diseases leukemia bony tumors connective tissue diseases systemic lupus erythematosus systemiconset form jia differential diagnosis also includes kawasaki disease periodic fever syndromes genetic skeletal dysplasias forms mucopolysaccharidosis especially scheie syndrome progressive pseudorheumatoid multicentric osteolysis nodulosis arthropathy may also mimic jia may present joint swelling joint restriction stiffness pain clinical radiologic overlap genetic skeletal dysplasias jia great molecular

treatment jia helping child young person regain normal levels physical social functioning controlling inflammation extraarticular symptoms clinical remission primary target patients treatment adjusted prompt recognition management important early initiation therapy increases likelihood response firstline treatments achieving drugfree remission later overarching consensus treatment guidelines exist treatments specifically tailored individuals needs discussion child young person optimal management jia requires multidisciplinary team working address needs individual patient optimising physical social functioning accomplished via twopronged approach nonpharmacological strategies physical therapies pain management strategies social supports swift use medication control inflammation extraarticular early diagnosis treatment imperative helping reduce joint damage symptoms help reduce levels permanent damage leading long term disability optimal approach treating child jia typically involves team medical professionals may include limited paediatric rheumatologists paediatric rheumatology nurses general paediatricians general practitioners adult rheumatologists physical therapists pts occupational therapists ots podiatrists psychologists social workers pharmacists ophthalmologists orthopaedic surgeons multidisciplinary team mdt work conjunction child parents local health service medical team childs school teachers community leaders sports coaches best support child together team help children participate fully independently possible daily activities maximising quality life maximising function minimising disruption life child young person multidisciplinary team work together provide child family support education jia strategies promote ageappropriate selfsufficiency help child adapt adjust challenges face many ways make daily tasks easier manageable one key ways multidisciplinary team helps children jia involve families decisionmaking process regarding treatment rehabilitation young children jia symptoms may result either delay regression developmental milestones walking running climbing upper limb function may also affected members multidisciplinary team perform developmental assessments identify deficits guide treatments information gathered shared schools child care facilities one key ways occupational physical therapists help young children jia developing home therapy program based around play exercises prescribed physical therapists occupational therapists increase range child move joint strengthen muscles around joint decrease pain stiffness prevent limitations joint movements ots pts provide children ageappropriate games activities allow children practice exercises playing socializing friends examples crafts swimming children jia may experience challenges low mood social interaction reduced selfconfidence negative selfimage psychologists ots nurses social workers team members work child family develop strategies help

physical therapist role guiding physical rehabilitation muscle stretching strengthening enhancing joint range movement improving balance etc optimising physical functioning goalsetting improving childs confidence body usually work child family develop home exercise program changes time child makes progress arthritis childhood associated muscle weakness wasting around affected joints also lead low bone density may predispose osteoporosis fractures adulthood getting regular exercise important part management jia promote bone muscle variation exact exercise prescription best promotes musculoskeletal health whilst reducing fatigue pain swelling consensus children jia following national public health standards physical activity participating moderate fitness flexibility strengthening exercises compatible abilities disease important across week exercise combination moderate vigorous cardiovascular activity eg walking school scooting bikeriding playing tag dancing physical education sports basketball football strengthening exercises bone strengthening activities build muscles muscles push pull bone bones get stronger include things like playing climbing equipment swinging monkeybars using weights carrying groceries skipping running cochrane metaanalysis looking existing rcts showed studies exercise detrimental effect jia fact evidence show low highintensity exercise programs result improved physical function reduced pain children jia guidelines indicate children jia encouraged physically active safely participate sports without disease exacerbation actively inflamed joints limit activities within pain limits gradually return full activity following disease may necessary use aids like splints casts correct biomechanics prolonged splinting casting rarely indicated children jia following joint injections children often advised take easy often undertaking one two days low activity although advice around joint usually knee loses range motion due prolonged inflammation pain series plaster casts may used gradually extend shortened muscles restore range serial casts usually applied days weeks active strengthening lengthening used conjunction serial casting optimal results children may benefit foot orthotics support correct body position function orthotics maintain biomechanical alignment may reduce discomfort legs back children participate physical activities sports pain common often distressing symptom jia although children jia joint inflammation without pain pain occur even children receiving effective doses therapies managing underlying disease pain found negatively impact aspects quality life associated reduction physical social emotional functioning children higher levels pain tend reduced levels
