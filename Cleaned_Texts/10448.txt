hybrid also known filial hybrid first filial generation offspring distinctly different parental hybrids used genetics selective breeding term crossbreed may used term sometimes written subscript subsequent generations called etc offspring distinctly different parental types produce new uniform phenotype combination characteristics parents fish breeding parents frequently two closely related fish species plant animal breeding parents often two inbred lines gregor mendel focused patterns inheritance genetic basis variation crosspollination experiments involving two truebreeding homozygous parents mendel found resulting generation heterozygous consistent offspring showed combination phenotypes parent genetically dominant mendels discoveries involving generations laid foundation modern genetics crossing two genetically different plants produces hybrid seed happen naturally includes hybrids species example peppermint sterile hybrid watermint spearmint agronomy term hybrid usually reserved agricultural cultivars derived twoparent cultivars hybrids usually created means controlled pollination sometimes hand pollination annual plants tomato maize hybrids must produced season mass production hybrids uniform phenotype parent plants must predictable genetic effects offspring inbreeding selection uniformity multiple generations ensures parent lines almost homozygous divergence two parent lines promotes improved growth yield characteristics offspring phenomenon heterosis hybrid vigour combining ability two populations breeding stock desired characteristics subjected inbreeding homozygosity population exceeds certain level usually typically requires generations thereafter two strains must crossed avoiding selffertilization normally done plants deactivating removing male flowers one population taking advantage time differences male female flowering hand corn sugar beet spinach sunflowers broccoli onions planted united states hybridscitation needed beans peas commercially hybridized automatic pollinators hand pollination prohibitively expensive plant hybrids like cannabis sativa indica ruderalis naturally occurring lately created hybridization two species inbred plants man several generations inbreeding occur sometimes genes inbreds wear thin inbred humans sometimes create retardation growth mental abilities etc inbred plants may beginning show incredible yield strength flavor etc keep inbreeding seem wear weaken creating many good yields strengths etc begin wear away become victims disease weak growth many functions viability seeds break eventually become sterile become hybrid inviable plants would need breed one another example two long lines inbred lineage must pollinate one female one several generation inbred weakened plant would need pollinated another different species sort hybridized inbred weakened pollinated species reset gene program back day one strong disease resistant productive effort survive mother nature worst currently done professional breeders across world making cannabis world much productive hybrids result self crosspollination lack consistency though may retain desirable traits produced cheaply hand pollination interventions required seed companies offer seed less cost particularly bedding plants consistency less crosses animals two inbred lines two closely related species subspecies fish cichlids term cross used crosses two different wildcaught individuals assumed different genetic mules hybrids horses mares donkeys jacks opposite sex cross results hinniescitation needed however
