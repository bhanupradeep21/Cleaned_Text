factors determine values alveolar partial pressures torr human rest alveolar oxygen partial pressure lower atmospheric partial pressure two reasons alveolar routinely measured calculated blood gas measurements alveolar gas equation partial pressure carbon dioxide along ph used differentiate metabolic acidosis metabolic alkalosis respiratory acidosis respiratory alkalosis hypoventilation exists ratio carbon dioxide production alveolar ventilation increases normal values greater ph also less respiratory acidosis hyperventilation exists ratio decreases less ph also greater respiratory httpsenwikipediaorgwikipulmonarygaspressures
