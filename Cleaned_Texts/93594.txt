representational insight ability detect mentally represent relation symbol referent whether child gains insight depends similarity symbol referent level information provided relationship symbol referent childs prior experience symbols essential part representational insight dual representation existence multiple mental representations single symbolic entity judy deloache coined term conducting many studies young children would watch experimenter hide toy model room asked retrieve similar larger toy larger symbol entity someone intends stand something making symbolic artifacts objects used aid communication representational insight ability detect mentally represent relation symbol referent whether child gains insight depends similarity symbol referent level information provided relationship symbol referent childs prior experience symbols essential part representational insight dual representation existence multiple mental representations single symbolic study deloache built model room lab purpose studying toddler memory groups threeyearold twoandahalfyearold toddlers watched experimenters hid miniature toys model room asked retrieve larger versions toys larger room threeyearolds performed retrieval task well however twoandahalfyearolds younger children failing appreciate relation model room realization led deloache focus research instead symbolic original concept dual representation came research deloache conducting infants babies shown pictures observed manually explore real objects indicating perception accurate representation incorrect meaning understand pictures real objects children get older acquire deloache calls dual representation understand symbolic meaning first experiment conducted dual representation began memory study young children deloache studying toddler memory beginning new experiment twoandahalf threeyearold children using model room lab real room furnished like standard living room model contained miniature versions items room items shape material arranged manner real room children would watch experimenter hide toy model room asked find larger version toy larger room set way model scale model study results surprising children poorly changed deloaches thinking shifting research memory calls dual one first symbolic objects young children master pictures though pictures simplest form symbols adults comprehend infants struggle observed manually explore example presented picture shoe toddler might try fit foot shoe depicted photograph babies achieved dual representation lack ability mentally grasp symbol object addition object represents judy deloache david uttal sophia pierroutsakos karl rosengren studied placing books containing realistic color photographs front ninemonthold children found every child study attempted interact pictures objects represented suggesting symbolic thinking intuitive behavior observed children shown video well babies observed understand symbolic nature pictures time months old pointing pictures communicating object instead manually exploring photos researchers believe contributing factor decrease manual exploration pictures development inhibitory control frontal cortex develops also believed experience pictures contributes development researchers also noted observed behavior indicate failure discriminate pictures real objects depict found given object photograph object sidebyside child almost always reach object first showing ability discriminate however researchers also found babies display manual interaction increased pictorial realism meaning picture resembles object child try interact children exhibit manual exploration photographs versus line drawings color pictures black picture orientation another subject research adults strong preference viewing pictures oriented right side children however found weak preference viewing pictures right side preference deloache uttal pierroutsakos found handed upsidedown book usually study book upsidedown orientation though found indifferent picture orientation able accurately identify pictures either orientation noted observed indifference orientation specific pictures seen many variations original task retrieval experiment conducted using threeyearold twoandahalfyearold children yielding different results two groups though six months apart threeyearolds consistently perform well whereas twoandahalfyearolds perform poorly retrieval success rate respectively due limited experience symbols lack maturity younger children struggle see object object achieve dual representation model becomes interesting object child making difficult see past physicality studies found symbolic objects allow dual representation achieved easily pictures found less interesting therefore better allow dual representation found though babies struggle pictures twoandahalfyearold children successful retrieval task shown correct location picture room finding hidden toy trials interesting contradicts current literature shows pictures less effective models cognitive activities learning memory results show young children dual representation easily achieved using pictures models observation led researchers believe simplicity pictures relation model room contributed success children completing retrieval task hypothesis tested using pieces furniture model room rather entire model give children fewer items focus furniture arranged similar orientation corresponding furniture lifesized room twoandahalfyearold children watched experimenter hide miniature toy one modelsized pieces furniture asked find larger version lifesized room children unsuccessful retrieval task demonstrating success found picture tasks result simpler models studies found distancing symbolic object child also aids dual representation one study model larger room placed behind window child could see model touch child shown toy hidden model asked find toy larger room children able find toy first try trials another study symbolic object made accessible children expectation dual representation would difficult achieve instead placing model behind window children allowed play model retrieval task children able find hidden toy trials indicating direct interaction model made difficult children view object symbolically additional studies found models closer size real room resulted greater success model furniture closely resembled lifesized child ages dual representation becomes less challenging likely assisted developmental accomplishments including ability inhibit initial response symbolic object increased experience symbols conducting several experiments using model room lifesize room deloache collaboration kevin miller karl rosengren developed credible shrinking room experiment study twoandahalfyearold children placed one two study groups children first study group watched experimenter hide large doll lifesized room asked find miniature doll model room children second study group also watched experimenter hide large doll lifesized room however convinced machine could shrink lifesize room model room first study group performed symbolic task required dual representation second study group performed nonsymbolic task primarily memory task require dual representation rationale behind shrinking room concept child believes model large room shrunk symbolic relation two spaces credulous child model simply room researchers found twoandahalfyearolds performed poorly first task using standard model expected previous experiments however twoandahalfyearolds completed nonsymbolic task performed well significantly better completed symbolic task study repeated different age groups yielded similar acquisition dual representation becomes necessity children begin school symbolic understanding necessary reading writing science mathematics though natural adults dual representation developmental challenge children school mathematical symbols challenge young children learn abstract representations opposed concrete representations used many researchers suggest use concrete objects handson activities teaching however researchers suggest using concrete objects teaching aid may help children learn symbolic representations may even distract subject studies shown realistic images support learning addition manipulative features pictures books distracts children subject matter hinders six months twoandahalf threeyears several developmental changes occur child study conducted young children presented large toys car chair followed miniature versions toys behaviors known scale errors observed children attempted interact miniature objects way larger versions researchers attribute scale errors immature cortical functioning normally developing young children young children struggle inhibitory control due immature prefrontal cortex twostreams hypothesis cited potential explanation ventral stream associated object identity dorsal stream associated determining object size believed young children two streams communicating properly resulting scale dual representation exhibited certain animal species rats dolphins parrots monkeys chimpanzees experiments shown training animals capable completing symbolic tasks simple arithmetic researchers believe major player capabilities occipitoparietal pathways spatial visual studies shown humans animals use symbolic cognition map spaces around locate certain objects ability necessary survival humans however additional ability communicating sharing representations spaces language
