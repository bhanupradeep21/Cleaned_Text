sex allocation allocation resources male versus female reproduction sexual needed sex allocation theory tries explain many species produce equal number males dioecious species individuals either male female entire lifetimes allocation decision lies producing male female offspring sequential hermaphrodites individuals function one sex early life switch allocation decisions lie sex first change sex
