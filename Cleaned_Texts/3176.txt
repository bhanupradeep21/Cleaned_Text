biological rhythms largescale contributions field chronobiology honma authored scholarly articles published several edited volumes summarize expand awardwinning papers lectures leading scientists field initially research revolved around understanding photic nonphotic entrainment circadian rhythms raised hypotheses role feeding entrainment circadian well ways endogenous rhythms entrain artificial bright later focusing uncovering structure circadian clock earlier career honma made key discovery body temperature locomotor activity plasma levels corticosterone circadian processes likely coupled one common internal oscillator however current research centered around ontogeny circadian well understanding uncovering physiological aspects underlie chronobiology honma first person

contributing current understanding circadian disorders implications development appropriate earlier careers honma wife sato honma able detect circadian rhythms gene expression via situ hybridization scn rats found expression highest subjective night rats rhythms mrna expression found regions brain like hippocampus cerebellum findings allowed deduce plays significant role regulating circadian rhythms honma colleagues published paper highlighted effects postnatal light cryptochrome cry deficient authors showed exposure constant light partially restore rhythms scn even though cry deficient mice lose sleepwake rhythms upon placing newborn mice constant light three weeks published article emphasized role physical activity specifically blind elderly people entrainment circadian authors demonstrated physical activity could induce phaseshifts sleep wake schedules could also contribute shifts plasma levels kenichi sato honma part team hokkaido university discovered voltage rhythms scn

nucleus central oscillator mammals concluded together collaborators gaba neither establishes maintains circadian patterns body rather refines circadian firing rhythm ensure noiseless communications neurons outside discovery poses implications development new therapies treatments targeting different circadianrelated disorders honma also involved recent research ultradian rhythms shortterm rhythms
