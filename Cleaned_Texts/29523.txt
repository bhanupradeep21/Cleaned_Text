barsbold originally placed ceratonykus within alvarezsauria within clade parvicursoridae sister taxon mononykus authors questioned traditional placement alvarezsauria within theropoda instead suggesting ornithischians since qin et al recovered ceratonykus within polytomy linhenykus shuvuuia mononykus parvicursor position also recovered xu et al lee et al recovered similar position inclusion nemegtonykus clade containing kol xixianykus addition also recovered within polytomy fowler et al inclusion trierarchuncus averianov lopatin inclusion khulsanurus strict consensus tree using unweighted however strict consensus tree implied weighting averianov lopatin placed sister taxon agnolin et al positioned ceratonykus within tribe ceratonykini sister taxon xixianykus averianov

lobes displaced ventrolaterally like birds alifanov savelyev tested hypothesis climbing ancestors alvarezsaurs looking cerebellum ceratonykus least one transverse sulcus crocodiles lizards due crocodiles better coordination movements lizards need orient three dimensional space authors proposed ancestor alvarezsaurs likely arboreal authors also suggested complex cerebellum could useful efficient regulation speed numerous movement patterns jumping terrestrial alvarezsaurs additionally considered specialization eyesight hearing sense smell might made alvarezsaurs efficient searching
