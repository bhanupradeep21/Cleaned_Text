vigilance field behavioural ecology refers animals monitoring surroundings order heighten awareness predator presence vigilance important behaviour foraging animals must often venture away safety shelter find food however vigilant comes expense time spent feeding tradeoff two length time animals devote vigilance dependent many factors including predation risk hunger vigilance often observed animals forage groups yelloweyed juncos junco phaeonutus meerkats suricata suricatta foraging groups dilutes individuals risk predation allows reduce vigilance vigilance group alarm signals may used alert group presence predators groups species least one individual sentry duty looks predators perch rest group vigilance feeding searching handling food generally mutually exclusive activities leading foragers facing tradeoff energy intake safety predation time allocated scanning reduces time spent feeding vigilant individuals must devote time foraging obtain required food impedes activities mating prolongs exposure predation foraging occurs away foraging time limited vigilant animals left reduced energy optimality models used predict foraging decisions animal based costs predation risk starvation benefits safety food also affected physiology hunger grey squirrels sciurus carolinensis alter behaviour according relative costs benefits foraging small food items consumed immediately maximise energy intake require little handling time predation risk large items require long handling time hence time exposed predators carried back safety tree minimise predation although energetic cost transporting food large food items high contribution nutrient intake benefits outweigh overall predation risk function abundance activity ability predators detect forager well likelihood forager escape predator animals prioritise vigilance feeding predation risk high example yelloweyed juncos spend time scanning predators potential predator harriss hawk parabuteo unicinctus present compared hawk another factor influences vigilance benefit expected foraging absence dependent quality food well energetic state individual much gained feeding foragers may forgo vigilance similarly hungry animals higher chance dying starvation predation beneficial sacrifice vigilance fulfill energy requirements threespined sticklebacks gasterosteus aculeatus deprived food prefer feed locations high density water cost choice sticklebacks must concentrate picking prey due predator confusion effect many moving targets make difficult predators pick individual choice means sticklebacks less able scan predators however risk starvation relatively higher risk similarly juncos deprived food exhibit lower levels vigilance instead focusing rapid feeding behaviour incompatible state animal change due behaviour vice versa due dynamic feedback foraging body reserves predation feedback influence individuals choice feed predation risk great animal must maintain level vigilance drastically inhibits feeding may opt alternative example bluegill sunfish lepomis macrochirus choice foraging plankton safety reeds benthic invertebrates better quality food predator largemouth bass present smaller sunfish spend majority time foraging reeds despite choice reducing food intake seasonal growth sunfish large eaten bass forage almost entirely benthos although staying reeds results slower growth rate longer period size vulnerable predators maximum survival sunfish choose remain reeds feeding plankton reach certain size leave feed nocturnal animals alter timing foraging based level light avoiding feeding moonlight bright predation risk raised head common indicator vigilance many animals require heads lowered search handle different foods require different handling affect amount vigilance animal maintain seeds without husks example require little handling birds rapidly pecked birds head incompatible situations high predation risk animals may choose foods foraged maintaining vigilance darkeyed juncos junco hymenalis feed small flocks prefer feed larger pieces food part larger individuals smaller flocks greater need vigilant see vigilance groups large pieces food beneficial require longer handling time simultaneously spent scanning whereas birds feeding small pieces must intermittently stop foraging scan solitary group foraging come variety costs benefits many animals foraging group optimal strategy among many benefits group foraging reduction predation risk improved vigilance one wood pigeons columba palumbus large flocks able escape predation goshawks able spot fly away quickly would larger flocks likely one bird notice hawk sooner alert group flying away group animals may better finding capturing food solitary animals species feed food patchy likelihood locating food greater individuals search food independently inform rest group food patch information sharing way little cost individual locates food occurs high abundance patch group hunting allows predators take larger prey well prey outrun predator caught ambush example lionesses panthera leo hunt cooperatively large prey zebra equus burchelli wildebeest connochaetes taurinus lioness adopting particular positions presence many predators also causes panic groups prey often causing flee different directions making easier predators single foraging group also antipredator benefits part group dilutes individuals risk attacked group members lower probability individual grouping may swamp predators capacity capture prey example hawks unable capture one yelloweyed junco per large groups also cause predator confusion makes difficult prey focus one groups animals may engage communal defences mobbing dilution predation risk occurs groups animals prone attack often large groups conspicuous predators grouping may increase risk attack blue acara cichlid fish aequidens pulcher choose shoals guppies poecilia reticulate attack based visually conspicuous preferring shoals larger exhibit foraging groups requires sharing may also lead greater competition food larger groups may greater overall vigilance small groups due many eyes hypothesis eyes scanning predators means proportion time least one individual vigilant collective vigilance improved vigilance may allow individual decrease time allocates vigilance without increase personal risk attacked particularly large groups already diluted predation lower individual levels vigilance increasing group size observed many bird mammal fish individual ostriches struthio camelus greater rheas rhea americana large groups spend less time head individuals small groups however collective vigilance increases group size ostriches therefore many eyes hypothesis always hold although individuals groups may able decrease time spend scanning hence reach energy requirements shorter period time increased competition food groups may mean animals need devote time overall foraging due increased allocation time aggressive behaviour example rate fighting house sparrows passer domesticus increases size large groups animals able detect predators earlier higher probability least one individual vigilant predator approaches many predators rely element surprise successful attacks early detection predators reduces predation detection predator one individual translates collective detection individual makes sort signal alert rest group signal may deliberate call made vigilant individual case meerkats simply departure individual detected predator flocks birds often exhibit collective detection one birds initially detect threat birds perceive threat detect departure also respond departure multiple birds simultaneously likely effective alarm signal single bird birds regularly depart flocks reasons predator water skaters halobates robustus transmit predator avoidance behaviour group sense touch individuals edge flotilla detect predator move bumping neighbours turn start moving bumping wave alarm termed trafalgar effect species individuals foraging group take sentry duty sentinels look predators often good vantage point rest group forages sound alarm spot sentry duty particularly important species whose foraging activity incompatible vigilance feed areas highly exposed predators example dwarf mongooses helogale parvula dig arthropods ground eat activity requires fixation vision olfaction often sentry makes quiet calls function watchman song reassure rest group individual response vocalising sentry pied babblers turdoides bicolor decrease vigilance spread group forage exposed patches resulting higher intake guarding may appear altruistic behaviour individual sentry duty unable feed may exposed predators may attract predators attention make alarm call however meerkats sentry duty greater risk predation generally first detect predators eg jackals eagle species flee meerkats also go guard satiated individual sentry duty guarding may beneficial behaviour individual requirement feeding benefit early predator large group possible individual cheat scanning less members group without negative effect collective vigilance group cheating would seem beneficial strategy individual still benefits collective detection group able feed individuals however cheating stable strategy members group would collective adopting high level vigilance group also stable strategy individual adopts lower level vigilance would greater advantage evolutionarily stable ess scanning rate rate group members adopted individual scanned less frequently would lower chance maintaining individual vigilance may beneficial strategy vigilant animals gain sort nonvigilant individuals often last flee safety groups generally flee succession individual spots predator individuals vigilant first animal departs finally nonvigilant predators may also target less vigilant prey likely detect predator later therefore respond slowly cheetahs acinonyx jubatus select less vigilant thomsons gazelles eudorcas thomsonii initiating chase target
