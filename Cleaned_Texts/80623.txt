testosterone estrogens androstenedione converted either testosterone estrone conversion androstenedione testosterone requires enzyme dehydrogenase androstenedione released blood theca cells conversion androstenedione estrone requires enzyme aromatase androstenedione substrate estrogen production granulosa cells produce aromatase thus theca cells granulosa cells work together form androstanedione
