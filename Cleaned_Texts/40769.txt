dependent dopaminergic possibly serotonergic neurotransmitter systems exact mechanism action distinct properties relative typical psychostimulants amphetamine unique aspects bromantane sometimes described instead adaptogen therapeutic effects bromantane asthenia said onset within proposed combination psychostimulant anxiolytic activity may give bromantane special efficacy treatment largescale multicenter clinical trial patients diagnosed asthenia bromantane given days daily dose mg impressiveness cgis cgii indicating broadlyapplicable high therapeutic benefit asthenia notably observed still present onemonth discontinuation drug indicating longlasting positive effects quality life significantly increased bromantane increase remained onemonth withdrawal patients experienced side effects none adverse effects serious patients discontinued treatment due side bromantane also noted normalize sleepwake authors concluded bromantane daily dose mg highly effective welltolerated safe drug wide spectrum clinical effects therefore drug could recommended treatment asthenic disorders neurological bromantane described primarily mild also said possess antiasthenic bromantane reported improve physical mental performance hence could considered performanceenhancing bromantane found lower levels proinflammatory cytokines normalize behavior animal models depression may possess clinical
