behavioral ecology also spelled behavioural ecology study evolutionary basis animal behavior due ecological pressures behavioral ecology emerged ethology niko tinbergen outlined four questions address studying animal behaviors proximate causes ontogeny survival value phylogeny behavior organism trait provides selective advantage ie adaptive significance environment natural selection favors adaptive significance refers expression trait affects fitness measured individuals reproductive success adaptive traits produce copies individuals genes future generations maladaptive traits leave fewer example bird call loudly attracts mates loud call adaptive trait species louder bird mates frequently less loud sending loudcalling genes future generations conversely loud calling birds may attract attention predators often decreasing presence gene pool individuals always competition others limited resources including food territories mates conflict occurs predators prey rivals mates siblings mates even parents offspring value social behavior depends part social behavior animals neighbors example likely rival male back threat value male gets making threat likely however rival attack threatened less useful threaten males population exhibits number interacting social behaviors evolve stable pattern behaviors known evolutionarily stable strategy ess term derived economic game theory became prominent john maynard smith recognized possible application concept nash equilibrium model evolution behavioral strategies short evolutionary game theory asserts strategies common population invaded alternative mutant strategy ess thus maintained population words equilibrium every player play best strategic response game two player symmetric player play strategy provides response best therefore ess considered evolutionary end point subsequent interactions fitness conveyed strategy influenced individuals relative frequency strategy population behavior governed optimality frequencies strategies adopted others therefore frequency dependent frequency dependence behavioral evolution therefore influenced physical environment interactions individuals example changes geography make strategy susceptible alternative strategies parasitization african honey bee scutellata term economic defendability first introduced jerram brown economic defendability states defense resource costs energy expenditure risk injury well benefits priority access resource territorial behavior arises benefits greater studies goldenwinged sunbird validated concept economic defendability comparing energetic costs sunbird expends day extra nectar gained defending territory researchers showed birds became territorial making net energetic resources low density gains excluding others may sufficient pay cost territorial defense contrast resource availability high may many intruders defender would time make use resources made available defense sometimes economics resource competition favors shared defense example feeding territories white wagtail white wagtails feed insects washed river onto bank acts renewing food supply intruders harvested territory prey would quickly become depleted sometimes territory owners tolerate second bird known satellite two sharers would move phase one another resulting decreased feeding rate also increased defense illustrating advantages group one major models used predict distribution competing individuals amongst resource patches ideal free distribution model within model resource patches variable quality limit number individuals occupy extract resources particular patch competition within particular patch means benefit individual receives exploiting patch decreases logarithmically increasing number competitors sharing resource patch model predicts individuals initially flock higherquality patches costs crowding bring benefits exploiting line benefits individual lesserquality resource patch point reached individuals alternate exploiting higherquality patches lowerquality patches way average benefit individuals patches model ideal individuals complete information quality resource patch number individuals currently exploiting free individuals freely able choose resource patch experiment manfred malinski demonstrated feeding behavior threespined sticklebacks follows ideal free distribution six fish placed tank food items dropped opposite ends tank different rates rate food deposition one end set twice end fish distributed four individuals fasterdepositing end two individuals slowerdepositing end way average feeding rate fish competition resources species across animal kingdom may also engage competitions mating one considers mates potentials mates resource sexual partners randomly distributed amongst resource pools within given environment following ideal free distribution model suitors distribute amongst potential mates effort maximize chances number potential matings competitors males species cases variations strategies tactics used obtain matings strategies generally refer genetically determined behaviors described conditional tactics refer subset behaviors within given genetic strategy thus difficult great many variations mating strategies exist given environment experiment conducted anthony arak playback synthetic calls male natterjack toads used manipulate behavior males chorus difference strategies tactics clear small immature male natterjack toads adopted satellite tactic parasitize larger males though large males average still retained greater reproductive success smaller males able intercept matings large males chorus removed smaller males adopted calling behavior longer competing loud calls larger males smaller males got larger calls competitive started calling competing directly many sexually reproducing species mammals birds amphibians females able bear offspring certain time period males free mate available females therefore father many offspring pass genes fundamental difference male female reproduction mechanisms determines different strategies sex employs maximize reproductive success males reproductive success limited access females females limited access resources sense females much choosier males bet resources provided males ensure reproductive resources usually include nest sites food protection cases males provide eg sedge females dwell chosen males territories access resources males gain ownership territories competition often involves physical aggression largest strongest males manage defend best quality nest sites females choose males inspecting quality different territories looking male traits indicate quality one example grayling butterfly hipparchia semele males engage complex flight patterns decide defends particular territory female grayling butterfly chooses male based optimal location sometimes males leave mating resource male provides nuptial gift protection food seen drosophila female evaluate quality protection food provided male decide whether mate long willing copulate males contribution offspring sperm females particularly choosy high level female choice sexual ornaments seen males ornaments reflect males social status two hypotheses proposed conceptualize genetic benefits female mate first good genes hypothesis suggests female choice higher genetic quality preference favored increases fitness includes zahavis handicap hypothesis hamilton zuks host parasite arms race zahavis handicap hypothesis proposed within context looking elaborate male sexual displays suggested females favor ornamented traits handicaps indicators males genetic quality since ornamented traits hazards males survival must indicative high genetic quality areas way degree male expresses sexual display indicates female genetic zuk hamilton proposed hypothesis observing disease powerful selective pressure rabbit population suggested sexual displays indicators resistance disease genetic choosiness female individuals seen wasp species especially among polistes dominula wasps females tend prefer males smaller elliptically shaped spots larger irregularly shaped spots males would reproductive superiority males irregular spots marbled newts females show preference mates larger crests however considered handicap negatively affect males chances survival simply trait females show preference choosing mate indication health fishers hypothesis runaway sexual selection suggests female preference genetically correlated male traits preference coevolves evolution trait thus preference indirect fisher suggests female preference began trait indicated males quality female preference spread females offspring benefited higher quality specific trait also greater attractiveness mates eventually trait represents attractiveness mates longer represents increased example mate choice genes seen cichlid fish tropheus moorii males provide parental care experiment found female moorii likely choose mate color morph another experiment females shown share preferences males given two choose meaning males get reproduce often sensory bias hypothesis states preference trait evolves nonmating context exploited one sex obtain mating opportunities competitive sex evolves traits exploit preexisting bias choosy sex already possesses mechanism thought explain remarkable trait differences closely related species produces divergence signaling systems leads reproductive sensory bias demonstrated guppies freshwater fish trinidad tobago mating system female guppies prefer mate males orange body coloration however outside mating context sexes prefer animate orange objects suggests preference originally evolved another context like orange fruits rare treat fall streams guppies live ability find fruits quickly adaptive quality evolved outside mating context sometime affinity orange objects arose male guppies exploited preference incorporating large orange spots attract females another example sensory exploitation water mite neumania papillator ambush predator hunts copepods small crustaceans passing water hunting n papillator adopts characteristic stance termed net stance first four legs held water column four hind legs resting aquatic vegetation allows detect vibrational stimuli produced swimming prey use orient towards clutch courtship males actively search male finds female slowly circles around female whilst trembling first second leg near male leg trembling causes females net stance orient towards often clutch damage male deter courtship male deposited spermatophores began vigorously fan jerk fourth pair legs spermatophore generating current water passed spermatophores towards sperm packet uptake female would sometimes heather proctor hypothesised vibrations trembling male legs made done mimic vibrations females detect swimming prey would trigger female preydetection responses causing females orient clutch males mediating true males exploiting female predation responses hungry females receptive male trembling proctor found unfed captive females orient clutch males significantly fed captive females consistent sensory exploitation examples sensory bias mechanism include traits wolf experimental work required reach fuller understanding prevalence mechanisms sensory sexual conflict form another may well inherent ways animals females invest offspring prior mating due differences gametes species exhibit anisogamy often invest offspring unequal investment leads one hand intense competition males mates hand females choosing among males better access resources good genes differences mating goals males females may different preferred outcomes mating sexual conflict occurs whenever preferred outcome mating different male female difference theory lead sex evolving adaptations bias outcome reproduction towards interests sexual competition leads sexually antagonistic coevolution males females resulting described evolutionary arms race males males reproductive successes often limited access mates whereas females reproductive successes often limited access resources thus given sexual encounter benefits male mate benefits female choosy example male small tortoiseshell butterfly compete gain best territory another example conflict found eastern carpenter bee xylocopa virginica males species limited reproduction primarily access mates claim territory wait female pass big males therefore successful mating claim territories near female nesting sites sought smaller males hand monopolize less competitive sites foraging areas may mate reduced another example sepsis cynipsea males species mount females guard males remain female attempting copulate female either shakes consents similarly neriid fly derocephalus angusticollis demonstrates mate guarding using long limbs hold onto female well push males away extreme manifestations conflict seen throughout nature example male panorpa scorpionflies attempt force copulation male scorpionflies usually acquire mates presenting edible nuptial gifts forms salivary secretions dead insects however males attempt force copulation grabbing females specialized abdominal organ without offering forced copulation costly female receive food male search food costing time energy beneficial male need find nuptial gift cases however pays female gain matings social mate prevent guard paternity example many socially monogamous birds males follow females closely fertile periods attempt chase away males prevent extrapair matings female may attempt sneak achieve extra matings species males incapable constant guarding social male may frequently copulate female swamp rival males sexual conflict mating also shown occur males females males employ diverse array tactics increase success sperm competition include removing males sperm females displacing males sperm flushing prior inseminations large amounts sperm creating copulatory plugs females reproductive tracts prevent future matings males spraying females antiaphrodisiacs discourage males mating female producing sterile parasperm protect fertile eusperm females reproductive example male spruce bud moth zeiraphera canadensis secretes accessory gland protein mating makes unattractive males thus prevents females future rocky mountain parnassian also exhibits type sexual conflict male butterflies deposit waxy genital plug onto tip females abdomen physically prevents female mating males also prevent future mating transferring antiaphrodiasic female mating behavior seen butterfly species heliconius melpomene males transfer compound causes female smell like male butterfly thus deter future potential furthermore males may control strategic allocation sperm producing sperm females promiscuous methods meant ensure females likely produce offspring belonging males uses females also control outcomes matings exists possibility females choose sperm cryptic female dramatic example feral fowl gallus gallus species females prefer copulate dominant males subordinate males force matings cases female able eject subordinate males sperm using cloacal parental care investment parent puts includes protecting feeding young preparing burrows nests providing eggs great variation parental care animal kingdom species parents may care offspring others parents exhibit singleparental even biparental care topics behavioral ecology interactions within family involve conflicts conflicts broken three general types sexual conflict conflict sibling conflict many different patterns parental care animal kingdom patterns explained physiological constraints ecological conditions mating opportunities invertebrates parental care species favorable parents produce large number eggs whose fate left chance protect individual young cases parental care indirect manifested via actions taken offspring produced nonetheless essential survival example female lasioglossum figueresi sweat bees excavate nest construct brood cells stock cells pollen nectar lay eggs larvae hatch sheltered fed females die without ever interacting birds biparental care common reproductive success directly depends parents ability feed chicks two parents feed twice many young favorable birds parents delivering food mammals femaleonly care common likely females internally fertilized holding young inside prolonged period gestation provides males opportunity desert females also feed young lactation birth males required feeding male parental care observed species contribute feeding carrying young fish parental care bony fish parental care usually limited selecting preparing defending nest seen sockeye salmon also parental care fish primarily done males seen gobies redlip cichlid fish v moorii exhibits biparental species internal fertilization female usually one take care young cases fertilization external male becomes main caretaker familial conflict result tradeoffs function lifetime parental investment parental investment defined robert trivers investment parent individual offspring increases offsprings chance surviving cost parents ability invest offspringcitation needed parental investment includes behaviors like guarding feeding parent limited amount parental investment course lifetime investment tradeoffs offspring quality quantity within brood trade offs current future broods leads conflict much parental investment provide parents invest three major types familial conflict sexual conflict among parents provide care well much care provide parent must decide whether stay care offspring desert offspring decision best modeled game theoretic approaches evolutionarily stable strategies ess best strategy one parent depends strategy adopted parent recent research found response matching parents determine much care invest offspring studies found parent great tits match partners increased caregiving efforts increased provisioning rates cued parental response type behavioral negotiation parents leads stabilized compensation sexual conflicts give rise antagonistic coevolution sexes try get sex care offspring example waltzing fly prochyliza xanthostoma ejaculate feeding maximizes female reproductive success minimizes females chance mating evidence suggests sperm evolved prevent female waltzing flies mating multiply order ensure males according robert triverss theory relatednesscitation needed offspring related related parents siblings genetically offspring predisposed behave selfinterest parents predisposed behave equally offspring including current future ones offspring selfishly try take fair shares parental investment parents try spread parental investment equally amongst present young future young many examples conflict nature one manifestation asynchronous hatching birds behavioral ecology hypothesis known lacks brood reduction hypothesis named david lackcitation needed lacks hypothesis posits evolutionary ecological explanation birds lay series eggs asynchronous delay leading nestlings mixed age weights according lack brood behavior ecological insurance allows larger birds survive poor years birds survive food also see sexratio conflict queen workers social hymenoptera haplodiploidy workers offspring prefer female male sex allocation queen prefers sex ratio queen workers try bias sex ratio species workers gain control sex ratio species like b terrestris queen considerable amount control colony sex lastly recent evidence regarding genomic imprinting result conflict paternal genes offspring demand maternal resources maternal genes offspring vice versa shown imprinted genes like insulinlike growth parents need honest signal offspring indicates level hunger need parents distribute resources accordingly offspring want fair share resources exaggerate signals wheedle parental investment however conflict countered cost excessive begging excessive begging attract predators also retards chick growth begging goes thus cost increased begging enforces offspring honesty another resolution conflict parental provisioning offspring demand actually coevolved obvious underlying conflict crossfostering experiments great tits parus major shown offspring beg biological mothers therefore seems willingness invest offspring coadapted offspring demand lifetime parental investment fixed amount parental resources available parents young offspring wants much possible siblings brood often compete parental resources trying gain fair share parents offer nature provides numerous examples sibling rivalry escalates extreme one sibling tries kill broodmates maximize parental investment see siblicide galápagos fur seal second pup female usually born first pup still suckling competition mothers milk especially fierce periods food shortage el niño year usually results older pup directly attacking killing younger bird species sibling rivalry also abetted asynchronous hatching eggs bluefooted booby example first egg nest hatched four days second one resulting elder chick fourday head start growth elder chick falls expected weight threshold attacks younger sibling drives sibling relatedness brood also influences level conflict study passerine birds found chicks begged loudly species higher levels extrapair animals deceive species providing parental care brood parasites selfishly exploit hosts parents host offspring common cuckoo well known example brood parasite female cuckoos lay single egg nest host species cuckoo chick hatches ejects host eggs young examples brood parasites include honeyguides cowbirds large blue brood parasite offspring many strategies induce host parents invest parental care studies show common cuckoo uses vocal mimicry reproduce sound multiple hungry host young solicit cuckoos use visual deception wings exaggerate begging display false gapes brood parasite offspring cause host parents collect another example brood parasite phengaris butterflies phengaris rebeli phengaris arion differ cuckoo butterflies oviposit directly nest host ant species myrmica rather butterfly larvae release chemicals deceive ants believing ant larvae causing ants bring butterfly larvae back nests feed examples brood parasites polistes sulcifer paper wasp lost ability build nests females lay eggs nest host species polistes dominula rely host workers take care well bombus bohemicus bumblebee relies host workers various bombus similarly eulaema meriana leucospidae wasps exploit brood cells nest shelter food vespula austriaca another wasp females force host workers feed take care particular bombus hyperboreus arctic bee species also classified brood parasite attacks enslaves species within subgenus alpinobombus propagate various types mating systems include monogamy polygyny polyandry promiscuity differentiated sexual behavior mates males mate certain females influential paper stephen emlen lewis oring argued two main factors animal behavior influence diversity mating systems relative accessibility sex mates parental desertion either sex system male parental care resource dispersion predation effects social living primarily influence female dispersion turn influences male dispersion since males primary concern female acquisition males either indirectly directly compete females direct competition males directly focused blueheaded wrasse demonstrate behavior females follow good nest males follow conversely species males exemplify indirectly competitive behavior tend towards males anticipation resources desired females subsequent effort control acquire resources helps achieve success greysided voles demonstrate indirect male competition females males experimentally observed home sites best food anticipation females settling males euglossa imperialis nonsocial bee species also demonstrate indirect competitive behavior forming aggregations territories considered leks defend fragrantrich primary territories purpose aggregations largely facultative since suitable fragrantrich sites habitable territories inhabit giving females species large selection males potentially leks choruses also deemed another behavior among phenomena male competition females due resourcepoor nature territories lekking males often defend difficult categorize indirect competitors example ghost moth males display leks attract female mate additionally difficult classify direct competitors seeing put great deal effort defense territories females arrive upon female arrival put great mating displays attract females individual sites observations make difficult determine whether female resource dispersion primarily influences male aggregation especially lieu apparent difficulty males may defending resources females densely populated reason male aggregation leks unclear five hypotheses proposed postulates propose following reasons male lekking hotspot predation reduction increased female attraction hotshot males facilitation female mating behaviors discussed primary factors influencing differences within species ecology social conflicts life history instances neither direct indirect competition seen instead species like ediths checkerspot butterfly males efforts directed acquisition females exhibit indiscriminate mate location behavior given low cost mistakes blindly attempt mate correctly females incorrectly monogamy mating system birds possibly male female greater number offspring share raising obligate monogamy males feed females nest share incubation chickfeeding species males females form lifelong pair bonds monogamy may also arise limited opportunities polygamy due strong competition among males mates females suffering loss male help birds polygyny occurs males indirectly monopolize females controlling resources species males normally contribute much parental care females suffer relatively little species however females suffer loss male contribution cost share resources male controls nest sites food cases polygynous male may control highquality territory female benefits polygyny may outweigh also seems polyandry threshold males may better agreeing share female instead maintaining monogamous mating situations may lead cooperation among males include food scarce intense competition territories females example male lions sometimes form coalitions gain control pride females populations galapagos hawks groups males would cooperate defend one breeding territory males would share matings female share paternity birds desertion often happens food abundant remaining partner better able raise young unaided desertion also occurs great chance parent gain another mate depends environmental populational birds phalaropes reversed sex roles female larger brightly colored compete males incubate jacanas female larger male territory could overlap multiple territories four frog species p bibronii female
