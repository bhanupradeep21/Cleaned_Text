invertebrates umbrella term describing animals neither develop retain vertebral column commonly known spine backbone evolved notochord paraphyletic grouping including animals excluding chordate subphylum vertebrata ie vertebrates wellknown phyla invertebrates include arthropods mollusks annelids echinoderms flatworms cnidarians sponges majority animal species invertebrates one estimate puts figure many invertebrate taxa greater number diversity species entire subphylum invertebrates vary widely size μm ft colossal socalled invertebrates tunicata cephalochordata actually sister chordate subphyla vertebrata closely related vertebrates invertebrates makes term invertebrates rather polyphyletic term little meaning taxonomy word invertebrate comes latin word vertebra means joint general sometimes specifically joint spinal column vertebrate jointed aspect vertebra derived concept turning expressed root verto vorto prefix means term invertebrates always precise among nonbiologists since accurately describe taxon way arthropoda vertebrata manidae terms describes valid taxon phylum subphylum family invertebrata term convenience taxon little circumscriptional significance except within chordata vertebrata subphylum comprises small proportion metazoa speak kingdom animalia terms vertebrata invertebrata limited practicality formal taxonomy animalia attributes logically precede presence absence vertebral column constructing cladogram example presence notochord would least circumscribe chordata however even notochord would less fundamental criterion aspects embryological development perhaps despite concept invertebrates taxon animals persisted century among within zoological community literature remains use term convenience animals members following text reflects earlier scientific understanding term animals constituted according understanding invertebrates possess skeleton bone either internal external include hugely varied body plans many fluidfilled hydrostatic skeletons like jellyfish worms others hard exoskeletons outer shells like insects crustaceans familiar invertebrates include protozoa porifera coelenterata platyhelminthes nematoda

differentiated tissues also typically digestive chamber one two openings exterior body plans multicellular organisms exhibit form symmetry whether radial bilateral spherical minority however exhibit

able detect increasing pressures tissue neurons identified wide range invertebrate species including annelids molluscs nematodes one type invertebrate respiratory system open respiratory system composed spiracles tracheae tracheoles terrestrial arthropods transport metabolic gases distribution spiracles vary greatly among many orders insects general segment body one pair spiracles connects atrium relatively large tracheal tube behind tracheae invaginations cuticular exoskeleton branch anastomose throughout body diameters micrometres mm smallest tubes tracheoles penetrate cells serve sites diffusion water oxygen carbon dioxide gas may conducted respiratory system means active ventilation passive diffusion unlike vertebrates insects generally carry oxygen tracheal tube may contain ridgelike circumferential rings taenidia various geometries loops helices head thorax abdomen tracheae may also connected air sacs many insects grasshoppers bees actively pump air sacs abdomen able control flow air body aquatic insects tracheae exchange gas body wall directly form gill function essentially normal via plastron despite internal tracheae arthropods shed moulting vertebrate animals ears though many invertebrates detect sound using kinds sense organs insects tympanal organs used hear distant sounds located either head elsewhere depending insect tympanal organs insects extremely sensitive offering acute hearing beyond animals female cricket fly ormia ochracea tympanal organs side abdomen connected thin bridge exoskeleton function like tiny pair eardrums linked provide acute directional information fly uses ears detect call host male cricket depending song cricket coming flys hearing organs reverberate slightly different frequencies difference may little billionths second enough allow fly home directly singing male cricket parasitise like vertebrates invertebrates reproduce least partly sexual reproduction produce specialized reproductive cells undergo meiosis produce smaller motile spermatozoa larger nonmotile fuse form zygotes develop new others capable asexual reproduction sometimes methods reproduction extensive research model invertebrate species drosophila melanogaster caenorhabditis elegans contributed much understanding meiosis reproduction however beyond model systems modes reproduction found invertebrates show incredible one extreme example estimated orbatid mite species persisted without sexual reproduction reproduced asexually million social behavior widespread invertebrates including cockroaches termites aphids thrips ants bees passalidae acari spiders social interaction particularly salient eusocial species applies invertebrates well insects recognize information transmitted term invertebrates covers several phyla one sponges porifera long thought diverged animals lack complex organization found cells differentiated cases organized distinct sponges typically feed drawing water speculate sponges primitive may instead secondarily ctenophora cnidaria includes sea anemones corals jellyfish radially symmetric digestive chambers single opening serves mouth distinct tissues organized two main germ layers ectoderm endoderm scattered cells sometimes called echinodermata radially symmetric exclusively marine including starfish asteroidea sea urchins echinoidea brittle stars ophiuroidea sea cucumbers holothuroidea feather stars largest animal phylum also included within invertebrates arthropoda including insects spiders crabs kin organisms body divided repeating segments typically paired appendages addition possess hardened exoskeleton periodically shed two smaller phyla onychophora tardigrada close relatives arthropods share traits excluding hardened exoskeleton nematoda roundworms perhaps second largest animal phylum also invertebrates roundworms typically microscopic occur nearly every environment number important smaller phyla related kinorhyncha priapulida loricifera groups reduced coelom called pseudocoelom invertebrates include nemertea ribbon worms sipuncula another phylum platyhelminthes originally considered primitive appears developed complex flatworms acoelomates lacking body cavity closest relatives microscopic rotifera rotifers common aqueous environments invertebrates also include acanthocephala spinyheaded worms gnathostomulida micrognathozoa also included two successful animal phyla mollusca former secondlargest animal phylum number described species includes animals snails clams squids latter comprises segmented worms earthworms leeches two groups long considered close relatives common presence trochophore larvae annelids considered closer arthropods generally considered convergent evolution owing many morphological genetic differences two among lesser phyla invertebrates hemichordata acorn chaetognatha arrow worms phyla include acoelomorpha brachiopoda bryozoa entoprocta phoronida xenoturbellida invertebrates classified several main categories taxonomically obsolescent debatable still used terms convenience however appears article following earliest animal fossils appear invertebrates fossils trezona formation trezona bore west central flinders south australia interpreted early paleontologists suggest animals appeared much earlier possibly early billion years though probably became multicellular tonian trace fossils tracks burrows found late neoproterozoic era indicate presence triploblastic worms roughly large mm wide complex around mya animals began diversifying many important groups invertebrates diverged one another

conclusion invertebrates group deviates normal vertebrates said researchers past lamarck viewed vertebrates standard lamarcks theory evolution believed characteristics acquired evolutionary process involved survival also progression toward higher form humans vertebrates closer invertebrates although goaldirected evolution abandoned distinction invertebrates vertebrates persists day even though grouping noted hardly natural even sharp another reason cited continued distinction lamarck created precedent classifications difficult escape also possible humans believe vertebrates group deserves
