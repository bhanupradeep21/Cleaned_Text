pharmacology testosterone androgen anabolic steroid aas medication naturally occurring steroid hormone concerns pharmacodynamics pharmacokinetics various routes administration testosterone naturally occurring bioidentical aas agonist androgen receptor biological target androgens like endogenous testosterone dihydrotestosterone dht testosterone used men women taken variety different routes

subcutaneous injection oil solutions aqueous suspensions subcutaneous pharmacokinetics testosterone including bioavailability metabolism biological halflife parameters differ route likewise potency testosterone local effects certain tissues instance liver differ route administration particular oral route subject high firstpass effect results high levels testosterone liver consequent hepatic androgenic effects well low potency due firstpass metabolism intestines liver metabolites like dihydrotestosterone androgen conversely case nonoral routes bypass first different testosterone routes
