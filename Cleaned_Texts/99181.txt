pointy wings decurved bill sexually woodswallows sometimes grouped within family cracticidae though two lineages may diverged roughly million years grouping supported morphological analyses weakly supported limited dna comprehensive genetic analysis disproves two may sister remains disputed however recent mitochondrial phylogeny instead supports sister relationship cracticids african bushshrikes additionally mottled berryhunter may another sister taxa within cracticids morphology tarsometatarsus suggests kurrartapu closely related currawongs diverged likely mid currawongs appear evolved earlier possibly indicative group shares traits kurrartapu kurrartapu fossil found early miocene deposit australia experiencing effects global warming phase followed melting polar ice plant animal fossils also found deposit closely related extant rainforest subtropical tropical closed forest dwelling early miocene fossils suggest central australian lakes swamps hosted sclerophyll forests dominated acacia casuarina temperate rainforests canopy consisted mainly coniferous podocorp araucarian deciduous nothofagus trees understory tree ferns predominately cyatheacean dicksoniacean along diversity rich diversity early miocene australian forests approximates modern lowlands forests forever wet ranged warm cool time early miocene australia broken implies kurrartapu restricted continent likely resided within widespread rainforests aboard similar nonmigratory black extant australian one might assume kurrartapu equally sedentary although contemporary currawongs undertake altitudinal kurrartapus likely diminished rainforest habitat loss accompanying increasing aridification expansion savannas occurred mid late gondwanas breakup movement continents altered ocean currents precipitated icehouse conditions brought reduced rainfall cool temperatures extinction many based comparison currawongs australian magpie one might infer kurrartapus also territorial possibly likely

intelligence shared likely kurrartapus hoppers navigated ground moving legs parallel synchronization butcherbirds currawongs although australian magpies developed bipedalism able walk like cracticids probably predatory omnivores generalists active daytime feeding mainly invertebrates carrion though consuming smaller vertebrates fruits observations australian magpie piedbilled currawong diets show heavy invertebrate consumption predominantly beetles ants moths caterpillars orthopterans spiders though piedbilled currawongs consumed fruit significantly hypothesized based closest living relatives
