economics hyperbolic discounting timeinconsistent model delay discounting one cornerstones behavioral brainbasis actively studied neuroeconomics according discounted utility approach intertemporal choices different choices except consequences delayed hence must anticipated discounted ie reweighted take account delay given two similar rewards humans show preference one arrives sooner rather later humans said discount value later reward factor increases length delay financial world process normally modeled form exponential discounting timeconsistent model discounting many psychological studies since demonstrated deviations instinctive preference constant discount rate assumed exponential hyperbolic discounting alternative mathematical model agrees closely according hyperbolic discounting valuations fall relatively rapidly earlier delay periods one week fall slowly longer delay periods instance days example early study subjects said would indifferent receiving immediately months year years indifferences reflect annual discount rates declined delays got contrasts exponential discounting valuation falls constant factor per unit delay discount rate stays standard experiment used reveal test subjects hyperbolic discounting curve compare shortterm preferences longterm preferences instance would prefer dollar today three dollars tomorrow would prefer dollar one year three dollars one year one day claimed significant fraction subjects take lesser amount today gladly wait one extra day year order receive higher amount individuals preferences described presentbiased important consequence hyperbolic discounting creates temporary preferences small rewards occur sooner larger later ones individuals using hyperbolic discounting reveal strong tendency make choices inconsistent time make choices today future self would prefer made despite knowing information dynamic inconsistency happens hyperbolas distort relative value options fixed difference delays proportion far choicemaker phenomenon hyperbolic discounting implicit richard herrnsteins matching law states dividing time effort two nonexclusive ongoing sources reward subjects allocate direct proportion rate size rewards two sources inverse proportion subjects choices match parameters report effect case george ainslie pointed single choice larger later smaller sooner reward inverse proportionality delay would described plot value delay hyperbolic shape smaller sooner reward preferred preference reversed increasing rewards delays absolute amount ainslies research showed substantial number subjects reported would prefer immediately rather six months would prefer months rather nine months even though choice seen months greater distance significantly subjects said preferred months months said would prefer months pair options different preferencereversal effect depend excitement getting immediate depend human culture first preference reversal findings rats many subsequent experiments confirmed spontaneous preferences human nonhuman subjects follow hyperbolic curve rather conventional exponential curve would produce consistent choice instance offered choice year many people choose immediate however given choice five years six years almost everyone choose six years even though choice seen five years greater distance hyperbolic discounting also found relate realworld examples selfcontrol indeed variety studies used measures hyperbolic discounting find drugdependent individuals discount delayed consequences matched nondependent controls suggesting extreme delay discounting fundamental behavioral process drug evidence suggests pathological gamblers also discount delayed outcomes higher rates matched whether high rates hyperbolic discounting precede addictions vice versa currently unknown although studies reported highrate discounters likely consume lowerrate discounters likewise suggested highrate hyperbolic discounting makes unpredictable gambling outcomes degree discounting vitally important describing hyperbolic discounting especially discounting specific rewards money discounting monetary rewards varies across age groups due varying discount rate depends variety factors including species observed age experience amount time needed consume suppose study participants offered choice taking x dollars immediately taking dollars n days later suppose one participant study employs exponential discounting another employs hyperbolic discounting participants know invest money receive today savings plan gives interest r realize take x dollars immediately future value savings plan yield dollars n days later participant correctly understands fundamental question asked given value dollars n days minimum amount x dollars willing accept words many dollars would need invest today get dollars n days take x dollars x greater answer calculate take dollars n days x smaller answer however methods use calculate amount answers get different exponential discounter use correct method get reliably correct result n becomes large value rn becomes much larger value effect value rn becomes much smaller value therefore minimum value x number dollars immediate choice suffices greater amount much smaller hyperbolic discounter thinks result perceive xvalues range r n inclusive small result irrationally

rate gains greatly circumstances many examples exist financial world example reasonable assume implicit risk reward available future date furthermore risk increases time consider paying dinner today

heuristic hyperbolic subjects also reported changing relative preferences see details temporal construal study daniel read introduces subadditive discounting fact discounting delay increases delay divided smaller intervals hypothesis may explain main finding many studies support hyperbolic observation impatience declines also accounting observations predicted hyperbolic however although observations depart exponential discounting entail preference reversal time choice earlier reward increases arousal appetite emotion sometimes lead preference reversal widely accepted alternative simply hyperbolic function hyperboloid quasihyperbolic discounting fuses exponential curves arousal bump visceral reward becomes cases obviously important still account cases either neither choice made arousal obvious objection hyperbolic discounting many people learn choose consistently time situations similarly paper criticized existing studies mostly using data collected university students
