methylthioninium chloride commonly called methylene blue salt used dye medication medication mainly used treat methemoglobinemia chemically reducing ferric iron hemoglobin ferrous specifically used treat methemoglobin levels greater symptoms despite oxygen previously used treating cyanide poisoning urinary tract infections use longer methylene blue typically given injection common side effects include headache vomiting use pregnancy may harm baby using methemoglobinemia likely methylene blue first prepared heinrich world health organizations list essential methylene blue employed medication
