reconstructive memory theory memory recall act remembering influenced various cognitive processes including perception imagination motivation semantic memory beliefs amongst others people view memories coherent truthful account episodic memory believe perspective free error recall however reconstructive process memory recall subject distortion intervening cognitive functions individual perceptions social influences world knowledge lead errors reconstruction memory rarely relies literal recount past experiences using multiple interdependent cognitive processes never single location brain given complete memory trace experience rather memory dependent constructive processes encoding may introduce errors distortions essentially constructive memory process functions encoding

unable form specific description unique characteristics given memory would like little available distinctive information given episode overlap across multiple episodes leading individual recall general similarities common memories ultimately proper recall desired target memory fails due interference nontarget memories activated secondly large number errors occur memory reconstruction caused

reconstruction rely use schema information networks organize store abstract knowledge brain schema generally defined mental information networks represent aspect collected world knowledge frederic bartlett one first psychologists propose schematic theory suggesting individuals understanding world influenced elaborate neural networks organize abstract information schema fairly consistent become strongly internalized individual socialization turn alters recall episodic memory schema understood central reconstruction used confabulate fill gaps provide plausible narrative bartlett also showed schema tied cultural social piagets theory proposed alternative understanding schema based two concepts assimilation accommodation piaget defined assimilation process making sense novel unfamiliar information using previously learned information assimilate piaget defined second cognitive process served integrate new information memory altering preexisting schematic networks fit novel concepts

reconstructive memory accuracy subject many studies eyewitness testimony firsthand accounts given individuals event witnessed eyewitness testimony used acquire details event even identify perpetrators eyewitness testimony used often court viewed favorably juries reliable source unfortunately eyewitness testimony easily manipulated variety factors anxiety state distress uneasiness mind caused consistently associated witnessing crimes study done yuille cutshall discovered witnesses reallife violent crimes able remember event quite vividly even five months originally fact witnesses violent traumatic crimes often selfreport memory particularly vivid reason eyewitness memory often listed example flashbulb memory however study clifford scott participants shown either film violent crime film nonviolent crime participants viewed stressful film difficulty remembering details event compared participants watched nonviolent study brigham et al subjects experienced electrical shock less accurate facial recognition tests suggesting details well remembered stressful fact case phenomena known weapon focus eyewitnesses stressful crimes involving weapons may perform worse suspect studies flashbulb memories seem indicate witnesses may recall vivid sensory content unrelated actual event enhance perceived due vividness eyewitnesses may place higher confidence reconstructed use schemas

introduced theory priming refers increased sensitivity certain stimuli due prior priming believed occur outside conscious awareness makes different memory relies direct retrieval priming influence reconstructive memory interfere retrieval cues psychologist elizabeth loftus presented many papers concerning effects proactive interference recall eyewitness events interference involving priming established classic study john palmer loftus palmer recruited participants showed film traffic accident participants fill questionnaire concerning videos details participants split three groups week

others primed word smashed questionnaire one week answering question changing one word questionnaire memories reencoded new confabulation involuntary false remembering events characteristic several psychological diseases korsakoffs syndrome alzheimers disease schizophrenia traumatic injury certain brain confabulating dont know remembering false intent regular process reconstruction several sources used accrue information add detail memory patients producing confabulations key sources information missing sources used produce cohesive internally consistent often believable false source type confabulations differ type disease area traumatic damage selective memory involves actively forgetting negative experiences enhancing positive process actively affects reconstructive memory distorting recollections events affects reconstructive memories two ways many autobiographies excellent examples motivated selfenhancement recalling events taken place ones life tendency make oneself
