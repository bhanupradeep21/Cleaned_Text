evolution cooperation process groups organisms work act together common mutual benefits commonly defined adaptation evolved least part increase reproductive success actors social example territorial choruses male lions discourage intruders likely benefit process contrasts intragroup competition individuals work selfish reasons cooperation exists humans animals well diversity taxa exhibits cooperation quite large ranging zebra herds pied babblers african elephants many animal plant species cooperate members species members species cooperation animals appears occur mostly direct benefit relatives spending time resources assisting related individual may first seem destructive organisms chances survival actually beneficial longterm since relatives share part helpers genetic makeup enhancing individuals chance survival may actually increase likelihood helpers genetic traits passed future however researchers ecology professor tim cluttonbrock assert cooperation complex process state helpers may receive direct less indirect gains assisting others commonly reported gains include protection predation increased reproductive fitness furthermore insist cooperation may solely interaction two individuals may part broader goal unifying prominent biologists charles darwin e wilson w hamilton found evolution cooperation fascinating natural selection favors achieve greatest reproductive success cooperative behavior often decreases reproductive success actor individual performing cooperative behavior hence cooperation seemed pose challenging problem theory natural selection rests assumption individuals compete survive maximize reproductive additionally species found perform cooperative behaviors may first sight seem detrimental evolutionary fitness example ground squirrel sounds alarm call warn group members nearby coyote draws attention increases odds multiple hypotheses evolution cooperation rooted hamiltons models based inclusive fitness models hypothesize cooperation favored natural selection due either direct fitness benefits mutually beneficial cooperation indirect fitness benefits altruistic explained direct benefits encompass byproduct benefits enforced reciprocity indirect benefits kin selection encompass limited dispersal kin discrimination greenbeard effect one specific form cooperation animals kin selection involves animals promoting reproductive success kin thereby promoting different theories explaining kin selection proposed including paytostay territory inheritance hypotheses paytostay theory suggests individuals help others rear offspring order return favor breeders allowing live land territory inheritance theory contends individuals help order improved access breeding areas breeders studies conducted red wolves support previous researchers contention helpers obtain immediate longterm gains cooperative researchers evaluated consequences red wolves decisions stay packs extended periods time birth delayed dispersal helped wolves offspring studies also found extended male helper wolves life spans suggests kin selection may benefit individual longterm increased fitness also shortterm increased survival research suggests individuals provide help closer relatives phenomenon known kin metaanalysis researchers compiled data kin selection mediated genetic relatedness species including western bluebird pied kingfisher australian magpie dwarf mongoose found different species exhibited varying degrees kin discrimination largest frequencies occurring among gain cooperative cooperation exists animals also plants greenhouse experiment ipomoea hederacea climbing plant results show kin groups higher efficiency rates growth nonkin groups expected rise reduced competition within kin inclusive fitness theory provides good overview possible solutions fundamental problem cooperation theory based hypothesis cooperation helps transmitting underlying genes future generations either increasing reproductive successes individual direct fitness individuals carry genes indirect fitness direct benefits result simple byproduct cooperation enforcement mechanisms indirect benefits result cooperation genetically similar also called mutually beneficial cooperation actor recipient depend direct fitness benefits broken two different types byproduct benefit enforcement byproduct benefit arises consequence social partners shared interest cooperation example meerkats larger group size provides benefit members group increasing survival rates foraging success conflict living groups better living alone cooperation arises passively result many animals thing byproduct benefit also arise consequence subordinate animals staying helping nest dominated leaders often suffer high mortality rates shown cooperation would advantageous sex likely remain breed natal group subordinate higher chance become dominant group time passes cooperation scenario often seen nonrelated members species wasp polistes prisoners delight another term describe byproduct benefit term coined kenneth binmore found benefits result automatic consequence otherwise selfinterested act cooperative hunting illustrated scenario two hunters hunter choice hunting cooperate hunting freeriding assuming cooperative hunting results greater rewards oneplayer hunt hunting rare hunters nonhunters benefit either player likely hunters thus likely reap rewards successful hunt situation demonstrates prisoners delight food successful hunt shared two players regardless whether shown free riding reaping benefits without effort often problem collective action examples free riding would employee labor union pays dues still benefits union representation study published scientists found female lions showed individual differences extent participated groupterritorial conflict lions consistently cooperated approaching intruders others lagged behind avoid risk fighting although lead female recognized laggards failed punish suggesting cooperation maintained cooperation maintained situations freeriding problem enforcement mechanism actor rewarded cooperating punished cooperating happens cooperation favored aiding helped actors past punishment noncooperation documented meerkats dominant females attack evict subordinate females become pregnant pregnancy seen failure cooperate dominant females allowed bear offspring dominant females attack kill offspring subordinate females evade eviction eviction often leads increased stress decreased enforcement also mutually beneficial often called reciprocal cooperation act cooperation preferentially directed individuals helped actor past directly helped helped actor past second class explanations cooperation indirect fitness benefits altruistic cooperation three major mechanisms generate type fitness benefit limited dispersal kin discrimination greenbeard effect hamilton originally suggested high relatedness could arise two ways direct kin recognition individuals limited dispersal population viscosity keep relatives easiest way generate relatedness social partners limited dispersal mechanism genetic similarity correlates spatial proximity individuals move far kin usually surrounds hence act altruism would directed primarily towards kin mechanism shown pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria cooperation disfavored populations well mixed favored high local kin discrimination also influences cooperation actor give aid preferentially towards related partners since kin usually share common genes thought nepotism lead genetic relatedness actor partners offspring affects cooperation actor might give mechanism similar happens greenbeard effect greenbeard effect actor instead identify social partners share gene cooperation greenbeard system must always cooccur within individuals alleles produce perceptible trait recognition trait others preferential treatment recognized examples greenbeard behavior found hydrozoans slime molds yeast ants example sideblotch lizards bluethroated males preferentially establish territories next results show neighboring bluethroats successful mate guarding however blue males next larger aggressive orange males suffer strategy blue evolutionary cycles altruism alternating mutualism tied rps game multilevel selection theory suggests selection operates one level example may operate atomic molecular level cells level cells body whole organism level community level species level level competitive others level eliminated even level highly competitive classic example genes

closely often long period time symbiosis includes three types commensalism mutualism sometimes qualify cooperation mutualism involves close mutually beneficial interaction two different biological species whereas cooperation general term involve looser interactions interspecific species intraspecific within species commensalism one two participating species benefits neither harmed benefitted parasitism one two participating species benefits expense symbiosis may obligate facultative obligate symbiosis one species depends survival facultative symbiosis symbiotic interaction necessary survival either species two special types symbiosis include endosymbiosis one species lives inside another ectosymbiosis one species lives another mutualism form symbiosis participating species benefit classic example mutualism interaction rhizobia soil bacteria legumes fabaceae interaction rhizobia bacteria induce root nodule formation legume plants via exchange molecular within root nodules rhizobia fix atmospheric nitrogen ammonia using nitrogenase enzyme legume benefits new supply usable nitrogen rhizobia rhizobia benefits organic acid energy sources plant well protection provided root nodule since rhizobia live within legume example endosymbiosis since bacteria plant survive independently also example facultative symbiosis lichens another example mutualism lichens consist fungus mycobiont photosynthetic partner photobiont usually green alga cyanobacteria mycobiont benefits sugar products photosynthesis generated photobiont photobiont benefits increased water retention increased surface area capture water mineral nutrients conferred mycobiont many lichens examples obligate symbiosis fact onefifth known extant fungal species form obligate symbiotic associations green algae cyanobacteria examples mutualism also examples cooperation specifically byproduct mutualism participants benefit cooperation involved example elephant defecates beneficial elephant way empty waste also beneficial dung beetle uses elephants dung however neither participants behavior yields benefit thus cooperation taking hidden benefits benefits cooperation obvious obscure delayed example hidden benefit would involve increase number offspring offspring viability one example hidden benefit involves malarus cyaneus superb fairywren cyaneus presence helpers nest lead increase chick mass however presence helpers confer hidden benefit increases chance mother survive breed next another example hidden benefit indirect reciprocity donor individual helps
