oxygen mask mask provides method transfer breathing oxygen gas storage tank lungs oxygen masks may cover nose mouth oral nasal mask entire face fullface mask may made plastic silicone rubber certain circumstances oxygen may delivered via nasal cannula instead mask medical plastic oxygen masks used primarily medical care providers oxygen therapy disposable reduce cleaning costs infection risks mask design determine accuracy oxygen delivered many various medical situations requiring treatment oxygen oxygen naturally occurring room air higher percentages often essential medical treatment oxygen higher percentages classified drug much oxygen potentially harmful patients health resulting oxygen dependence time extreme circumstances patient blindness reasons oxygen therapy closely
