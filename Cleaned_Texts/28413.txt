endocrinology paper appeared describing loss x chromosome turners syndrome founded first human cytogenetics laboratory finland first concentrated cytogenetics turners syndrome turned addition structural abnormalities single x chromosome commonly involved well mosaicism genotypephenotype correlations described resulting publication became de la chapelles first breakthrough publication also phd thesis cytogenetics turner syndrome time extensive study targeting abnormalities affecting sex determination de la chapelle published first example male karyotype first step towards establishment

recessively inherited lethal skeletal dysplasia characterized extreme micromelia short limbs underlying mutation homozygosity gene later found responsible syndrome syndrome called de la chapelle dysplasia dlcd omim alternative name atelosteogenesis type de la chapelle decided begin clarify genetic basis disorders recessively inherited known greatly overrepresented finnish population due founder nature ie present population derives small number settlers without significant recent influx diseases said comprise finnish disease heritage de la chapelle laboratory soon transformed molecular genetics one working mainly restriction fragment length polymorphisms markers prominent use strong linkage disequilibrium patterns important tool disease disease mapped critical genomic intervals positional cloning culpable genes identified based occurrence pathogenic mutations number diseases studied approximately including nonfinnish disorders syndrome de la chapelle group mapped

colorectal cancer hnpcc characterized greatly increased risk colorectal endometrial cancer plus moderately increased risk cancers collaborations finnish us new zealand canadian researchers led study exceptionally large families favorable linkage analysis genotyping helsinki led breakthrough convincing linkage found locus chromosome subsequently shown harbor first time proved lynch syndrome exists mendelian disorder addition tumors families shown display greatly reduced dna repair nowadays referred measured microsatellite instability msi mismatch repair paper first early descriptions microsatellite instability representing major breakthrough translational consequences addition established link microsatellite instability hereditary form colorectal cancer two decades later dr de la chapelle coauthored paper describing dramatic results therapy antibodies patients microsatellite unstable mapping detection msi led avalanche research targeting presumptive human homologs already known yeast mismatch repair genes end mismatch repair genes cloned shown cause lynch syndrome dr de la chapelles group contributed cloning characterization genes unraveling lynch syndrome important implications morbidity mortality substantially reduced mutationpositive individuals clinical surveillance interventions estimatedclarification needed new cases ls would detected year us provided atrisk family members affected individuals screened probands mutation increasingly practiced numerous institutions hospitals around globe beginning main component de la chapelles research centered detecting annotating gene mutations predispose thyroid cancer tc relying ample experience work finnish disease heritage see de la chapelle laboratory used linkage linkage disequilibrium analysis search genes high penetrance genes low penetrance genomewide association analysis gwas carried presently highpenetrance genes lowpenetrance variants found annotated becoming increasingly clear many predisposing genes high penetrance exist rare ultrarare instead single nucleotide polymorphisms variants low penetrance account genetically determined risk ongoing research de la chapelle lab aims
