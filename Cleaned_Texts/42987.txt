grayanotoxins group closely related neurotoxins named leucothoe grayana plant native japan originally named century american botanist asa grayanotoxin also known andromedotoxin acetylandromedol rhodotoxin grayanotoxins produced rhododendron species plants family ericaceae honey made nectar containing pollen plants also contains grayanotoxins commonly referred mad consumption plant secondary products including mad honey cause rare poisonous reaction called grayanotoxin poisoning mad honey disease honey intoxication rhododendron frequently produced consumed regions nepal turkey recreational drug traditional grayanotoxins produced plants family ericaceae specifically members genera rhododendron pieris agarista genus rhododendron alone encompasses species grow around world parts europe north america japan nepal turkey grow variety altitudes ranging sea level three kilometers many species contain grayanotoxins contain significant levels species high concentrations grayanotoxins r ponticum r flavum r luteum commonly found nepal regions turkey bordering black nearly parts grayanotoxinproducing rhododendrons contain molecule including stem leaves flower pollen nectar grayanotoxins also found secondary plant products honey labrador tea cigarettes herbal grayanotoxins low molecular weight hydrophobic structurally characterized polyhydroxylated cyclic diterpenes base structure ring system contain grayanotoxin isoforms identified rhododendron grayanotoxin iii thought principal toxic isoforms different rhododendron species contain multiple different grayanotoxin isoforms contributing differences plant toxicity grayanotoxin derived ability interfere voltagegated sodium channels located cell membrane neurons channels consist four homologous domains iiv containing six transmembrane alphahelical segments grayanotoxin binding affinity approximately μm binds group ii receptor site located segment domains iv toxins bind region include alkaloids veratridine batrachotoxin experiments utilizing squid axonal membranes indicate sodium channel binding likely occurs internal face additionally grayanotoxin binds activated conformation sodium channels normally voltage gated sodium channels activated opened cell membrane potential reaches specific threshold voltage activated conformation allows influx sodium ions resulting cell depolarization followed firing action potential peak action potential voltagegated sodium channels quickly inactivated reset cell repolarized resting potential grayanotoxin present binding induces conformational changes prevent sodium channel inactivation lead prolonged depolarization owing transient ability activate channels increase membrane permeability sodium ions grayanotoxin classified reversible prolonged sodium channel activation cell depolarization leads overstimulation central nervous system physical symptoms grayanotoxin poisoning appear dosedependent latent period several minutes approximately three hours common clinical symptoms include various cardiovascular effects nausea vomiting change consciousness cardiovascular effects may include hypotension low blood pressure various cardiac rhythm disorders sinus bradycardia slow regular heart rhythm bradyarrhythmia slow irregular heart rhythm partial complete atrioventricular earlyonset symptoms may include diplopia blurred vision dizziness hypersalivation perspiration weakness paresthesia extremities around mouth higher doses symptoms include loss coordination severe progressive muscular weakness electrocardiographic changes bundle branch block andor stsegment elevations seen ischemic myocardial threat nodal rhythm wolffparkinsonwhite primary mediator grayanotoxin pathophysiology paired vagus nerve tenth cranial vagus nerve major component parasympathetic nervous system branch autonomic nervous system innervates various organs including lungs stomach kidney heart one study experimental administration grayanotoxin bilaterally vagotomized rats failed induce bradycardia common symptom grayanotoxin poisoning supporting role vagal vagal stimulation myocardium specifically mediated muscarinic acetylcholine receptors severe cases grayanotoxin poisoning atropine nonspecific machr antagonist muscarinic antagonist used treat bradycardia heart rhythm malfunctions addition correcting rhythm disorders administration fluids vasopressors also help treat hypotension mitigate patients exposed low doses grayanotoxin typically recover within hours severe cases symptoms may persist hours longer may require medical treatment described despite risk cardiac problems grayanotoxin poisoning rarely fatal contrast humans grayanotoxin poisoning lethal nectar containing grayanotoxin kill honeybees though seem resistance produce honey nectar see according team researchers uk ireland worker bumblebees harmed may preferable pollinators transfer pollen consequently may advantageous plants produce grayanotoxin order pollinated bees collect pollen nectar grayanotoxincontaining plants often produce honey also contains socalled mad honey common cause grayanotoxin poisoning humans smallscale producers mad honey typically harvest honey small area single hive order produce final product containing significant concentration grayanotoxin contrast largescale honey production often mixes honey gathered different locations diluting concentration contaminated mad honey deliberately produced regions world notably nepal black sea region turkey nepal type honey used gurung people hallucinogenic properties supposed medicinal turkey mad honey known deli bal also used recreational drug traditional medicine commonly made nectar rhododendron luteum rhododendron ponticum caucasus eighteenth century honey exported europe add alcoholic drinks give extra potency modern times consumed locally exported north america europe addition various rhododendron species mad honey also made several grayanotoxincontaining plants honey produced nectar andromeda polifolia contains high enough levels grayanotoxin cause full body paralysis potentially fatal breathing difficulties due diaphragm honey obtained spoonwood allied species sheeplaurel also cause honey lestrimelitta limao also produces paralyzing effect seen honey polifolia also toxic although mad honey used traditional medicine majority grayanotoxin poisoning cases occur middleaged males use honey perceived sexual intoxicating effects mad honey known thousands years many famous episodes human inebriation caused consumption xenophon aristotle strabo pliny columella document results eating maddening honey believed pollen nectar rhododendron luteum rhododendron according xenophons anabasis invading greek army accidentally poisoned harvesting eating local asia minor honey made quick recovery without heard incident realizing foreign invaders would ignorant dangers local honey king mithridates later used
