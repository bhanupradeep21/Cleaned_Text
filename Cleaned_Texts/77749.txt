plant tissue culture collection techniques used maintain grow plant cells tissues organs sterile conditions nutrient culture medium known composition widely used produce clones plant method known micropropagation different techniques plant tissue culture may offer certain advantages traditional methods propagation including plant tissue culture relies fact many plant parts ability regenerate whole plant cells regenerative plant parts called totipotent cells differentiate various specialized cells single cells plant cells without cell walls protoplasts pieces leaves stems roots often used generate new plant culture media given required nutrients plant hormones preparation plant tissue tissue culture performed aseptic conditions hepa filtered air provided laminar flow cabinet thereafter tissue grown sterile containers petri dishes flasks growth room controlled temperature light intensity living plant materials environment naturally contaminated surfaces sometimes interiors microorganisms surfaces sterilized chemical solutions usually alcohol sodium calcium suitable samples known explants taken sterile explants usually placed surface sterile solid culture medium sometimes placed directly sterile liquid medium particularly cell suspension cultures desired solid liquid media generally composed inorganic salts plus organic nutrients vitamins plant hormones solid media prepared liquid media addition gelling agent usually purified agar composition medium particularly plant hormones nitrogen source nitrate versus ammonium salts amino acids profound effects morphology tissues grow initial explant example excess auxin often result proliferation roots excess cytokinin may yield shoots balance auxin cytokinin often produce unorganised growth cells callus morphology outgrowth depend plant species well medium composition cultures grow pieces typically sliced subcultured onto new media allow growth alter morphology culture skill experience tissue culturist important judging pieces culture discard shoots emerge culture may sliced rooted auxin produce plantlets mature transferred potting soil growth greenhouse normal specific differences regeneration potential different organs explants various explanations significant factors include differences stage cells cell cycle availability ability transport endogenous growth regulators metabolic capabilities cells commonly used tissue explants meristematic ends plants like stem tip axillary bud tip root tissues high rates cell division either concentrate produce required growthregulating substances including auxins cytokinins shoot regeneration efficiency tissue culture usually quantitative trait often varies plant species within plant species among subspecies varieties cultivars ecotypes therefore tissue culture regeneration become complicated especially many regeneration procedures developed different genotypes within species three common pathways plant tissue culture regeneration propagation preexisting meristems shoot culture nodal culture organogenesis nonzygotic embryogenesis propagation shoots nodal segments usually performed four stages mass production plantlets vitro vegetative multiplication organogenesis standard method micropropagation involves tissue regeneration adventitious organs axillary buds directly indirectly explants nonzygotic embryogenesis noteworthy developmental pathway highly comparable zygotic embryos important pathway producing somaclonal variants developing artificial seeds synthesizing metabolites due singlecell origin nonzygotic embryos preferred several regeneration systems micropropagation ploidy manipulation gene transfer synthetic seed production nonetheless tissue regeneration via organogenesis also proved advantageous studying regulatory mechanisms plant development tissue obtained plant cultured called explant explants taken many different parts plant including portions shoots leaves stems flowers roots single undifferentiated cells many types mature cells provided still contain living cytoplasm nuclei able dedifferentiate resume cell division given rise concept totipotency plant however true cells many species explants various organs vary rates growth regeneration grow choice explant material also determines plantlets developed via tissue culture haploid diploid also risk microbial contamination increased inappropriate explants first method involving meristems induction multiple shoots preferred method micropropagation industry since risks somaclonal variation genetic variation induced tissue culture minimal compared two methods somatic embryogenesis method potential several times higher multiplication rates amenable handling liquid culture systems like bioreactors explants like root tip hard isolate contaminated soil microflora becomes problematic tissue culture process certain soil microflora form tight associations root systems even grow within root soil particles bound roots difficult remove without injury roots allows microbial attack associated microflora generally overgrow tissue culture medium significant growth plant tissue cultured tissues slow growth would two options optimizing culture medium ii culturing highly responsive tissues necrosis spoil cultured tissues generally plant varieties differ susceptibility tissue culture necrosis thus culturing highly responsive varieties tissues aerial soil explants also rich undesirable microflora however easily removed explant gentle rinsing remainder usually killed surface sterilization surface microflora form tight associations plant tissue associations usually found visual inspection mosaic decolorization localized necrosis surface explant alternative obtaining uncontaminated explants take explants seedlings aseptically grown surfacesterilized seeds hard surface seed less permeable penetration harsh surface sterilizing agents hypochlorite acceptable conditions sterilization used seeds much stringent vegetative tissues tissuecultured plants clones original mother plant used produce first explants susceptible pathogen environmental condition entire crop would susceptible problem conversely positive traits would remain within line also plant tissue culture used widely plant sciences forestry horticulture applications include developing somaclonal
