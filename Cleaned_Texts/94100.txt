overdiagnosis diagnosis disease never cause symptoms death patients ordinarily expected thus presents practical threat regardless pathologic overdiagnosis side effect screening early forms disease although screening saves lives cases others may turn people patients unnecessarily may lead treatments good perhaps harm given tremendous variability normal biology inherent one screens incidental findings generally found large percentage appropriate medical response recognize something require intervention determining action particular finding warrants ignoring watchful waiting intervention difficult whether differential diagnosis uncertain risk ratio uncertain risks posed intervention namely adverse events versus risks posed intervening overdiagnosis occurs disease diagnosed correctly diagnosis irrelevant correct diagnosis may irrelevant treatment disease available needed wanted people contend term overdiagnosis inappropriate overtreatment representative phenomenon people diagnosed also treated difficult assess whether overdiagnosis occurred individual overdiagnosis individual determined life overdiagnosis certain individual remains untreated never develops symptoms disease dies something else distinction died disease versus died disease important relevant thus inferences overdiagnosis comes study populations rapidly rising rates testing disease diagnosis setting stable rates feared outcome disease eg death highly suggestive overdiagnosis compelling however evidence randomized trial screening test intended detect preclinical disease persistent excess detected disease tested group years trial completed constitutes best evidence overdiagnosis occurred although overdiagnosis potentially applicable diagnosis disease concept first recognized studied cancer systematic evaluation asymptomatic patients detect early forms central harm cancer screening detection abnormalities meet pathologic definition cancer microscope never progress cause symptoms death patients ordinarily expected lifetime advanced age years older concept overdiagnosis takes increasing importance life expectancy decreases various cancer types standard contraindication screening life expectancy less years simple logical reason person already medically complex health status eg multiple comorbidities realistically probably expect live less years less likely get net benefit balance benefit versus harms diagnosing treating cancer especially may indolent anyway prostate cancer classic example concept apply breast cancer types well cancer screening effort detect cancer early preclinical time period begins abnormal cell ends patient notices symptoms cancer long known people cancers short preclinical phases fastgrowing aggressive cancers others cancers long preclinical phases slowgrowing cancers heterogeneity unfortunate implication namely screening tends disproportionately detect slowgrowing cancers accessible detected long period time disproportionately miss fastgrowing cancers accessible detected short period cancers would like catch information see screening medicinelength time bias longstanding model hidden assumption namely cancers inevitably progress preclinical cancers progress cause problems patients screening testing reason detects cancers overdiagnosis occurred figure depicts heterogeneity cancer progression using arrows represent categories cancer progression arrow labeled fast represents fastgrowing cancer one quickly leads symptoms death worst forms cancer unfortunately often appear interval screening tests arrow labeled slow represents slowgrowing cancer one leads symptoms death many years cancers screening arguably greatest beneficial impact arrow labeled slow represents cancer never causes problems growing slowly cancer grows slowly enough patients die cause cancer gets big enough produce symptoms arrow labeled nonprogressive represents cancer never causes problems growing words cellular abnormalities meet pathologic definition cancer never grow cause may grow regress although concept nonprogressive cancers may seem implausible basic scientists begun uncover biologic mechanisms halt progression cancers outgrow blood supply starved others recognized hosts immune system successfully contained aggressive first place cancer grows slowly likely harm patient usually referred benign tumor although types benign tumor may require intervention often simply monitored malignant phenomenon overdiagnosis widely understood prostate dramatic increase number new cases prostate cancer observed following introduction

overdiagnosis identified mammographic screening breast longterm followup malmo randomized trial mammography found persistent excess breast cancers screened group years trial completed rate letter

probably rule exceptioncitation needed issues overdiagnosis infectious diseases malaria typhoid fever persist many regions around world example malaria overdiagnosis welldocumented african results

issues related laboratory testing see diagnosis therefore malaria overdiagnosis leads undermanagement feverinducing also overprescription antimalarial overdiagnosed patients benefit detection treatment cancer cancer never destined cause symptoms death harmed three categories harm associated overdiagnosis many identify false positive results major downside cancer screening data suggest patients informed much concerned overdiagnosis false positive overdiagnosis often confused term false positive test results misdiagnosis three distinct false positive test result refers test suggests presence disease ultimately proved error usually second precise test patients false positive test results may told disease erroneously treated overdiagnosed patients told disease generally receive treatment misdiagnosed patients condition totally different condition treated anyway overdiagnosis also distinct overtesting overtesting phenomenon patients receive medical test dont need benefit instance patient receives lumbar spine xray low back pain without sinister signs symptoms weight loss fever lower limb paresthesia etc symptoms present less weeks tests subject overtesting echocardiograms ultrasounds heart shown particularly prone detection overtesting difficult recently many populationlevel estimates emerged try detect potential overtesting common estimates geographical variation test use estimates detect regions hospitals general practices order many tests compared peers irrespective differences patient demographics methods used include identifying general practices order higher proportion tests return normal identification tests large temporal increases use without justifiable concept undiagnosing strategy review diagnostic labels remove
