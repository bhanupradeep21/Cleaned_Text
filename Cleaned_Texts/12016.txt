robert john aitken born september british reproductive biologist widely known identifying oxidative stress significant contribution infertility actions human sperm function also made substantial contributions clinical practice translation male reproductive health notably development new contraceptive vaccine born bath england moved australia took chair biological sciences university nominated provicechancellor faculty health medicine laureate professor biological sciences university newcastle since currently fellow royal society australian academy australian academy health medical former president international society aitken also founded directed priority research centre reproduction university newcastle colleagues work broad spectrum reproductive issues conception parturition aitken received many honours contributions science throughout career including carl g hartman award nsw scientist aitken cited author several biology journals particularly field andrology reproduction molecular human reproduction international journal andrology journal andrology aitken born england september born family real estate agents devon attended barnstaple boys grammar quit age follow parents footsteps become estate six months selling houses semirural residents barnstaple aitken decided return reenrolled former school study art english geography full choice study chemistry botany zoology despite initial intention avoid aitken graduated university london received bachelor science special honours university studied zoology specifically made interested reproductive biology prompting pursue masters degree embryology mammalian reproduction university college north wales continued postgraduate studies focusing wild animal reproduction veterinary clinical studies university cambridge professor roger shorts aitkens first paper ultrastructural changes uterine glands roe deer delayed implantation published journal years working dr roger short aitken completed received phd research reproductive study roe deer university cambridge cambridge aitken started postdoctoral position university edinburghs institute animal working collaboratively anne mclaren graduate university however first months edinburgh done outstanding research due transformations study models descriptive wild animals mechanistic approaches using mouse well changes despite initial difficulties became familiar new study models vitro fertilisation embryo transfer second later years combining techniques electrophoretic analysis proteins publication rate rose cited scientists late aitken invited study problems associated fertility regulation world health organisation whos human reproduction unit consulting scientists mike conducted several reviews fertility control strategies help prevent disrupt returning informative sessions worked postdoctoral fellow university bordeaux continuing research activities university edinburgh september despite short period aitken opportunity consider problems concern human health particular infertility issue time prompted pursue research human reproductive aitken appointed first medical research council centre reproductive health university edinburgh team focused biochemistry early days newly founded centre found advanced technique examining proteins carbohydrates precisely preovulatory period study hormonal control despite early achievements team suspended research activities due material shortage gynaecology months waiting clinical supplies aitken took lead andrology roger short david mortimers despite fact discipline still infancy around transition research styles could gain direct access without relying clinical colleagues thus solving need clinical materials promoted senior scientist medical research however initially difficult since team obscure could influence years renovated laboratory facilities aitken started focus future study clinical research male contraceptives androgen physiology male infertility especially molecular mechanisms regulate sperm aitken remained university edinburgh discovered abnormally free radical attack failures later research relationship reactive oxygen species effects impaired sperm also proposed new techniques contraception helped prevent sexually transmitted diseases treat male contributions laid foundation reproductive studies done latter half twentieth century time university edinburgh aitken worked multiple antibodies analyse effects fertilisation human sperm gave administration spermatozoa normal fertile oligospermia discovered decline fertilisation rates higher dose reduced sperm attempt explain cellular basis defective sperm function association paper journal reproduction fertility found sudden burst production reactive oxygen species ros associated free radical attack male hyperactive production ros causes peroxidative damage sperm plasma membrane known oxidative stress resulting loss sperm discovery later acknowledged thousands scientists foundational concept studying oxygen species associated aitkens paper expanded molecular modifications oxidants male infertility resulted new therapeutic intervention methods maintain reproductive besides discovering oxidative stress aitken also improved male contraceptive vaccine later paper european journal pharmacology proposed possible targets including hcg zona pellucida sperm surface contraception research provided foundation designing longlasting reversible form contraceptives providing effective method help prevent sexually transmitted diseases control worlds growing university cambridge awarded aitken doctor science scd recognise achievements gamete time got phone call university newcastle inviting take chair biological sciences first declined mistook newcastle newcastle upon tyne agreed learning university later took part several important roles head school director arc centre excellence provicechancellor faculty health medicine university serving high positions university newcastle aitken continued research career reproductive studies colleagues conducted research effects oxidative stress physiological functional integrity human also researched related oxidative stress problems genetic alterations male infertility culminated gene mutations discussing possible health issues next generation couples using assisted reproductive colleagues continued research safe reliable contraception vaccinations controlling human fertility study included developing potential contraceptive potential chemical compositions contraceptive agents implying potential effectiveness antihcg early years australia aitken attempted diverge studies human reproductive released articles helped identify diseases various australian species including tammar wallaby brushtail addition discovered ehrlichia platys dogs australia previously found australian however years decided return andrology pursuit understanding cell biology according google scholar period aitkens papers receiving increasing number time aitken team carried studies identify different causes affecting male reproductive health found environmental conditions toxins mobile contribute various health issues simply affect male fertility causing oxidative stress also cause dna damage increasing risk mans children developing infertility along studies dna integrity effect radiofrequency fertility fertility preservation patients aitken working molecular markers oxidative stress developing sensitive methods measure reactive oxygen species generation cells discovery showed effectiveness numerous diagnostic techniques chemiluminescence spectrophotometry flow cytometry indicator oxidative stress emphasizing general significance mitochondrial dysregulation impaired sperm despite gaining much success animal study contribution developing immunocontraception animals ranging horses submammalian organisms annelid worms oysters fish enabled development nonsurgical sterilization technique received patent method reducing reproductive potential animal working eileen invention revolutionized australian horse breeding industry provided new method controlling horse population increase recent years aitken focusing translational research male contraception male infertility since working alongside memphasis develop felix device uses patented cell separation technology gently effectively separate sperm semen project seeks increase collection vital stable sperm crucial early stages ivf aitkens cultural interests go beyond deciding pursue career scientist music greatest played guitar time time
