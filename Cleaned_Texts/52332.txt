esophageal rupture rupture esophageal wall iatrogenic causes account approximately esophageal perforations usually due medical instrumentation endoscopy paraesophageal contrast term boerhaave syndrome reserved esophageal perforations occur due spontaneous perforation esophagus commonly results fullthickness tear esophageal wall due sudden increase intraesophageal pressure combined relatively negative intrathoracic pressure caused straining vomiting effort rupture esophagus boerhaaves syndrome causes spontaneous perforation include caustic ingestion pill esophagitis barretts esophagus infectious ulcers patients aids following dilation esophageal stricturescitation needed cases boerhaaves syndrome tear occurs left posterolateral aspect distal esophagus extends several centimeters condition associated high morbidity mortality fatal without treatment occasionally nonspecific nature symptoms may contribute delay diagnosis poor outcome spontaneous effort rupture cervical esophagus leading localized cervical perforation may common previously recognized generally benign course preexisting esophageal disease prerequisite esophageal perforation contributes increased mortalitycitation needed condition first documented physician herman boerhaave related condition malloryweiss syndrome mucosal tear case iatrogenic perforation common site cervical esophagus upper sphincter whereas spontaneous rupture seen boerhaaves syndrome perforation commonly occurs lower onethird classic history esophageal rupture one severe retching vomiting followed excruciating retrosternal chest upper abdominal pain odynophagia tachypnea dyspnea cyanosis fever shock develop rapidly physical examination usually helpful particularly early course subcutaneous emphysema

iatrogenic however iatrogenic perforations still constituting serious medical condition easier treat less prone complications particularly mediastinitis sepsis usually involve contamination mediastinum gastric contentscitation needed diagnosis boerhaaves syndrome suggested plain chest radiography confirmed chest ct scan initial plain chest radiograph almost always abnormal patients boerhaaves syndrome usually reveals mediastinal free peritoneal air initial radiologic manifestation cervical esophageal perforations plain films neck show air soft tissues prevertebral spacecitation needed hours days later pleural effusions without pneumothorax widened mediastinum subcutaneous emphysema typically seen ct scan may show esophageal wall edema thickening extraesophageal air periesophageal fluid without gas bubbles mediastinal widening air fluid pleural spaces retroperitoneum lesser saccitation needed diagnosis esophageal perforation could also confirmed watersoluble contrast esophagram gastrografin reveals location extent extravasation contrast material although barium superior demonstrating small perforations spillage barium sulfate mediastinal pleural cavities cause inflammatory response subsequent fibrosis therefore used primary diagnostic study however watersoluble study negative barium study performed better definitioncitation needed endoscopy role

physical findings chest xray water soluble contrast radiographic studies esophagus ct scan promptly obtained cases nonoperative management administered based radiological evidence contained mediastinal exception case reports describing survival without mortality untreated boerhaave syndrome surgical intervention mortality rate decreases treatment includes immediate antibiotic therapy prevent mediastinitis sepsis surgical repair significant fluid loss replaced iv fluid therapy since oral rehydration possible even early surgical intervention within hours risk death
