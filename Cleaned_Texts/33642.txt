cartilage resilient smooth type connective tissue semitransparent nonporous type tissue usually covered tough fibrous membrane called perichondrium tetrapods covers protects ends long bones joints articular structural component many body parts including rib cage neck bronchial tubes intervertebral discs taxa chondrichthyans also cyclostomes may constitute much greater proportion hard rigid bone much stiffer much less flexible muscle matrix cartilage made glycosaminoglycans proteoglycans collagen fibers sometimes elastin usually grows quicker bone rigidity cartilage often serves purpose holding tubes open body examples include rings trachea cricoid cartilage carina cartilage composed specialized cells called chondrocytes produce large amount collagenous extracellular matrix abundant ground substance rich proteoglycan elastin fibers cartilage classified three types elastic cartilage hyaline cartilage fibrocartilage differ relative amounts collagen proteoglycan cartilage contain blood vessels nerves hence insensitive fibrocartilage meniscus knee however blood supply part nutrition supplied chondrocytes diffusion compression articular cartilage flexion elastic cartilage generates fluid flow assists diffusion nutrients chondrocytes compared connective tissues cartilage slow turnover extracellular matrix documented repair slow rate relative tissues embryogenesis skeletal system derived mesoderm germ layer chondrification also known chondrogenesis process cartilage formed condensed mesenchyme tissue differentiates chondroblasts begins secreting molecules

following initial chondrification occurs embryogenesis cartilage growth consists mostly maturing immature cartilage mature state division cells within cartilage occurs slowly thus growth cartilage
