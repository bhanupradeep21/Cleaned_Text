behavioral ecology polyandry class mating system one female mates several males breeding season polyandry often compared polygyny system based cost benefits incurred members sex polygyny one male mates several females breeding season eg lions deer primates many systems alpha common example polyandrous mating found field cricket gryllus bimaculatus invertebrate order orthoptera containing crickets grasshoppers groundhoppers polyandrous behavior also prominent many insect species including red flour beetle species spider stegodyphus lineatus polyandry also occurs primates marmosets mammal groups marsupial genus antechinus bandicoots around bird speciescitation needed jacanas dunnocks insects honeybees fish pipefish theorized polyandry prevalent organisms incompatibility costly incompatibility former especially true viviparous cost lowquality father significant however organism less likely adaptive significance polyandry animals controversial polyandry direct benefits females allowing fertilization assurance provision resources parental care house mice mus musculus musculus shown indirect genetic benefits females increased offspring survival multiple mating showing practicing polyandry mating results increase offspring meta analysis including different orders insects polyandry increased production eggs females specifically lepidopterans indirect benefits mating females gained sperm competition attain good genes cryptic female choice increased genetic quality genetic females spiders pisaura mirabilis store sperm giftgiving males suggesting sperm storage female control cryptic sperm increase sperm storage gift giving males might allow females produce sexy sons also give gifts increase fitness offspring sperm storage fertilization success increased copulation duration suggesting advantage sperm many reptile species also demonstrate polyandry especially among members tortoise family testudinidae polyandry longterm sperm storage recent studies found evidence ability female tortoises produce clutches eggs demonstrate multiple predictably hatchlings showed increase genetic variability compared sired single potential multiple paternity within clutch primarily result sperm storage across reproductive cycles since studies confirmed presence multiple males sperm female tortoise reproductive tract result clutches greater variation paternal genes increased sperm competition females maximize genetic quality number multiple paternities within single clutch therefore considered effective strategy increase reproductive success fitness female acorn woodpeckers provide substantial information breeding systems practice monogamy polyandry polygyny polyandry presence male breeders acorn woodpeckers shown females reproduce optimal clutch size paternity sharing males behaviorally stable increasing male female opposed polygyny observed polygynous females lay large number eggs exceeding optimal clutch size reduces fitness polygynous trios compared polyandrous trios showed eggs lowered group fitness chao studies using acorn woodpeckers suggest mating systems practiced lower rate compared polyandry polyandry maximize fitness males females obtaining optimal clutch size polyandrous mating optimal clutch size obtained one female becomes stable members remain multiple mating also seen wattled jacanas females group males close mating copulations easily seen jacanas facilitating observation females copulating continuously various continuous copulations close proximity mates allowed females fly within minutes leading expected sperm allowing viable sperm fertilize clutch increase genetic diversity benefits disease snow andrade concluded redback spider latrodectus hasselti increases ability manipulate paternity offspring using spermathecae store multiple sperms additionally study leafcutting ants acromyrmex echinatior supported hypothesis sperm mixing indeed occurs polyandrous social insects found eggs queen ants showed completely mixed used randomly egg according gordon g gallup form adapting multiple mating females human penile shape indicative evolutionary history polyandry male humans evolved wedge spoonshaped glans perform repeated thrusting motions copulation order draw foreign semen back away cervix thus compete sperm polyandry may also impose costs females exposing diseases increased predation risk time energy costs even physical harm due sexual polyandrous females encounter sexual harassment courted males resulting costly females order reduce costs females females take part polyandry example bee species anthidium maculosum like many species high cost resisting mating may exceed cost accepting numerous males breeding copulating takes short time therefore females species inclined polyandrous system sexual coercion observed one major reasons females begin mate multiple males outweigh cost different sexual conflict hypothesis suggest polyandry occur due sexual preventing females obtaining benefits sexual coercion seen three different forms forced copulation sexual harassment intimidation forced copulation seen males gain access females mating result lack access mates males likely engage sexually aggressive behaviors could result physical harm death females observed elephant seals ducks intimidation seen social primates coerce females mating therefore pushing mate aggressor males use intimidation method punishment females mate sexual coercion many benefits males allowing mate strategies pose high cost observed vertebrates like green green turtles example species receive possible benefit polyandry uses reduce cost house mice multiple male mating observed even females opportunity select mate without sexual coercion showing due female fly dryomyza anilis females favor matings quick anilis females store sperm least two egg batches without fertilization rate decreasing therefore mating oviposition necessary significant overall benefit females multiple matings large females advantage due ability resist unnecessary result multiple male mating multiple paternities observed species result convenience convenience polyandry hypothesis assumption greater cost females refusing male mating attempts choice situation females adjust mating rate balance costs male harassment suggested convenience polyandry would increase females weaker males decreasing costs sexual aggression convenience polyandry seen several arthropod species like water striders gerris males compete mating opportunities ones shown less cooperation breeding however males order gain access females mating opportunities practice parental care parental care mostly seen polyandrous mating systems must go cost sharing paternity parental care observed avians like acorn woodpeckers melanerpes fishes cichlid fish julidochromis observations show male relatedness suggest importance male social relationships taking care offspring social relationships males seen primates geoffroys tamarins saguinus high proportions related males half sibling higher frog species rhacaphorid frog kurixalus eiffingeri one polyandrous exhibits parental care eggs male frogs sit egg clutches maintaining contact parental care males genetic contribution found significantly correlated meaning male frogs higher paternity attended eggs far significantly partial paternity females mate one male obtain aid result three parents providing food care offspring increase survival young amount help determined based mating share paternity share mating systems p polyandrous mating suggested male cooperation may outweigh costs sharing paternity situations scarcity foods high competition levels land females female size large breeding territory defended males may force male cooperation males factors promote increase reproductive success leaving behind cost paternity share mating systems combcrested jacanas irediparra gallinacea shown genetic evidence paternity combcrested jacana females one three mates available copulation order guarantee paternity male mates females would spend time territory male laying taxa high social organization eusocial meaning single female eg queen bee caste produces offspring organisms eg nonreproductive female worker bees cooperate caring young examples mammalian eusociality include damaraland molerats naked among polyandry norm polygyny never infanticide avoidance one major reasons animals like mammals inclined choose infanticide observed major cause mortality various mammals polyandry thought evolve offsprings vulnerability evidence polyandry effective strategy adapted many increase offspring survival avoidance male infanticide bank voles myodes glareolus supported infanticide avoidance hypothesis polyandrous females offspring higher survival monandrous females high levels multiple paternity widely seen reported snakes marine however lee hayes evidence suggests set data green turtles significantly shows potential fitness gains polyandry instead suggested multiple mating result male aggression lee hayes studies exhibit similar results show lack support indirect benefits polyandry addition pose relationship multiple paternity reproductive success multiple male paternity present green turtles significant fitness benefits found observations done clutches showed correlation reproductive success mating multiple current research suggests polyandry dominant social structure new world monkey family callitrichidae callitrichidae includes marmosets tamarins two groups small new world monkeys found south america wild groups usually consist three ten individuals one reproductively active female one reproductive males several nonreproductive helpers either male female cooperative polyandry mating system found primates polyandrous monogamous polygynous groups found within population group even change mating systems making flexible mating system nonhuman unlike primates typically give birth single young twins average litter size tamarins marmosets entire group participates raising offspring sharing responsibilities infant carrying feeding grooming presence nonreproductive helpers appears important factor determining mating system used ecological environmental variability found significant impact goldizen proposed hypothesis monogamy callitrichidae develop groups nonreproductive helpers help raise young absence helpers polyandrous males females would higher reproductive success lone monogamous pairs indeed studies saguinus fuscicollis common name saddleback tamarin monogamous lone pairs
