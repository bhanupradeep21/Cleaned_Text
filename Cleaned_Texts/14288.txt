continent later spread europe would invaded africa south america usual interpretation rebbachisaurids south american origin thus maraapunisaurus rebbachisaurid migration rebbachisaurids time would reverse original reevaluation carpenter examined paleobiology giant sauropods including maraapunisaurus addressed question group attained large size pointed gigantic sizes reached early sauropod evolution largesized species present early late triassic period concluded whatever evolutionary pressure caused large size present early origins group carpenter cited several studies giant mammalian herbivores elephants rhinoceros showed larger size planteating animals leads greater efficiency digesting food since larger animals longer digestive systems food kept digestion significantly longer periods time allowing large animals survive lowerquality food sources especially true animals large number fermentation chambers along intestine allow microbes accumulate ferment plant material aiding throughout evolutionary history sauropod dinosaurs found primarily semiarid seasonally dry environments corresponding seasonal drop quality food dry season environment maraapunisaurus essentially savanna similar arid environments modern giant herbivores found supporting idea poorquality food arid environment promotes evolution giant herbivores carpenter argued benefits large size relative immunity predators lower energy expenditure longer life span probably secondary morrison formation environment maraapunisaurus lived would resembled modern savanna though since grasses appear late cretaceous ferns probably dominant plant main food source maraapunisaurus though engelmann et al dismissed ferns sauropod food source due relatively low caloric carpenter argued sauropod digestive system well adapted handle lowquality food allows consumption ferns large part sauropod diet carpenter also noted occasional presence large petrified logs indicate presence ft tall trees would seem conflict savanna comparison however trees rare since tall trees require water savanna environment could generally provide probably existed narrow tracts gallery forests along rivers gulleys water could accumulate carpenter speculated giant herbivores like maraapunisaurus may used shade gallery forests stay cool day done feeding open savanna httpsenwikipediaorgwikimaraapunisaurus
