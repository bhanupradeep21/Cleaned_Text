william bradford shockley jr february august american inventor physicist eugenicist manager research group bell labs included john bardeen walter brattain three scientists jointly awarded nobel prize physics researches semiconductors discovery transistor partly result shockleys attempts commercialize new transistor design californias silicon valley became hotbed electronics innovation recruited brilliant employees quickly alienated autocratic erratic management left founded major companies later life professor electrical engineering stanford university afterward shockley became widely known

eight languages mother may n√©e bradford grew american west graduated stanford university became first female us deputy mining shockley homeschooled age eight due parents dislike public schools well shockleys habit violent shockley learned physics young age neighbor stanford physics shockley spent two years palo alto military academy briefly enrolled los angeles coaching school study physics later graduated hollywood high school shockley earned bachelor science degree caltech phd mit title doctoral thesis electronic bands sodium chloride topic suggested thesis advisor john c shockley one first recruits bell labs mervin kelly became director research company focused hiring solidstate shockley joined group headed clinton davisson murray hill new executives bell labs theorized semiconductors may offer solidstate alternatives vacuum tubes used throughout bells nationwide telephone system shockley conceived number designs based copperoxide semiconductor materials walter brattain unsuccessfully attempted create prototype shockley published number fundamental papers solid state physics physical review received first patent electron discharge device electron world war ii broke shockleys prior research interrupted became involved radar research manhattan new york city may took leave bell labs become research director columbia universitys antisubmarine warfare operations involved devising methods countering tactics submarines improved convoying techniques optimizing depth charge patterns shockley traveled frequently pentagon washington meet highranking officers government organized training program bomber pilots use new radar bomb sights late took threemonth tour bases around world assess results project secretary war robert patterson awarded shockley medal merit october july war department asked shockley prepare report question probable casualties invasion japanese mainland shockley concluded study shows behavior nations historical cases comparable japans fact invariably consistent behavior troops battle means japanese dead ineffectives time defeat exceed corresponding number germans words shall probably kill least million japanese might cost us million casualties including report influenced decision united states drop atomic bombs hiroshima nagasaki preceded surrender shockley first physicist propose lognormal distribution model creation process scientific research shortly war ended bell labs formed solidstate physics group led shockley chemist stanley morgan included john bardeen walter brattain physicist gerald pearson chemist robert gibney electronics expert hilbert moore several technicians assignment seek solidstate alternative fragile glass vacuum tube amplifiers first attempts based shockleys ideas using external electrical field semiconductor affect conductivity experiments failed every time sorts configurations materials group standstill bardeen suggested theory invoked surface states prevented field penetrating semiconductor group changed focus study surface states met almost daily discuss work group excellent rapport freely exchanged winter enough results bardeen submitted paper surface states physical review brattain started experiments study surface states observations made shining bright light semiconductors surface led several papers one coauthored shockley estimated density surface states enough account failed experiments pace work picked significantly started surround point contacts semiconductor conducting wires electrolytes moore built circuit allowed vary frequency input signal easily finally began get evidence power amplification pearson acting suggestion shockley put voltage droplet glycol borate placed across bell labs attorneys soon discovered shockleys field effect principle anticipated devices based patented julius lilienfeld filed mesfetlike patent canada october although patent appeared breakable could work patent attorneys based one four patent applications bardeenbrattain point contact design three others submitted first covered electrolytebased transistors bardeen gibney brattain inventorscitation needed shockleys name patent applications angered shockley thought name also patents work based field effect idea even made efforts patent written name told bardeen brattain shockley angered included patent applications secretly continued work build different sort transistor based junctions instead point contacts expected kind design would likely commercially viable point contact transistor believed would prove fragile difficult manufacture shockley also dissatisfied certain parts explanation point contact transistor worked conceived possibility minority carrier injection february another team member john n shive built point contact transistor bronze contacts front back thin wedge germanium proving holes could diffuse bulk germanium along surface previously shives invention shockleys invention junction months later invented entirely new considerably robust type transistor layer sandwich structure structure went used vast majority transistors evolved bipolar junction transistor shockley later described workings team mixture cooperation competition also said kept work secret hand forced shives shockley worked rather complete description called sandwich transistor first proof principle obtained april meanwhile shockley worked magnum opus electrons holes semiconductors published treatise tome included shockleys critical ideas drift diffusion differential equations govern flow electrons solid state crystals shockleys diode equation also described seminal work became reference text scientists working develop improve new variants transistor devices based resulted invention bipolar junction transistor announced press conference july elected national academy sciences nas fortyone years old rather young election two years later chosen recipient prestigious comstock physics nas recipient many awards honors ensuing publicity generated invention transistor often thrust shockley fore much chagrin bardeen brattain bell labs management however consistently presented three inventors team though shockley would correct record reporters gave sole credit eventually infuriated alienated bardeen brattain essentially blocked two working junction transistor bardeen began pursuing theory superconductivity left bell labs brattain refused work shockley assigned another group neither bardeen brattain much development transistor beyond first year shockley left bell labs around took job shockley bardeen brattain received nobel prize physics shockley started shockley semiconductor laboratory mountain view california close elderly mother palo alto company division beckman instruments
