maternal fetal stress transfer physiological phenomenon psychosocial stress experienced mother pregnancy transferred fetus psychosocial stress describes brains physiological response perceived social threat link blood supply mother fetus found stress leave lasting effects developing fetus even child born according recent studies effects mainly result two particular stress biomarkers circulating maternal blood supply cortisol catecholamines cortisol type hormone called glucocorticoid glucose usage body tends activated fightorflight response cortisol produced adrenal gland whose activity mediated hypothalamus pituitary glands brain together collective signaling hypothalamus pituitary gland adrenal gland known hypothalamopituitaryadrenal hpa axis period psychosocial stress cortisol released leading physiological manifestations stress increased maternal blood pressure mbp maternal heart rate case pregnant woman release cortisol adrenal glands also effect fetus carried womb cortisol steroid hormone like steroid hormones receptors cortisol located intracellularly words cortisol need extracellular receptor order enter nucleus cells affect gene expression feature steroid hormones cortisol diffuses directly across placenta barrier separates fetus mother luckily fetus protective mechanism inundation cortisol stressed mother enzyme placenta called dehydrogenase type capable inactivating vast majority cortisol passing placental barrier cases high levels maternal cortisol placental enzyme expression activity greatly reduced thus buffering fetus less mother high cortisol levels detrimental effects loss placental enzymatic activity one effect change set point hpa myriad studies animal models indicate fetal cortisol levels high hpa axis active high levels fetal cortisol induce higher crh expression paraventricular nucleus hypothalamus pvn central nucleus words excessive cortisol crossing placental barrier causes hypothalamus amygdala increase transcription crh turn stimulates hpa axis activity early postnatal life overactive hpa axis glucocorticoid receptor expression brain making release minimal levels cortisol elicit substantial response developing synapses speculated hpa axis rapidly develop neural circuitry result pregnancy foetus brain extremely malleable prime developmental phase parts brain susceptible extraneous influences responsible stress response hypothalamus pituitary gland due fact stress response humans forms early foetal stage therefore vulnerable mother mental physical emotional state gestational mother experiences unusually high levels stress body would respond increasing cortisol levels abnormal standing hormones would passed mother bloodstream foetus reason phenomenon occurs mother experiencing excessive amount stress occur usual everyday stress many individuals experience due one protective mechanism takes place mechanism understood first comparing cortisol concentrations mother foetus cortisol concentrations mother five ten times higher concentration foetus ratio maternal foetus cortisol concentration maintained enzyme placenta alters cortisol molecule inactive metabolite products called placental Î²hydroxysteroiddehydrogenase problem lies multiplying factor arising ratio ie maternal cortisol levels rise could cause foetal cortisol levels double occurs mother experiences psychological additionally persistent antenatal stress experienced toward end gestation period shown inflict severe permanent damage foetus physiological development potentially leading early growth retardation aka intrauterine growth restriction preterm labour delayed motor development studying foetal stress response vivo commonly done due various ethical considerations studies managed conduct research phenomenon human pregnancy reached similar conclusions maternalfoetal stress transfer occurs mechanism cortisol moving mother baby means mothers stress levels become child stress levels passes oversensitive stress response nongenetic means biological phenomena problematic due impact increased level cortisol foetal hpa axis major source cortisol increase stimuli provoke consistently high levels psychosocial stress another source high cortisol concentrations often overlooked ingestion alcohol already wellknown women drink alcohol pregnancy likely give birth children physical neurological defects occurs large amounts alcohol intake smaller still significant portions alcohol intake trigger rise cortisol levels mother bloodstream hence causing cortisol levels rise foetus well resulting consequences maternalfoetal stress obesity later life linked changes hpaaxis activity fetus mothers experience increased stress may begin participare risky health behaviors poor dietary habits increases chance obesity mother fetus fetus increased chance obesity high stress used predict potential environment fetus lives two specific types glucocorticoids dexamethasone betamethasone transferred fetus crh well also influences fetus health diseasethis exposure addition higher energy diet increase likelihood obesity later life due glucocorticoids regulating stress fetus also appetite obesity metabolism animals mother antenatal stress correlated detrimental neurobehavioural outcomes myriad consequences child birth psychiatric disorders behavioural abnormalities dysfunctional emotional regulation delays motor exposure important neurodevelopment periods increase risk metabolic disorders including obesity type diabetes poor lipid profile risk present later stage pregnancy seen early six months likelihood increases children experience high levels commonly occurring psychiatric disorders develop attentiondeficit hyperactivity minor depressive neurotic symptoms schizophrenia tendency toward alcoholismdrugaddiction criminal psychiatric disorders turn either lead exacerbate behavioural irregularities hyperactivity unusually low threshold irritation frustration antisocial inconsiderate behaviour well profuse clinging crying especially younger age furthermore feminisation male behaviour increase timidity also observed children born stressful antenatal biologically speaking phenomenon also cause hippocampus important component stress response defective function reason hippocampus one parts brain seen vulnerable maternal stress hormones may believe physiological consequence maternalfoetal stress transfer said cause psychiatric disorders behavioural abnormalities outlined alongside moreover overexposure cortisol infancy lead extreme response desensitisation cortisol child desensitisation blocking cortisol receptors occur irregularities hpa axis form utero due passing cortisol placenta mother conversion extremely high low cortisol levels said defence mechanism sorts one unconsciously experiences withdrawal avoidance denial effort disengage challenging discomforting stimuli sometimes manifesting alexithymia people often left feeling empty isolated due state emotional numbness continuity maternal stress pregnancy progression maternalfoetal stress transfer significant impacting infant overall wellbeing postnatal maternal stress postpartum depression enormous impact emotion mental behavioural growth child hence aggravate intensify impacts maternalfoetal stress transfer roughly women experience least one depressive episode directly pregnancy thus encouraging increased interest identifying effects antenatal maternal stress development individual foetal infancy stages stated epigenetics one conclusions nature vs
