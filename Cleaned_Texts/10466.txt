ethics demonstrated geometrical order latin ethica ordine geometrico demonstrata usually known ethics philosophical treatise written latin baruch spinoza benedictus de spinoza written first published posthumously book perhaps ambitious attempt apply method euclid philosophy spinoza puts forward small number definitions axioms attempts derive hundreds propositions corollaries mind imagines lack power saddened free man thinks nothing less human mind absolutely destroyed body something remains first part book addresses relationship god universe spinoza engaging tradition held god exists outside universe god created universe reason god could created different universe according spinoza denies point according spinoza god natural world spinoza concludes following god substance comprising universe god existing somehow outside universe universe exists necessity divine theological reason spinoza argues propositions holds perspective conclusion presents merely necessary logical result combining provided definitions axioms starts proposition exist universe two substances nature follows arguing objects events must merely caused occur prevented logical contradiction something noncontradictory reason exist spinoza builds starting ideas substance exists must infinite another finite substance would exist take remaining parts finite attributes something impossible according earlier proposition spinoza uses ontological argument justification existence god argues god read nature rather traditional deity must possess attributes infinitely since two things share attributes besides god substance granted many spinozas claims means matter dispute spinoza claims things make universe including human beings gods modes means everything sense dependent upon god nature dependence disputed scholars say modes properties god traditional sense others say modes effects god either way modes also logically dependent gods essence sense everything happens follows nature god like follows nature triangle angles equal two right angles since god exist nature nothing happened could avoided god fixed particular fate particular mode escaping spinoza puts thing determined god produce effect render undetermined second part focuses human mind body spinoza attacks several cartesian positions mind body distinct substances affect one another know minds better know bodies senses may trusted despite created god make mistakes namely affirm free idea clear distinct spinoza denies descartess points regarding spinoza argues mind body single thing thought two different ways whole nature fully described terms thoughts terms bodies however mix two ways describing things descartes say mind affects body vice versa moreover minds selfknowledge fundamental know thoughts better knows ways body acted upon bodies difference contemplating idea thinking true freedom sensory perception spinoza calls knowledge first kind entirely inaccurate since reflects bodies work things really also kind accurate knowledge called knowledge second kind reason encompasses knowledge features common things includes principles physics geometry also knowledge third kind intuitive knowledge sort knowledge somehow relates particular things nature god third part ethics spinoza argues things including human beings strive persevere perfection power spinoza states virtue equal power ie spinoza explains desire conatus underlies movement complexity emotions passions ie joy sadness building blocks mind certain cases active certain cases passive far adequate ideas necessarily active far inadequate ideas necessarily passive refers pleasure refers pain f refer respectively feeling imagining proposition would translate imagines loved object destroyed feels pain loved object preserved feel pleasure symbolically reduces two equations f f fourth part analyzes human passions spinoza sees aspects mind direct us outwards seek gives pleasure shun gives pain bondage refers domination passions affects calls spinoza considers affects ungoverned torment people make impossible mankind live harmony one another fifth part argues reason govern affects pursuit virtue spinoza selfpreservation aid reason humans distinguish passions truly aid virtue ultimately harmful reason see things truly sub specie aeternitatis aspect eternity spinoza treats god nature indistinguishable knowing things improve knowledge god seeing things determined nature achieve rational tranquility best promotes happiness liberate driven passions according spinoza god nature nature god deus sive natura pantheism previous book theologicopolitical treatise spinoza discussed inconsistencies result god assumed human characteristics third chapter book stated word god means word nature wrote whether say things happen according laws nature ordered decree direction god say thing later qualified statement letter abjuring nature spinoza metaphysical substance physical posthumously published book ethics equated god nature writing god nature four spinoza god one whole infinite eternal necessarily existing active system universe within absolutely everything exists fundamental principle spinoza holds everything exists part nature everything nature follows basic laws perspective human beings part nature hence explained understood way everything else nature aspect spinozas philosophy naturalism radical time perhaps even today preface part iii ethics relating emotions writes writers emotions human conduct seem treating rather matters outside nature natural phenomena following natures general laws appear conceive man situated nature kingdom within kingdom believe disturbs rather follows natures order absolute control actions determined solely however argument nothing comes pass nature set flaw therein nature always everywhere one efficacy power action natures laws ordinances whereby things come pass change one form another everywhere always one method understanding nature things whatsoever namely natures universal laws rules therefore spinoza affirms passions hatred anger envy considered follow necessity efficacy nature answer certain definite causes understood possess certain properties worthy known properties anything else humans different kind rest natural world part spinozas naturalism seen deriving firm commitment principle sufficient reason psr thesis everything explanation articulates psr strong fashion applies everything also everything everything whatsoever cause reason must assigned either existence nonexistence eg triangle exists reason cause must granted existence contrary exist cause must also granted prevents existing annuls existence continue spinozas triangle example one claim makes god gods supreme power infinite nature infinite number things things necessarily flowed forth infinite number ways always flow necessity way nature triangle follows eternity eternity three interior angles equal two right angles spinoza rejected idea external creator suddenly apparently capriciously creating world one particular time rather another creating nothing solution appeared perplexing problem rather unscientific spirit involving break continuity preferred think entire system reality ground view simpler avoided impossible conception creation nothing religiously satisfying bringing god man closer relationship instead nature one hand supernatural god posited one world reality nature god leaving room supernatural socalled naturalism spinoza distorted one starts crude materialistic idea nature supposes spinoza degraded god truth raised nature rank god conceiving nature fulness reality one rejected specious simplicity obtainable denying reality matter mind god cosmic system comprehends fact god nature become identical conceived perfect selfexistent constitutes spinozas according spinoza god attributes one attribute extension another attribute thought infinitely many attributes since spinoza holds exist act readers
