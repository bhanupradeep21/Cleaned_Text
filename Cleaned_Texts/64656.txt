featherplucking sometimes termed featherpicking feather damaging behaviour maladaptive behavioural disorder commonly seen captive birds chew bite pluck feathers beak resulting damage feathers occasionally especially common among parrots order psittaciformes estimated captive parrots exhibiting areas body mainly pecked plucked accessible regions neck chest flank inner thigh ventral wing

guinea pigs rabbits sheep muskox dogs leading suggestions comparative psychology approach alleviating featherplucking generally regarded multifactorial disorder although three main aspects bird

behavioural needs solitary housing fails meet high social needs bird featherplucking often attributed variety social causes may include poor socialisation absence parents rearing period individual

conspecifics whereas wild would form stable sometimes large flocks birds may deal well solitary lifestyle deprivation social sexual partner may lead separation anxiety loneliness boredom sexual frustration attentionseeking behaviour factors may contribute although empirical studies performed test ideas increasing environmental complexity reduce however studies managed stabilise existing plumage increasing foraging opportunities markedly reduce featherplucking many similarities redirected foraging behaviour hypothesis proposed feather pecking commercial poultry birds captivity usually
