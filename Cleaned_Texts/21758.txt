oardasaurus meaning oarda de jos lizard extinct genus lizard latest cretaceous romania member barbatteiidae group lizards closely related teiidae centimetres length much smaller named member barbatteiidae barbatteius lived slightly later like barbatteius oardasaurus identified presence crust bone deposits osteoderms roof skull differs barbatteius pattern sculpturing crust oardasaurus barbatteius lived isolated island ecosystem hațeg island rapidly diversified various generalist predators small prey arrival island early cretaceous went extinct extinction event oardasaurus small lizard measuring roughly cm smaller close relative barbatteius measures cm like teiioids meyasaurus teeth oardasaurus heterodont ie several types consistently bicuspid ie bearing two cusps rear cusp larger teeth probably underwent replacement unlike modern teiidae crushing teeth back jaw among lizards oardasaurus barbatteiusare unique temporal muscles originate attachments upper portions parietal bones upper temporal fenestrae obscured either postorbital bones postfrontal characteristic family barbatteiidae oardasaurus barbatteius belong presence extensive crust osteoderms separated deep grooves bones skull roof including parietals postorbitals frontals latter slightly different arrangement osteoderms preserve imprints collectively known pileus scales laid modern teiidae arrangement pileus present directly skull roof due absent limited osteoderm varies species fairly constant modern oardasaurus occipital rear scale pileus subdivided three smaller osteoderms oardasaurus unlike lacertid plesiolacerta variable division barbetteiidae may transitional teiids oardasaurus frontal bones completely fused suture frontal parietal straight jagged margin also fused barbatteius adult
