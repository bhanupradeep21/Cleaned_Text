bodily structure namely variation selection similarly behavior individual varies moment moment variation followed reinforcement strengthened becomes prominent individuals behavioral repertoire shaping skinners term gradual modification behavior reinforcement desired variations skinner believed superstitious behavior arise response happens followed reinforcement actually unrelatedclarification needed second question operant behavior controlled arises begin behavior emitted without reference particular stimulus skinner answered question saying stimulus comes control operant present response reinforced absent example leverpressing brings food light rat child learn press lever light skinner summarized relationship saying discriminative stimulus eg light sound sets occasion reinforcement food operant leverpress threeterm contingency stimulusresponsereinforcer one skinners important concepts sets theory apart theories use pairwise behavior humans easily described terms individual responses reinforced one one skinner devoted great deal effort problem behavioral complexity complex behavior seen sequence relatively simple responses skinner invoked idea chaining chaining based fact experimentally demonstrated discriminative stimulus sets occasion subsequent behavior also reinforce behavior precedes discriminative stimulus also conditioned reinforcer example light sets occasion lever pressing may also used reinforce turning around presence noise results sequence noise turnaround light press lever food much longer chains built adding stimuli responses however skinner recognized great deal behavior especially human behavior accounted gradual shaping construction response complex behavior often appears suddenly final form person first finds way elevator following instructions given front desk account behavior skinner introduced concept rulegoverned behavior first relatively simple behaviors come control verbal stimuli child learns jump open book large number responses come verbal control sequence verbal stimuli evoke almost unlimited variety complex reinforcement key concept behaviorism primary process shapes controls behavior occurs two ways positive negative behavior organisms skinner defines negative reinforcement synonymous punishment ie presentation aversive stimulus definition would subsequently redefined science human behavior become standard set definitions positive reinforcement strengthening behavior occurrence event eg praise behavior performed whereas negative reinforcement strengthening behavior removal avoidance aversive event eg opening raising umbrella head rainy day reinforced cessation rain falling types reinforcement strengthen behavior increase probability behavior reoccurring difference whether reinforcing event something applied positive reinforcement something removed avoided negative reinforcement punishment application aversive stimulusevent positive punishment punishment contingent stimulation removal desirable stimulus negative punishment punishment contingent withdrawal though punishment often used suppress behavior skinner argued suppression temporary number often unwanted extinction absence rewarding stimulus weakens behavior writing skinner pointed darwinian natural selection like reinforced behavior selection consequences though said natural selection made case regretted
