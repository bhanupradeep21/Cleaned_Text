hangover experience various unpleasant physiological psychological effects usually following consumption alcohol wine beer liquor hangovers last several hours hours typical symptoms hangover may include headache drowsiness concentration problems dry mouth dizziness fatigue gastrointestinal distress eg nausea vomiting diarrhea absence hunger light sensitivity depression sweating hyperexcitability irritability causes hangover still poorly several factors known involved including acetaldehyde accumulation changes immune system glucose metabolism dehydration metabolic acidosis disturbed prostaglandin synthesis increased cardiac output vasodilation sleep deprivation malnutrition beveragespecific effects additives byproducts congeners alcoholic beverages also play important symptoms usually occur intoxicating effect alcohol begins wear generally morning night heavy though many possible remedies folk cures suggested compelling evidence suggest effective preventing treating avoiding alcohol drinking moderation effective ways avoid socioeconomic consequences hangovers include workplace absenteeism impaired job performance reduced productivity poor academic achievement hangover may also impair performance potentially dangerous daily activities driving car operating heavy alcohol hangover associated variety symptoms may include drowsiness headache concentration problems dry mouth dizziness gastrointestinal complaints fatigue sweating nausea hyperexcitability anxiety feeling general discomfort may last alcohol hangover symptoms develop blood alcohol concentration falls considerably peak returns almost hangover symptoms validated controlled studies include general malaise thirst headache feeling dizzy faint tiredness loss appetite nausea stomach ache feeling though ones heart racing symptoms changes sleep pattern gastrointestinal distress attributed direct effects alcohol intoxication withdrawal drowsiness impaired cognitive function two dominant features alcohol processes lead hangovers still poorly several pathophysiological changes may give rise alcohol hangover including increased levels acetaldehyde hormonal alterations cytokine pathways decrease availability glucose additional associated phenomena dehydration metabolic acidosis disturbed prostaglandin synthesis increased cardiac output vasodilation sleep deprivation insufficient complex organic molecules found alcoholic beverages known congeners may play important role producing hangover effects methanol metabolized notably toxic substances formaldehyde formic ingested ethanol alcoholic beverages first converted acetaldehyde enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase acetic acid oxidation egestion process reactions also convert nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nad reduced form nadh redox reaction causing imbalance nadnadh redox system alcoholic beverages make normal bodily functions difficult consequences alcohol induced redox changes human body include increased triglyceride production increased amino acid catabolism inhibition citric acid cycle lactic acidosis ketoacidosis hyperuricemia disturbance cortisol androgen metabolism increased fibrogenesis metabolism glucose insulin also however recent studies showed significant correlation hangover severity concentrations various hormones electrolytes free fatty acids triglycerides lactate ketone bodies cortisol glucose blood urine alcohol also induces enzyme metabolizes ethanol substances reactive toxins particular binge drinking enzyme activated plays role creating harmful condition known oxidative stress lead cell acetaldehyde first byproduct ethanol times toxic alcohol remain elevated plateau many hours initial ethanol addition certain genetic factors amplify negative effects acetaldehyde example people predominantly east asians mutation alcohol dehydrogenase gene makes enzyme unusually fast converting ethanol acetaldehyde addition half east asians convert acetaldehyde acetic acid slowly via acetaldehyde dehydrogenase causing higher buildup acetaldehyde normally seen high concentration acetaldehyde causes alcohol flush reaction colloquially known asian flush since alcohol flush reaction highly uncomfortable possibility hangovers immediate severe people gene variant less likely become acetaldehyde may also influence glutathione peroxidase key antioxidant enzyme increases susceptibility oxidative likewise acetic acid acetate ion cause additional problems one study found injecting sodium acetate rats caused nociceptive behavior headaches addition biochemical explanation finding high acetate levels cause adenosine accumulate many parts brain rats given caffeine blocks action adenosine longer experienced addition ethanol water alcoholic drinks also contain congeners either flavoring byproduct fermentation wine aging process ethanol sufficient produce hangover effects congeners may potentially aggravate hangover residual effects extent congeners include substances amines amides acetones acetaldehydes polyphenols methanol histamines fusel oil esters furfural tannins many one study mice indicates fusel oil may mitigating effect hangover whiskey congeners butanol protect stomach gastric mucosal damage different types alcoholic beverages contain different amounts congeners general dark liquors higher concentration clear liquors lower concentration whereas vodka virtually congeners pure ethanol bourbon total congener content times higher found several studies examined whether certain types alcohol cause worse four studies concluded darker liquors higher congeners produced worse hangovers one even showed hangovers worse frequent darker study average standard drinks ml beer needed produce hangover drinks required wine liquor note one standard drink amount alcohol regardless another study ranked several drinks ability cause hangover follows low high distilled ethanol diluted fruit juice beer vodka gin white wine whisky rum red wine one potent congener methanol naturally formed small quantities fermentation accidentally concentrated improper distillation techniques metabolism methanol produces extremely toxic compounds formaldehyde formic acid may play role severity hangover ethanol slows conversion methanol toxic metabolites methanol excreted harmlessly breath urine without forming toxic metabolites may explain temporary postponement symptoms reported common remedy drinking alcohol relieve hangover since methanol metabolism effectively inhibited consumption alcohol methanol accumulates drinking begins metabolized ethanol cleared delayed action makes attractive candidate explanation delayed postintoxication symptoms correlations methanol concentrations presence hangover symptoms found metabolic processes required alcohol elimination deplete essential furthermore alcohol diuretic causing excretion electrolytes urination night drinking resulting lack key b c vitamins well potassium magnesium zinc may cause fatigue aching hangoverlike symptomscitation needed ethanol dehydrating effect causing increased urine production diuresis could cause thirst dry mouth dizziness may lead electrolyte imbalance studies suggest electrolyte changes play minor role genesis alcohol hangover caused dehydration effects drinking water may help relieve symptoms result dehydration unlikely rehydration significantly reduces presence severity alcohol alcohols effect stomach lining account nausea alcohol stimulates production hydrochloric acid stomach studies show alcohol hangover associated decrease blood glucose concentration less mldl relationship blood glucose concentration hangover severity also known insulin shock hypoglycemia lead coma even current research significant relationship immune factors hangover severity convincing among factors far imbalance immune system particular cytokine metabolism identified playing role pathophysiology hangover state especially hangover symptoms nausea headache fatigue suggested mediated changes immune system concentration several cytokines found significantly increased blood alcohol consumption include interleukin interferon gamma ifnÎ³ interleukin pharmacological studies tolfenamic opuntia ficusindica also indicated involvement immune system studies suggest presence severity hangover symptoms probably reduced administration cyclooxygenase inhibitor aspirin several factors cause alcohol hangover known influence severity factors include personality genetics health status age sex associated activities drinking smoking use drugs physical activity dancing well sleep quality hangovers poorly understood medical point health care professionals prefer study alcohol abuse standpoint treatment prevention view hangover provides useful natural intrinsic disincentive excessive within limited amount serious study subject debate whether hangover may prevented least mitigated also vast body folk medicine simple quackery fourpage literature
