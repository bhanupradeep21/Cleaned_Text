bronchiolitis inflammation small airways lungs acute bronchiolitis due viral infection usually affecting children younger two years symptoms may include fever cough runny nose wheezing breathing severe cases may associated nasal flaring grunting skin ribs pulling child able feed properly signs dehydration may chronic bronchiolitis general term used small airways disease adults notably chronic obstructive pulmonary acute bronchiolitis usually result infection respiratory syncytial virus cases human rhinovirus diagnosis generally based tests chest xray viral testing routinely specific

infancy commonly caused respiratory syncytial rsv also known human pneumovirus agents cause illness include human metapneumovirus influenza parainfluenza coronavirus adenovirus rhinovirus children increased risk progression severe respiratory disease following additional diagnosis typically made clinical examination chest xray sometimes useful exclude bacterial pneumonia indicated routine chest xray may also useful people impending respiratory additional testing blood cultures complete blood count electrolyte analyses recommended routine use although may useful children multiple comorbidities signs sepsis testing specific viral cause done little effect management thus routinely rsv testing direct immunofluorescence testing nasopharyngeal aspirate sensitivity specificity identification rsvpositive help disease surveillance grouping cohorting people together hospital wards prevent cross infection predicting whether disease course peaked yet reducing need diagnostic procedures providing confidence cause identification virus may help reduce use infants bronchiolitis age two three months second infection bacteria usually urinary tract infection less evaluated urinalysis infants bronchiolitis concomitant uti preliminary studies suggested elevated procalcitonin levels may assist clinicians determining presence bacterial coinfection could prevent unnecessary antibiotic use many childhood illnesses present respiratory symptoms particularly persistent cough bronchiolitis may differentiated characteristic pattern preceding febrile upper respiratory tract symptoms lasting days followed persistent cough tachypnea however infants may present without fever cases may present apnea without signs poor weight gain prior onset cases additional laboratory

lower respiratory disease infants well risk severity tobacco smoke lingers environment prolonged periods clothing even smoking outside guidelines recommend parents fully educated risks tobacco smoke exposure children treatment bronchiolitis usually focused hydration symptoms instead infection since infection run course complications typically symptoms without active treatment half cases go away days three children severe symptoms especially poor feeding dehydration may considered hospital oxygen saturation measured pulse oximetry also frequently used indicator need highrisk infants apnea cyanosis malnutrition diagnostic uncertainty additional indications guidelines recommend sufficient fluids nutritional support affected measures recommendations mixed include nebulized hypertonic

maintaining hydration important part management infants mild pulmonary symptoms may require observation feeding however oral intake may affected nasal secretions increased work poor feeding dehydration defined less usual intake often cited indication hospital guidelines recommend use nasogastric intravenous fluids children bronchiolitis maintain usual oral risk health care caused hyponatremia fluid retention minimal use isotonic fluids normal saline breast milk inadequate oxygen supply tissue one main concerns severe bronchiolitis oxygen saturation often closely associated need hospitalization continued length hospital stay children however oxygen saturation poor predictor respiratory accuracy pulse oximetry limited range weak correlation oxygen saturation respiratory distress brief hypoxemia common healthy additionally pulse oximetry associated frequent false alarms parental stress clinicians may choose given additional oxygen children bronchiolitis oxygen saturation additionally clinicians may choose use continuous pulse oximetry choosing use oxygen therapy child bronchiolitis evidence home oxygen may reduce hospitalization rate length stay although readmission rates followup visits also use humidified heated highflow nasal cannula may safe initial therapy decrease work breathing need however evidence lacking regarding use highflow nasal cannula compared standard oxygen therapy continuous positive airway practices may still used severe cases prior update blood gas testing recommended people hospitalized disease useful routine management people severe worsening respiratory distress impending respiratory failure may considered capillary blood gas guidelines recommend use nebulized hypertonic saline emergency department children bronchiolitis may given children nebulized hypertonic saline limited evidence benefit previous studies lack consistency review found tentative evidence reduces risk hospitalization duration hospital stay improved severity majority evidence suggests hypertonic saline safe effective improving respiratory symptoms mild moderate bronchiolitis hours however appear effective reducing rate hospitalization used emergency room outpatient settings length therapy side effects mild resolved guidelines recommend use bronchodilators children bronchiolitis evidence support change outcomes additionally adverse effects use bronchodilators children tachycardia tremors well adding increased financial several studies shown bronchodilation βadrenergic agents salbutamol may improve symptoms briefly affect overall course illness reduce need however conflicting recommendations use trial bronchodilator especially history previous wheezing due difficulty assessing objective improvement bronchiolitisassociated wheezing likely effectively alleviated bronchodilators anyway caused airway obstruction plugging small airway diameters luminal debris bronchospasm asthmaassociated wheezing bronchodilators usually treat anticholinergic inhalers ipratropium bromide modest shortterm effect best recommended current state evidence suggests nebulized epinephrine indicated children bronchiolitis except trial rescue therapy severe epinephrine α β adrenergic agonist used treat upper respiratory tract illnesses croup nebulized cochrane metaanalysis found benefit use epinephrine inpatient setting suggested may utility outpatient setting reducing rate however current guidelines support outpatient use epinephrine given lack substantial sustained review found inhaled epinephrine corticosteroids change need hospitalization time spent studies suggest synergistic effect epinephrine corticosteroids consistently demonstrated benefits clinical guidelines recommend use approximately infants hospitalized due bronchiolitis require fluid dehydrated others fed fluids safely two main approaches fluid therapy intravenous iv fluid therapy enteral tube fluid therapy nasogastric
