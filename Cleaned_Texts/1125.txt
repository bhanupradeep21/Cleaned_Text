grinkers myelinopathy also known anoxic rare disease central nervous system disease characterized delayed leukoencephalopathy hypoxic typically though necessarily related carbon monoxide poisoning heroin overdose occurs roughly experience acute hypoxicanoxic wide range symptoms delay onset often misdiagnosed neuropathologies grinkers myelinopathy originally characterized roy r grinker depending source following apparent rehabilitation severe episode prolonged cerebral oxygen deprivation patients grinkers myelinopathy begin experience massive white matter death leads wide range neurological dysfunctions ranging confusion apathy parkinsonlike symptoms known include apathy dementia parkinsonism agitation urinary incontinence pseudobulbar palsy among many neuropsychiatric symptoms microscopically extensive hemispheric demyelination degeneration basal ganglia onset symptoms usually occurs several weeks initial hypoxic episode hypoxic episode necessarily severe usually arterial oxygen partial pressure less following severe hypoxia patient typically falls unconscious coma exception cases carbon monoxide patient recovers unconscious state usually within hours typically followed successful recovery days generally short recovery lucid period observed lasting anywhere weeks patient exhibits symptoms related anoxic episode period degenerative symptoms begin appear rapidly grow main cause neurological disorders believed demyelination cerebral hemispheres though currently widely accepted consensus commonly accepted theories cause demyelination include hypoxia cerebral edema due carbon monoxide toxicity drug overdose cerebral blood vessel damage disruption myelinproducing pathways carbon monoxide binds hemoglobin efficiently oxygen lower systemic blood pressure brought upon acute anoxic episode conjunction carbon monoxide poisoning often leads cerebral ischemia condition brain receive enough oxygen satisfy needs results lesions great deal subcortical cerebral white matter leaves axons ufibers perivascular myelin mostly untouched support theory stems ability replicate lesions using nitrogeninduced hypoxia hypotension onset disease individuals experienced acute hypoxia without carbon monoxide cerebral edema unusual swelling brain commonly caused anoxic episodes severe enough known cause preferential damage cerebral white matter due excessive swelling glial cells leaving many tissues theory suggests hypoxia carbon monoxide induce form edema resulting white matter necrosis evidence theory comes observation pathological lesions mimicking carbon monoxide poisoning hypoxia dehydration along toorapid rehydration taken place without carbon monoxide present anoxic event likely cause damage cytoplasmic atpdependent enzymes
