body hands feet armpits groin facial area among active regions perspiration due high number sweat glands eccrine glands particular areas excessive sweating localized eg palms soles face underarms scalp referred primary hyperhidrosis focal hyperhidrosis excessive sweating involving whole body termed generalized hyperhidrosis secondary hyperhidrosis usually result underlying condition primary focal hyperhidrosis may divided area affected instance palmoplantar hyperhidrosis symptomatic sweating hands feet gustatory hyperhidrosis sweating face chest moments eating certain hyperhidrosis also classified onset either congenital present birth acquired beginning later life primary focal hyperhidrosis usually starts adolescence even earlier seems inherited autosomal dominant genetic trait must distinguished secondary hyperhidrosis start point life usually presents years age secondary hyperhidrosis commonly accompanies conditions diabetes mellitus parkinsons disease hyperthyroidism hyperpituitarism anxiety disorder pheochromocytoma one classification scheme uses amount skin scheme excessive sweating area square centimeters square inches differentiated sweating affects small another classification scheme based possible causes hyperhidrosis cause primary hyperhidrosis unknown anxiety excitement exacerbate condition common complaint people nervous condition associated sweating sweat person nervous factors play role including certain foods drinks nicotine caffeine smells similarly secondary generalized hyperhidrosis many causes including certain types cancer disturbances endocrine system infections medications primary focal hyperhidrosis many causes variety cancers associated development secondary hyperhidrosis including lymphoma pheochromocytoma carcinoid tumors resulting carcinoid syndrome tumors within thoracic certain endocrine conditions also known cause secondary hyperhidrosis including diabetes mellitus especially blood sugars low acromegaly hyperpituitarism pheochromocytoma tumor adrenal glands present patients various forms thyroid use selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors eg sertraline common cause medicationinduced secondary medications associated secondary hyperhidrosis include tricyclic antidepressants stimulants opioids nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids glyburide insulin anxiolytic agents adrenergic agonists cholinergic symmetry excessive sweating hyperhidrosis consistent primary diagnose condition dermatologist gives person physical exam includes looking closely areas body sweat excessively dermatologist also asks specific questions helps physician understand person excessive sweating sometimes medical testing necessary patients require test called sweat test involves coating skin powder turns purple skin gets wet excessive sweating affecting one side body suggestive secondary hyperhidrosis investigation neurologic cause antihydral cream one solutions prescribed hyperhidrosis topical agents hyperhidrosis therapy include formaldehyde lotion topical anticholinergics etc agents reduce perspiration denaturing keratin turn occluding pores sweat glands shortlasting effect formaldehyde classified probable human carcinogen contact sensitization increased especially formalin aluminium chlorohydrate used regular antiperspirants however hyperhidrosis requires solutions gels much higher concentration antiperspirant solutions hyperhidrosis gels especially effective treatment axillary underarm regions normally takes around three five days see improvement common sideeffect skin irritation severe cases plantar palmar hyperhidrosis success conservative measures higher strength aluminium chloride treatment algorithms hyperhidrosis recommend topical antiperspirants first line therapy hyperhidrosis international hyperhidrosis society canadian hyperhidrosis advisory committee published treatment guidelines focal hyperhidrosis said evidencebased prescription medications called anticholinergics often taken mouth sometimes used treatment generalized focal anticholinergics used hyperhidrosis include propantheline glycopyrronium bromide glycopyrrolate oxybutynin methantheline benzatropine use drugs limited however sideeffects including dry mouth urinary retention constipation visual disturbances mydriasis dilation pupils cycloplegia people find hyperhidrosis made worse anxietyprovoking situations public speaking stage performances special events weddings etc taking anticholinergic medicine event may several anticholinergic drugs reduce hyperhidrosis oxybutynin brand name ditropan one shown although sideeffects drowsiness visual symptoms dryness mouth mucous membranes glycopyrrolate another drug sometimes used said nearly effective oxybutynin similar sideeffects us food drug administration fda approved topical anticholinergic glycopyrronium tosylate brand name qbrexza treatment primary axillary peripheral hyperhidrosis people found relief

treatment severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis excessive underarm sweating unknown cause managed topical microwavebased device tried excessive underarm perspiration appears show device rare serious side effects exist reported literature paralysis upper limbs brachial tap water iontophoresis treatment palmoplantar hyperhidrosis originally described studies showed positive results good safety tap water one trial found decreased sweating sweat gland removal destruction one surgical option available axillary hyperhidrosis excessive underarm perspiration multiple methods sweat gland removal destruction sweat gland suction retrodermal curettage axillary liposuction vaser laser sweat ablation sweat gland suction technique adapted main surgical option endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy ets cuts burns clamps thoracic ganglion main sympathetic chain runs alongside spine clamping intended permit reversal procedure ets generally considered safe reproducible effective procedure patients satisfied results satisfaction rates reported higher procedure brings relief excessive hand sweating ets may helpful treating axillary hyperhidrosis facial blushing facial sweating failure rates people facial blushing andor excessive facial sweating higher people may likely experience unwanted side ets sideeffects described ranging trivial common sideeffect ets compensatory sweating sweating different areas prior surgery major problems compensatory sweating seen people undergoing people find compensatory sweating tolerable claim quality life decreased result compensatory total body perspiration response heat reported increase original sweating problem may recur due nerve regeneration sometimes early months possible sideeffects include horners syndrome gustatory sweating less excessive dryness palms sandpaper people experienced cardiac sympathetic denervation result decrease heart rate rest exercise resulting decreased exercise percutaneous sympathectomy minimally invasive procedure similar botulinum method nerves blocked injection procedure provides temporary relief cases physicians advocate trying conservative procedure resorting surgical sympathectomy effects usually reversible hyperhidrosis physiological consequences cold clammy hands dehydration skin infections secondary maceration skin hyperhidrosis also devastating emotional effects ones individual hyperhidrosis may greater stress levels frequent excessive sweating focal hyperhidrosis hands interferes many routine securely grasping objects people focal hyperhidrosis sufferers avoid situations come physical contact others greeting person handshake hiding embarrassing sweat spots armpits limits affected persons arm movements pose severe cases shirts must changed several times day require additional showers remove sweat control body odor issues microbial problems acne dandruff athletes foot additionally anxiety caused selfconsciousness sweating may aggravate sweating excessive sweating

sweating hands risk dehydration limit ability function extremely hot especially also humid even playing musical instruments uncomfortable difficult sweaty estimated incidence focal hyperhidrosis may high population united affects men women equally commonly occurs among people aged years though may affected since early people another family member affected implying genetic researchers saga
