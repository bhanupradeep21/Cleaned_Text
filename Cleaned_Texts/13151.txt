adiponectin also referred adipoq protein hormone adipokine involved regulating glucose levels fatty acid breakdown humans encoded adipoq gene produced primarily adipose tissue also muscle even adiponectin polypeptide protein four distinct regions first short signal sequence targets hormone secretion outside cell next short region varies species third acid region similarity collagenous proteins last globular domain overall protein shows similarity complement factors threedimensional structure globular region determined striking similarity tnfα observed despite unrelated protein
