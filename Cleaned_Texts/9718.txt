ability alveoli return normal shape causal role tobacco smoke bronchiectasis nonetheless tobacco smoking worsen pulmonary function accelerate progression disease already development bronchiectasis requires two factors initial injury lung infection autoimmune destruction lung tissue destruction lung tissue seen gastroesophageal reflux disease aspiration syndromes leads impaired mucociliary clearance obstruction defect host triggers host immune response neutrophils elastases reactive oxygen species inflammatory cytokines results progressive destruction normal lung architecture particular elastic fibers bronchi result permanent abnormal dilation destruction major bronchi bronchiole disordered neutrophil function believed play role pathogenesis bronchiectasis neutrophil extracellular traps nets extracellular fibers secreted neutrophils used trap destroy pathogens hyperactive bronchiectasis increased net activity associated severe neutrophil elastase extracellular protein secreted neutrophils destroy pathogens well host tissue also hyperactive many cases increased neutrophil elastase activity also associated worse outcomes severe disease initial lung injury bronchiectasis leads impaired mucociliary clearance lung airways leads mucous mucous stasis leads bacterial colonization bronchiectasis leads neutrophil neutrophil activation leads tissue destruction airway distortion neutrophils addition direct tissue destruction pathogenic distorted damaged lung airways thus impaired mucociliary clearance leading mucous stasis bacterial colonization leading neutrophil activation thus fueling selfperpetuating vicious cycle inflammation vicious cycle theory generally accepted explanation pathogenesis endobronchial tuberculosis commonly leads bronchiectasis either bronchial stenosis secondary traction traction bronchiectasis characteristically affects peripheral bronchi lack cartilage support areas endstage goals diagnostic evaluation bronchiectasis radiographic confirmation diagnosis identification potential treatable causes functional assessment patient comprehensive evaluation consists radiographic imaging laboratory testing lung function laboratory tests commonly part initial evaluation include complete blood count sputum cultures bacteria mycobacteria fungi testing cystic fibrosis immunoglobulin additional tests sometimes indicated include testing specific genetic lung function testing used assessment monitoring functional impairment due bronchiectasis tests may include spirometry walking obstructive lung impairment common finding restrictive lung impairment seen advanced disease flexible bronchoscopy may performed sputum studies negative focal obstructing lesion chest xray abnormal patients bronchiectasis computed tomography recommended confirm diagnosis also used describe distribution grade severity disease radiographic findings include airway dilation bronchial wall thickening three types bronchiectasis seen ct scan namely cylindrical varicose cystic bronchiectasis primarily middle lobe right lung bronchiectasis secondary large carcinoid tumor shown completely obstructing bronchus proximally dilation airways present preventing bronchiectasis necessary prevent lung infections lung damage cause children immunized measles pertussis pneumonia acute respiratory infections childhood additionally parents stay alert keep children inhaling objects pieces food small toys may get stuck small smoking toxic fumes gases avoided patients bronchiectasis decrease development infections bronchitis treatments slow progression chronic disease include keeping bronchial airways clear secretions weakened various forms airway clearance aggressively treating bronchial infections antibiotics prevent destructive cycle infection damage bronchi bronchioles infection also standard treatment regular vaccination pneumonia influenza pertussis generally advised healthy body mass index regular doctor visits may beneficial effects prevention progressing bronchiectasis presence hypoxemia hypercapnia dyspnea level radiographic extent greatly affect mortality rate comprehensive approach management bronchiectasis important establish whether underlying modifiable cause immunoglobulin deficiency antitrypsin deficiency next steps include controlling infections bronchial secretions relieving airway obstructions removing affected portions lung surgery preventing goal airway clearance therapy loosen secretions interrupt cycle inflammation airway clearance techniques improve difficulty breathing cough help patients cough phlegm mucus airway clearance usually uses inhaled agent hypertonic saline chest physiotherapy highfrequency chest wall many airway clearance techniques devices exist choice technique device

treating mucolytic agents dornase alfa recommended individuals noncf mannitol hyperosmolar agent thought hydrate airway secretions however clinical trials demonstrated two commonly used classes antiinflammatory therapies macrolides despite also antibiotics macrolides exert immunomodulatory effects host inflammatory response without systemic suppression immune effects include modifying mucus production inhibition biofilm production suppression inflammatory three large multicenter randomized trials shown reduced rates exacerbations improved cough dyspnea use macrolide impact adverse effects macrolides gastrointestinal symptoms hepatotoxicity increased antimicrobial resistance needs ongoing review inhaled corticosteroid therapy reduce sputum production decrease airway constriction period time helping prevent progression long term use highdose inhaled corticosteroids lead adverse consequences cataracts recommended routine use one commonly used therapy beclometasone antibiotics used bronchiectasis eradicate p aeruginosa mrsa suppress burden chronic bacterial colonization treat use daily oral nonmacrolide antibiotic treatment studied small case series randomized role inhaled antibiotics noncf bronchiectasis recently evolved two society guidelines systematic review suggesting therapeutic trial inhaled antibiotics patients three exacerbations per year p aeruginosa options inhaled antibiotics include aerosolized tobramycin inhaled ciprofloxacin aerosolized aztreonam aerosolized however arises problem inhaled antibiotic treatments ciprofloxacin staying desired area
