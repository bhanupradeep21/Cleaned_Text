skull fracture break one eight bones form cranial portion skull usually occurring result blunt force trauma force impact excessive bone may fracture near site impact cause damage underlying structures within skull membranes blood vessels brain uncomplicated skull fracture occur without associated physical neurological damage usually clinically significant fracture healthy bone indicates substantial amount force applied increases possibility associated injury significant blow head results concussion without loss consciousness fracture conjunction overlying laceration tears epidermis meninges runs paranasal sinuses middle ear structures bringing outside environment contact cranial cavity called compound fracture compound fractures either clean contaminated four major types skull fractures linear depressed diastatic basilar linear fractures common usually require intervention fracture depressed fractures usually comminuted broken portions bone displaced may require surgical intervention repair underlying tissue damage diastatic fractures widen sutures skull usually affect children three basilar fractures bones base skull linear skull fractures breaks bone transverse full thickness skull outer inner table usually fairly straight bone displacement common cause injury blunt force trauma impact energy transferred wide area skullcitation needed linear skull fractures usually little clinical significance unless parallel close proximity transverse suture involve venous sinus groove vascular channel resulting complications may include suture diastasis venous sinus thrombosis epidural hematoma young children although rare possibility exists developing growing skull fracture especially fracture occurs parietal depressed skull fracture type fracture usually resulting blunt force trauma getting struck hammer rock getting kicked head types occur severe head comminuted fractures broken bones displace inward depressed skull fractures present high risk increased pressure brain hemorrhage brain crushes delicate tissuecitation needed compound depressed skull fractures occur laceration fracture putting internal cranial cavity contact outside environment increasing risk contamination infection complex depressed fractures dura mater torn depressed skull fractures may require surgery lift bones brain pressing making burr holes adjacent normal diastatic fractures occur fracture line transverses one sutures skull causing widening suture type fracture usually seen infants young children sutures yet fused also occur adults diastatic fracture occurs adults usually affects lambdoidal suture suture fully fuse adults age adult diastatic fractures caused severe head injuries due trauma diastatic fracture occurs collapse surrounding head bones crushes delicate tissue similarly depressed skull fracturecitation needed diastatic fractures occur different types fractures also possible diastasis cranial sutures occur without concomitant fracture sutural diastasis may also occur various congenital disorders cleidocranial dysplasia osteogenesis basilar skull fractures linear fractures occur floor cranial vault skull base require force cause areas neurocranium thus rare occurring fracture severe head injury patients basilar fractures characteristic signs blood sinuses cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea csf leaking nose ears cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea periorbital ecchymosis often called raccoon bruising orbits eyes result blood collecting leaks fracture site retroauricular ecchymosis known battles sign bruising mastoid growing skull fracture gsf also known craniocerebral erosion leptomeningeal due usual development cystic mass filled cerebrospinal fluid rare complication head injury usually associated linear skull fractures parietal bone children reported older children atypical regions skull basioccipital base skull base association types skull fractures characterized diastatic enlargement fracturecitation needed various factors associated development gsf primary causative factor tear dura mater skull fracture enlarges due part rapid physiologic growth brain occurs young children brain cerebrospinal fluid csf pulsations underlying leptomeningeal cystic cranial burst skull fracture usually occurring severe injuries infants less year age closed diastatic skull fracture cerebral extrusion beyond outer table skull intact scalpcitation needed acute scalp swelling associated type fracture equivocal cases without immediate scalp swelling diagnosis may made via use magnetic resonance imaging thus insuring prompt treatment avoiding development growing skull fracture conjunction overlying laceration tears epidermis runs paranasal sinuses middle ear structures putting outside environment contact cranial

two parts neurocranium formed eight cranial bones houses protect facial skeleton viscerocranium composed fourteen bones including three ossicles inner term skull fracture typically means fractures neurocranium fractures facial portion skull facial fractures jaw fractured mandibular eight cranial bones separated sutures one frontal bone two parietal bones two temporal bones one occipital bone one sphenoid bone one ethmoid bones skull three layers hard compact layer external table lamina externa diploë spongy layer red bone marrow middle compact layer inner table lamina skull thickness variable depending location thus traumatic impact required cause fracture depends impact site skull thick glabella external occipital protuberance mastoid processes external angular process frontal
