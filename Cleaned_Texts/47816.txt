flatulence humans expulsion gas intestines via anus commonly referred farting flatus medical word gas generated stomach proportion intestinal gas may swallowed environmental air hence flatus entirely generated stomach bowels scientific study area medicine termed flatus brought rectum pressurized muscles intestines normal pass flatus fart though volume frequency vary greatly among individuals also normal intestinal gas feculent unpleasant odor may intense noise commonly associated flatulence produced anus buttocks act together manner similar embouchure sound odor sources embarrassment annoyance amusement flatulence humor many societies flatus taboo thus many people either let flatus quietly even hold however holding gases inside several general symptoms related intestinal gas pain bloating abdominal distension excessive flatus volume excessive flatus odor gas incontinence furthermore eructation colloquially known burping sometimes included topic excessive malodorous flatus sign health disorder irritable bowel syndrome celiac disease lactose nonmedical definitions term include uncomfortable condition gas stomach bowels state excessive gas alimentary canal definitions highlight many people consider bloating abdominal distension increased volume intestinal gas synonymous term flatulence although technically inaccurate colloquially flatulence may referred farting pumping blowing pooting passing gas breaking wind backfiring simply american english gas british english wind derived terms include vaginal flatulence otherwise known queef generally speaking four different types complaints relate intestinal gas may present individually combination patients may complain bloating abdominal distension discomfort pain trapped wind past functional bowel disorders irritable bowel syndrome produced symptoms bloating attributed increased production intestinal gas however three significant pieces evidence refute theory first normal subjects even high rates gas infusion small intestine mlmin tolerated without complaints pain bloating harmlessly passed flatus per secondly studies aiming quantify total volume gas produced patients irritable bowel syndrome including gas emitted mouth eructation consistently failed demonstrate increased volumes compared healthy subjects proportion hydrogen produced may increased patients irritable bowel syndrome affect total thirdly volume flatus produced patients irritable bowel syndrome pain abdominal distension would tolerated normal subjects without complaints pain patients complain bloating frequently shown objective increases abdominal girth often increased throughout day resolving sleep increase girth combined fact total volume flatus increased led studies aiming image distribution intestinal gas patients bloating found gas distributed normally patients segmental gas pooling focal conclusion abdominal distension pain bloating symptoms result abnormal intestinal gas dynamics rather increased flatus production range volumes flatus normal individuals varies hugely intestinal gas either swallowed environmental air present intrinsically foods beverages result gut fermentation swallowing small amounts air occurs eating drinking emitted mouth eructation burping normal excessive swallowing environmental air called aerophagia shown case reports responsible increased flatus volume however considered rare cause increased flatus volume gases contained food beverages likewise emitted largely eructation eg carbonated beverages endogenously produced intestinal gases make percent flatus normal subjects volume gas produced partially dependent upon composition intestinal microbiota normally resistant change also different different individuals patients predisposed increased endogenous gas production virtue gut microbiota greatest concentration gut bacteria colon small intestine normally nearly sterile fermentation occurs unabsorbed food residues arrive colon therefore even composition microbiota diet primary factor dictates volume flatus diets aim reduce amount undigested fermentable food residues arriving colon shown significantly reduce volume flatus produced increased volume intestinal gas cause bloating pain normal subjects abnormal intestinal gas dynamics create pain distension bloating regardless whether high low total flatus volume although flatus possesses odor may abnormally increased patients cause social distress patient increased odor flatus presents distinct clinical issue complaints related intestinal patients may exhibit oversensitivity bad flatus odor extreme forms olfactory reference syndrome may diagnosed recent informal research found correlation flatus odor loudness humidity gas incontinence could defined loss voluntary control passage flatus recognised subtype faecal incontinence usually related minor disruptions continence mechanisms consider gas incontinence first sometimes symptom faecal intestinal gas composed varying quantities exogenous sources endogenous exogenous gases swallowed aerophagia eating drinking increased swallowing times excessive salivation might occur nauseated result gastroesophageal reflux
