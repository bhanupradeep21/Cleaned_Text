chemokines ancient greek χῠμείᾱ khumeíā alchemy movement chemotactic cytokines family small cytokines signaling proteins secreted cells induce directional movement leukocytes well cell types including endothelial epithelial addition playing major role activation host immune responses chemokines important biological processes including morphogenesis wound healing well pathogenesis diseases like cytokine proteins classified chemokines according behavior structural characteristics addition known mediating chemotaxis chemokines approximately kilodaltons mass four cysteine residues conserved locations key forming shape proteins historically known several names including sis family cytokines sig family cytokines scy family cytokines platelet superfamily intercrines chemokines considered proinflammatory induced immune response recruit cells immune system site infection others considered homeostatic involved controlling migration cells normal processes tissue maintenance development
