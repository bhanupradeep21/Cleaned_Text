displeasing recent meta analysis treatments however effectiveness treatment called three main mechanisms involved hypercarotenemia excessive dietary intake carotenoids increased serum lipids decreased metabolism carotenoids common reported cause hypercarotenemia thus carotenoderma increased intake either increased dietary foods nutritional supplements change takes approximately weeks recognized clinically numerous ingested substances rich carotenoids increased serum lipids also cause hypercarotenemia increased circulating lipoproteins contain bound carotenoids finally certain disease states
