target numbers may exceed case dice show rerolled target number eg reached rolling followed least target number one identical except extra dice rolls allowed target number greater even higher target numbers procedure repeated thus action target number like attempting procure militarygrade weaponry succeed three successive dice rolls result sixes fourth gives least dice roll roll always counts failure addition basic mechanic players use several taskspecific dice pools add bonus dice certain tests though dice used refresh end turn adds extra tactical element player must decide best spend bonus dice example combat pool dice could spent improve attacks improve defense players also karma pool used reroll dice failed reach target number karma pool refreshes rarely typically per scene less
