animals disparate rabbits rhinoceroses notoungulata largest group south american native ungulates genera families described divided two major subgroupings typotheria toxodontia notoungulates first diversified eocene diversity declined late neogene onwards large toxodontids persisting end pleistocene mixotoxodon expanding central america southern north america perishing part quaternary extinction event among large mammals americas collagen analysis suggests notoungulates closely related litopterns another group south american ungulates closest living relatives perissodactyls oddtoed ungulates including rhinoceroses tapirs equines part clade panperissodactyla however relationships south american ungulates uncertain several groups notoungulates separately evolved evergrowing cheek

million years conflicts results morphological analyses posited afrotherians line recent morphological analyses suggested basal euungulates panperissodactyla proposed name unranked clade include perissodactyls extinct south american ungulate cifelli argued notioprogonia paraphyletic would include ancestors remaining suborders similarly cifelli indicated typotheria would paraphyletic excluded hegetotheria advocated inclusion archaeohyracidae hegetotheriidae notoungulata many years taken include order arctostylopida whose fossils found mainly china recent studies however concluded arctostylopida properly classified gliriforms notoungulates therefore never found outside south central based analysis morphological characters notoungulate genera billet concluded homalodotheriidae
