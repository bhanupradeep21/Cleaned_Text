idiopathic orbital inflammatory ioi disease refers marginated masslike enhancing soft tissue involving area orbit common painful orbital mass adult population associated proptosis cranial nerve palsy syndrome uveitis retinal detachment idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome also known orbital pseudotumor first described busse characterized distinct entity benign nongranulomatous orbital inflammatory process characterized extraocular orbital adnexal inflammation known local systemic diagnosis exclusion neoplasm primary infection systemic disorders ruled diagnosed characterized chronicity anatomic location histologic idiopathic orbital inflammation varied clinical presentation depending involved tissue range diffuse inflammatory process localized inflammation muscle lacrimal gland orbital former name orbital pseudotumor derived due resemblance neoplasm however histologically characterized inflammation although benign condition may present aggressive clinical course severe vision loss oculomotor affected individuals typically present sudden painful proptosis redness edema proptosis vary according degree inflammation fibrosis mass effect occasionally ptosis chemosis motility dysfunction ophthalmoplegia optic neuropathy setting extensive sclerosis may restriction compression destruction orbital tissue symptoms usually develop acutely hours days also seen develop several weeks even months malaise headaches nausea may accompany symptoms unusual presentations described include cystoid macular edema temporal arteritis cluster pediatric ioi accounts cases idiopathic orbital common sign proptosis redness pain also experienced presentation varies slightly compared adults bilateral involvement uveitis disc edema tissue eosinophilia common population presence uveitis generally implies poor outcome pediatric ioi bilateral presentation may higher incidence systemic exact cause ioi unknown infectious immunemediated mechanisms proposed several studies

one study mottowlippe jakobiec smith suggests release circulating antigens caused local vascular permeability triggers inflammatory cascade affected tissues although mechanisms postulated possible causes ioi exact nature relationships condition still remain histopathology idiopathic orbital inflammation described nondiagnostic includes diverse polymorphous infiltrate atypical granulomatous

usually quick many agree corticosteroids continued tapering basis avoid breakthrough inflammation although many respond corticosteroid treatment alone several cases adjuvant therapy needed many
