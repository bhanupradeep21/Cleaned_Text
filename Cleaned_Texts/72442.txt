evolutionary developmental biology informally evodevo field biological research compares developmental processes different organisms infer developmental processes evolved field grew beginnings embryology faced mystery zoologists know embryonic development controlled molecular level charles darwin noted similar embryos implied common ancestry little progress made recombinant dna technology last brought embryology together molecular genetics key early discovery homeotic genes regulate development wide range eukaryotes field composed multiple core evolutionary concepts one deep homology finding dissimilar organs eyes insects vertebrates cephalopod molluscs long thought evolved separately controlled similar genes evodevo gene toolkit genes ancient highly conserved among phyla generate patterns time space shape embryo ultimately form body plan organism another species differ much structural genes coding enzymes differ way gene expression regulated toolkit genes genes reused unchanged many times different parts embryo different stages development forming complex cascade control switching regulatory genes well structural genes precise pattern multiple pleiotropic reuse explains genes highly conserved change would many adverse consequences natural selection would oppose new morphological features ultimately new species produced variations toolkit either genes expressed new pattern toolkit genes acquire additional functions another possibility neolamarckian theory epigenetic changes later consolidated gene level something may important early history multicellular life philosophers began think animals acquired form womb classical antiquity aristotle asserts physics treatise according empedocles order spontaneously appears developing embryo parts animals treatise argues empedocles theory wrong aristotles account empedocles stated vertebral column divided vertebrae happens embryo twists snaps column pieces aristotle argues instead process predefined goal seed develops embryo began inbuilt potential become specific body parts vertebrae sort animal gives rise animals kind humans human recapitulation theory evolutionary development proposed étienne serres echoing ideas johann friedrich meckel argued embryos higher animals went recapitulated series stages resembled animal lower great chain example brain human embryo looked first like fish turn like reptile bird mammal becoming clearly human embryologist karl ernst von baer opposed arguing linear sequence great chain based single body plan process epigenesis structures differentiate von baer instead recognized four distinct animal body plans radiate like starfish molluscan like clams articulate like lobsters vertebrate like fish zoologists largely abandoned recapitulation though ernst haeckel revived early century century embryology faced mystery animals seen develop adults widely differing body plan often similar stages egg zoologists knew almost nothing embryonic development controlled molecular level therefore equally little developmental processes charles darwin argued shared embryonic structure implied common ancestor example darwin cited book origin species shrimplike larva barnacle whose sessile adults looked nothing like arthropods linnaeus cuvier classified darwin also noted alexander kowalevskys finding tunicate mollusc larval stage notochord pharyngeal slits developed germ layers equivalent structures vertebrates therefore grouped century zoology thus converted embryology evolutionary science connecting phylogeny homologies germ layers embryos zoologists including fritz müller proposed use embryology discover phylogenetic relationships taxa müller demonstrated crustaceans shared nauplius larva identifying several parasitic species recognized crustaceans müller also recognized natural selection must act larvae adults giving lie recapitulation would require larval forms shielded natural two haeckels ideas evolution development fared better recapitulation argued changes timing heterochrony changes positioning within body heterotopy aspects embryonic development would drive evolution changing shape descendants body compared ancestors took century ideas shown darcy thompson wrote book shapes animals showing simple mathematics small changes parameters angles gastropods spiral shell radically alter animals form though preferred mechanical evolutionary without molecular evidence progress alan turing published paper chemical basis morphogenesis development patterns animals bodies suggested

time creating visible order violated second law socalled modern synthesis early century ronald fisher brought together darwins theory evolution insistence natural selection heredity variation gregor mendels laws genetics coherent structure evolutionary biology biologists assumed organism straightforward reflection component genes genes coded proteins built organisms body biochemical pathways supposed new species evolved mutations genes simple clear nearly comprehensive picture explain sean b carroll commented evodevos insights available embryology would certainly played central role evolutionary embryologist gavin de beer anticipated evolutionary developmental biology book embryos showing evolution could occur retention juvenile features de beer argued could cause apparently sudden changes fossil record since embryos fossilise poorly gaps fossil record used argument darwins gradualist evolution de beers explanation supported darwinian however despite de beer modern synthesis largely ignored embryonic development explain form organisms since population genetics appeared adequate explanation forms jacques monod jeanpierre changeux françois jacob discovered lac

led second last including embryology well molecular genetics phylogeny evolutionary biology form edward b lewis discovered homeotic genes regulate embryonic development drosophila fruit flies like insects arthropods one major phyla invertebrate bill mcginnis quickly discovered homeotic gene sequences homeoboxes animals phyla vertebrates frogs birds mammals later also found fungi yeasts evidently strong similarities genes controlled development across christiane nüssleinvolhard eric wieschaus described gap genes help create segmentation pattern fruit fly lewis nobel prize work later

pass layer nerve fibres reaching detector cells retina structure effectively upsidedown contrast cephalopod eye retina layer nerve fibres wall eye right way evidence however genes controlled development eyes animals suggesting evolved common ancient genes conserved millions years evolution create dissimilar structures similar functions demonstrating deep homology structures thought purely notion later extended evolution caused radical revision meaning homology evolutionary small fraction genes organisms genome control organisms development genes called developmentalgenetic toolkit highly conserved among phyla meaning ancient similar widely separated groups animals differences deployment toolkit genes affect body plan number identity pattern body parts toolkit genes parts signalling pathways encode transcription factors cell adhesion proteins cell surface receptor proteins signalling ligands bind secreted morphogens diffuse embryo help define fate undifferentiated cells embryo together generate patterns time space shape embryo ultimately form body plan organism among important toolkit genes hox genes transcription factors contain homeobox proteinbinding dna motif also found toolkit genes create basic pattern body along fronttoback hox genes determine repeating parts many vertebrae snakes grow developing embryo already mentioned classic toolkit although toolkit genes involved establishing plant homeobox genes also found plants implying common protein products regulatory toolkit reused duplication modification complex mosaic pleiotropy applied unchanged many independent developmental processes giving pattern many dissimilar body loci pleiotropic toolkit genes large complicated modular cisregulatory elements example nonpleiotropic rhodopsin gene fruit fly cisregulatory element hundred base pairs long pleiotropic eyeless cisregulatory region contains cisregulatory elements base regulatory networks involved often large regulatory protein controls scores hundreds cisregulatory elements instance fruit fly transcription factors controlled average target genes complexity enables genes involved development embryo switched exactly right times exactly right places genes structural directly forming enzymes tissues organs embryo many others regulatory genes switched often preciselytimed cascade switching involving turning one developmental process another developing cascading regulatory network studied detail development fruit fly embryo young embryo oval shape like rugby ball small number genes produce messenger rnas set
