philosophers jeremy bentham baruch spinoza descartes hypothesized feelings pain suffering pleasure part continuum strong evidence biological connections neurochemical pathways used perception pain pleasure well psychological rewards stimulusresponse perspective perception physical pain starts nociceptors type physiological receptor transmits neural signals brain activated receptors commonly found skin membranes deep fascias mucosa connective tissues visceral organs ligaments articular capsules muscles tendons periosteum arterial stimuli received various afferent action potentials triggered pass along various fibers axons nociceptive nerve cells dorsal horn spinal cord dorsal roots neuroanatomical review pain pathway afferent pain pathways almeida describes various specific nociceptive pathways spinal cord spinothalamic tract spinoreticular tract spinomesencephalic tract spinoparabrachial tract spinohypothalamic tract spinocervical tract postsynaptic pathway spinal activity many parts brain associated pain perception known parts ascending pathway include thalamus hypothalamus midbrain lentiform nucleus somatosensory cortices insular prefrontal anterior parietal also descending pathways modulation pain sensation one brainstem regions responsible periaqueductal gray midbrain relieves pain behavior well inhibits activity nociceptive neurons dorsal horn spinal cord brainstem sites parabrachial nucleus dorsal raphe locus coeruleus medullary reticular formation also mediate pain relief use many different neurotransmitters either facilitate inhibit activity neurons dorsal horn neurotransmitters include noradrenaline serotonin dopamine histamine acetylcholine pleasure considered many different perspectives physiological hedonic hotspots activated experience psychological study behavioral responses towards reward pleasure also often compared even defined many neuroscientists form alleviation pleasure studied systems taste olfaction auditory musical visual art sexual activity neural hotspots involved processing pleasure include nucleus accumbens posterior ventral pallidum amygdala cortical subcortical prefrontal limbic regions neocortex particularly orbitofrontal region prefrontal cortex anterior cingulate cortex insular cortex suggested pleasure causing substrates one approach evaluating relationship pain pleasure consider two systems rewardpunishment based system pleasure perceived one associates reward pain perceived one associates punishment evolutionarily makes sense often actions result pleasure chemicals induce pleasure work towards restoring homeostasis body example body hungry pleasure rewarding food oneself restores body back balanced state replenished energy like also applied pain ability perceive pain enhances avoidance defensive mechanisms still necessary neural systems explored trying look neurochemical relationship pain pleasure opioid dopamine systems opioid system responsible actual experience sensation whereas dopamine system responsible anticipation expectation experience opioids work modulation pleasure pain relief either blocking neurotransmitter release hyperpolarizing neurons opening potassium channel effectively temporarily blocks suggested early century bc pain pleasure occurs continuum aristotle claims antagonistic relationship rhetoric describes pain pleasure much like pushpull concept human beings move towards something causes pleasure move away something causes pain anatomical level shown source modulation pain pleasure originates neurons locations including amygdala pallidum nucleus accumbens siri leknes irene tracey two neuroscientists study pain pleasure concluded pain reward processing involve many regions brain also functional relationship lies pain decreases pleasure rewards increase analgesia relief thomas szasz late professor psychiatry emeritus state university new york health science center syracuse new york explored pain pleasure opposites ends spectrum book pain pleasure study bodily feelings szasz notes although often refer pain pleasure opposites way incorrect receptors pain none way pleasure makes sense ask pain pleasure vantage point established author delves topics metaphorical pain legitimacy power relations communications myriad whether pain pleasure indeed continuum still remains scientifically supported parts neural pathways two perceptions overlap also scientific evidence one may opposing effects would evolutionarily advantageous human beings develop relationship two perceptions south african neuroscientists presented evidence physiological link continuum pain pleasure first neuroscientists mark gillman fred lichtigfeld demonstrated two endogenous endorphin systems one pain producing pain short time later showed two systems might also involved addiction initially pursued presumably pleasure generating pain relieving actions addictive soon provided evidence endorphins system involved sexual morten kringelbach suggests relationship pain pleasure would evolutionarily efficient necessary know whether avoid approach something survival according norman doidge brain limited sense tends focus used pathways therefore common pathway pain pleasure could simplified way human beings interacted environmentcitation needed leknes tracey offer two theoretical perspectives relationship could evolutionarily advantageous opponentprocess theory model views two components pairs opposite one component experienced component repressed therefore increase pain bring decrease pleasure decrease pain bring increase pleasure pain relief simple model serves purpose explaining evolutionarily significant role homeostasis relationship evident since seeking pleasure avoiding pain important survival leknes tracey provide suggest perhaps common currency human beings determine importance motivation perception allow weighed order make decision best motivationdecision model suggested howard l centered around concept decision processes driven motivations highest priority model predicts case anything important pain survival cause human body mediate pain activating descending pain modulation system described thus suggested human beings developed unconscious ability endure pain sometimes even relieve pain important survival gain larger reward may advantageous link pain pleasure perceptions together able reduce pain gain reward necessary fitness childbirth like opponentprocess theory body induce pleasure pain relief decrease effect pain would allow human beings able make best evolutionary decisions survival following neurological andor mental diseases linked forms pain anhedonia schizophrenia depression addiction cluster headache chronic great deal known pain pleasure today primarily comes studies conducted rats deep brain stimulation involves electrical stimulation deep brain structures electrodes implanted brain effects neurosurgery studied patients parkinsons disease tremors dystonia epilepsy depression obsessivecompulsive disorder tourettes syndrome cluster headache chronic fine electrode inserted targeted area brain secured skull attached pulse generator implanted elsewhere body skin surgeon turns frequency electrode voltage frequency desired deep brain stimulation shown several studies induce pleasure even addiction well ameliorate pain chronic pain lower frequencies hz produced analgesic effects whereas higher frequencies hz alleviated stopped pyramidal tremors parkinsons still research necessary exactly dbs works however understanding
