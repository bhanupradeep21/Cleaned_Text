implicit personality theory describes specific patterns biases individual uses forming impressions based limited amount initial information unfamiliar parts impression formation process contextdependent individuals also tend exhibit certain tendencies forming impressions across variety situations one singular implicit personality theory utilized rather individual approaches task impression formation unique however components implicit personality theories consistent across individuals within groups similar individuals components particular interest social psychologists potential give insight impression one person form one first psychologists extensively explore concept impression formation solomon asch research dating back provided substantial amount initial data explaining factors affect impression formation particularly interested differences central peripheral traits many ideas produced aschs experiments still relevant study impression formation played significant role establishing foundation modern implicit personality theory one notable characteristics implicit personality theories fact implicit context implicit taken mean automatic common belief much process social perception actually example possible person experience automatic thought processes processes occur without persons intention awareness terms impression formation means observer may perceive another persons behavior automatically make trait inferences behavior without aware inferences strongest evidence implicitness impression formation comes observed savings effects trying learn another persons traits study carlston skowronski participants exposed descriptive stimuli containing implied trait information learned target persons traits easily participants previously exposed implied trait information moreover effect could accounted simple priming mechanisms participants exhibited true savings effect suggested gained implicit trait information descriptive consistency terms implicit personality theories refers way newly formed impression relates already known person two dimensions consistency involved inferring traits respect known traits person evaluative consistency suggests inferred traits match overall impression person formed traits person already tendency infer favorable traits people already exhibited mostly favorable traits likewise evaluative consistency implies person known mostly unfavorable traits others likely attribute unfavorable traits hand descriptive consistency suggests trait inferences person occur similarities descriptive attributes person assumed example two traits descriptively similar skeptical observer using descriptive similarity form impression skeptical person would likely also believe person distrustful two traits similarly describe person questions people tell dimensions consistency used forming impressions inferring traitsone correct likely used sequence descriptive consistency used evaluative consistency study felipe revealed traits exhibit evaluative descriptive consistency traits descriptively evaluatively consistent stingy firm assumed cooccur often traits show evaluative descriptive consistency stingy permissive however evaluative consistency preferred scenarios making quick allornothing judgment necessary attribution theory describes people view trait stability another person theory deal exclusively traits rather describes general worldview person takes life two main attribute theories entity theory incremental theory people exhibit entity theory tend believe traits fixed stable time across making judgments persons behavior inclined emphasize traits person moreover entity theorists tend make assumptions others traits based limited sample behaviors incremental theorists believe traits dynamic vary time also place less significance traits interpreting another persons actions focusing rather types mediators may influencing biggest distinguishing factor two theories entity theorists tend make stronger broader inferences traits incremental theorists distinction holds true even situational explanations observed behavior entity theorists believe traits stable time confident attributing persons behavior forming impression observer weigh every observed trait equally traits observer consider others forming ultimate concept main focus aschs research impression formation asch termed highly influential traits strong effect overall impression central traits less influential traits produced smaller effects overall impression called peripheral traits according asch defining feature central trait plays significant role determining content function first study performed asch found participants asked form impression person intelligent skillful industrious warm determined practical cautious formed significantly different impressions participants asked describe person intelligent skillful industrious cold determined practical cautious furthermore participants asked rate traits list important formation impression reported warm cold one influential traits list asch performed experiment using polite blunt place warm cold found change two traits much weaker effect overall impression changing warm cold additionally negative central trait cold inserted list positive peripheral traits greater overall effect impression positive central trait warm inserted list negative peripheral general observer believes exhibits trait likely observer notice trait addition study benedetti joseph showed specific observer traits could significant factors impressions observer forms another person however effect highly variable across various traits contexts example compared outgoing people reserved tend form positive impressions reserved people however pattern found outgoing people judged case number outgoing reserved people attributed positive traits outgoing possible explanation observers tendency form positive impressions people similar involves theory intergroup bias idea intergroup bias suggests people tend judge members group favorably nonmembers assumption reserved people would consider unsociable people group would rate favorably people outgoing group selfbased heuristic describes strategy observers use provided limited trait information another person case proceed fill gaps trait information reflects personality filling occurs trait information observers personality easily accessible information observers common explanation limited availability trait information traits difficult judge example trait like extraversion easy another person observe therefore easier judge another person trait like general affect therefore trait external indicators observer likely assume another person embodies trait similar way observer important note however selfbased heuristic negatively correlated agreement words observer uses selfbased heuristic less likely making correct trait primacy effect describes tendency weigh information learned first heavily information learned later terms impression formation primacy effect indicates order persons traits presented affects overall impression formed effect prevails forming impressions hypothetical person asked form impression target person observer actually asch hypothesized reason primacy effect impression formation first traits learned produce general direction impression formed subsequent traits interpreted way coincides established primacy effect also explained terms memory shortterm memory becomes crowded trait information less attention given newer details consequently information learned early greater influence impression formation receives attention remembered clearly later mood play influential role impression formation affecting way primacy effect used making positive mood causes person process information holistic allinclusive fashion negative mood encourages adaptive processing accounts detail therefore positive mood tends increase influence early information negative mood opposite effect also evidence moodcongruent factor people good moods form positive impressions people bad moods form negative likely due selective priming information associated current mood state causes moodcongruent biases impression although many advantages using implicit personality theories forming impressions danger relying heavily theories addition aforementioned selfbased heuristic another one common misuses implicit personality theory observers believe two traits highly correlated fallacy take two forms halo effect logical error halo effect describes tendency observer form generally favorable unfavorable average impression specific person allow general impression exaggerated effect judgments person along trait common example halo effect observer considers attractiveness favorable trait assumes attractive person meets also extremely friendly helpful traits also favorable hand logical error fallacy made observers make judgments trait relationships based correlations believe make sense logically instead forming connections based observations reallife trait relationships example making logical error would assuming person physically strong muscular also athletic trait relationship makes logical sense without observations back assuming relationship would making logical error halo effect logical error fallacy result unfounded trait correlations difference halo effect refers trait correlations specific person logical error generalizable across population refers trait correlations made regard specific individuals
