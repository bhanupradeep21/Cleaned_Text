cousin relative child parents sibling specifically referred first cousin generally kinship system used englishspeaking world cousin type relationship relatives two generations away recent common ancestor definition degrees removals used specify relationship degree measures number generations recent common ancestors parent cousin cousins come generation removal specified removal measures difference generations two cousins relative recent common ancestors removal specified cousin separated different number generations common ancestor case degree cousin previous generation used illustrate usage second cousin cousin degree two three two generations common ancestors degree specified first cousin assumed cousin removed cousin one removal generational difference namely child one first cousin first cousin one parent removal specified removal various governmental entities established systems legal use precisely specify kinship common ancestors number generations past example medicine law first cousin type thirddegree relativecitation needed people related type cousin relationship share common ancestor separated recent common ancestor two generations means neither person ancestor share parent siblings neither sibling others parent others auntuncle english system cousin relationship detailed concepts degree removal degree number generations subsequent common ancestor parent one cousins found means degree separation cousin common ancestor less one also cousins separated common ancestor number generations cousin smallest separation used determine removal difference number generations cousin common two people removed around age due differences birth dates parents children relevant example david george opposing sides family tree first cousins david lowest order one one removal cousins order one two respectively therefore difference generations common ancestor one maternal cousin cousin related mothers side family paternal cousin cousin related fathers side family relationship necessarily reciprocal maternal cousin one person could paternal cousin example basic family tree emma davids maternal cousin david emmas paternal cousin parallel cross cousins hand reciprocal relationships parallel cousins descended samesex siblings parallel first cousin relationship exists subject relative maternal cousins paternal cousins cross cousins descendants oppositesex siblings cross first cousin relationship exists subject relative maternal cousin paternal cousin basic family tree example david emma cross cousins double cousins relatives cousins two different branches family tree occurs siblings respectively reproduce different siblings another may also referred cousins sides resulting children related parents thus doubly related double first cousins share sets grandparents half cousins descended half siblings would share one children two half siblings first half cousins half siblings children another pair half siblings resulting children would double half first cousins agreed upon term possible cousins share three grandparents pair half siblings children pair full stepcousins either stepchildren individuals aunt uncle nieces nephews ones stepparent children ones parents cousininlaw cousin ones spouse spouse ones consanguinity measure closely individuals related measured coefficient relationship discussing coefficient relationship assume subject relative related kinship term coefficient one represents relationship one oneself consanguinity decreases half every generation separation recent common ancestor two parents child one common ancestor consanguinity ancestor added together get final first cousins two shared ancestors four generations separation family tree displaystyle lefttfrac consanguinity oneeighth additional removal cousin relationship consanguinity reduced half generations separation increase one additional degree cousin relationship consanguinity reduced quarter generations separation increase one half cousins half consanguinity ordinary cousins half common ancestors ie one vs two double cousins twice consanguinity ordinary cousins twice number common ancestors ie four vs two double first cousins share consanguinity halfsiblings likewise double half cousins share consanguinity first cousins two common ancestors halfsiblings one side full siblings would threehalves consanguinity ordinary first scenario two monozygotic identical twins children another pair monozygotic twins resulting double cousins would test genetically similar siblings couples closely related increased chance sharing genes including mutations occurred family tree mutation recessive trait reveal unless father mother share due risk trait harmful children highconsanguinity parents increased risk recessive genetic disorders see inbreeding information closely related couples children couples related consanguinity equivalent third cousins greatest reproductive seems counterintuitive closely related parents higher probability offspring unfit yet closer kinship also decrease likelihood immunological incompatibility cousin marriage important several anthropological theories often differentiate matriarchal patriarchal parallel cross cousins currently historically high marriages first second cousin marriages often anthropologists believe used tool strengthen family conserve wealth protect cultural heritage retain power structure family place community groups encourage cousin marriage others attach strong social stigma regions middle east half marriages first second cousins countries region may
