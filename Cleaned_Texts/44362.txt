elderly many reported cases come east asian origin suggests may genetic disposition development hemiballismus result hyperglycemia hemiballistic movements appear blood glucose levels get high subside glucose levels return normal time scale usually several hours patients type hemiballismus imaging reveals abnormalities putamen contralateral movements well globus pallidus caudate nucleus hyperglycemia cause hemiballistic movements suggested petechial hemorrhage decreased production gaba acetylcholine could result secondary hyperglycemia one issues could responsible hemiballistic neoplasm abnormal growth cells cases shown occurs somewhere basal ganglia hemiballismus vascular malformations cause abnormal blood flow areas brain little blood delivered basal ganglia stroke another form tumor result brain result tuberculous meningitis infection type tumor also damage parts basal ganglia sometimes resulting demyelinating plaques attack myelin sheaths neurons decreases conduction velocity neurons making signals received basal ganglia garbled incomplete disorganized signal also cause chaotic movements characterized patients hiv often complications arise along aids hypoglycemia due pentamidine use patients aids known cause hemiballismus patients hemiballismus visible symptom alert physician patients may aids typically result secondary infection occurs due compromised immune system common infection causing hemiballismus cerebral toxoplasmosis lesions result infection found basal ganglia long diagnosis missed type hemiballismus treated well patients without basal ganglia collection nuclei connects several areas brain due diverse nuclei contain basal ganglia involved numerous functions including motor control within structure hemiballismus primarily occurs braincitation needed structure within basal ganglia innervates structures including important connection internal globus pallidus subthalamic nucleus essentially provides excitement needed drive globus injury area efferent afferent connections induce disorder contralateral side structure regulator motor function also involved associative limbic traditionally thought disorder caused injury subthalamic nucleus later studies shown damage basal ganglia regions also responsible causing hemiballismus caused lesions subthalamic nucleus severe forms recent studies thought hemiballismus associated decreased output globus pallidus studies shown firing rates decrease addition decreased firing rate degenerative neurological disorders cause patients exhibit hemiballistic movements show marked decrease globus pallidus mass increases activity area causes inhibition motor thalamus causes cortical activation thus movement inhibition case hemiballismus opposite occurs leading characteristic large irregular putamen also part basal ganglia involved hemiballismus due fact projects premotor cortex globus pallidus result damage area also cause hemiballistic movements seen also part chain caudate nucleus portion basal ganglia helps control voluntary movement damage area also result hemiballismus directly related voluntary majority damage causes hemiballismus occurs within basal ganglia still cases documented damage cortical structures caused hemiballistic diagnosis hemiballismus clinical one made observation clinical examination hemiballismus clinical sign number different causes therefore diagnosis underlying clinical sign sought observer note sudden flinging movements limbs occasionally face commonly unilateral hemiballismus movements must distinguished hyperkinetic movement disorders tremor generally rhythmic smaller amplitude chorea akathisia athetosis often lower amplitude less violentcitation needed treating hemiballismus first important treat whatever may causing manifestation disorder could hyperglycemia infections neoplastic lesions patients may even need treatment disorder severe pharmacological treatment necessary standard type drug use antidopaminergic drug blocking dopamine effective ninety percent patients perphenazine pimozide haloperidol chlorpromazine standard choices treatment scientists still unsure form treatment works dopamine directly linked anticonvulsant called topiramate helped patients three cases may viable treatment intrathecal baclofen itb therapy used treat variety movement disorders cerebral palsy multiple sclerosis also possibility help treat one case itb patient average ballism episodes right lower limb per hour episodes right hip would flex degrees fully extended knee itb pump implanted correct dosage found frequency ballistic right leg movements decreased three per day right hip flexed degrees patient also able better isolate individual distal joint movements right lower limb patient currently receives microgday itb continues benefit almost years itb pump new uses botulinum toxin included treatment hemiballismus however still early stages testing treatment deals muscular manifestations hemiballismus opposed neurological tetrabenazine used treat movement disorders used treat hemiballismus patients using medication dramatic response however lowering dosage leads return symptoms drug works depleting one case patient responding haloperidol thus physician tried olanzapine patient made significant recovery research performed use types drugs treating surgery treatment used patients severe hemiballismus responded treatment lesioning globus pallidus deep brain stimulation globus pallidus procedures used humans usually lesioning favored deep brain stimulation maintenance required continue stimulating brain correctly past prognosis patients disease poor many patients experiencing severe disability death patients responding remarkably well current treatments majority patients go spontaneous remission go remission symptoms hemiballismus generally well controlled due rarity disorder scientists know little details hemiballismus work jr whittier fa mettler mb carpenter helped scientists clinicians form complete picture hemiballismus experiments several lesions made basal ganglia structures monkeys monitored results noticed majority time monkeys unusual movements however least twenty percent subthalamic nucleus damaged abnormal movements seen limbs opposite side brain damaged observation caused scientists believe hemiballismus outside subthalamic nucleus occur much later classical model began expand include areas basal ganglia even cortical structures also noticed unlike human patients unusual movements monkeys mainly lower extremities half monkeys hemiballismus continued monkey scientists also worked perplexing disorder found symptoms induced injecting kainic acid ibotenic acid subthalamic nucleus hamada mr delong found using chemicals could destroy four percent subthalamic nucleus still see hemiballistic movements however abnormal movements would usually disappear within four five hours even though appear though damaged tissue healed suggests subthalamic nucleus plastic enough adapt small amounts damage order resume normal disease httpsenwikipediaorgwikihemiballismus
