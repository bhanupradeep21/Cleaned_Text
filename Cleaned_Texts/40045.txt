ability sense infrared thermal radiation evolved independently two different groups snakes one consisting families boidae boas pythonidae pythons family crotalinae pit vipers commonly called pit organ allows animals essentially radiant heat wavelengths Î¼m advanced infrared sense pit vipers allows animals strike prey accurately even absence light detect warm objects several meters previously thought organs evolved primarily prey detectors recent evidence suggests may also used thermoregulation predator detection making generalpurpose sensory organ facial pit underwent parallel evolution pitvipers boas pythons evolved pitvipers multiple times boas electrophysiology structure similar two lineages differ gross structural anatomy superficially pitvipers possess one large pit organ either side head eye nostril loreal pits boas pythons three comparatively smaller pits lining upper sometimes lower lip scales labial pits pitvipers advanced suspended sensory membrane opposed simple pit structure pit vipers heat pit consists deep pocket rostrum membrane stretched across behind membrane airfilled chamber provides air contact either side membrane pit membrane highly vascular heavily innervated numerous heatsensitive receptors formed terminal masses trigeminal nerve terminal nerve masses tnms receptors therefore discrete cells part trigeminal nerve labial pit found boas pythons lacks suspended membrane consists simply pit lined membrane similarly innervated vascular though morphology vasculature differs snakes crotalines purpose vasculature addition providing oxygen receptor terminals rapidly cool receptors thermoneutral state heated thermal radiation stimulus vasculature receptor would remain warm state exposed warm stimulus would present animal afterimages even stimulus cases facial pit innervated trigeminal nerve crotalines information pit organ relayed nucleus reticularus caloris medulla via lateral descending trigeminal tract relayed contralateral optic tectum boas pythons information labial pit sent directly contralateral optic tectum via lateral descending trigeminal tract bypassing nucleus reticularus optic tectum brain eventually processes infrared cues portion brain receives sensory information well notably optic stimulation also motor proprioceptive auditory neurons tectum respond visual infrared stimulation alone others respond strongly combined visual infrared stimulation still others respond combination visual infrared neurons appear tuned detect movement one direction found snakes visual infrared maps world overlaid optic tectum combined information relayed via tectum nerve fibers pit organ constantly firing low rate objects within neutral temperature range change rate firing neutral range determined average thermal radiation objects receptive field organ thermal radiation given threshold causes increase temperature nerve fiber resulting stimulation nerve subsequent firing increased temperature resulting increased firing sensitivity nerve fibers estimated pit organ adapt repeated stimulus adapted stimulus removed fluctuation opposite direction example warm object placed front snake organ increase firing rate first adapt warm object firing rate nerves pit organ return normal warm object removed pit organ register space used occupy colder firing rate depressed adapts removal object latency period adaptation approximately facial pit actually visualizes thermal radiation using optical principles pinhole camera wherein location source thermal radiation determined location radiation membrane heat pit however studies visualized thermal images seen facial pit using computer analysis suggested resolution extremely poor size opening pit results poor resolution small warm objects coupled pits small size subsequent poor heat conduction image produced extremely low resolution contrast known focusing sharpening image occurs lateral descending trigeminal tract possible visual infrared integration occurs tectum may also used help sharpen image spite detection infrared light infrared detection mechanism similar photoreceptors photoreceptors detect light via photochemical reactions protein pits snakes type transient receptor potential channel temperature sensitive ion channel senses infrared signals mechanism involving warming pit organ rather chemical reaction structure function resembles biological version warmthsensing instrument called bolometer consistent thin pit membrane would allow incoming infrared radiation quickly precisely warm given ion channel trigger nerve impulse well vascularization pit membrane order rapidly cool ion channel back original temperature state molecular precursors mechanism found snakes protein expressed much lower degree much less sensitive infrared sensing snakes use pit organs extensively detect target warmblooded prey rodents birds blind blindfolded rattlesnakes strike prey accurately complete absence visible though appear assess prey animals based body addition snakes may deliberately choose ambush sites facilitate infrared detection previously assumed organ evolved specifically prey however recent evidence shows pit organ may also used thermoregulation experiment tested snakes abilities locate cool thermal refuge uncomfortably hot maze pit vipers able locate refuge quickly easily true vipers unable suggests pitvipers using pit organs aid thermoregulatory also possible organ may even evolved defensive adaptation rather predatory one multiple pressures may contributed organs use heat pit direct thermoregulation behaviors
