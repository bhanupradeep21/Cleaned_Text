stephen jay gould introduced term spandrel evolutionary theory held endowed chair zoology biology harvard university death research professor sociological perspective lewontin strongly opposed genetic

dobzhansky held faculty positions north carolina state university university rochester university chicago lewontin appointed alexander agassiz professor zoology professor biology harvard university holding position lewontin worked theoretical experimental population genetics hallmark work interest new technology kenichi kojima gave equations change haplotype frequencies interacting natural selection two paper gave theoretical derivation equilibria expected also investigated dynamics model computer iteration lewontin later introduced measure linkage j l hubby published paper studied amount heterozygosity used protein gel electrophoresis survey dozens loci fruit fly drosophila pseudoobscura reported large fraction loci polymorphic average locus chance individual heterozygous harry harris reported similar results humans previous work gel electrophoresis reports variation single loci give sense common variation lewontin hubbys paper also discussed possible explanation high levels variability either balancing selection neutral mutation martin kreitman later pioneering survey populationlevel variability dna sequences phd student lewontins landmark paper published lewontin identified variation within human populations found within local geographic groups differences attributable race groups defined study minor part human genetic variability paper w f edwards criticized lewontins conclusion race invalid taxonomic construct terming lewontins fallacy showed probability racial misclassification individual based variation single genetic locus approximately misclassification probability becomes close zero enough loci appears majority genetic variation found within groups single locus used reverse true analyzing multiplicity loci edwards paper commented jonathan marks argued point theory race discover large clusters people principally homogeneous within heterogeneous contrasting groups lewontins analysis shows groups exist human species edwards critique contradict lewontin alexander agassiz research professor harvard worked great influence many philosophers biology including william c wimsatt elliott sober philip kitcher elisabeth lloyd peter godfreysmith sahotra sarkar robert brandon often inviting work lab since lewontin listed advisory council national center science e wilsons book sociobiology proposed evolutionary explanations human social behaviors biologists including lewontin harvard colleagues stephen jay gould ruth hubbard responded negatively robert trivers called accusations coming eminent biologists intellectually weak lewontin gould introduced term spandrel evolutionary biology inspired architectural term spandrel influential paper spandrels san marco panglossian paradigm critique adaptationist programme spandrels described features organism exist necessary consequence perhaps adaptive features directly improve fitness thus necessarily relative frequency spandrels versus adaptations continues stir controversy evolutionary biology lewontin early proponent hierarchy levels selection article units selection major influence philosophers biology notably william c wimsatt taught lewontin richard levins university chicago robert brandon elisabeth lloyd studied lewontin graduate students philip kitcher elliott sober sahotra sarkar lewontin briefly argued historical nature biological causality nature probable organism environment scientia popular form last chapter biology ideology lewontin argued traditional darwinism portrayed organism passive recipient environmental influences correct understanding emphasize organism active constructor environment niches preformed empty receptacles organisms inserted defined created organisms organismenvironment relationship reciprocal dialectical w feldman developed lewontins conception detailed models term niche construction adaptationist view evolution organism function organism environment environment function environment seen autonomous unshaped organism lewontin instead believed constructivist view organism function organism environment environment function organism environment well means organism shapes environment environment shapes organism organism shapes environment future lewontin criticized traditional neodarwinian approaches adaptation article adaptation italian enciclopedia einaudi modified version scientific american emphasized need give engineering characterization adaptation separate measurement number offspring rather simply assuming organs organisms adaptive lewontin said general technical criticism adaptationism grew recognition fallacies sociobiology reflect fundamentally flawed assumptions adaptiveness traits much modern evolutionary synthesis lewontin accused neodarwinists telling justso stories try show natural selection explains novelties longnecked along others gould lewontin persistent critic themes neodarwinism specifically criticized proponents sociobiology evolutionary psychology edward wilson richard dawkins attempt explain animal behaviour social structures terms evolutionary advantage strategy others criticize approach applied humans sees genetic determinism writing lewontin suggests nuanced view evolution needed requires careful understanding context whole organism well concerns viewed oversimplification genetics led lewontin frequent participant debates active life public intellectual lectured widely promote views evolutionary biology science book genes coauthored steven rose leon j kamin numerous articles lewontin questioned much claimed heritability human behavioral traits intelligence measured iq testscitation needed academics criticized rejecting sociobiology nonscientific reasons edward wilson suggested lewontins political beliefs affected scientific view others kitcher countered lewontins criticisms sociobiology genuine scientific concerns discipline wrote attacking lewontins motives amounts ad hominem argumentcitation needed
