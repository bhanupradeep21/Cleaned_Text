dysprosody may manifest pseudoforeign accent syndrome refers disorder one prosodic functions either compromised prosody refers variations melody intonation pauses stresses intensity vocal quality accents result prosody wide array functions including expression linguistic attitudinal pragmatic affective personal levels people diagnosed dysprosody commonly experience difficulties pitch timing people diagnosed condition comprehend language vocalize intend say however able control way words come mouths since dysprosody rarest neurological speech disorder discoveredcitation needed much conclusively known understood disorder obvious expression dysprosody person starts speaking accent speaking foreign accent one type dysprosody condition also manifest ways changes pitch volume rhythm speech still unclear damage brain causes disruption prosodic function form effective treatment developed dysprosody speech therapy dysprosody characterized alterations intensity timing utterance segments rhythm cadency intonation differences cause person lose characteristics particular individual speech individuals personality sensory comprehension motor skills intelligence remain intact grammar well vocal emotional capacity affected prosodic control essential speech delivery establishes vocal identity since individuals voice unique characteristics two types dysprosody linguistic emotional present slightly different symptoms possible one present forms dysprosodycitation needed dysprosody works linguistic level specifies intent ones speech example prosody responsible verbal variations interrogative versus declarative statements serious versus sarcastic remarks linguistic dysprosody refers diminished ability verbally convey aspects sentence structure placing stress certain words emphasis using patterns intonation reveal structure intention utterance example individuals linguistic dysprosody may difficulty distinguishing production interrogative declarative sentences switching leaving expected rising falling shift thus linguistic dysprosody alters individuals vocal identity impairs verbal communicationcitation needed emotional dysprosody deals persons ability express emotions speech well ability understand emotion someone elses speech whenever speak whether realize nonverbal aspects speech reveal information feelings attitude strong evidence dysprosody affect ability express emotion however severity may vary depending part brain damaged studies shown ability express emotional information dependent motor perceptual neurobehavioral functions working together specific person dysprosody would able accurately convey emotion vocally pitch melody make conclusion another persons feeling regardless inability vocally express feeling prosodic controls emotions still formed felt individual since many different factors contribute emotional understanding speech makes much complicated experiencing brain injury people may begin speaking accent native country origin discussed preceding sections common forms dysprosody consist alterations vocal pitch timing rhythm control necessarily resulting foreignsounding addition cases seizures began develop patients decisive conclusions connecting dysprosody seizure activity made dysprosody last differing durations months years although reason seems unclearcitation needed several different types dysprosody classified common types dysprosody associated dysarthria developmental coordination disorder affect motor processing speech among studied types also emotional mental side effects dysprosody individual distinct voice characterized prosodic elements person loses control timing pitch melody etc speech also feel sense loss personal identity sometimes lead dysprosody usually attributed neurological damage brain tumors brain trauma brain vascular damage stroke severe head injury better understand causes condition cases dysprosody diagnosed examined closely found majority developed dysprosody cerebrovascular accident another cases developed head trauma study patients female male however conclusive evidence gender affects onset dysprosody evidence ethnicity age genetics impact development another reported case patient presented dysprosody interesting circumstances patient underwent surgery correct reinkes edema originates vocal folds larynx surgery however began speaking foreign german accent neurological examinations carried patient magnetic resonance imaging results completely normal conclusion doctors could make surgery somehow changed patients vocal identification causing new voice pattern possible patient lack oxygen brain surgery would gone undetected resonance imaging causing although causes dysprosody due neurological damage case study shows causes necessarily neurologically basedcitation needed studies dysprosody first began diagnosis involved untrained ear determining impairments prosodic elements however time dysprosody studied closely concrete method diagnosis developed one diagnosis technique rating scale boston diagnostic aphasia examination exam subjective rating system volume loud normal soft voice normal whisper hoarse speech rate fast normal slow intonation rated scale one indicates sentence intonation four given sentence intonation limited abrupt pauses seven indicates normal intonationcitation needed also involved diagnostic evaluations contain productive comprehensive parts productive part patient asked say sentences certain instructions comprehension section patient asked listen sentences said answer questions stated order determine linguistic dysprosody patient asked read sentences either statement question using declarative interrogative intonations patient uses prosodic contours distinguish asking question saying statement recorded comprehension section evaluation clinician reads simple sentences either declarative interrogative intonation patient asked identify whether sentence question statement evaluation two parts determine patient linguistic dysprosody emotional dysprosody diagnosed patient state neutral sentence different emotions happy sad angry patients dysprosody able convey emotions well differentiate speech different emotions significantly comprehension part clinician say sentence specific emotional intonations patient must indicate correct techniques ultimately allow diagnosis dysprosody degree severity patient since discovery dysprosody scientists attempting declare particular area brain responsible prosodic control long believed right hemisphere brain responsible prosodic organization ultimately leading grossly oversimplified hemispheric model argued organization language centered left hemisphere parallels organization prosody right since release however studies given model substantial support scientists attributed major control temporal aspects prosody including rhythm timing left hemisphere brain hand pitch perception singing linguistics related emotion believed organized right hemisphere belief led development functional lateralization hypothesis stating dysprosody caused lesions either right left states left responsible acoustic temporal aspects prosody right responsible pitch hypothesis however also cause concern studies shown people left hemispheric damage exhibit prosodic deficiencies associated right hemisphere defined functional lateralization hypothesis vice also found damage medulla cerebellum basal ganglia may cause conclusions led scientists believe prosodic organization brain extremely complex attributed hemispheric divisions alone although well understood yetwhen studies identify prosodic organization brain continue primarily examination damaged brain areas patients dysprosody resulting vocal deficiencies addition dysprosody associated several conditions including parkinsons condition huntingtons condition gelastic epilepsy gelastic seizure behavioral disorders apathy akinesia aboulia understanding disorders areas brain affected case key conducting studies dysprosody scientists continuing study patients hope creating concrete connections areas brain damage prosodic abnormalities hopefully someday lead full understanding prosodic organization parkinsons disease chronic neurodegenerative disorder involves loss dopaminergic neurons brain common symptoms parkinsons disease tremors rigidity bradykinesia postural instability dysprosody also common common characteristic feature dysprosody parkinsons monopitch inability vary pitch several studies performed investigating link parkinsons dysprosody concluded patients parkinsons disease tend struggle specific areas prosody less able produce loudness pitch rhythm patterns required expressing certain emotions general voice modulations needed express strong emotions particularly difficult patients parkinsons disease abnormal pauses speech also characteristic parkinsonian dysprosody including pauses general speech intraword pauses decrease speech rate also observed parkinsons demonstration deficits producing understanding emotional information modalities speech prosody eg facial gestural individuals parkinsons disease well individuals disorders affecting basal ganglia circuitry providing increasing evidence additional nonmotorically based dimension underlying prosodic metaanalysis examining almost individuals parkinsons disease reported robust link parkinsons disease deficits recognizing emotion voice facial studies also shown progression dysprosody time patients parkinsons disease abnormalities speech rate pauses variation range speech become worse condition degradation prosody parkinsons disease time independent motor control issues thus separate aspects studies shown treatment parkinsons disease help dysprosody symptoms however usually improvement pitch control volume emotional aspects condition treatments include medications ldopa well electrophysiological neurological conditions autism spectrum disorder several psychiatric conditions clinical depression schizophrenia characterized distinctive prosodic several studies found atypical neural processing expressive dysprosody individuals diagnosed autism spectrum effective course treatment dysprosody speech therapy first step therapy practice drills consist repeating phrases using different prosodic contours pitch timing intonation typically clinician say either syllables words phrases nonsensical sentences certain prosodic contours patient repeats prosodic contours treatment following lines principles motor learning pml found improve production lexical stress patient able effectively complete drill start advanced forms speech therapy upon completion therapy people identify prosodic cues natural situations normal conversation speech therapy proven effective linguistic dysprosody therapy emotional dysprosody requires much effort always successful one way people learn cope emotional dysprosody explicitly state emotions rather relying prosodic time also cases people dysprosody gaining native accent back course since part brain responsible dysprosody definitely discovered mechanism brain processes cause dysprosody found much treatment condition means medication past decade research dysprosody begun focus relationship common conditions parkinsons condition scientists believe studying connections dysprosody better understood conditions may help pinpoint specific areas brain responsible recent research looked development dysprosody connection parkinsons condition looking voice speech issues also effects cognitivelinguistic prosody perception first documented occurrence dysprosody described pierre marie french neurologist marie described case frenchman started speaking alsatian accent cerebrovascular accident caused right next documented report dysprosody occurred arnold pick german neurologist noticed czechoslovak started speaking polish accent following stroke picks patient also right hemiparesis lesser version hemiplegia aphasia stroke pick noticed accent altered timing speech slower patient spoke uncharacteristic grammatical mistakes pick later wanted follow research able since patient died autopsy well documented account dysprosody g h monradkrohn woman astrid l norway hit shell fragment air raid left frontal bone leaving brain unconscious four
