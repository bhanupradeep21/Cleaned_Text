shortest third longest unlike known dinosaurs long pointed wrist bone known styliform element exceeding third finger ulna length extended backward forelimb bones styliform adaptation help support membrane may newly evolved wrist bone calcified rod cartilage slightly curved tapered outer known specimen yi qi preserved heavy covering feathers unusually based classification advanced theropod clade pennaraptora group containing theropods advanced birdlike feathers feathers simple structure paintbrushlike long quilllike bases topped sprays thinner filaments structures rather feathers covered body starting near tip snout head neck feathers long formed thick coat body feathers even longer denser making difficult scientists study detailed structure longest feathers length six centimetres present behind upper arm shinbone metatarsus foot feather covering small patches wrinkled skin also preserved fingers styliform bone indicating unlike known dinosaurs planes yi qi formed skin membrane rather flight membrane stretched shorter fingers elongated third finger styliform bone possibly connected torso though inner part wing membrane preserved known would given animal appearance similar modern bats example convergent however bats membrane stretches fingers styliform wrist bone present ossified styliform bones found however wings modern gliding animals like flying squirrels greater glider prehistoric gliding rodent eomys quercyi also similarly long cartilaginous styliform twelve positions fossil checked electron microscope presence melanosomes pigmentbearing organelles nine feather locations showed eumelanosomes head feathers also phaeomelanosomes present membranes one observation positive result phaeomelanosomes eumelanosomes calf feathers exceptionally yi placed scansoriopterygidae group maniraptoran theropods cladistic analysis failed resolve exact relationships known scansoriopterygids epidendrosaurus epidexipteryx analysis scansoriopterygidae recovered basal clade yi qi presumably scansoriopterygids possessed type wing unknown among prehistoric bird relatives unlike paravian dinosaurs seem replaced birdlike feathers membranous wings may one many independent evolutionary experiments flight close origin birds membranous wings yi qi unique among dinosaurs difficult interpret arm could principle function wing shown longer already elongated hindlimb sufficient thickness long bones also hard explain styliform element outside flight context presence long styliform bone adding support membrane found animals glide suggests yi qi specialized gliding flight possible form flapping flight also used animal lack evidence large pectoral deltopectoral crest humerus cumbersome nature styliform make likely yi qi exclusive glider best researchers conducted initial study known yi specimen concluded mode flight considered authors proposed three main models wing configuration bat model styliform element would pointed straight rear membrane connecting styliform torso would resulted broad wing variant bat model might pterosaur model styliform bone would directed obliquely outside narrower wing result second main possibility maniraptor model styliform element pointing towards body reinforcing trailing edge narrow membrane possibly widened feathers top underside sticking last configuration would frog model styliform bone enlarging membranous hand plane like used flying frogs last case membrane would formed inner wing possibly arm feathers would generated preliminary analysis made flight characteristics bat model maniraptor model models assumed wingspan sixty centimetres narrow wing maniraptor model would resulted sq wing surface wing loading lbsq ft broad bat model wing values would sq lbsq ft respectively cases wing loading well critical lbsq ft upper limit bird flight maniraptor model loading typical ducks though relatively larger wingspan lower aspect ratio bat model loading typical shore birds though wingspan much larger aspect ratio contrary higher problem hypothesis yi specialised gliding flight resides fact forelimb wing instead gliding skin along torso gliders center mass seems behind control main lift surfaces causing flight instability problem might lessened short fleshy tail long tail feathers known relative epidexipteryx stability might also improved flapping movements wings modern analogue kākāpō likewise glides trees also flaps control alexander dececchi colleagues found though yi scansoriopterygids gliding arboreal animals notorious deficiencies flapping behaviors wair wingassisted incline running takingoff ground compared small paravians similar gliding abilities nearlysized mammalian gliders bats results suggest scansoriopterygids might specialized maniraptorans mainly closed forests high glide speed average glide ratios would efficient travelling across small gaps canopy longer flights would less efficient higher predation risks poor gliding abilities scansoriopterygids like yi ambopteryx along difficulty takeoff would made highly susceptible outcompeted capable aerial vertebrates moreover likely specialist lifestyle may contributed known yi qi fossil found rocks assigned tiaojishan formation dating callovianoxfordian age middlelate dated approximately million years formation around age known scansoriopterygids epidexipteryx scansoriopteryx ecosystem preserved tiaojishan formation forest dominated bennettitales ginkgo trees conifers leptosporangiate ferns forests surrounded large lakes shadow active volcanoes ash responsible remarkable preservation many fossils based tiajishans plant life climate would subtropical temperate warm vertebrate fossils found rock quarry yi qi would close contemporaries included salamanders like chunerpeton tianyiensis flying pterosaurs changchengopterus pani dendrorhynchoides mutoudengensis qinglongopterus guoi dinosaurs like tianyulong confuciusi basal birds like anchiornis huxleyi caihong
