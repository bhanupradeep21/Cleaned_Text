cooperative hunting also documented birds large marine vertebrates groupers moray cooperative hunting linked social organization animal species evolution sociality thus provides unique perspective study group nonavian theropod dinosaurs may displayed pack understanding cooperative hunting could evolve requires considering circumstances would make beneficial ecologists craig packer lore ruttan surveyed documented instances cooperative hunting make gametheoretical model explain circumstances cooperative hunting might evolve model individuals engage one four hunting strategies certain efficiency based size number prey captured model shows cooperative hunting single large prey evolutionarily stable strategy strategy individual adopts failure reduces solitary hunting much less efficient usually due prey species large taken single individual predator meaning hunting efficiency low hunting cost high case increased benefit hunting efficiency cooperation must compensate division available meat among cooperators furthermore cooperatively hunting groups prone invasion cheaters scavengers avoid drawbacks hunting added benefit cooperative hunting must also outweigh costs otherwise cheating scavenging also evolutionarily stable strategies proportion strategies increases larger groups since certain number individuals required help make kill allowing others directly benefit without participating species hunts single prey small enough monopolized individual cooperative hunting rarely ever ess since group members essence compete single meal unless individual preytracking captureefficiency extremely low solitary hunting always dominant strategy since solitaries dont share kill cheaters scavengers never prosper situation since original captor monopolizes food model predicts way cooperative hunting ess single small prey predators already constrained live must share get order keep group hand cooperative hunting always ess attacking multiple prey large small cooperators longer pay costs dividing meat make kill another benefit prey sufficiently large shared among cooperators one member unable make kill moreover cheaters scavengers well hunting costs high since forgo chance get prey parts model cooperative hunting always favorable long form increase net efficiency solitary hunting however body research packer ruttan found instances clear advantage

suggest social living chimps may necessary prerequisite evolution cooperative hunting instead distribution resources critical determining factor distribution prey species often determining factor whether populations hunt cooperatively prey abundant throughout habitat cooperative hunting effective solitary hunters easily find food share kill case arises prey small enough captured individual contrast patches prey focused small areas habitat predators likely live groups coordinate large attacks kill strategy illustrates importance group living establishing cooperative hunting efforts respect cooperative hunting function species also environment consequentially cooperative hunting likely evolved areas scarce prey distribution patterns behavior likely vary seasonal fluctuation available even species normally exhibit solitary hunting behavior shown engage cooperative hunting distribution prey makes difficult solitary hunters successful example aplomado falcons individuals generally hunt alone searching insects hunts simple insects easy find however aplomado falcons generally hunt cooperatively targeting smaller rodents birds hunts lengthy require highspeed chases thus switch hunting cooperatively often depends upon resource distribution certain resources distributed way supports group living populations may develop social groups cooperative hunting often major feature groups theorizedby primary basis evolution sociality order quotation verify alternate theories concluded cooperative hunting may important factor sociality territorysharing mutual protection offspring still agree plays important role developing social example result cooperative hunting aplomado falcons defend nest together share food offspring cooperative hunting thus proven hold certain social groups together since disadvantageous hunt alone particular situations future research may quantify contribution cooperative hunting evolution sociality currently difficult ascertain much cooperative hunting cause consequence social behavior environment allows cooperative hunting offer species range adaptive advantages normally available solitary hunting two main goals cooperative hunting social carnivores taking large prey species coordinated effort subsequently protecting kill common goal cooperatively hunting pairs coordinate separation mother offspring facilitating easier kill solitary hunter could make cooperative hunting also important species prey larger animals african hunting dogs allows make kill safer efficient manner kill made hunters restrict meat access involved hunt protect food scavengers includes strictly scavenging species members species participate hunt ways cooperative hunting confers adaptive advantages affording species means make efficient kills ensuring get maximum amount food possible kill another advantage cooperative hunting attacking group allows opportunities make kill prey scatters gets also potential confuse prey species may run another hunter approaching different direction group attacks particularly advantageous prey live concentrated groups hunters hard time tracking prey territories outside preferred habitat higher success prey capture demonstrated wild bottlenose dolphins falcons fossa due cooperative hunting example aplomado falcons increase efficiency capture hunting pairs pairs twice successful hunting result high overall success rate cooperative hunting leads higher per capita meat intake even large many populations capable forming cooperative hunting groups may necessarily group small large behavior favorable group size important indicator specific instances cooperative hunting prey must large enough hunting group small enough provide enough food individuals another important consideration groups grow larger greater chance individuals engage cheater strategy consistently much cheating group individuals prefer hunt alone share meal freeloaders may costs set upper limit group net benefits increase function pack size animals group theoretically able obtain meat however african wild dogs researchers found common group size group size maximized net instead larger packs must travel farther get food travelling costs associated larger groups thus african wild dogs optimize appropriate currency amount meat gained per dog per kilometer traveled instead amount meat gained per dog per day latter take account costs hunting research successfully demonstrates varying ecological variables responsible difference optimum group size among cooperatively hunting animals division labor team member performing subtask complete objective found many species shown animals forage hunt cooperatively groups often adopt specialized roles hunting event vary widely among different species division labor among cooperatively hunting species occurs along continuum ranging species individuals never differentiate specific roles species individuals specialize different roles always perform throughout lifetime african wild dogs participate intense rally ceremony hunting function ensure members alert ready hunt trot together participate chase pursue harass prey instead immediately attacking prey could result small prey immediately fleeing large prey forming defensive pinwheel charging dogs form defensive formation despite coordinated formation clear role specialization species
