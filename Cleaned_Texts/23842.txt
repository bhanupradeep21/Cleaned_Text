reactive inhibition phrase coined clark l hull book titled principles behavior defined whenever reaction evoked organism left condition state acts primary negative motivation innate capacity produce cessation activity produced state reactive inhibition typically studied context drive reduction hull likens fatigue humans become tired time thus less accurate precise within given significant debate whether process reactive inhibition due fatigue process nevertheless factor researchers need consider analyses sustained performance due possible role results analysis hull goes explain decay performance use decay formula estimate rate performance deterioration hull explains dissipates exponentially time passage time since formation ir spontaneously dissipates approximately simple decay function time elapsed ie hulls decay formula somewhat awkward might give rise confusion example ir refer derivative ir convenient way writing formula would follows b ln displaystyle displaystyle inhibition beginning time interval note one takes natural logarithm sides one obtains ln displaystyle ytln ln displaystyle last formula used inhibition reactive inhibition distinct proactive inhibition reactive inhibition occurs initial response activated set carried contrast proactive inhibition determines whether response process activated future occurs initial reactive inhibition considered bottomup processing process associated lower level mechanisms inhibition whereas proactive inhibition considered topdown processing dealing higher level mechanisms reactive inhibition may important everyday life process decline performance detrimental driving car rush example kathaus washcer getzmann found older adults showed tendency towards reactive inhibition determined electroencephalography measures showed higher driving lane variability impairment although older adults matched younger adults lane keeping abilities unable change lanes effectively relied reactive another study also revolving around younger vs older adults realm inhibition found older adults decreased reactive inhibition sustain proactive inhibition overall using smart phone app participants played game two apples falling either side tree tap either apple press one apples apple turned brown rotten similar stop signal task described trials primed person expect change others found decreased ability older adults inhibit action primed thus indicating deficit reactive researchers also studied reactive inhibition within context commonly accepted decreased inhibition abilities prominent aspect symptoms associated within context stop signal task studies point inability switch attention signal switches go signal stop compared environmental changes world proven reactive inhibition particular affected individuals adhd related adhd symptoms may even impact proactive inhibition ability inhibit impact children learning abilities lack reactive inhibition present many learning reactive inhibition also related repetition performance including learning example torok et al recorded learning capabilities adults using alternating serial reaction time test results showed reactive inhibition profound effect performance specifically showed significantly learning occurred perceived end task reactive inhibition effected individual time concluded reactive inhibition may affect one rate learning due causes progressive decline within task stated feature performance within participants thus playing significant role results findings caused researchers question existing psychological example rickard pan albarrac√≠n present evidence even well accepted psychological findings memory consolidation sleep may increase memory supposedly occurs sleep may due reactive inhibition may existed end learning sleeping occurred thus caused seemingly lower memory scores reactive inhibition often recognized factor performance learning based experiments thus lead incorrect presence reactive inhibition result decreased performance time thus decrease level supposed learning tested later time however reactive inhibition present one may see true measures learning reactive inhibition within experimental settings commonly measured stopsignal task sst sst gosignal presented participant indicate complete action instances stopsignal also presented participant indicate abandon previously initiated action stop signal presented within hundreds milliseconds receiving go important within task stop signal reaction time indicates long takes reactive inhibition triggered thus action shorter times indicate person better reactive inhibition skills thus able quickly switch activation response abandoning goal reactive due simplicity sst modern researchers use make broader assumptions inhibition sst demands attention inhibition relatively low simple nature unlike many real life situations makes distrusting however sst thought indicative many reactive inhibition opposed addition reactive inhibition thought involve mechanisms context dependent generally amongst many conditions contexts changing original gosignal explicitly implicitly reactive inhibition negatively affected parkinsons people parkinson disease difficulty inhibiting behaviors proposed levels dopamine directly associated one ability inhibit proper inhibition believed successful desired level dopamine using simon task researchers showed inhibitory processes significantly depleted parkinson patients withdrawing medications thus experiencing low levels dopamine performance also depleted among high levels dopamine indicating ideal middle ground level dopamine reactive inhibition successful results suggest association dopamine levels reactive reactive inhibition appears related subthalamic nucleus stn particularly within active inhibition overriding behavior stn charge sending signal inhibit thalamocortical activation thus reaction causes gaba driven inhibitory signals sent thalamus inhibits although reactive inhibition supported early stn activity relative time responses proactive inhibition defined continuous stn one study also shown significant damage prefrontal cortex particularly right superior medial frontal region result lack inhibitory control particular region damaged patients relied last second reactive inhibition avoid performing inappropriate
