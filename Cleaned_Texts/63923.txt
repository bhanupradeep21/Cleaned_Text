published results two experiments explored late positivity presented subjects either cue indicated whether following stimulus would click flash cue required subjects guess whether following stimulus would click flash found subjects required guess following stimulus would amplitude late positive larger knew stimulus would second experiment presented two cue types one cue chance following stimulus would click chance following stimulus would flash second cue type probabilities reverse first found amplitude positive complex larger response less probable stimuli one chance appearing another important finding studies late positive complex observed clicks flashes indicating physical type stimulus auditory visual matter later studies published sutton colleagues subjects guess whether would
