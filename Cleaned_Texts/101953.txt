dentistry debridement refers removal dental cleaning accumulations plaque calculus tartar order maintain dental debridement may performed using ultrasonic instruments fracture calculus thereby facilitating removal well hand tools including periodontal scaler curettes use chemicals hydrogen peroxide dental debridement procedure plaque calculus tartar accumulated teeth debridement may performed process personal professional teeth cleaning professional debridement techniques include use ultrasonic instruments fracture calculus thereby facilitating removal well use hand tools including periodontal scaler curettescitation needed debridement may also performed using saline solutioncitation needed periodontal pockets periodontal pocket formed disease process defined apical extension gingiva resulting detachment periodontal ligament pdl ligament attaches root tooth supporting alveolar bone ligament allows occlusal force absorption plaque accumulates within pocket initiating inflammatory response due increased number spirochetes different types bacteria make dental plaque cases aggressive periodontitis three major species bacteria identified within periodontal pocket bacteria include porphyromonas gingivalis prevotella intermedia actinobacillus healthy gingiva consists microorganisms mostly coccoid cells straight rods diseased gingiva consists increased numbers spirochetes mobile rods interactions plaque host inflammatory response determine alterations pocket bacterial plaque initiates nonspecific host inflammatory response intention eliminating necrotic cells harmful bacteria process cytokines proteinases prostaglandins produced cause damage kill healthy tissues macrophages fibroblasts neutrophiles epithelial exposure connective tissue blood capillaries allows microorganisms gain entryway circulation suppresses host protection mechanisms leading destruction periodontal pockets may occur either coronal swelling apical migration pockets occur due coronal swelling clinical attachment loss considered pseudopockets two types periodontal pockets determined type bone loss present suprabony pocket occurs horizontal bone loss bottom pocket coronal alveolar bone infrabony pocket occurs vertical bone loss bottom pocket apical alveolar clinical signs periodontal pockets include bluishred thickened gingiva gingival bleeding localized pain cases exudate periodontal pockets cause loosening loss dentition due destruction supporting tissues including alveolar bone pdl gingival tissue clinical diagnosis periodontal pockets achieved full mouth periodontal probing performed dentist dental treatment periodontal pocketing requires professional home intervention home treatment periodontal pockets include meticulous routine plaque removal brushing interproximal cleaning professional treatment includes routine dental visits debridement scaling root planing clinical treatment goals set control inflammatory disease removal coronal subgingival plaque containing destructive pathogens consistent complete removal biofilm infection arrested healthy periodontium another major risk factor periodontal pocket smoking affects severity prevalence pockets tobacco cessation necessary intervention motivate patients quit smoking achieve periodontal smoking also delays healing process debridement scaling root planing adequate home care completed healing periodontal pockets shown reduction pocket depth although pocket depths reduced decreasing inflammation important note large changes occur two ways periodontal pocket reduction occur either nonsurgical periodontal therapy nspt surgical periodontal therapy nspt includes limited initial debridement scaling root planing antibiotic treatment oral health education periodontal pocket depths controlled maintained nspt reevaluation appointment surgical periodontal therapy surgical periodontal therapy creates stable maintainable environment patient eliminating pathological changes pockets overall purpose surgical therapy eliminate pathogenic plaque pocket walls get stable easily maintainable state promote periodontal periodontal scalers professional periodontal therapy includes initial debridement scaling root planing specific periodontal instruments instruments include files curettes fives mini fives used mechanical debridement shank periodontal instruments either rigid works better heavy tenacious calculus flexible fine tuning light periodontal files used crush larger tenacious deposits prepare debridement scaler curette ultrasonic scalers series blades base therefore suitable root planing fine universal curettes doubleended instruments paired mirror working ends rounded toe instruments used surfaces tooth including root surfaces periodontal gracey curettes stronger rigid shank angulated working blades area specific best subgingival scaling root planing offset blade allowing greater fives similar graceys except extended shank allow extension deeper pockets also thinner blade heavy tenacious mini fives modification fives blades half length allow easier insertion adaptation deep pockets furcations developmental grooves line angles also contribute reduction tissue ultrasonic scalers move elliptical motion cutting edge operate frequency cycles per second use magnetostrictive piezoelectric technology thus helping remove plaque calculus
