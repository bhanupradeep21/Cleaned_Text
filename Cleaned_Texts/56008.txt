valley networks branching networks valleys mars superficially resemble terrestrial river drainage found mainly incised terrain martian southern highlands typically though always noachian age approximately four billion years old individual valleys typically less kilometers wide though may extend hundreds even thousands kilometers across martian surface form distribution implied evolution valley networks great importance may tell us history liquid water martian surface hence mars climate history authors argued properties networks demand hydrological cycle must active ancient though remains objections chiefly arise repeated results models martian paleoclimate suggesting high enough temperatures pressures sustain liquid water surface ever possible advent high resolution images

narrow km deep neither value changing consistently along lengths crosssectional form tends evolve vshaped headwaters ushaped lower reaches individual valleys form interconnected branching networks typically less km long draining local topographic form tributary valleys commonly described stubby similar term implying short lengths away trunk streams amphitheaterlike terminations many authors described drainage density networks typically much lower would seen though extent may artifact image resolution landscape degradation observer bias also raised however recent imagery also emphasized term valley network incorporates large variety different valley forms across number different scales different martian geological branched valley system scale smaller outflow channel termed valley network probably incorporating large variety geomorphological formation processes valley networks run km across martian landscape may change width downstream drainage densities match terrestrial narrower less deep valley networks present probably rare larger valley networks later aeolian processes deposited windblown sediments bottoms valleys obscuring nature channel must cut earth valley depression flat floor across migrates channel carries water discharge due later deposits mars however almost cases unclear whether valley floors contain individual channel structures whether fully inundated flow events nanedi valles rare example channel though new higher resolution imagery continues reveal structures accounts preference literature term valley network rather channel network though work tends confuse two interpretation valley networks strongly concentrated cratered southern uplands mars hesperianage lava plains northern hemisphere general almost entirely undissected however significant numbers exceptions generalization particular many hesperian younger volcanoes carry networks well several valleys also appear qualitatively fresher less degraded highlands eg nanedi vallis however finer scales distribution valleys present highly patchy discontinuous within highlands unusual find heavily dissected slopes immediately adjacent almost entirely unmodified surfaces valley catchment scales valleys also regionally clustered little dissection northwest arabia southwest southeast hellas much terra cimmeria south equator also much prominent steeper example crater rims may present one side unfortunately generally small size individual catchments relative narrowness constituent valleys means dating valley networks conventional crater counting techniques extremely difficult though concentration valleys noachianage southern highlands sparsity northern hesperian plains circumstantially combined independent estimates multiorder magnitude decrease global martian erosion rates end probably indicates networks cut early however channels hesperian surfaces unambiguously demonstrate valleyforming processes continue least locations least time noachian crater counting evidence even suggests highland networks may formed mechanisms implied environments formation valleys remain contentious processes diverse glaciation mass wasting faulting erosion wind lava invoked point formation networks may play important roles locally regions mars authors however agree liquid water must played role formation bulk valleys largely basis known widespread

summarized also worth emphasizing earth different formation mechanisms likely operate different times places surface mars august scientists reported valley networks southern highlands mars may formed mostly glaciers freeflowing rivers water indicating early mars colder thought extensive glaciation likely occurred scenario seeks describe formation valley networks without appeal conditions processes different already known exist mars today modeling indicates seeps groundwater could occur surface even modern conditions freeze quickly however suggestion ice cover could insulate water flowing beneath well enough allow longdistance transport associated erosion much like lava tube insulates molten lava inside valleys typically many features earth commonly though associated groundwater sapping instance amphitheaterlike headwalls constant valley width downstream flat ushaped floors steep however without recharge mechanism putative aquifers producing seepage ie hydrologic cycle kind extremely unlikely enough water could seep cut valleys formed noachian spite basic model may remain useful understanding limited valleys formed later hesperian models expand upon cold dry mars model envisioning mechanisms whereby subsurface aquifers providing groundwater might recharged early mars history thus require sustained water cycle sort long term noachian explicitly require water liquid fall precipitation means mars need warm ie freezing early history accordance current climate aquifers could recharged geological time scales sequence sublimation frozen seeps atmospheric circulation vapor southern polar ice cap redeposition onto cap basal melting ice mass groundwater circulation global scale mechanism appealing requires little conjecture radically different past climate fits well independent theories origins martian outflow channels chaos terrains major aquifer breaches however hydrostatic head supplied mechanism could feed numerous channels elevations greater base southern polar related model suggests locally generated heat could produce local scale groundwater seepage recharge either intrusive impact however version struggles explain longer larger valley networks water flows hundreds thousands kilometers away heat source ground frozen recharge possible many noachian valley networks features strongly indicative origin distributed precipitation branched networks valleys starting narrow crests vshaped cross profiles diffusional behavior hillslopes conversely using geomorphic evidence challenging build strong argument origin precipitation also provides straightforward recharge mechanism subsurface aquifers doubtlessly exist important cases earth precipitation may occurred rain snow subsequent melt ground either demands significantly humid thus warmer thicker atmosphere presently exists warmer wetter noachian also supported independent observations rock weathering rates noachianage crater lakes noachian geology lander sites chief difficulty
