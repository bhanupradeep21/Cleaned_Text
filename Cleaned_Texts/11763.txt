topical fluorides fluoridecontaining drugs indicated prevention treatment dental caries particularly childrens primary dentalprotecting property topical fluoride attributed multiple mechanisms action including promotion remineralization decalcified enamel inhibition cariogenic microbial metabolism dental plaque increase tooth resistance acid topical fluoride available variety dose forms example toothpaste mouth rinses varnish silver diamine dosage forms possess different absorption mechanisms consist different active common active ingredients include sodium fluoride stannous fluoride silver diamine ingredients account different pharmacokinetic profiles thereby varied dosing regimes therapeutic minority individuals may experience certain adverse effects including dermatological irritation hypersensitivity reactions neurotoxicity dental severe cases fluoride overdose may lead acute topical fluoride effective preventing dental caries used caution specific situations avoid undesired side topical fluoride formulations effective measures preventing arresting progression dental caries especially early childhood caries domestic products toothpaste mouthwash used regular basis home silver diamine solution therapy administered specialists dental topical fluoride serves prevent early dental caries primarily three ways promoting remineralization decalcified enamel inhibiting cariogenic microbial processes dental plaque increasing tooth resistance acid fluoride high tendency react calcium hydroxyapatite tooth enamel due high affinity subsequently replaces hydroxide group hydroxyapatite precipitate calcium fluorapatite fluorapatite precipitations scavenge excess phosphate calcium saliva form supersaturated solution topical fluoride also serves antimicrobial agent reduce demineralization inhibiting growth tootherupting microorganisms dental fluoride ions readily combine hydrogen cations produce hydrogen hydrogen fluoride subsequently acidifies bacterial cytoplasm inactivating essential enzymes bacterial metabolism including enolase proton releasing adenosine topical fluoride lowers ph bacteria consume energy maintain neutral environment leaving less energy reproduction generation polysaccharides polysaccharides necessary adherence enamel acids essential synthesis bacterial enzymes example immunoglobulin processes contribute reducing risk dental caries inhibiting microbial metabolism tooth topical fluoride increase resistance enamel bacteria enamel including streptococcus mutans generate acids maintain low ph environment acids eventually dissociate hydroxyapatite teeth acidity falls critical ph ph fluorapatite formed topical fluorides lower critical ph ph normal enamel therefore acid resistant prone degrade even acidic mechanism helps decelerate rate teeth daily use fluoridecontaining toothpaste recognized key factor contributing global reduction dental caries recent fluoridecontaining toothpaste classified two types namely lowfluoride highfluoride lowfluoride toothpaste depending brand generally contains fluorides often manufactured form sodium fluoride stannous fluoride sodium monofluorophosphate highfluoride toothpaste typically contains sodium fluoride namely four times concentrated lowfluoride people using highfluoride toothpaste avoid eating rinsing mouth least minutes treatment maximal therapeutic effectcitation needed fluoridecontaining toothpaste incorporates extra chemical ingredients additional instance calcium carbonate magnesium carbonate added abrasives remove dental plaque teeth strontium chloride potassium nitrate added antisensitive agents individuals teeth fluoride mouth rinse usually used adjunctive therapy topical fluoride generally prepared form sodium sodium chloride kept saliva spitting mouth rinse thus helping prevent tooth fluoride mouth rinse rinse commonly administered twice daily administered daily bedtime thoroughly brushing people using highfluoride

exposure fluoride may lead certain adverse side effects including dental fluorosis developmental rare side effects include skin rash hypersensitivity severe cases fluoride overdose may lead acute dental fluorosis dosedependent adverse drug effect featured temporary white induced increased fluoride exposure typically stannous fluoridecontaining products fluoridated excess intake fluoride leads overabundance structurallyweak fluorapatite formed inside enamel resulting increased brittleness severe dental fluorosis brown yellow staining may appear children age eight susceptible dental overdose fluoride potentially cause neurotoxicity early exact pathophysiology fluorideinduced developmental toxicity completely understood research suggested excessive fluoride intake may result formation aluminium fluoride aluminium fluoride structurally mimics phosphate thus capable crossing bloodbrain barrier via phosphate fluorides brain may cause neurodegenerative disorders including alzheimers disease parkinsons disease iq nevertheless topical fluoride less likely cause developmental neurotoxicity fluoridated fluoride overdose may cause acute underlying mechanism fluoride toxicity unclear studies ascribe fluoride toxicity capacity inhibit metalloproteins imitating metallofluoride inhibition metalloproteins slows multiple signalling pathways disrupts cellular organelles subsequently producing oxidative stress cell cycle fluoride overload suggested linked ph electrolyte imbalances creating environment unfavourable cell mechanisms ultimately result cellular malfunction cell
