donald h owings december april professor psychology faculty member animal behavior graduate group university california research focused ground squirrels particular interactions predators rattlesnakes generally concepts communication within elected fellow animal behavior received exemplar award mentoring graduate born atlanta georgia united states graduated bellaire high school houston texas earned ba degree university texas austin followed phd psychology university washington became faculty member university california davis department psychology research field animal behavior resulted election fellow animal behavior society received exemplar award mentor graduate students animal behavior connection award one former graduate students wrote wonderful working really could asked better advisor learned much grateful broadened understanding animal behavior let part truly fascinating research system great research parents markely j owings erin white owings married sharon calhoun owings son ragon daughter anna died home battling prostate cancer primary animal system investigating animal behavior social behavior communication antipredator counterantipredator behavior california ground squirrels snakes especially rattlesnakes adult california ground squirrels must defend avian mammalian predators also must defend pups especially predation rattlesnakes gopher snakes owings together students colleagues discovered number behavioral physiological defense mechanisms snakes ground squirrels encounter predator first response typically vocalize distinctly different ways aerial ground predators encounters snakes may elicit ground predator vocalization ground squirrels shift visual signaling tail tail flagging advantage harassing snakes deterring entering burrows squirrel pups disadvantage requiring close proximity snakes increasing likelihood snake bites response problem ground squirrels evolved capacity neutralize rattlesnake rattlesnakes evolved specialized sensory organs infraredsensitive pit organs enhance ability predate small mammals ability sense infrared set stage ground squirrels evolve antipredator counterinnovations take advantage specialized sensory organs rattlesnakes owings colleagues found ground squirrels shunt blood tails encountering rattlesnakes allows ground squirrels tail flag rattlesnakes even dark hot tails rattlesnakes detect infraredsensitive pit organs ground squirrels shunt blood tails encounter gopher snakes also feed young lack infraredsensitive pit research predatorprey interactions ground squirrels rattlesnakes led formulation new theoretical perspective communication called assessmentmanagement view communication perspective communication dependent sensory action systems individuals engaged communication information sent received individuals rather extracted others context ie gibsonian affordances extracted information assessed acted upon affordances individual extracts assesses depend sensory systems generally nature umwelt ie animals sensoryactions systems communication requires extraction information affordances presented individuals creates opportunity manipulate manage behavior others controlling affordances perceive example ground squirrels evolved ability shunt blood tails heats tails tailflag rattlesnakes perceive hot tails communication thus interindividual process extracting assessing information affordances actively managing affordances perceived others thereby managing behavior view communication selfinterested behavior shaped natural assessmentmanagement view communication general allowing intra interspecies communication also extended human communication encompass broader understanding human communication early development first form human communication occurs via human infant crying human infants helpless sensoryaction systems severely limited compared sensoryaction systems caregivers limited assessing needs much less managing caregivers assess manage needs infants lack direct access emotional needs infants eg hunger pain human infant crying highly salient normally activates assessment management systems caregivers directing crying infants successful caregivers assess needs crying infants act ways reduce needs eg feeding hungry infant noxiousness crying may factor cases child assessmentmanagement approach predictive malfunctions infantcaregiver communication example colic common technologically developed western countries may result decreased proximity caregiver infant decreased proximity result delayed responses caregivers crying infants resulting infants escalating crying subsequent development long bouts crying stop caregivers attempts manage distressed robosquirrel project stems directly owings longterm research interactions ground squirrels rattlesnakes together assessmentmanagement view robosquirrel developed test implication assessmentmanagement approach developing robotic squirrels could allow researchers precisely control affordances eg tail wagging tail heating presented rattlesnakes assessment affordances manage rattlesnake development robosquirrel received extensive coverage science popular also
