baroreflex baroreceptor reflex one bodys homeostatic mechanisms helps maintain blood pressure nearly constant levels baroreflex provides rapid negative feedback loop elevated blood pressure causes heart rate decrease decreased blood pressure decreases baroreflex activation causes heart rate increase restore blood pressure levels function sense pressure changes responding change tension arterial baroreflex begin act less duration cardiac cycle fractions second thus baroreflex adjustments key factors dealing postural hypotension tendency blood pressure decrease standing due gravity system relies specialized neurons known baroreceptors chiefly aortic arch carotid sinuses monitor changes blood pressure relay medulla oblongata baroreceptors stretch receptors respond pressure induced

nervous system parasympathetic neurons send axons heart parasympathetic activity slows cardiac pacemaking thus heart rate parasympathetic activity increased conditions elevated blood pressure parasympathetic nervous system primarily directed toward heartcitation needed baroreceptors stretchsensitive mechanoreceptors low pressures baroreceptors become inactive blood pressure rises carotid aortic sinuses distended resulting increased stretch therefore greater degree activation baroreceptors normal resting blood pressures many baroreceptors actively reporting blood pressure information

endresult baroreceptor activation inhibition sympathetic nervous system activation parasympathetic nervous systemcitation needed sympathetic parasympathetic branches autonomic nervous system opposing effects blood pressure sympathetic activation leads elevation total peripheral resistance cardiac output via increased contractility heart heart rate arterial vasoconstriction tends increase blood pressure conversely parasympathetic activation leads decreased cardiac output via decrease heart rate resulting tendency lower blood pressurecitation needed coupling sympathetic inhibition parasympathetic activation baroreflex maximizes blood pressure reduction sympathetic inhibition leads drop peripheral resistance parasympathetic activation leads depressed heart rate reflex bradycardia contractility combined effects dramatically decrease blood pressure similar manner sympathetic activation parasympathetic inhibition allows baroreflex elevate blood pressurecitation needed baroreceptor firing inhibitory effect sympathetic outflow sympathetic neurons fire different rates determines release norepinephrine onto cardiovascular targets norepinephrine constricts blood vessels increase blood pressure baroreceptors stretched due increased blood pressure firing rate increases turn decreases sympathetic outflow resulting reduced norepinephrine thus blood pressure blood
