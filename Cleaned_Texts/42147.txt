endotheliotropic herpesvirus eehv family herpesviruses known cause death young asian elephant calves wild captivity since north america eehv responsible deaths asian elephants captivity ages months

treatment guidelines recommend administering fluid therapy fresh plasma adult elephants antibodies virus antiviral drugs including famciclovir ganciclovir elephants treated severe eehv approximate survival study found north american zoos reported least one elephant foot abnormality reported least one elephant arthritis reported least one case lameness elephant populations within previous common foot problems among captive elephants include overgrown nails soles cuticles necrotic pododermatitis formation abscesses split nails though conditions usually cause mortality often reason captive facilities choose euthanize elephants due quality life many elephant facilities perform regular foot care hopes preventing serious chronic foot problems wild elephants feet worn elephants walk goal captive foot care simulate wearingdown elephants free contact protected contact facilities trained accept assist routine foot care including nail filing trimming foot elephants trained must anesthetized accept foot care brings element risk elephant handler common musculoskeletal problems include degenerative joint disease osteoarthritis trauma soft tissue due large body mass long life elephants thought especially prone problems relatively sedentary lifestyle captive elephant comparison wild counterparts likely contributes study north american zoos found predictors poor foot health included older age time spent hard floors less space nighttime enclosures high percentage time spent exhibits allowed choice indoors study found correlations poor musculoskeletal health time spent hard floors lack space daytime thought using soft sand floors providing access grass dirt sand outside giving elephants increased space day night enclosures avoiding large changes temperature humidity indoor outdoor spaces may improve foot musculoskeletal study north american zoos found zoo elephants overweight effects obesity elephants widely studied based research species may correlated higher
