versions donor mammals therefore different original mammals always true copy professor dan burk finds roslin opinion hardly model coherent judicial reasoning either terms regard supreme courts subject matter jurisprudence point insists dolly cloned sheep something found nature genetically identical mammals one finds wild rather mammals sheep propagate via sexual recombination typically renders genetically identical furthermore dolly born old sheep virtue inheriting mature set somatic cell chromosomes rather freshly recombined set germline chromosomes would accompany natural conception dolly
