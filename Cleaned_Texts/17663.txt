nipple pain common symptom pain nipple occurs women breastfeeding pain shows highest intensity third seventh day postpartum becomes severe third day nipple pain result many conditions early nipple pain breastfeeding usually caused improper positioning latch causes may include blocked milk ducts tonguetie cracked nipples nipple infections yeasts bacteria complications nursing women involve increase nipple sensitivity breast engorgement leading mastitis subsequent common diagnostic approaches include quantifying pain numerical rating scale nrs maternal breast infant mouth nipple pain may hinder common reason early general management positioning latch adjustment thermal intervention administered pain alleviation appropriate treatment nipple pain given based underlying cause causes nipple pain breastfeeding classified three factors physiological mechanical infectious interrelated possibly happen simultaneously physiological changes nursing women including unusual milk supply blocked milk ducts cause nipple breast oversupply breast milk caused overactive milk hence excess milk accumulates leading breast engorgement hand milk supply lowered prolonged breastfeeding high pumping overly vigorous breast blocked milk ducts refers lactiferous ducts blockage nipple pore deeper breast hampers adequate drainage milk causes breast mass engorgement redness nipple bleb subsequent cracked nipples including nipple blisters fissure increase nipple pain frequency intensity first week traumas may break skin integrity nipple serve routes infections common complication mastitis due bacterial poor positioning poor latching infants refers infants inappropriate fastening onto mothers nipple common cause early persistent nipple breastfeeding infants mouth plane mothers nipple infants ears shoulders hips parallel child grasp enough portion nipple areola mouth receive enough infant sip vigorously thus reduce blood flow ischemia nipple leads vasospasm blanched abnormal tongue motion infants commonly caused nipple infants given rubber nipple pacifier may sip maternal nipple rubber nipple tongue movements used breastfeeding bottlefeeding different infants use wavelike motion remove breast milk breastfeeding thrusting action latex nipple control milk flow infant pinches presses nipple gums creates large friction results nipple soreness tonguetie ankyloglossia tight frenulum refers abnormally short thick lingual hinders child curving tongue around hence infant drains insufficient breast milk rubs harder nipple causes nipple leads suboptimal weight gain babies mechanical nipple injuries associated nipple soreness pain congenital mouth abnormalities like cleft palate infants cause nipple increase risk nipple dermatitis nursing mothers diagnosed yeast bacterial viral infections dermatitis susceptible nipple pain type yeast infection called candidiasis caused type fungus called lead itching erythema nipple areola burning stabbing nipple happens infants mouth infected candida species called candida albicans child may transmit yeast mothers nipple bacterial infection staphylococcus aureus saureus give rise mastitis refers inflammation mammary half breastfeeding mothers reporting nipple ache infected usually experienced sudden onset systemic symptoms including nipple pain fever flulike symptoms myalgia risk infections increases inhibition mammary gland viral infection herpes simplex virus hsv causes nipple ulceration soreness infants feeding hsv infected nipple develop lifethreatening complication affecting brain called breastfeeding women dermatitis problems including psoriasis eczema nipple suffer erythema scaling lesion nursing mothers psoriasis may develop koebner phenomenon upon nipple abrasion infants prolonged eczema nipple caused direct chemical contact allergic affects areola sometimes extends diagnosis nipple pain breastfeeding divided three major parts measurement pain intensity physical examination breastfeeding mother infant identify cause pain study psychological impact pain breastfeeding woman acute chronic pain directly measured pain scales numerical rating scale nrs visual analog scale serial pain scale pain worst pain imaginable quantify pain also monitor symptom improvement nursing women experience persistent nipple pain least two weeks nipple pain symptom many possible causes thorough maternal breast infant mouth inspection help identify specific cause thus assign appropriate maternal nipple examination used diagnose traumatic factors including nipple fissure nipple blisters infections prominent breast biopsy detecting breast mass diagnose breast breast mass present core needle biopsy diagnostic imaging required assessment underlying including mastitis blocked milk ducts cancers benign breast tumours called lactating checking infant mouth causes like tonguetie candidiasis abnormal tongue motion nipple pain may lead psychological problems edinburg postpartum postnatal depression scale set ten questions commonly used assessing postpartum generally nipple pain levels reduce seven ten days constant nipple ache painkiller taken mothers relieve uncomfortableness general management applied time mainly positioning correction thermal intervention breast milk drainage prevent clinically proper positioning latch infants nipple resolve persistent nipple pain brought inefficient milk flow avoid nipple trauma fissure prevent breast mastitis allow efficient wound mothers place nipple asymmetrically top half infants hand continuation effective frequent breast milk drainage especially draining first milk production childbirth called prevent development mastitis common practices include manual expression pumping pressurerelief tools effective breast pumps lubricants used achieve goal successful draining prevent blockage milk addition moderating oversupply rapid flow breast milk effectively ameliorate painful pain severe drainage carried painkillers ibuprofen taken minimize nipple ache successful two types common thermal intervention nipple pain one warm compress another cold warm compress hot tea bag compress applied breast breastfeeding unblock blocked milk common practice solid lump blocks milk ducts resolved hours otherwise assessing possible causes nipple pain lactating adenoma malignancy also applied breast fissure sites vasodilation caused rise temperature allows oxygen nutrients help relieve pain boost wound applying cold compress resolve breast cold gel pack example slightly reduce nipple pain caused breast engorgement despite effect yet nipple pain resolved effectively general management appropriate treatment directed underlying causes nevertheless except general management mentioned common therapeutic practices treating nipple pain breastfeeding proven effective drugs treating nipple ache breastfeeding divided two categories based ways administration topical application oral medication table summarises common medicine taken patients eg guaiacguaiazulene effectively prevent breast eg mupirocin eg eg calendula officinalis marigold ziziphus jujuba jujube aloe vera mentha spicata portulaca eg dicloxacillin cephalexin penicillins three types nonmedical therapies namely shielding external protectors light therapy acupuncture bacterial invasion successfully blocked external protectors nipple nipple shield polyethylene film silver especially nipple impaired protectors create humid environment wound recovery defending bacterial silver cap consists silver natural agent antibacterial hence also less likely cause irritation light therapy including phototherapy lowintensity laser therapy treat nipple trauma range nm wavelength light therapy facilitates wound recovery promoting fibroblast proliferation collagen synthesis angiogenesis growth factor moreover stimulate tissue regeneration accelerate local blood flow rate vasodilation suppress inflammation increase fissure healing rate reduce pain recently many review articles suggested effectiveness acupuncture treating nipple pain showed considerable improvement treating breast cochrane review found number interventions somewhat effective hotcold packs guasha scraping therapy cabbage leaves proteolytic enzymes none evidence supported widespread minimally invasive surgical therapy called serial ultrasoundguided aspiration performed treat breast mastitis outpatient setting achieving better cosmetic postoperative side nipple pain caused tonguetie seek surgical therapy called frenotomy infants surgery frenulum tongue clipped improve latch remove restriction tongue hence breastfeeding efficiency however may instantly relieve nipple pain since infants probably developed uncommon tongue early effective breastfeeding minimize likelihood engorgement latch difficulties nipple trauma bacterial surface nipple breast pumps sterilized remove sources irritants breastfeeding pumping may help prevent yeast infections crosscontamination bacteria family ideally cleaning baby items mothers underwear like boiling disinfecting pacifiers diapers bras bathing equipment frequently prevent breastfeeding mothers hold infants correct breastfeeding position order prevent nipple pain brought poor nipple pain breastfeeding may affect family life mothers average mothers infants need make visits healthcare providers nipple pain first year leading huge household meanwhile mothers may shorten breastfeeding duration switch artificial infant milk order prevent suffering besides painful experience may affect relationship parents children mothers may develop depression tension mood disturbances httpsenwikipediaorgwikinipplepaininbreastfeeding
