great french wine blight severe blight century destroyed many vineyards france laid waste wine industry caused aphid originated north america carried across atlantic late actual genus aphid still debated although largely considered species daktulosphaira vitifoliae commonly known grape phylloxera france considered worst affected blight also great deal damage vineyards european countries phylloxera aphid introduced europe remains debated american vines taken europe many times reasons including experimentation trials grafting without consideration possibility introduction pestilence phylloxera thought arrived around first recorded france former province languedoc argued introduction pests phylloxera problem invention steamships allowed faster journey across ocean consequently allowed pests phylloxera survive trip eventually following julesémile planchons discovery phylloxera cause charles valentine rileys confirmation planchons theory leo laliman gaston bazille fr two french wine growers proposed european vines grafted resistant american rootstock susceptible phylloxera many french wine growers disliked idea many found option method proved effective remedy reconstitution termed many vineyards lost slow process eventually wine industry france able return relative normality aphid central source damage france first noted following growing european vine vitis vinifera french colonists century plantations failure later experiments related species vine also failed although reason failures appears mystery french colonists known today species north american grape phylloxera caused early vineyards fail venom injected phylloxera causes disease quickly fatal european varieties aphids initially went unnoticed colonists despite great numbers pressure successfully start vineyard america became common knowledge among settlers european vines vinifera variety simply would grow american soil resorted growing native american plants established plantations native vines exceptions exist vinifera plantations wellestablished california aphids found way several theories proposed phylloxera ignored possible cause disease resulted failure many vineyards involve feeding behaviour insect way attacks proboscis grape phylloxera venom canal injects deadly venom feeding tube takes vine sap nutrients toxin venom corrodes root structure vine sap pressure falls result phylloxera quickly withdraws feeding tube searches another source food thus anyone digging diseased dying vine find phylloxera clinging roots centuries europeans experimented american vines plants soil many varieties imported america without regulation disregarding possibility pest transfer related problems julesemile planchon french biologist identified phylloxera maintained transfer american vines plants europe greatly increased roughly accidentally introduced phylloxera europe around others say aphid enter france around advent steamships may factor faster sailing ships phylloxera better able survive shorter ocean first known documented instance attack phylloxera france village pujaut department gard former province wine makers notice aphids french colonists america noted mysterious blight damaging vines description disease given wine growers reminded distressingly blight quickly spread throughout france several years cause disease french grape vines vineyardsclarification needed devastated period late french economy badly hit blight many businesses lost wages wine industry cut less half also noticeable trend migration places algiers america production cheap raisins sugar wines caused domestic industry several problems threatened persist even blight damage french economy estimated slightly billion research cause disease began grape growers roquemaure near pujaut asked agricultural society montpellier society appointed committee including botanist jules émile planchon local grower felix sahut societys president gaston bazille sahut soon noticed roots dying vines infested sucking sap plants committee named new insect rhizaphis planchon consulted french entomologists victor antoine signoret jules lichtenstein planchons brotherinlaw signoret suggested renaming insect phylloxera vastatrix due similarity phylloxera quercus afflicted oak english entomologist john obadiah westwood suggested insect afflicted grape leaves england circa insect afflicting grape vines roots also lichtenstein suggested french insect american vine louse identified american entomologist asa fitch named pemphigus however problem suggestions french grape lice known infest vines roots whereas american grape lice known infest britishborn american entomologist charles valentine riley following news outbreak france sent signoret specimens american grape lice signoret concluded besieged paris francoprussian war indeed identical french grape meanwhile planchon lichtenstein found vines afflicted leaves lice transferred leaves roots healthy vines attached vines roots french grape lice also riley discovered american grape lice wintered american grape vines roots insects damaged albeit less case french vines riley repeated planchon lichtensteins experiment using american grape vines american grape lice similar thus identity french american grape lice proven nevertheless another three years powerful majority france argued phylloxera cause vine disease instead vines already sickly became infested phylloxera thus opinion phylloxera merely consequence true disease remained regardless riley discovered american grape varieties especially resistant phylloxera french farmers began import graft french vines onto american leo laliman suggested importing american vines early french farmers reluctant abandon traditional varieties gaston bazille proposed grafting traditional french vines onto american however importation american vines entirely solve problem american grape varieties struggled frances chalky soils succumbed trial error american vines found could tolerate chalky meanwhile entomologists worked unravel strange life cycle phylloxera project completed many growers resorted methods attempt resolve issue chemicals pesticides used avail desperation growers positioned toads vine others allowed poultry roam free hope would eat none methods successful charles valentine riley missouris state entomologist confirmed planchons theory leo laliman gaston bazille fr two french wine growers suggested possibility vinifera vines could combined means grafting aphidresistant american vines problem might solved thomas volney munson consulted provided native texan rootstocks grafting munsons role french government sent delegation denison texas confer french legion honor chevalier du mérite another viticulturist hermann jaeger neosho missouri pivotal rescue french vineyards well jaeger working missouri state entomologist george hussman already raised vines resistance pest indeed several

industries france jaeger awarded french legion honor chevalier légion grafting method tested proved process colloquially termed reconstitution french wine growers cure disease caused great division wine industry became known chemists rejected grafting solution persisted use pesticides chemicals became grafters known americanists wood following demonstrated success grafting immense task reconstituting majority frances vineyards began french government offered francs reward whoever could discover cure blight reportedly first suggest possibility using resistant american rootstock leo laliman tried claim money french government refused award rationale cured blight rather stopped occurring however may reasons government denying laliman prize mistrusted several notable partieswho thought many originally introduced still remedy phylloxera disease brings still poses substantial threat vineyard planted grafted one european grape vine known resistant phylloxera assyrtiko vine
