sampled specimen blocks course several expeditions largely led marcelo r sánchezvillagra small primitive animal known distinct dental anatomy one earliest primitive ornithischians fossil record taxonomic uncertainty led conflicting theories either base ornithischia base subgroup thyreophora either model dating around million years ago start jurassic existence equatorial latitudes primitive

though choice tooth type specimen uncommon dinosaur chosen due distinctive aspect anatomy abundant element sample unlikelihood teeth would different different parts mouth due uniformity known teeth anatomy like early members ornithischia assumed laquintasaura lithe bipedal animal largest femur among bonebed millimetres length used estimate body size animal based comparisons taxa assuming similar proportions similar primitive ornithischians hypsilophodon heterodontosaurus hexinlusaurus estimated laquintasaura individual around metre ft length individual question however subadult indicating species may gotten slightly larger adult indicated fragmentary elements less useful size estimation small size conservative skeletal anatomy indicates ornithischians beginning jurassic yet diversified extensively ancestral anatomical state later would group diverge larger specialized animals traits armor distinctive part anatomy laquintasaura found dentition numerous autapomorphies found therein teeth unusually long tapering central apex tooth crown forming isosceles triangular shape overall coarse denticles run along entire crown margin edge exposed tooth teeth laterally widest near apex

teeth position present diastema close premaxillomaxillary suture high number premaxillary teeth uncommon ornithischians outside members ankylosauria later members ornithischia would reduce premaxillary tooth count many didnt possess whatsoever high count laquintasaura elucidates basal state many teeth indicates dental anatomy primitive even compared early jurassic postcranial anatomy

diagnostic features numerous differences individual basal ornithischian taxa noted described detail supplementary material description histology bone microstructure specimens referred laquintasaura indicate secondarily reduced growth rates compared presumed ancestral state ornithischians similar small thyreophorans like scutellosaurus unlike lesothosaurus ornithopods marginocephalians however lack data primitive ornithischian histology well limited sample size available laquintasaura conclusions remain specifics phylogenetic relationships laquintasaura remains somewhat phylogenetic analyses well general anatomy demonstrate robustly basal member group ornithischia exact position within clade unresolved original description found large polytomy eocursor lesothosaurus stormbergia

formation traditionally unclear estimates variably placing anywhere permian cretaceous modern estimates tend find section containing laquintasaura bonebed dates near boundary triassic jurassic periods specifically start hettangian age around million years ago potentially little thousand years end triassic though uncertainty still old age makes laquintasaura one earliest known members ornithischia making important understanding early provides concrete evidence spread northern hemisphere start geographic placement equatorial region demonstrates dinosaur presence equatorial latitudes well regions role early dinosaur evolution something traditionally though genus presence soon endtriassic extinction indicates ornithischians achieved quick expansion diversity distribution conservative anatomy indicates increases body size anatomical specialization occur later ecosystem laquintasaura lived thought represent alluvial plain arid humid early theropod dinosaur tachiraptor would lived alongside laquintasaura likely preyed upon sauropod dinosaur perijasaurus also hails la quinta formation thought lived later time near end early jurassic around million years laquintasaura thought primarily herbivorous unusually tall structure teeth reminiscent carnivorous animals indicating may also eaten things like small insects part similar omnivorous behaviour suggested fellow primitive ornithischian well tentatively taxa like agilisaurus hypsilophodon orodromeus disappearing derived relatives like exact nature taphonomy laquintasaura bonebed remains incompletely studied remains thought undergone degree lowenergy transport lack damage bones signs things like plant root damage insect boring holes indicating remains exposed long time prior bonebed entirely devoid microfossils invertebrates plant remains palynologically barren animal found site scant remains indicates four individuals site likely died together maybe lived together life indicative social behaviour herding known ornithischians late jurassic cretaceous presence laquintasaura would first recognized early member group though recent research also indicated presence genus httpsenwikipediaorgwikilaquintasaura
