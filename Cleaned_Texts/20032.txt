gram stain gram staining grams method method staining used classify bacterial species two large groups grampositive bacteria gramnegative bacteria may also used diagnose fungal name comes danish bacteriologist hans christian gram developed technique gram staining differentiates bacteria chemical physical properties cell walls grampositive cells thick layer peptidoglycan cell wall retains primary stain crystal violet gramnegative cells thinner peptidoglycan layer allows crystal violet wash addition ethanol stained pink red commonly safranin fuchsine lugols iodine solution always added addition crystal violet strengthen bonds stain cell membrane gram staining almost always first step identification bacterial group gram staining valuable diagnostic tool clinical research settings bacteria definitively classified technique gives rise gramvariable gramindeterminate groups method named inventor danish scientist hans christian gram developed technique working carl friedl√§nder morgue city hospital berlin gram devised technique purpose distinguishing one type bacterium another make bacteria visible stained sections lung published method included short report observation typhus bacillus retain gram staining bacteriological laboratory used differentiate bacterial species two large groups grampositive gramnegative based physical properties cell needed gram staining also used diagnose fungal gram staining used classify archaea since microorganisms yield widely varying responses follow phylogenetic organisms gramvariable meaning may stain either negative positive stained either dye used gram technique seen modern environmental molecular microbiology lab identification done using genetic sequences molecular techniques far specific informative differential stainingcitation needed gram stains performed body fluid biopsy infection suspected gram stains yield results much quickly culturing especially important infection would make important difference patients treatment prognosis examples cerebrospinal fluid meningitis synovial fluid septic grampositive bacteria thick meshlike cell wall made peptidoglycan cell envelope result stained purple crystal violet whereas gramnegative bacteria thinner layer cell envelope retain purple stain counterstained pink safranin four basic steps gram stain crystal violet cv dissociates aqueous solutions cv chloride ions ions penetrate cell wall grampositive gramnegative cells cv ion interacts negatively charged components bacterial cells stains cells iodide interacts cv forms large complexes crystal violet iodine within inner outer layers cell iodine often referred mordant trapping agent prevents removal complex therefore colors decolorizer alcohol acetone added interacts lipids cell gramnegative cell loses outer lipopolysaccharide membrane inner peptidoglycan layer left exposed complexes washed gramnegative cell along outer contrast grampositive cell becomes dehydrated ethanol treatment large complexes become trapped within grampositive cell due multilayered nature decolorization step critical must timed correctly crystal violet stain removed grampositive negative cells decolorizing agent left long matter decolorization grampositive cell remains purple gramnegative cell loses purple counterstain usually positively charged safranin basic fuchsine applied last give decolorized gramnegative bacteria pink red grampositive bacteria gramnegative bacteria pick counterstain counterstain however unseen grampositive bacteria darker crystal violet stain grampositive bacteria generally single membrane monoderm surrounded thick peptidoglycan rule followed two phyla bacillota except classes mollicutes negativicutes contrast members chloroflexota green nonsulfur bacteria monoderms possess thin absent class dehalococcoidetes peptidoglycan stain negative positive indeterminate members deinococcota stain positive diderms thick historically grampositive forms made phylum firmicutes name used largest group includes many wellknown genera lactobacillus bacillus listeria staphylococcus streptococcus enterococcus also expanded include mollicutes bacteria mycoplasma thermoplasma lack cell walls gramstained derived bacteria cell walls particularly adept retaining stains appear positive gram stain even though closely related grampositive bacteria called acidfast bacteria differentiated grampositive bacteria special staining gramnegative bacteria generally possess thin layer peptidoglycan two membranes lipopolysaccharide lps abundant antigen cell surface gramnegative bacteria contributing outer membrane e coli bacterial phyla gramnegative including cyanobacteria green sulfur bacteria pseudomonadota exceptions members rickettsiales insectendosymbionts bacteria staining gram stain yield gramvariable pattern mix pink purple cells cultures bacillus butyrivibrio clostridium decrease peptidoglycan thickness growth coincides increase number cells stain addition bacteria stained using gram stain age culture may influence results gramindeterminate bacteria respond predictably gram staining therefore determined either grampositive gramnegative examples include many species mycobacterium including mycobacterium bovis mycobacterium leprae mycobacterium tuberculosis latter two causative agents leprosy tuberculosis bacteria genus mycoplasma lack cell wall around cell means stain grams method resistant antibiotics target cell wall term gram staining derived surname hans christian gram eponym gram therefore capitalized common noun stain usual scientific initial letters grampositive gramnegative eponymous adjectives either capital g lowercase g depending style guide governs document written lowercase style used us centers disease control prevention style regimens ama dictionaries may use uppercase grampositive gramnegative usage also common many scientific journal articles articles submitted journals journal may may apply house style postprint version preprint versions contain whichever style author happened use even style regimens use lowercase adjectives grampositive gramnegative still typically use capital gram stain
