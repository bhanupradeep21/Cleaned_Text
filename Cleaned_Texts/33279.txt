believed play role pathogenesis bronchiolitis common respiratory tract disease caused viral infectioncitation needed member cxc chemokine family genes encoding ten members cxc chemokine family form cluster region mapped chromosome primary cytokine involved recruitment neutrophils site damage infection process called chemotaxis number variables essential successful chemotaxis neutrophils including increased expression high affinity adhesion molecules secure neutrophil endothelium near affected site therefore washed away circulatory system neutrophil digest way basement membrane extracellular matrix ecm reach affected site plays key role inducing cell signalling necessary bring firstly site infection histamine release causes vasodilation capillaries near injured area slows blood flow region encourages leukocytes neutrophils come closer endothelium away centre lumen rate blood flow highest occurs weak interactions made selectins expressed neutrophil endothelial cells

surface stimulates cell signalling pathway mediated gcoupledproteinreceptor binding neutrophil stimulates neutrophils upregulate expression integrin takes part high affinity bonding receptors expressed endothelium expression affinity significantly increased maximise binding causes neutrophil slow stationary another key function cell signalling stimulated initiation oxidative burst process
