supreme court issued six different opinions unanimous decision majority opinion authored chief justice rehnquist joined justices oconnor scalia kennedy thomas justice oconnor wrote concurring opinion joined part justices ginsburg breyer justices stevens souter ginsburg breyer filed separate concurring opinions court began opinion stating new york law infringe upon fundamental right line reasoning court referenced san antonio school district v rodriguez us said relevant part judiciary must look constitution rather stated importance right determining whether right indeed fundamental new yorks ban infringe upon fundamental right respondents claiming right die fundamental court reiterated policy according laws great deal leeway courts words heller v doe us laws enacted new york entitled strong presumption validity addressing matter fundamental rights court delineated rationale behind decision first turned longstanding legal tradition looking persons intent way distinguishing two acts identical physical consequences example person accidentally kills pedestrian blinded sun might face punishment vehicular manslaughter person intentionally purposefully kills another car could punished murder two acts give results distinguished intent actors court applied standard intent matter hand finding doctor withdraws life support request patient intends respect patients wishes court said sharp contrast doctor honors patients request end life necessarily requires intent respect wishes namely requires intent kill patient major difference court determined two scenarios former may cause patient die underlying causes latter cause patient die hands physician effect court quoted house judiciary committee hearing stating physician performing assisted suicide must necessarily indubitably intend primarily patient made dead furthermore another repudiation respondents argument court noted patient removing life support might actually intend die death without device may certainty looking new yorks intent behind ban court noted law plainly recognized difference killing letting die also recognized state new york matter policy compelling interest forbidding assisted suicide allowing patient refuse life support simply act protecting commonlaw right right contrary court appeals view right hasten death rather court declared right retain bodily integrity preserve individual autonomy prevention unwanted touching court said legitimate right protect closing court said fully rejected respondents argument statutory difference assisted suicide refusing lifesaving treatment arbitrary irrational concede probably incidents two likely result also said argument beside point court declared new york obviously number legitimate compelling rational interests enacting ban however regardless reasons determined simply law permitted everyone refuse treatment prohibited everyone assisting suicide law run afoul equal protection clause state constitutional authority put law place justice oconnor joined courts decision accepted contention neither right commit suicide right die however think court needed consider conflict beyond rejecting facial challenges statute justice oconnor stated context questions presented case court need address whether patient constitutionally cognizable interest controlling circumstances imminent death statute claimed constitutional face state interests protecting truly competent facing imminent death whose decisions would genuinely voluntary gravity validate legislation pursuit interests said constitutional conflict patient free seek painrelieving medication doctor even risk health alleviate suffering constitutionally acceptable alternative permit absence legalized assisted suicide justice oconnor went say everyone face suffering kind loved one faith democratic process strike appropriate balance short law people new york decide justice stevens joined courts decision stated though issued separate opinion clarify belief possibility debate constitutional limitations states ability punish assisted suicide secondmost senior justice court chief justice rehnquist likely stevens would written opinion rehnquist elected much suggested length stevens concurrence runs several pages official format longer rehnquists opinion possible chief justice part persuaded exercise ability fact stevens concurrence offers less concrete view states ability regulate euthanasia majority justices seem support stevens notes court construed challenge statute one facial validity ie respondents asserted law invalid cases might applied type challenge noted difficult argue successfully challenger must show prohibited action constitutionally protected applied case court required demonstrated fourteenth amendment included right commit suicide right included right receive assistance stevens agreed court rejecting idea believing liberty defined due process clause didnt include right value others persons life far precious allow individual claim constitutional entitlement complete autonomy making decision end life spite however stevens said debate necessarily end noted supreme court found capital punishment constitutionally permissible later also said could potentially impermissibly cruel simply deciding certain statute outlawing assisted suicide constitutional mean every possible application would likewise stated believed state compelling interest preventing suicide prompted depression coercion however interest apply people competent make decisions coerced abused decision stevens also rejected argument raised petitioners permitting physicianassisted suicide would taint perception doctorpatient relationship cases argued doctors refusal hasten death could perceived act contrary doctors role healer cases believed relationship would hindered permitting doctor aid patients demise conclude opinion stevens stated agreed majority finding rationale decision well founded however drew distinction finding law generally acceptable finding acceptable cases agreeing principle noted could instances law unjustly infringed upon patients personal liberty justice souter issued short clarifying concurrence noting agreed ruling also stressing felt claims raised significant enough warrant justification cited concurrence washington v glucksberg us reiterating felt distinction permitted refusal treatment prohibited assisted suicide arbitrary one justice breyer issued joint concurrence case washington v glucksberg stated agreed distinction law made practices question justified rational however thought majority erred stating respondents asserted right commit suicide anothers assistance stating right choose ones manner death fundamental justice breyer felt would appropriate consider right die dignity regardless semantics breyers primary disagreement court belief need deemed whether right would fundamental believed could cases future similar yet substantially different circumstances court may forced reconsider terms used decision justice ginsburg also issued joint concurrence case washington v glucksberg stated reasoning largely mirrored used justice oconnor
