lemurosaurus genus extinct biarmosuchian therapsids late permian south generic epithet lemursaurus mix latin lemures ghosts spirits greek sauros lizard lemurosaurus easily identifiable prominent eye crests large eyes name lemurosaurus pricei coined paleontologist robert broom based single small crushed skull measured approximately millimeters length found dorsfontein farm date two skulls lemurosaurus discovered body size unknown second larger intact skull found team national museum holotype skull poorly preserved referred lemurosaurus pricei coined robert broom convinced since presumed lemurosaurus closely related ictidorhinus classification expanded rusell sigogneu classified genera within ictidorhinidae place within sigogneau restructured ictidorhinds four familylevel four biarmosuchidae hipposauridae ictidorhinidae many classifications required research incorrect second skull known nmqr extracted farm petersburg south africa kilometers southeast type specimen left unprepared discovered second lemurosaurus present knowledge points lemurosaurus part specimens flaws make difficult make definitive conclusions aspects structure skull postorbital occipital regions left lateral side missing right lateral side poorly entire skull crushed warped adding ambiguity posterior part jaw also severely damaged weathered enough sutures nmqr also quite weathered external surface different skull matrices tough left posterolateral corner skull warped resulting missing features like portion zygomatic arch occipital condyle paraoccipital process full skeleton yet located leaving many questions lemurosaurus full size structure lemurosaurus distinctive feature triangular supraorbital bosses tall stretching either side toward pineal postfrontal pachyostosed supraorbital boss stronger arch upper canines oval looked premaxillary dentition nmqr fully intact four upper strong indications could five one lost weathering poor preservation lower canine rests anterior section choana much like gorgonopsians therocephalians third fourth positions two complete incisors right millimeter precanine diastema located behind upper incisor right seems large compared incisors dinocephalians anomodonts relatively serration present nmqr faint compared intense serration speculated differences serration nmqr might ontogenetic common juvenile therapsids lose serration get also high ridges dorsal margins orbit small midline crest anterior pineal lacrimal large two fossae contacts maxilla well structure like anything seen basal therapsids present squamosal poorly defined deformation zygomatic arch suggests squamosal extends nearly posterior end also squamosal two small knobs along ventral knobs considered indicative occiput lemurosaurus tall narrow measurement scleral ring orbital dimensions indicate lemurosaurus able see low light inner scleral ring diameter millimeters outer diameter around articular prearticular distinguished might indicate splenial bound dentary keeps visible ventral edge mandible quadrate quadratojugal appressed right side quadratojugal foramen lemurosaurus lobalopex biarmosuchian therapsid genera found south africa lobalopex fossil recovered farm quaggas fontein south africa thought middle late permian specimen undergone compression many features compared lemurosaurus several differences note example lobalopex skull median frontal ridge prominent posterior contact nasal passage almost lemurosaurus fossil observed distinct medial frontal another difference lobalopex dorsal orbital margin become thicker extra layers bone lemurosaurus one similarity two taxa skull fossils contained unpaired partial skull found western cape south africa lead discovery new burnetiamorph called lophorhinus fossil misclassified though specific relation lemurosaurus still worked specimen rather deformed comparison taxa similarities species example lemurosaurus lophorhinus short maxillaryprefrontal one major difference includes midline suture nasals present discovery fossil important shows two related taxa lophorhinus lobalopex alive assemblage exact relationships within branch uncertain prevailing theory lemurosaurus basal three lobalopex lophorhinus closely lemurosaurus characteristics place closer burnetiids biarmosuchian genera reclassifying burnetiamorpha altering previous belief evident biarmosuchia commonly carnivores conclusive evidence whether lemurosaurus carnivorous specific karoo basin makes majority south africa covering within basin lies different zones made difficult pinpoint exactly lemurosaurus positioned timeline lemurosaurus incorrectly placed dicynodon assemblage zone later confirmed live within cistecephalus assemblage zone matching rocks fossil rocks late permian climate beginning warm instances seasonal also semipermanent lakes present time believed early therapsids originated however ambiguity specific ages fauna resulted two prominent theories lemurosaurus ended south africa first therapsids originated south africa presence russia explained dispersal second theory therapsids pangaean distribution complete line evolutionary fossil data needed draw concrete conclusion
