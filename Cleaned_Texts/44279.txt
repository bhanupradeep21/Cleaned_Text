used many areas biological research notably toxicology medaka short gestation period reproductively make easy rear laboratory withstand cold shipped easily nearly aspects life cycle medaka analyzed

subpopulation indicates effective population size around medaka kept domesticated pet japan centuries recent years fish gained popularity rarer breeds valued million yen approximately common varieties like himedaka purchased around yen per currently commercial strains documented available medaka kept pets also widely utilized education japanese elementary school classes often raise medaka order
