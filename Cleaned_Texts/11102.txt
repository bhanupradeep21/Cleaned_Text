developed throughout world due extensive number structures available review focus important groups covering occurrence biological activity biosynthesis laboratory synthesis indolocarbazoles belong alkaloid subclass bisindoles frequently isolated indolocarbazoles common subgroup divided two major classes halogenated chlorinated fully oxidized carbon one indole nitrogen containing Î²glycosidic
