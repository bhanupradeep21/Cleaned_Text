psychology desensitization treatment process diminishes emotional responsiveness negative aversive positive stimulus repeated exposure desensitization also occur emotional response repeatedly evoked action tendency associated emotion proves irrelevant unnecessary process desensitization developed psychologist mary cover jones primarily used assist individuals unlearning desensitization psychological process response repeatedly elicited circumstances emotions propensity action joseph wolpe developed method hierarchal list anxietyevoking stimuli order intensity allows individuals undergo adaptation although medication available individuals anxiety fear phobias empirical evidence supports desensitization high rates cure particularly clients depression wolpes reciprocal

occur simultaneously ie relaxation methods involved desensitization inhibit feelings anxiety come exposed phobic deep muscle relaxation techniques primary method used wolpe increase parasympathetic

research revealed biological basis reciprocal inhibition occurs tap patellar tendon results muscle relaxation inhibition flexors muscle activation excitation example coordinated inhibition excitation different one criticism reciprocal inhibition isnt necessary part process desensitizing people therapies along similar lines flooding work without preemptive inhibitory relaxation review empirical evidence confirmed therapy without relaxation equally effective gave birth exposure review taylors classification reciprocal inhibition shortterm longterm effects within understanding desensitization doesnt make sense due theoretically similar reactive inhibition longerterm develops conditioned counterconditioning suggests anxiety response replaced relaxation response conditioning desensitization counterconditioning behavioural equivalent reciprocal inhibition understood neurological wolpe used mechanism explain longterm effects systematic desensitization reduces avoidance responses therefore excessive avoidance behaviours contributing anxiety however explanation supported empirical similar reasons reciprocal inhibition counterconditioning criticized underpinning mechanism desensitization due therapies dont suggest replacement emotion anxiety effective desensitizing noted would behavioural difference reciprocal inhibition counterconditioning functioning theory explains increased exposure stimulus decreased response phobic subject empirical evidence suggest overall phobia responses reduced people specific phobias vivo exposure however empirical evidence support habituation explanation desensitization due reversible shortterm phobic responses decreased exposure stimuli without avoidance lack reinforcement however used explain desensitization works solely describes functional relationship absent reinforcement phobic responses lacks actual mechanism relationship wolpe disagreed extinction could explanatory mechanism desensitization occurs therapies based exposure believed repeated exposure insufficient likely already happened lives people specific phobias exposure phobic stimuli subsequent avoidance response may strengthen future anxiety avoidance response reduces stress therefore reinforces avoidant behaviour prominent feature specific phobias anxiety therefore exposure nonavoidance seen essential desensitization process view persons belief able cope increases especially moving exposure hierarchy confirmatory experiences coping lower increase selfefficacy explains fear reduction ie desensitization mechanism explanation desensitization lacks explanation increased expectation fear reduction leads reduced fear responses person didnt experience reduced fear response whether desensitization occurred anxiety response reaffirm theory suggests people expect therapy going work change view going receive phobic stimuli speaking therapist responses align display reduced marcia et al found high expectancy change receiving full expectancy treatment comparable results systematic desensitization therapy suggesting change expectancy reduces fear rj mcnally explains fear represented memory network comprising stimulus propositions express

reduced responsiveness actual violence caused exposure violence media however topic debated scientific desensitization may arise different media sources including tv video games movies scholars suggest violence may prime thoughts hostility possibly affecting perceive others interpret desensitization shown lower arousal violent scenes heavy versus light television viewers physiological frequently suggested commit extreme violence blunted sensibilities result watching violent videos desensitization violence linked number observed example less arousal emotional disturbance witnessing violence greater hesitancy call adult intervene witnessed physical altercation less sympathy victims domestic recent school shootings sparked lot discussion desensitising effects violent video games possible involvement shooter games teach gun handling skills provide intense desensitisation hypothesized initial exposure violence media may produce number aversive responses increased heart rate fear discomfort perspiration disgust however prolonged repeated exposure violence media may reduce habituate initial psychological impact violent images elicit negative responses eventually observer may become emotionally cognitively desensitized media violence one experiment participants played violent video games showed lower heart rate galvanic skin response readings authors interpreted displaying physiological desensitization however studies failed replicate scholars questioned whether becoming desensitized media violence specifically transfers becoming desensitized reallife addition psychological research frequently focuses members group behave studies demonstrate media violence raises likelihood members group become desensitised act however sensitive developmental studies might find effect moderated individual difference variables empathy perspective taking trait
