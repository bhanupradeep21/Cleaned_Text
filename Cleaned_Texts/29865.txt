elbow forearm wrist pain extension term tennis elbow widely used although informal condition understood limited tennis historically medical term lateral epicondylitis commonly used condition itis implies inflammation condition since histological findings reveal noninflammatory tissue terms lateral elbow tendinopathy tendinosis group international experts suggested lateral elbow tendinopathy
