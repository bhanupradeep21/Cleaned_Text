daunorubicin immediate precursor dxr biosynthetic pathway daunorubicin abundantly found natural product produced number different wild type strains streptomyces contrast one known nonwild type species streptomyces peucetius subspecies cesius atcc initially found capable producing widely used strain created arcamone et al mutating strain producing daunorubicin dxr least detectable subsequently hutchinsons group showed special environmental conditions introduction genetic modifications strains streptomyces produce group also cloned many genes required dxr production although fully characterized strohls group discovered isolated characterized dox gene encoding enzyme converts daunorubicin produced recombinant dox cytochrome oxidase found catalyzes multiple steps dxr biosynthesis including steps leading significant became clear daunorubicinproducing strains necessary genes produce dxr much therapeutically important two hutchinsons group went develop methods improve yield dxr fermentation process used commercial production introducing dox encoding plasmids also introducing mutations deactivate enzymes shunt dxr precursors less useful products example baumycinlike triple mutants also overexpressed dox able double yield dxr academic interest time dxr cost million per kg current production kg per efficient production techniques brought price million per kg nonliposomal formulation although dxr produced semisynthetically daunorubicin process involves electrophilic bromination multiple steps yield since daunorubicin produced fermentation would ideal bacteria could
