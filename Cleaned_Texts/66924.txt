kayenta formation southwestern us recent phylogenetic analyses syntarsus kayentakatae shown distantly related coelophysis megapnosaurus suggesting belongs early debate diagnostic characteristics first specimens collected compared material excavated ghost ranch coelophysis quarry paleontologists opinion original specimens diagnostic beyond therefore name c bauri could applied additional specimens therefore applied different name rioarribasaurus ghost ranch quarry since numerous wellpreserved ghost ranch specimens used coelophysis scientific literature use rioarribasaurus would inconvenient researchers petition given type specimen coelophysis transferred poorly preserved original specimen one wellpreserved ghost ranch specimens would make rioarribasaurus definite synonym coelophysis specifically junior objective end international commission zoological nomenclature iczn voted make one ghost ranch samples actual type specimen coelophysis dispose name rioarribasaurus altogether declaring nomen rejectum rejected name thus resolving confusion name coelophysis became nomen conservandum conserved situation affecting many dinosaur taxa recently discovered fossils originally

coelophysis similarity coelophysis ghost ranch however reassessment camposaurus holotype martin ezcurra stephen brusatte published revealed pair autapomorphies holotype indicating c arizonensis synonym c bauri although close relative barta et al concluded c bauri differed rhodesiensis bears several features musculature limbs according griffin teeth coelophysis typical predatory dinosaurs bladelike recurved sharp jagged finely serrated anterior posterior edges dentition shows carnivorous probably preying small lizardlike animals discovered may also hunted packs tackle larger coelophysis bauri approximately teeth maxillary bone upper jaw teeth dentary bone lower kenneth carpenter examined biomechanics theropod arms attempted evaluate usefulness predation concluded arm coelophysis flexible good range motion bone structure suggested comparatively weak weak arms small teeth genus suggested coelophysis preyed upon animals substantially smaller rinehart et al agreed coelophysis hunter small fastmoving carpenter also identified three distinct models theropod arm use noted coelophysis combination grasperclutcher compared dinosaurs clutchers long armed suggested c bauri cannibal based supposed juvenile specimens found within abdominal cavities ghost ranch however robert j gay showed specimens misinterpreted several specimens juvenile coelophysids actually small crurotarsan reptiles gays position lent support study nesbitt et new evidence cannibalism came light additional preparation previously excavated matrix revealed regurgitate material around mouth coelophysis specimen nmmnh material included tooth jaw bone fragments rinehart et al considered morphologically identical juvenile gay examined bones juveniles found within thoracic cavity amnh calculated total volume bones times greater maximum estimated stomach volume coelophysis specimen gay observed total volume would even greater considering would flesh bones analysis also noted absence tooth marks bones would expected defleshing absence expected pitting stomach acids finally gay demonstrated alleged cannibalized juvenile bones deposited stratigraphically larger animal supposedly cannibalized taken together data suggested coelophysis specimen amnh cannibal bones juvenile adult specimens found final position result coincidental superposition different sized discovery specimens coelophysis whitaker quarry ghost ranch suggested gregarious behavior researchers like schwartz tendency see massive congregation animals evidence huge packs coelophysis roaming direct evidence flocking exists deposits indicate large numbers coelophysis along various triassic animals buried together evidence taphonomy site indicates animals may gathered together feed drink depleted water hole feed spawning run fish later buried catastrophic flash specimens c rhodesiensis found together zimbabwe palaeontologists suggested coelophysis indeed gregarious direct evidence flocking case also suggested individuals also victims flash flooding appears commonplace rinehart assessed ontogenic growth genus using data gathered length upper leg bone femur concluded coelophysis juveniles grew rapidly especially first year coelophysis likely reached sexual maturity second third year life reached full size feet length eighth year study identified four distinct growth stages also thought soon hatched would fend two morphs coelophysis identified one gracile form specimen amnh slightly robust form specimens amnh nmmnh skeletal proportions different two gracile form longer skull longer neck shorter arms sacral neural spines fused robust form shorter skull shorter neck longer arms unfused sacral neural historically many arguments made represents sort dimorphism population coelophysis probably sexual raath agreed dimorphism coelophysis evidenced size structure rinehart et al studied individuals agreed two morphs present even juvenile specimens suggested sexual dimorphism present early life prior sexual maturity rinehart concluded gracile form female robust form male based differences sacral vertebrae gracile form allowed greater flexibility egg support position provided analysis showing morph comprised population would expected sex however recent research found c bauri c rhodesiensis highly variable growth individuals specimens larger immature phase smaller adults completely mature indicates supposed presence distinct morphs simply result individual variation highly variable growth likely ancestral dinosaurs later lost may given early dinosaurs evolutionary advantage surviving harsh environmental compilation analysis database nearly three dozen reptiles including birds comparison existing data anatomy coelophysis rinehart et al drew following conclusions estimated average egg coelophysis millimeters across minor diameter female would lay eggs clutch evidence suggested parental care necessary nurture relatively small hatchlings first year life would reach meters length end first growth stage coelophysis bauri invested much energy reproduction extinct reptiles approximate study conducted bruce rothschild paleontologists bones referred coelophysis
