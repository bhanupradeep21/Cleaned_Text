spinocerebellar ataxia sca progressive genetic disease multiple types could considered neurological condition right estimated people united states diagnosis spinocerebellar ataxia given time sca hereditary progressive degenerative often fatal known effective treatment cure sca affect anyone age disease caused either recessive dominant gene many cases people aware carry relevant gene children begin show signs spinocerebellar ataxia sca one group genetic disorders characterized slowly progressive incoordination gait often associated poor coordination hands speech eye movements review different clinical features among sca subtypes recently published describing frequency noncerebellar features like parkinsonism chorea pyramidalism cognitive impairment peripheral neuropathy seizures among forms ataxia sca frequently results atrophy loss fine coordination muscle movements leading unsteady clumsy motion symptoms ocular deficits quantified using soda symptoms ataxia vary specific type individual patient many cases person ataxia retains full mental capacity progressively loses physical controlcitation needed hereditary ataxias categorized mode inheritance causative gene chromosomal locus hereditary ataxias inherited autosomal dominant autosomal recessive xlinked mannercitation needed numerous types autosomaldominant cerebellar ataxias five typical autosomal recessive disorders ataxia prominent feature scas remain unspecified precisely diagnosed last decadeas genetic testing allowed precise identification dozens different scas tests added genetic ataxia blood test

mutations foundcitation needed following list many types spinocerebellar ataxia others include four xlinked types described first far tied gene cure spinocerebellar ataxia currently considered progressive irreversible disease although types cause equally severe general treatments directed towards alleviating symptoms disease many patients hereditary idiopathic forms ataxia symptoms addition ataxia medications therapies might appropriate symptoms could include tremor stiffness depression spasticity sleep disorders among others onset initial symptoms duration disease variable disease
