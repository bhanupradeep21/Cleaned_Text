carcharodontosaurus lifting capabilities conducted paleontologist donald henderson paleoartist robert nicholls authors used models animal well subadult sauropod limaysaurus although found alongside carcharodontosaurus similar rebbachisaurids kem kem beds models included size lungs pneumatic structures two fostering accurate weight simulation scenario henderson nicholls study found adult c saharicus could hold maximum kg lb half weight adult limaysaurus however two c saharicus adults could together lift much kilograms dentition allosauroids distinct carcharodontosaurid teeth bearing distinctly thin bladelike teeth however teeth thin likely could sustain impact hard surfaces like bone without potentially bending snapping danger exacerbated straight edges slightly recurved tips sinusoidal shapes observed dentition despite traits teeth still much robust smaller theropods due overall size could take pressure carcharodontosaurus also high tooth replacement rate meaning damaged teeth could replaced easily contrast extant bonecrushing mammals spend much energy maintaining evidence bonecrunching bites observed allosaurus would engage ritual facebiting individuals bite pelves stegosaurus shown bite bite forces carcharodontosaurus well giant theropods including acrocanthosaurus tyrannosaurus analyzed studies reported carcharodontosaurids much lower bite forces tyrannosaurus despite size class anterior bite force c saharicus estimated paper newtons posterior bite force newtons much lower tyrannosaurus implying eat finite element accounts skulls theropods also taken supported idea carcharodontosaurus ate softer food tyrannosaurids great amounts stress recovered posterior part cranium near quadrate carcharodontosaurus spinosaurus acrocanthosaurus skulls theropods higher relative stress quantities opposition smaller genera indicates crania giant taxa ex carcharodontosaurus unstable due large pneumatic structures save weight instead creating firm build however spinosaurus suchomimus experienced even greater values stress meaning could consume light small prey instead larger items stronger skull carcharodontosaurus could bite sustaining isotopic analyses teeth c saharicus found values higher contemporary spinosaurus suggesting latter pursued semiaquatic habits whereas carcharodontosaurus supported taphonomy c saharicus teeth often found land terrains aquatic carcharodontosaurus also homeotherm endothermlike thermophysiology inferred isotopes meaning oxygen accumulated drinking water rather theropods carcharodontosaurus allosaurus acrocanthosaurus

allosauroids carcharodontosaurus allosaurus well several coelurosaurs including tyrannosaurus stenonychosaurus applying modified perimetry models dinosaurs heads stevens deduced binocular vision carcharodontosaurus limited side effect large elongated rostrum greatest degree binocular vision higher elevations suggesting carcharodontosaurus may habitually held head downward angle eyes facing accordingly achieve maximum binocular vision range vision seen allosauroids comparable crocodiles suggesting ambush predators likely sensed prey via motion parallax prey background narrow binocular
