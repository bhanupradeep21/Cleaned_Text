central nervous system diseases central nervous system disorders group neurological disorders affect structure function brain spinal cord collectively form central nervous system disorders may caused things infection injury blood clots age related degeneration cancer autoimmune disfunction birth defects symptoms vary widely treatments central nervous system tumors common forms pediatric cancer brain tumors frequent highest disorders substance addiction autism adhd may regarded cns disorders though classifications without dispute every disease different signs symptoms persistent headache pain face back arms legs inability concentrate loss feeling memory loss loss muscle strength tremors seizures increased reflexes spasticity tics paralysis slurred speech one seek medical attention affected thesecitation needed type traumatic brain injury tbi injury done spinal cord result wide spectrum disabilities person depending section brain spinal cord experiences trauma outcome may anticipated infectious diseases transmitted several ways infections may affect brain spinal cord directly generally infection disease caused invasion microorganism virus degenerative spinal disorders involve loss function spine pressure spinal cord nerves may associated herniation disc displacement brain degeneration also causes central nervous system diseases ie alzheimers parkinsons huntingtons diseases studies shown obese people may severe degeneration braindubious discuss due loss tissue affecting needed common structural defects include birth anencephaly spina bifida children born structural defects may malformed limbs heart problems facial abnormalities defects formation cerebral cortex include microgyria polymicrogyria bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria pachygyria tumor abnormal growth body tissue beginning tumors noncancerous become malignant cancerous general appear problem cellular division problems bodys immune system lead tumors autoimmune disorder condition immune system attacks destroys healthy body tissue caused loss tolerance proteins body resulting immune cells recognising foreign directing immune response stroke interruption blood supply brain approximately every seconds someone us happen blood vessel blocked blood clot blood vessel ruptures causing blood leak brain brain get enough oxygen blood brain cells die leading permanent damage spinal cord transmits sensory reception peripheral nervous also conducts motor information bodys skeletal muscles cardiac muscles smooth muscles glands pairs spinal nerves along spinal cord consist sensory motor spinal cord protected vertebrae connects peripheral nervous system brain acts minor coordinating center brain serves organic basis cognition exerts centralized control organs body brain protected skull however brain damaged significant impairments cognition physiological function death may occur addiction disorder brains reward system arises transcriptional epigenetic mechanisms occurs time chronically high levels exposure addictive stimulus eg morphine cocaine sexual intercourse gambling arachnoid cysts cerebrospinal fluid covered arachnoidal cells may develop brain spinal congenital disorder cases may show symptoms however large cyst symptoms may include headache seizures ataxia lack muscle control hemiparesis several others macrocephaly adhd common among children presenile dementia hydrocephalus abnormality dynamics cerebrospinal fluid urinary incontinence symptoms elderly patients older adhd organic disorder nervous adhd severe cases symptoms thought caused structural well biochemical imbalances brain particular low levels neurotransmitters dopamine responsible controlling maintaining attention movement many people adhd continue symptoms well also note increased risk development dementia lewy bodies dlb direct genetic association attention deficit disorder parkinsons two progressive serious neurological diseases whose symptoms often occur people age autism neurodevelopmental disorder characterized repetitive patterns behavior persistent deficits social interaction tumors central nervous system constitute around cancer united catalepsy nervous disorder characterized immobility muscular rigidity along decreased sensitivity pain catalepsy considered symptom serious diseases nervous system eg parkinsons disease epilepsy etc rather disease cataleptic fits range duration several minutes weeks catalepsy often responds benzodiazepines eg lorazepam pill iv encephalitis inflammation brain usually caused foreign substance viral infection symptoms disease include headache neck pain drowsiness nausea fever caused west nile may lethal humans well birds horses epilepsy unpredictable serious potentially fatal disorder nervous system thought result faulty electrical activity brain epileptic seizures result abnormal excessive hypersynchronous neuronal activity brain million people worldwide epilepsy nearly epilepsy occurs developing countries epilepsy becomes common people age onset new cases occurs frequently infants elderly epileptic seizures may occur recovering patients consequence brain number different pathogens ie certain viruses bacteria protozoa fungi prions cause infections adversely affect brain spinal cord medical condition lockedin syndrome usually resulting stroke damages part brainstem body facial muscles paralysed consciousness remains ability perform certain eye movements preserved meningitis inflammation meninges membranes brain spinal cord often caused bacterial viral infection fever vomiting stiff neck symptoms meningitis chronic often debilitating neurological disorder characterized recurrent moderate severe headaches often association number autonomic nervous system symptoms multiple sclerosis ms chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease meaning myelin sheath neurons damaged symptoms ms include visual sensation problems muscle weakness numbness tingling muscle spasms poor coordination depression also patients ms reported extreme fatigue dizziness tremors bladder leakage myelopathy injury spinal cord due severe compression may result trauma congenital stenosis degenerative disease disc herniation spinal cord group nerves housed inside spine runs almost entire length tourettes syndrome inherited neurological disorder early onset may childhood characterized physical verbal tics tourettes often also includes symptoms ocd adhd indicating link three disorders exact cause tourettes genetic factors unknown alzheimers neurodegenerative disease typically found people age years worldwide approximately million people dementia cases due alzheimers ultimate cause unknown clinical sign alzheimers progressive cognition deterioration huntingtons disease degenerative neurological disorder inherited degeneration neuronal cells occurs throughout brain especially striatum progressive decline results abnormal statistics show huntingtons disease may affect per people western european descent parkinsons disease pd progressive illness nervous system caused death dopamineproducing brain cells affect motor skills speech symptoms may include bradykinesia slow physical movement muscle rigidity tremors behavior thinking sensation disorders sometimes comorbid skin condition seborrheic dermatitis pds numerous nonmotor symptoms parkinsons disease attention deficithyperactivity disorder adhd bipolar disorder appear connection one another three nervous system disorders involve lower normal levels brain chemical dopamine adhd parkinsons depressive phase bipolar disorder much dopamine mania manic states bipolar disorder different areas wide range treatments central nervous system diseases range surgery neural rehabilitation prescribed medicationscitation needed valued companies worldwide whose leading products cns care include cspc pharma hong kong biogen united states ucb belgium otsuka japan active treatment areas like ms
