identifies text written sender odd number markers identifies text recipient example even numbers joes text odd numbers marys html messages blockquote dl elements may nested achieve effect quoted material often preceded attribution line identifies author lines particularly helpful discussions multiple parties example reply quotes two messages one nancy reply peter one peter reply mary many mail agents add attribution lines automatically top quoted material note newly added attribution line get quotation marker since part quoted text level indicator attribution line always one less corresponding text otherwise may confuse reader also email interfaces choose text color according number leading markers instead attribution line one may indicate author comment brackets beginning

summarized much possible keeping parts necessary make readers understand course depends much readers assumed know discussion personal email particular subject line often sufficient quoting necessary unless one replying points long particular replying message already included quoted text one consider whether quoted material still relevant example quote marys message relevant peters reply joes reply latter could trimmed hand situations trimming editing original message may inappropriate example reply copied third person see original message may advisable quote full otherwise trimmed message may misinterpreted new recipient lack context also replying customer supplier may advisable quote original message entirety case party somehow failed keep copy interleaved reply style also called inline reply interlined reply pointbypoint rebuttal sometimes bottom posting original message broken two sections followed specific reply comment reply inline style may also include topposted bottomposted comments apply whole reply message rather specific point example interleaved reply style also combined topposting selected points quoted replied full copy original message appended

clear manner without quoting original email message may included attachment including whole original message may necessary also new correspondent included ongoing especially business correspondence entire message thread may need forwarded third party handling discussion hand environments entire discussion accessible new readers newsgroups online forums full inclusion previous messages inappropriate quoting necessary interleaved style probably best original message quoted full reason bottomposting usually appropriate preserves logical order replies consistent western reading direction top bottom uncommon discussions concerning topposting vs bottomposting hear quotes netiquette guidelines rfc many rfcs vetted approved though committee process rfcs rfc informational reality sometimes personal opinions additional information informational rfcs found rfc informational procedures experimental informational rfcs nature rfc considered reading following discussion according rfc message begin abbreviated summary ie post begin paraphrasing instead quoting selectively specifically says sending reply message posting sure summarize original top message include enough text original give context make sure readers understand start read response since netnews especially proliferated distributing postings one host another possible see response message seeing original giving context helps everyone include entire original interleaved reply combined topposting combines advantages styles however also results portions original message quoted twice takes extra space may
