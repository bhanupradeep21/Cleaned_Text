replacement training battalion german nachrichten aufklärung ersatz und ausbildungsabteilung located frankfurt responsible training german army signal recruits control signal intelligence replacement training companies service command district german wehrkreis basic training training signal matters given time peace basic training lasted one year signal training taken first three months war time basic training shortened order place troops quickly field recruits trained directionfinding teletype operation simple field codes sent field special courses conducted replacement training companies

replaced five cipher symbols practical example quoted russian code solved sporadically eg digit transposition ciphers jumble letters figures message way designed confuse main characteristic found german army cipher bureaux transposition cipher statistics always produced normal plaintext frequency hive transposition used short texts lacks security example transposition patterns eg squares rectangles consider following example combining various basic cipher systems order get combined cipher cipher recipher also studied examples included reciphered russian code described polyalphabetically reciphered transposition cipher letter tauschtafel system kenngruppenbuch used key setting procedure naval enigma cipher built upon principle practically unending polyalphabetical cipher regular pattern mentioned course academic interest training cryptanalysts army appears successful classes men used training section passed men would later become specialists field cryptanalysis either konas central agencies following soldiers known trained training signal troops field appears less successful throughout ticom documentation attention drawn acute shortages field army personnel well trained signal intelligence operations particularly true late years war courses became disorganised less effective central agencies recognized weakness attempted remedy publishing field manuals security lectures given army signals school halle german heeresnachrichtenschule ii members despite efforts however field army remained according walter fricke pitifully ignorant principles security ignorance undoubtedly lay bottom noncooperative attitude field army regard adoption systems considered secure use army conditions aggravated end war necessity sending ablebodied men front line general confusion army little training could carried field army late months war since schools taken operational agencies used train example army signal school halle used since november preparation army keys
