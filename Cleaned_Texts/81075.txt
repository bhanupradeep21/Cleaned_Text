similar modernday swimming crab modeling studies eurypterus swimming behavior suggest utilized dragbased rowing type locomotion appendages moved synchronously nearhorizontal paddle blades almost vertically oriented backward stroke pushing animal forward lifting blades oriented horizontally recovery stroke slash water without pushing animal back type swimming exhibited crabs water alternative hypothesis eurypterus swimming behavior individuals capable underwater flying subaqueous flight sinuous motions shape paddles acting hydrofoils enough generate type similar found sea turtles sea lions relatively slower acceleration rate rowing type especially since adults proportionally smaller paddles juveniles since larger sizes adults mean higher drag coefficient using type propulsion juveniles probably swam using rowing type rapid acceleration afforded propulsion suited quickly escaping predators small cm eurypterus could achieve two half body lengths per second larger adults meanwhile probably swam subaqueous flight type maximum velocity adults cruising would ft per second slightly faster turtles sea trace fossil evidence indicates eurypterus employed rowing stroke close proximity arcuites bertiensis ichnospecies includes pair crescentshaped impressions short medial drag found upper silurian eurypterid lagerstatten ontario pennsylvania trace fossil similar traces made modern aquatic swimming insects row water boatmen considered made juvenile adultsized eurypterids swimming shallow nearshore marine environments morphology bertiensis suggests eurypterus ability move swimming appendages horizontal vertical plane eurypterus swim hunt rather simply swam order move one feeding site another quickly time walked substrate legs including swimming leg generalist species equally likely engage predation scavenging hunted small softbodied invertebrates like worms utilized mass spines front appendages kill hold used chelicerae rip pieces small enough swallow young individuals may also fallen prey cannibalism larger eurypterus probably marine animals remains mostly found intertidal shallow environments concentrations eurypterus fossils certain sites interpreted result mass mating molting behavior juveniles likely inhabited nearshore hypersaline environments safer predators moved deeper waters grew older larger adults reach sexual maturity would migrate en masse shore areas order mate lay eggs molt activities would made vulnerable predators could also explain vast majority fossils found sites molts actual animals behavior seen modern horseshoe examinations respiratory systems eurypterus led many paleontologists conclude capable breathing air walking land short amount time eurypterus two types respiratory systems main organs breathing book gills inside segments mesosoma structures supported semicircular ribs probably attached near center body similar gills modern horseshoe protected platelike appendages actually formed apparent belly eurypterus known gills may also played role second system kiemenplatten also referred gilltracts ovalshaped areas within body wall preabdomen surfaces covered numerous small spines arranged hexagonal rosettes areas vascularized hence conclusion secondary breathing function book gills usually interpreted aquatic breathing kiemenplatten supplementary temporary breathing however authors argued two systems alone could supported organism size eurypterus structures might actually breathing air true gills underwater breathing eurypterus yet eurypterus however undoubtedly primarily juvenile eurypterus differed adults several ways carapaces narrower longer parabolic contrast trapezoidal carapaces adults eyes aligned almost laterally move anterior location growth preabdomen also lengthened increasing overall length ophisthosoma swimming legs also became narrower telsons shorter broader though e tetragonophthalmus e henningsmoeni telsons changed angular juveniles larger rounded adults
