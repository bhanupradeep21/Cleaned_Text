believe likely emerged pigs asia traveled north america human emphasized way prove hypothesis said evidence new virus combines eurasian north american genes never circulated north american pigs tantalizing evidence closely related sister virus circulated however subsequent report researchers mount sinai school medicine found virus likely originated central early june using computational

results show strain circulating among pigs possibly among multiple continents many years prior transmission humans research team worked case also believed derived several viruses circulating swine initial transmission humans occurred several months recognition outbreak team concluded despite widespread influenza surveillance humans lack systematic swine surveillance allowed undetected persistence evolution potentially pandemic strain many according researchers movement live pigs eurasia north america seems facilitated mixing diverse swine influenza viruses leading multiple reassortment events associated genesis new strain also said new pandemic provides evidence role domestic pigs ecosystem influenza november study published virology journal suggested virus may product three strains three continents swapped genes lab vaccinemaking plant subsequently escaped study followed debate among researchers may authors asked world health organization consider hypothesis reviewing initial paper organizations concluded pandemic strain naturallyoccurring virus virus contagious spreads human human much way seasonal flu common mechanisms spreads droplets coughs sneezes infected people also potentially touching surface hand person contaminated virus touching ones eyes nose reported seemed contagious seasonal however new england journal medicine report said transmissibility influenza virus households lower seen past us cdc recommended people wait least day fever subsides usually days onset symptoms resuming normal activities found continue shed virus

however comparisons human fatality figures seasonal influenza prone underestimate impact pandemic virus fact dominant strain influenza causing illness flu research carried imperial college shown unlike seasonal flu infect cells deep lungs seasonal flu infect cells receptor type typically located nose throat also infect cells receptor type may explain patients experience severe respiratory symptoms virus also able infect cells deep lungs receptor type infect cells receptor type making less contagious needed september people infected flu suffered mild illness small minority hospitalized often severely ill arand kumar intensive care expert university manitoba winnipeg canada said pandemic like two diseases either youre work days go hospital often intensivecare unit icu theres middle

winter although number death rate us calculated less november figures explicitly calculated study us centers disease control prevention published may found children preexisting immunity new strain adults particularly older degree immunity children showed crossreactive antibody reaction new strain adults aged older adults thought findings suggest partial immunity older adults may due previous
