pittsburgh fossil cm due completeness best source information genus plieninger first time studied p liasicus discovered quenstedt mistaken reality short metacarpal coracoid meaning basal plieninger referred p liasicus pittsburgh specimen campylognathus though yet establishing specific status three however plieninger recognised second species campylognathus c liasicus cm referred norwegian entomologist embrik strand discovered name campylognathus previously used african bug campylognathus nigrensis genus heteroptera named name thus preoccupied renamed pterosaur campylognathoides twentieth century new finds brought number known specimens dozen three species campylognathoides named distinction c liasicus c zitteli problematical plieninger merely recognised smaller species considered fossil poor quality refer specimens however swedish researcher carl wiman studying specimen uupm concluded fundamental morphological difference could distinguish two species c zitteli proportionally much longer wing however padian pointed might well matter ontogenetic development larger individuals growing extra large wings limit wing load differences larger number teeth lower jaw longer snout nares five instead four sacrals perpendicular sacral ribs longer leg might conceivably also sizerelated final proof could given continuous growth series previously done case rhamphorhynchus pterodactylus provisionally padian kept distinguishing two species moved two specimens c zitteli smns gpit larger size morphological compared contemporary layers dorygnathus snout genus relatively short though skull still general elongated much lighter built large eye sockets placed low skull narrow jugal caused researchers speculate campylognathoides especially acute vision possibly even nocturnal lifestyle back skull relatively high flat sudden downturn front eyes snout ends slender point curving bit upwards end large part snout occupied long bony nares small triangular skull opening fenestra antorbitalis present reflecting shallow snout teeth campylognathoides also short laniaries fanglike markedly heterodont dorygnathus conical recurved broad base point bevelled inside forming sharp strong cutting surface upper jaw four rather widely spaced teeth praemaxilla gradually increasing size front back fourth pair teeth largest behind ten smaller teeth maxilla gradually decreasing posteriorly lower jaw twelve fourteen teeth present c liasicus sixteen nineteen c zitteli largest total number thus according study kevin padian eight cervical vertebrae fourteen dorsals four five sacrals caudal vertebrae tail base flexible six short vertebrae behind caudals elongate stiffened long extensions allowing tail function sternum campylognathoides rather large rectangular plate bone short forwardfacing crest called upper arm short robust square deltopectoral crest lower arm short wing length considerable due hand short metacarpals long wing finger basal pterosaur second phalanx largest pteroid short robust pelvis well known fossil collector found well preserved campylognathoides hip braunschweig shale quarry pelvis bsp proved scientifically significant hip socket according peter wellnhofer upward lateral position preventing animal able orient legs erectly like dinosaurs birds mammals would prove campylognathoides well able walk hind legs must walked gait posture confirmed rhamphorhynchoids ie basal pterosaurs however padian concluded opposite stating erected position necessary place feet ground though quadrupedal gait possible bipedal way locomotion precondition fast subject remains highly controversial leg rather short feet small fifth toe often interpreted carrying membrane legs exceptionally short basal pterosaur plieninger later publications assigned campylognathus rhamphorhynchoidea suborder paraphyletic assemblage specially related basal pterosaurs classification merely states negative fact pterodactyloid positive determination first attempted baron franz nopcsa assigned genus subfamily rhamphorhynchinae within family period little work done pterosaur systematics oskar kuhn placed campylognathoides subfamily within rhamphorhynchidae however peter wellnhofer concluded placed basal position phylogenetic tree early twentyfirst century confirmed first extensive exact cladistic analyses david unwin alexander kellner introduced clade campylognathoididae within unwins terminology clade sister clade breviquartossa within applying kellners terminology basal offshoot within material difference two positions according analyses campylognathoides would closely related eudimorphodon similar skull sternum humerus form confirmed padian though padian also pointed several basal features present eudimorphodon lacking analysis published brian andres showing eudimorphodon together austriadactylus formed basal clade leaving campylognathoides known member recent phylogenetic analyses confirm results suggest campylognathoides derived triassicaged pterosaurs well early jurassic dimorphodon campylognathoides basalmost member novialoidea defined nodebased taxon consisting last common ancestor
