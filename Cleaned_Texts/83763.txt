walk ongoing vomiting social isolation may occur rare complications may include dehydration electrolyte problems lower esophageal tear severe motion sickness divided three categoriescitation needed cases motion sensed vestibular system hence motion felt motion little motion detected visual system terrestrial motion sicknesscitation needed specific form terrestrial motion sickness carsick quite common evidenced disorientation reading map book small screen travel carsickness results sensory conflict arising brain differing sensory inputs motion sickness caused conflict signals arriving brain inner ear forms base vestibular system sensory apparatus deals movement balance detects motion mechanically someone looking stationary object within vehicle magazine eyes inform brain viewing moving inner ears however contradict sensing motion varying theories exist cause sensory conflict theory notes eyes view motion riding moving vehicle body sensors sense stillness creating conflict eyes inner ear another suggests eyes mostly see interior car motionless vestibular system inner ear senses motion vehicle goes around corners hills even small bumps therefore effect worse looking may lessened looking outside vehicle early century austrohungarian scientist róbert bárány observed back forth movement eyes railroad passengers looked side windows scenery whipping called railway nystagmus also known optokinetic nystagmus findings published journal laeger air sickness kind terrestrial motion sickness induced certain sensations air specific form motion sickness considered normal response healthy individuals essentially carsickness occurs airplane airplane may bank tilt sharply unless passengers sitting window likely see stationary interior plane due small window sizes flights night another factor flight view windows may blocked clouds preventing passengers seeing moving ground passing cloudscitation needed seasickness form terrestrial motion sickness characterized feeling nausea extreme cases vertigo experienced spending time essentially carsickness though motion watercraft tends regular typically brought rocking motion movement craft immersed airsickness difficult visually detect motion even one looks outside boat since water offer fixed points visually judge motion poor visibility conditions fog may worsen seasickness greatest contributor seasickness tendency people

sea called gaining ones sea legs take significant portion time spent sea disembarking regain sense stability postsea legs rotating devices centrifuges used astronaut training amusement park rides rotor mission space gravitron cause motion sickness many people interior centrifuge appear move one experience sense motiondubious discuss addition centrifugal force cause vestibular system give one sense downward direction away center centrifuge rather true downward one spins stops suddenly fluid inner ear continues rotate causing sense continued spinning ones visual system longer detects motioncitation needed usually vr programs would detect motion users head adjust rotation vision avoid dizziness however cases system lagging software crashing could cause lags screen updates cases even small head motions could trigger motion sickness defense mechanism mentioned inner ear transmits brain senses motion eyes tell brain everything still cases motion detected visual system hence motion seen motion little motion sensed vestibular system motion sickness arising situations referred visually induced motion sickness zero gravity interferes vestibular systems gravitydependent operations two systems vestibular visual longer provide unified coherent sensory representation causes unpleasant disorientation sensations often quite distinct terrestrial motion sickness similar symptoms symptoms may intense condition caused prolonged weightlessness usually quite unfamiliarcitation needed space motion sickness effectively unknown earliest spaceflights cramped conditions spacecraft allowed minimal bodily motion especially head motion space motion sickness seems aggravated able freely move around common larger around space shuttle astronauts experienced first flight first case space motion sickness thought soviet cosmonaut gherman titov august onboard vostok reported dizziness nausea vomiting first severe cases early apollo flights frank borman apollo rusty schweickart apollo experienced identifiable quite unpleasant latter case causing mission plan modifiedcitation needed type terrestrial motion sickness particularly prevalent susceptible people watching films presented large screens imax may also occur regular format theaters even watching tv playing games sake novelty imax panoramic type theaters often show dramatic motions flying landscape riding roller coaster type motion sickness prevented closing ones eyes scenescitation needed regularformat theaters example movie caused motion sickness many people blair witch project theaters warned patrons possible nauseating effects cautioning pregnant women particular blair witch filmed handheld camcorder subjected considerably motion average movie lacks stabilization mechanisms steadicams home movies often filmed cell phone camera also tend cause motion sickness view person holding cell phone camera usually unaware recording made since sense motion seems match motion seen cameras viewfinder view film afterward see movement may considerable without sense motion using zoom function seems contribute motion sickness well since zooming normal function eye use tripod camera cell phone image stabilization filming reduce effectcitation needed motion sickness due virtual reality similar simulation sickness motion sickness due virtual reality effect made acute external reference points blocked vision simulated images threedimensional cases stereo sound may also give sense motion simulator located national advanced driving simulator capable accurately stimulating vestibular system horizontal field view degrees freedom motion studies shown exposure rotational motions virtual environment cause significant increases nausea symptoms motion study conducted us army research

posteffects kind reported symptoms dissipated less one hour reported symptoms lasted longer four hours reported symptoms lasted longer six hours also four reported cases spontaneously occurring moving within rotating reference frame centrifuge environment gravity simulated centrifugal force coriolis effect causes sense motion vestibular system match motion seencitation needed various hypotheses attempt explain cause condition contemporary sensory conflict theory referring discontinuity either visual proprioceptive somatosensory input semicircular canal otolith input probably thoroughly according theory brain presents mind two incongruous states motion result often nausea symptoms disorientation known motion sickness conditions happen vestibular system visual system present synchronized unified representation ones body according sensory conflict theory cause terrestrial motion sickness opposite cause space motion sickness former occurs one perceives visually ones surroundings relatively immobile vestibular system reports ones body motion relative latter occur visual system perceives ones surroundings motion vestibular system reports relative bodily immobility zero gravitycitation needed variation sensory conflict theory known neural mismatch implying mismatch occurring ongoing sensory experience longterm memory rather components vestibular visual systems theory emphasizes limbic system integration sensory information longterm memory expression symptoms motion sickness impact antimotionsickness drugs stress hormones limbic system function limbic system may neural mismatch center also proposed motion sickness could function defense mechanism area postrema brain responsible inducing vomiting poisons detected resolving conflicts vision balance feeling motion seeing example cabin ship portholes inner ear transmits brain senses motion eyes tell brain everything still result incongruity brain concludes individual hallucinating concludes hallucination due poison ingestion brain responds inducing vomiting clear supposed toxin treismans indirect argument recently questioned via alternative direct evolutionary hypothesis well modified extended via direct poison direct evolutionary hypothesis essentially argues plausible means ancient real apparent motion could contributed directly evolution aversive reactions without need coopting poison response posited treisman nevertheless direct poison hypothesis argues still plausible ways bodys poison response system may played role shaping evolution signature symptoms characterize motion sicknesscitation needed yet another theory known nystagmus proposed based stimulation vagus nerve resulting stretching traction extraocular muscles cooccurring eye movements caused vestibular stimulation three critical aspects theory first close linkage activity vestibular system ie semicircular canals otolith organs change tonus among various eyes six extraocular muscles thus exception voluntary eye movements vestibular oculomotor systems thoroughly linked second operation sherringtons describing reciprocal inhibition agonistantagonist muscle pairs implication stretching extraocular muscle must occur whenever sherringtons law made fail thereby causing unrelaxed contracted muscle stretched finally critical presence afferent output vagus nerves direct result eye muscle stretch thus tenth nerve stimulation resulting eye muscle stretch proposed cause motion sickness theory explains labyrinthinedefective individuals immune motion symptoms emerge undergoing various bodyhead accelerations combinations voluntary reflexive eye movements may challenge proper operation sherringtons law many drugs suppress eye movements also serve suppress motion sickness recent theory argues main reason motion sickness occurs due imbalance vestibular outputs favoring semicircular canals nauseogenic vs otolith organs antinauseogenic theory attempts integrate previous theories motion sickness example many sensory conflicts associated motion sickness many canal stimulation occurs absence normal otolith function eg free fall provocative vestibular imbalance theory also tied different roles otoliths canals autonomic arousal otolith output sympatheticcitation needed diagnosis based conditions may present similarly include vestibular disorders benign paroxysmal positional vertigo vestibular migraine treatment may include behavioral measures behavioral measures decrease motion sickness include holding head still lying focusing horizon may also listening music mindful
