stem cell laws policy united states complicated legal political history stem cells cells found multicellular organisms isolated mice humans humans many types stem cells varying levels potency potency measure cells differentiation potential number cell types made stem cell embryonic stem cells pluripotent stem cells derived inner cell mass blastocyst stem cells differentiate cells human body subject much scientific research however since must derived early human embryos production use research hotly debated topic stem cell treatments type cell therapy introduce new cells adult bodies possible treatment cancer diabetes neurological disorders medical conditions stem cells used repair tissue damaged disease cloning also might done stem cells pluripotent stem cells also derived somatic cell nuclear transfer laboratory technique clone embryo created donor nucleus somatic cell nuclear transfer also tightly regulated amongst various countries recently principal source human embryonic stem cells donated embryos fertility clinics january researchers wake forest university reported stem cells drawn amniotic fluid donated pregnant women hold much promise embryonic stem nih administration president bill clinton issued guidelines allow federal funding embryonic stemcell roe v wade legalized abortion united states five years later first successful human vitro fertilization resulted birth louise brown england developments prompted federal government create regulations barring use federal funds research experimented human nih human embryo research panel advised administration president bill clinton permit federal funding research embryos left vitro fertility treatments also recommended federal funding research embryos specifically created experimentation response panels recommendations clinton administration citing moral ethical concerns declined fund research embryos created solely research agree fund research leftover embryos created vitro fertility treatments point congress intervened passed amendment final bill included dickey amendment signed law bill clinton prohibited federal funding department health human services used research resulted destruction embryo regardless source embryo privately funded research led breakthrough discovery human embryonic stem cells hesc federal law ever ban stem cell research united states placed restrictions funding use congresss power february george w bush requested review nihs guidelines policy discussion within circle supporters implemented policy august year limit number embryonic stem cell lines could used claimed lines would qualify federal funding lines actually april members congress including many moderate republicans signed letter urging president bush expand federal funding embryonic stem cell research beyond bush already supported may house representatives voted loosen limitations federally funded embryonic stemcell research allowing governmentfunded research surplus frozen embryos vitro fertilization clinics used stem cell research permission donors despite bushs promise veto july senate majority leader william h frist rtn announced favored loosening restrictions federal funding embryonic stem cell july senate passed three different bills concerning stem cell research senate passed first bill would made legal federal government spend federal money embryonic stem cell research uses embryos left vitro fertilization procedures july president bush vetoed bill second bill makes illegal create grow abort fetuses research purposes third bill would encourage research would isolate pluripotent ie embryoniclike stem cells without destruction human embryos national institutes health hundreds funding opportunities researchers interested nih funded million worth stem cell research million specifically used bushs second term july used first presidential veto stem cell research enhancement act stem cell research enhancement act name two similar bills vetoed president george w bush enacted law new jersey congressman chris smith wrote stem cell therapeutic research act signed law president bush provided million adult stem cell therapy umbilical cord blood bone marrow treatment authorized million collection cord blood stem cells executive order march president barack obama removed certain restrictions federal funding research involving new lines human embryonic stem prior president obamas executive order federal funding limited nonembryonic stem cell research embryonic stem cell research based upon embryonic stem cell lines existence prior august federal funding originating current appropriations department health human services including national institutes health omnibus appropriations act remains prohibited amendment creation human embryo research purposes research human embryo embryos destroyed discarded knowingly subjected risk injury death greater allowed research fetuses utero speech signing executive order president obama noted following today executive order sign bring change many scientists researchers doctors innovators patients loved ones hoped fought past eight years lift ban federal funding promising embryonic stem cell research vigorously support scientists pursue research aim america lead world discoveries one day may united states district court threw lawsuit challenged use federal funds embryonic stem cell decision case remand united states court appeals district columbia bill passed new jersey legislature december signed law governor james mcgreevey january permits human cloning purpose developing harvesting human stem cells specifically legalizes process cloning human embryo implanting clone womb provided clone aborted used medical research missouri constitutional amendment missouri amendment two law legalized certain forms embryonic stem cell research state california voters november approved proposition creating billion state taxpayerfunded institute stem cell research california institute regenerative medicine hopes provide million year however june delays implementation california program believed delays continue significant future july governor arnold schwarzenegger rcalif authorized million loans institute attempt jump start process funding several states initially believed national migration biotech researchers shown interest providing funding support embryonic adult stem cell research states include connecticut florida illinois massachusetts missouri new hampshire new york pennsylvania texas around area washington wisconsin states shown interest additional restrictions even complete bans embryonic stem cell research states include arkansas iowa kansas louisiana nebraska north dakota south dakota virginia states play catchup stem cells usa today december arkansas indiana louisiana michigan subsequently reversed constitutional amendment north dakota south dakota passed laws prohibit creation destruction human embryos medical policy stances stem cell research various political leaders united states always predictable rule democratic party leaders highprofile supporters even rank file members pushed laws policies almost exclusively favoring embryonic stem cell president bill clinton supported nihs guidelines major candidates supported bills particular hillary rodham clinton bill clintons first lady u senator new barack obama us senator illinois promised sign efca law cosponsor massachusetts governor deval patrick also proponent embryonic stem cell research democrats asked boundaries placed human embryo use example carolyn mccarthy publicly stated supports using human embryos would republicans largely oppose embryonic stem cell research favor adult stem cell research already produced cures treatments cancer paralysis example highprofile exceptions offer qualified support embryonic stem cell prominent republican leaders embryonic stem cell research include sarah palin jim talent rick santorum sam july sen bill frist rtn sen orrin hatch rut vocal abortion opponent called limited federal funding embryonic stemcell research house speaker dennis hastert ril republican house leaders came opposition federal funding embryonic stem cell research gop presidential candidate john mccain member republican main street partnership supported embryonic stem cell despite earlier july said moment support stem cell research potential curing terrible diseases afflict described agonizing tough decision voted allow research using human embryos left fertility former first lady nancy reagan senator orrin hatch also support stem cell research first opposing former senator frist also supports stem cell research despite initially supported past restrictions embryonic stem cell research vp candidate palin opposed embryonic stem cell research said causes destruction life thus research inconsistent prolife position support moderates libertarians support research limits lincoln chafee supported federal funding embryonic stem cell research ron paul republican congressman physician libertarian independent candidate president sponsored much legislation quite complex positions several studies examined impact changing funding policies scientific research us development new cell therapies industry example studies highlighted immediate sizable drop research productivity usbased researchers compared researchers based elsewhere years enactment august federal funding restrictions research involving new embryonic stem cell us knowledge production human embryonic stem cell field fell percent anticipated levels measured terms forward citations core research publications field usbased followon work human embryonic stem cell research field declined nearly percent relative nonusbased research period period us based firms also less likely launch new therapeutic product development projects cell therapy field firms outside us likely discontinue clinical trials new cell therapies already effects reversed funding environment stem cell research us became favorable second half united states national academies released guidelines human embryonic stem cell research guidelines prepared enhance integrity human embryonic stem cell research publics perception actuality encouraging responsible practices conduct research national academies subsequently named human embryonic stem cell research advisory committee keep guidelines guidelines preserve two primary principles first hesc research potential improve understanding human health discover new ways treat illness second individuals donating embryos freely voluntary informed consent guidelines implement executive order apply hesc research receiving funds nih guidelines detail safeguards protect donating individuals acquiring informed consent protecting identity addition guidelines contain multiple sections applying embryos donated us abroad effective date nih guidelines define hesc research eligible receive nih funding series
