pain empathy specific variety empathy involves recognizing understanding another persons pain empathy mental ability allows one person understand another persons mental emotional state effectively respond person several cues communicate pain another person visualization injurycausing event injury behavioral efforts injured avoid harm displays pain distress facial expressions crying person receives cues another person pain neural pain circuits within receivers brain activated evolutionary perspective pain empathy beneficial human group survival since provides motivation noninjured people offer aid injured avoid injury themselvescitation needed person perceives another persons affective state experience changes brain activity known resonance help initiate empathetic response inferior frontal gyrus inferior parietal lobule two regions brain associated withclarification needed empathy order empathy another person one must understand context persons experience maintaining

motor cortex person observing another persons actions increases corticospinal excitability associated motor resonanceclarification needed transcranial magnetic stimulation studies show frontal structures motor resonance systemclarification needed process information peoples physical sensorimotor contagion takes place corticospinal excitability reduces due observing another person experiencing pain study avenanti pain empathy racial bias showed person sees needle poked hand another person reduced motor evoked potential muscle observers lack empathy occurs several conditions including autism schizophrenia sadistic personality disorder psychopathy sociopathy one interpretation improper ratio cortical excitability inhibition causes empathy defects brain stimulation investigated potential alter motor resonance pain empathy selfother discrimination mentalizing way treat empathy related schizophrenic patients impaired several empathy domains less able identify emotions take different perspectives perform low level facial mirroring less sensitive terms affective less responsive pain less empathetic others schizophrenic patients exhibit neural structural alterations brain regions normally associated processing empathy temporoparietal junction amygdala part reason schizophrenic individuals difficulties understanding reacting pain others impairing ability empathize one eeg study observed brain activity individuals schizophrenia shown hands feet painful situations results suggested ability separate self others essential empathizing people impaired schizophrenic another study concluded schizophrenic individuals tend process otherrelated pain stimuli way usually associated selfrelevant stimuli processed individuals less able differentiate self schizophrenic subjects participated studies also difficulty assessing discriminating different levels pain example one study schizophrenia less likely able discriminate strong moderate pain levels control subjects subjects schizophrenia also less able rate pain intensities looking different facial way individuals empathize pain may caused partially lack sensitivity terms affective processing pain severity increased suspiciousness seen many schizophrenics schizophrenia easily disturbed negative emotions others including pain compared healthy schizophrenics tend feel increased levels personal distress perceiving sign pain personal distress described hyper sensitivity pain overwhelms individual hence impairs ability empathetically respond relate pain others personal level increased levels personal distress may increase individuals need reduce discomfort result give less attention empathize less pain psychopathy thought caused normal processing social emotional cues abnormal use one fmri study looked brain activity youth aggressive conduct disorder socially normal youth observed empathy eliciting stimuli results showed aggressive conduct disorder group activation amygdala ventral striatum lead researcher believe subjects may get rewarding feeling viewing pain autismspectrum disorders characterized impairment processing social emotional affective young individuals callous unemotional traits cu exhibit lack empathy person experiences pain empathy less motivated hurt others since people experience pain empathy distress another person hurt one study showed juvenile psychopaths video clips strangers experiencing painful stimuli results showed juvenile psychopaths processed pain empathy eliciting stimuli atypically comparison normal juvenile controls central late positive potential lpp late cognitive evaluative component pain decreased subjects low cu traits subjects high cu traits decrease central lpp frontal early affective arousal component pain also differences pain thresholds normal test subjects subjects low cu traits subjects high cu traits subjects cu traits higher pain thresholds controls suggests less sensitive noxious pain results show cutrait juveniles lack pain empathy due lack arousal due another persons distress rather lack understanding others emotional evidence individual empathetic responses pain others biased based racial identity ingroupoutgroup status position social hierarchy experiences pain empathy also vary depending differences personality level threat sensitivity individual individual highly sensitive threat intense empathetic reactions others pain compared experiment used minimal group paradigmclarification needed create two groups ingroup outgroup assigned healthy right handed
