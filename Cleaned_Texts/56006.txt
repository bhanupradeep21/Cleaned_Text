photobioreactor pbr refers cultivation system designed growing photoautotrophic organisms using artificial light sources solar light facilitate photosynthesis pbrs typically used cultivate microalgae cyanobacteria pbrs open systems raceway ponds rely upon natural sources light carbon dioxide closed pbrs flexible systems controlled physiological requirements cultured organism resulting optimal growth rates purity levels pbrs typically used cultivation bioactive compounds biofuels pharmaceuticals industrial first approach controlled production phototrophic organisms natural open pond artificial raceway pond therein culture suspension contains necessary nutrients carbon dioxide pumped around cycle directly illuminated sunlight via liquids surface raceway ponds still commonly used industry due low operational cost comparison closed pbrs however offer insufficient control reaction conditions due reliance environmental light supply carbon dioxide well possible contamination microorganisms using open technologies also result losses water due evaporation construction closed pbrs avoids systemrelated water losses minimises though closed systems better productivity compared open systems due advantages mentioned still need improved make suitable production low price commodities cell density remains low due several limiting modern photobioreactors tried balance thin layer
