bionics biologically inspired engineering application biological methods systems found nature study design engineering systems modern word bionic coined jack e steele august portmanteau biology popularized us television series six million dollar man bionic woman based novel cyborg martin caidin three stories feature humans given various superhuman powers electromechanical implants according proponents bionic technology transfer technology lifeforms manufactured objects desirable evolutionary pressure typically forces living become optimized efficient example dirt waterrepellent paint coating inspired hydrophobic properties lotus flower plant lotus term biomimetic preferred references chemical reactions reactions nature involve biological macromolecules eg enzymes nucleic acids whose chemistry replicated vitro using much smaller examples bionics engineering include hulls boats imitating thick skin dolphins sonar radar medical ultrasound imaging imitating animal echolocation field computer science study bionics produced artificial neurons artificial neural swarm intelligence bionics also influenced evolutionary computation took idea simulating evolution silico producing optimized solutions never appeared nature research article estimated present overlap biology technology terms mechanisms needed name biomimetics coined otto schmitt term bionics later introduced jack e steele august working aeronautics division house wrightpatterson air force base dayton however terms like biomimicry biomimetics preferred order avoid confusion medical term bionics coincidentally martin caidin used word novel cyborg adapted television film subsequent series six million dollar man caidin longtime aviation industry writer turning fiction fulltime study bionics often emphasizes implementing function found nature rather imitating biological structures example computer science cybernetics tries model feedback control mechanisms inherent intelligent behavior artificial intelligence tries model intelligent function regardless particular way achieved conscious copying examples mechanisms natural organisms ecologies form applied casebased reasoning treating nature database solutions already work proponents argue selective pressure placed natural life forms minimizes removes failures although almost engineering could said form biomimicry modern origins field usually attributed buckminster fuller later codification house field study janine benyus generally three biological levels fauna flora technology modeled bionics refers flow concepts biology engineering vice versa hence two slightly different points view regarding meaning word medicine bionics means replacement enhancement organs body parts mechanical versions bionic implants differ mere prostheses mimicking original function closely even surpassing german equivalent bionics bionik always adheres broader meaning tries develop engineering solutions biological models approach motivated fact biological solutions usually optimized evolutionary forces technologies make bionic implants possible developing gradually successful bionic devices exist well known one australianinvented multichannel cochlear implant bionic ear device deaf people since bionic ear many bionic devices emerged work progressing bionics solutions sensory disorders eg vision balance bionic research recently provided treatments medical problems neurological psychiatric conditions example parkinsons disease colombian researcher alvaro rios poveda developed upper limb hand prosthesis sensory feedback technology allows amputee patients handle prosthetic hand systems natural fully functional artificial hearts developed significant progress expected advent nanotechnology wellknown example proposed
