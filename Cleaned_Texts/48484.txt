anismus dyssynergic defecation failure normal relaxation pelvic floor muscles attempted defecation occur children adults men women although common women caused physical defects occur reasons unknown reasons anismus behavioral cause could viewed similarities parcopresis psychogenic fecal retentioncitation needed symptoms include tenesmus sensation incomplete emptying rectum defecation occurred constipation retention stool may result fecal loading retention mass stool consistency fecal impaction retention mass hard stool mass may stretch walls rectum colon causing megarectum andor megacolon respectively liquid stool may leak around fecal impaction possibly causing degrees liquid fecal incontinence usually termed encopresis soiling children fecal leakage soiling liquid fecal incontinence adults anismus usually treated dietary adjustments dietary fiber supplementation also treated type biofeedback therapy sensor probe inserted persons anal canal order record pressures exerted pelvic

colorectal anatomy physiology including normal defecation mechanism helpful relevant anatomy includes rectum anal canal muscles pelvic floor especially puborectalis external anal sphinctercitation

defecation temporarily delayed socially acceptable defecate continent individuals rectum expand degree accommodate functioncitation needed anal canal short straight section bowel rectum anus defined functionally distance anorectal ring end internal anal sphincter internal anal sphincter forms walls anal canal internal anal sphincter voluntary control normal persons contracted times except need defecate means internal anal sphincter contributes resting tone anal canal external anal sphincter internal sphincter responsible creating watertight seal therefore provides continence liquid stool elementscitation needed puborectalis muscle one pelvic floor muscles skeletal muscle therefore voluntary control puborectalis originates posterior aspect pubic bone runs backwards looping around bowel point rectum joins anal canal known anorectal ring level puborectalis muscle loops around bowel front arrangement means puborectalis contracted pulls junction rectum anal canal forwards creating angle bowel called anorectal angle angle prevents movement stool stored rectum moving anal canal thought responsible gross continence solid stool believe anorectal angle one important contributors conversely relaxation puborectalis reduces pull junction rectum anal canal causing anorectal angle straighten squatting posture also known straighten anorectal angle meaning less effort required defecate distension rectum normally causes internal anal sphincter relax rectoanal inhibitory response rair external anal sphincter initially contract rectoanal excitatory reflex raer relaxation internal anal sphincter involuntary response external anal sphincter contrast made skeletal striated muscle therefore voluntary control contract vigorously short time contraction external sphincter defer defecation time pushing stool anal canal back rectum voluntary signal defecate sent back brain abdominal muscles contract straining causing intraabdominal pressure increase pelvic floor lowered causing anorectal angle straighten external anal sphincter relaxes rectum contracts shortens peristaltic waves thus forcing fecal material rectum anal canal anus internal external anal sphincters along puborectalis muscle allow feces passed pulling anus exiting feces shortening contracting actionscitation needed patients anismus puborectalis external anal sphincter muscles fail relax resultant

contracted pelvic floor instead increasing abdominal cavity pressures lowering pelvic cavity pressures may scenario develops due stress example one study reported anismus strongly associated sexual abuse one paper stated events pregnancy childbirth gynaecological descent neurogenic disturbances brainbowel axis could lead functional obstructed defecation syndrome including anismus may develop persons extrapyramidal motor disturbance due parkinsons represents type focal anismus may also occur anorectal malformation rectal rectal many cases however underlying pathophysiology patients presenting obstructed defecation authors commented puborectalis paradox spastic pelvic floor concepts objective data support validity state new evidence showing defecation integrated process colonic rectal emptying suggests anismus may much complex simple disorder pelvic floor persistent failure fully evacuate stool may lead retention mass stool rectum fecal loading become hardened forming fecal impaction even fecalithscitation needed liquid stool elements may leak around retained fecal mass may lead paradoxical diarrhoea andor fecal leakage usually known encopresis children fecal leakage

alleviate anismus include dietary adjustments simple adjustments attempting defecate supplementation bulking agent psyllium mg per day make stool bulky decreases effort required similarly exercise adequate hydration may help optimise stool form anorectal angle shown flatten squatting position thus recommended patients functional outlet obstruction like patient unable assume squatting postures due mobility issues low stool used raise feet sitting effectively achieves similar positioncitation needed treatments anismus include biofeedback retraining botox injections surgical resection anismus
