human embryonic development human embryogenesis development formation human embryo characterised processes cell division cellular differentiation embryo occurs early stages development biological terms development human body entails growth onecelled zygote adult human fertilization occurs sperm cell successfully enters fuses egg cell ovum genetic material sperm egg combine form single cell zygote germinal stage development commences embryonic development human covers first eight weeks development beginning ninth week embryo termed fetus eight weeks stages human embryology study development first eight weeks fertilization normal period gestation pregnancy nine months weeks germinal stage refers time fertilization development early embryo implantation completed uterus germinal stage takes around stage zygote begins divide process called cleavage blastocyst formed implants uterus embryogenesis continues next stage gastrulation three germ layers embryo form process called histogenesis processes neurulation organogenesis follow comparison embryo fetus recognizable external features complete set developing organs entire process embryogenesis involves coordinated spatial temporal changes gene expression cell growth cellular differentiation nearly identical process occurs species especially among chordates fertilization takes place spermatozoon successfully entered ovum two sets genetic material carried gametes fuse together resulting zygote single diploid cell usually takes place ampulla one fallopian tubes zygote contains combined genetic material carried male female gametes consists chromosomes nucleus ovum chromosomes nucleus sperm chromosomes undergo changes prior mitotic division leads formation embryo two cells successful fertilization enabled three processes also act controls ensure speciesspecificity first chemotaxis directs movement sperm towards secondly adhesive compatibility sperm egg occurs sperm adhered ovum third process acrosomal reaction takes place front part spermatozoan head capped acrosome contains digestive enzymes break zona pellucida allow entry sperm causes calcium released blocks entry sperm parallel reaction takes place ovum called zona reaction sees release cortical granules release enzymes digest sperm receptor proteins thus preventing granules also fuse plasma membrane modify zona pellucida way prevent sperm entry beginning cleavage process marked zygote divides mitosis two cells mitosis continues first two cells divide four cells eight cells division takes hours zygote large compared cell undergoes cleavage without overall increase size means successive subdivision ratio nuclear cytoplasmic material initially dividing cells called blastomeres blastos greek sprout undifferentiated aggregated
