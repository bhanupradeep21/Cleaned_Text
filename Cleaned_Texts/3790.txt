genetic algorithms evolutionary computation crossover also called recombination genetic operator used combine genetic information two parents generate new offspring one way stochastically generate new solutions existing population analogous crossover happens sexual reproduction biology solutions also generated cloning existing solution analogous asexual reproduction newly generated solutions may mutated added population different algorithms evolutionary computation may use different data structures store genetic information genetic representation recombined different crossover operators typical data structures recombined crossover bit arrays vectors real numbers trees list operators presented means complete serves mainly exemplary illustration dyadic genetic operator type operators details found traditional genetic algorithms store genetic information chromosome represented bit array crossover methods bit arrays popular illustrative example genetic recombination point parents chromosomes picked randomly designated crossover point bits right point swapped two parent chromosomes results two offspring carrying genetic information parents twopoint crossover two crossover
