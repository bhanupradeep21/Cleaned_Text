hemisphere separate functions must integrate abilities instead separating levy also claims human activity uses one side brain french study hommet billiard published questioned sperry gazzanigas study severing corpus callosum actually divides hemispheres brain found children born without corpus callosum demonstrated information transmitted hemispheres concluded subcortical connections must present

world differently rest us study suggested communication brain hemispheres necessary imaging simulating ones mind movements others morins research inner speech suggested alternative interpretation commissurotomy according splitbrain patients exhibit two uneven streams selfawareness complete one left hemisphere primitive one right two hemispheres cerebral cortex linked corpus callosum

investigation claimed difference two hemispheres left hemisphere analytic logical right hemisphere holistic many simple tasks especially comprehension inputs require functions specific right left hemispheres together form onedirection systematized way creating outputclarification needed communication coordination occurs corpus callosum structure brain along longitudinal fissure facilitates much communication two hemispheres structure composed white matter millions axons dendrites terminal boutons projecting right left hemisphere however evidence corpus callosum may also inhibitory postmortem research human monkey brains shows corpus callosum functionally organization results modalityspecific regions corpus callosum responsible transfer different types information research revealed anterior midbody transfers motor information posterior midbody transfers somatosensory information isthmus transfers auditory information splenium transfers visual although much interhemispheric transfer occurs corpus callosum trace amounts transfer via commissural pathways anterior commissure posterior commissure habenular commissure hippocampal studies effects visual pathway splitbrained patients revealed redundancy gain ability target detection benefit multiple copies target simple reaction time simple response visual stimuli splitbrained patients experience faster reaction time bilateral stimuli predicted model proposed iacoboni et suggests splitbrained patients experience asynchronous activity causes stronger signal thus decreased reaction time iacoboni also suggests exists dual attention splitbrained patients implies cerebral hemisphere attentional alternative approach taken reuterlorenz et suggests enhanced redundancy gain split brain primarily due slowing responses unilateral stimuli rather speeding responses bilateral ones important note simple reaction time splitbrained patients even enhanced redundancy gain slower reaction time normal
