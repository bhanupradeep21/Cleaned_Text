oocytogenesis part oogenesis results formation primary oocytes fetal period secondary oocytes part ovulation oocytes rich cytoplasm contains yolk granules nourish cell early development primary oocyte

cumulusoocyte complex contains layers tightly packed cumulus cells surrounding oocyte graafian follicle oocyte arrested meiosis ii stage metaphase ii considered secondary oocyte ovulation cumulus complex goes structural change known cumulus expansion granulosa cells transform tightly compacted expanded mucoid matrix many studies show cumulus expansion critical maturation oocyte cumulus complex oocytes direct communication developing follicle environment also plays significant role fertilization though mechanisms entirely known species fate oocyte become fertilized ultimately grow fully functioning organism must ready regulate multiple cellular developmental processes oocyte large complex cell must supplied numerous molecules direct growth embryo control cellular activities oocyte product female gametogenesis maternal contribution oocyte consequently newly fertilized egg enormous many types molecules maternally supplied oocyte direct various activities within growing zygote dna cell vulnerable damaging effect oxidative free radicals produced byproducts cellular metabolism dna damage occurring oocytes repaired lethal result reduced fecundity loss potential progeny oocytes substantially larger average somatic cell thus considerable metabolic activity necessary provisioning metabolic activity carried oocytes metabolic machinery oocyte genome would exposed reactive oxidative byproducts generated thus appears process evolved avoid vulnerability germline dna proposed order avoid damage dna genome oocytes metabolism contributing synthesis much oocytes constituents shifted maternal cells transferred constituents thus oocytes many organisms protected oxidative dna damage storing large mass substances nurture zygote initial embryonic growth growth oocyte variety
