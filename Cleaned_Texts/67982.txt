laminotomy orthopaedic neurosurgical procedure removes part lamina vertebral arch order relieve pressure vertebral laminotomy less invasive conventional vertebral column surgery techniques laminectomy leaves ligaments muscles attached spinous process intact requires removing less bone result laminotomies typically faster recovery time result fewer postoperative complications nevertheless possible risks occur procedure like infection hematomas dural laminotomies commonly performed treatment lumbar spinal stenosis herniated mri ct scans often used pre post surgery determine procedure spinal cord housed bony hollow tube called vertebral vertebral column composed many ringlike bones called vertebra plural vertebrae spans skull sacrum vertebra hole center called vertebral foramen spinal cord laminae singular lamina anatomical structures primary importance laminotomy laminae part vertebral arch region bone back side vertebra forms protective covering back side spinal vertebral arch composed several anatomical features addition laminae must taken account performing laminotomy center vertebral arch bony projection called spinous spinous process located posterior back side vertebra serves attachment point ligaments muscles support stabilize vertebral vertebra two lateral bony projections called transverse processes located either side vertebral arch transverse processes come contact ribs serve attachment points muscles ligaments stabilize vertebral lamina segment bone connects spinous process transverse process vertebra two lamina one side spinous different types laminotomy defined type instrument used visualize procedure vertebra procedure performed whether lamina vertebra operated common types laminotomy classifications laminotomies combined form descriptive name procedure possible example endoscopic unilateral lumbar laminotomy removal bone one lamina lumbar vertebrae using procedure laminotomy remains largely regardless instrument used level vertebrae operated laminotomies require general spinal anesthesia frequently require hospital stay following duration stay depends physical condition individual reason laminotomy takes minutes depending type procedure unilateral laminotomies typically require less time bone removed one lamina whereas bilateral laminotomies usually take time bone removed laminae level vertebrae laminotomy performed instrument used produce significant differences length unilateral bilateral laminotomies performed shorter time period compared conventional laminectomy takes minutes laminotomy individual lies stomach back facing towards initial incision made middle back exposing vertebrae laminotomy procedure spinous process ligaments vertebral column kept intact muscles adjacent vertebral column known paraspinous muscles example spinalis muscle must separated spinous process vertebral unilateral laminotomy muscles detached side laminotomy performed bilateral laminotomy muscles must removed sides ligaments connecting lamina upper lower vertebrae known ligamenta flava often removed remodeled procedure adjust small amount bone using either microscope endoscope visual procedure small surgical drill used remove part bone one laminae laminotomies performed multiple vertebrae surgery known multilevel slightly different commonly used procedure laminotomy unilateral laminotomy bilateral spinal minimally invasive procedure often used treat patients excessive pressure vertebral column must procedure spinal ligaments kept intact paraspinous muscles must still unilateral laminotomy performed one lamina removal bone one lamina provides opening spinal canal using microscope endoscope visualize procedure surgical tools inserted opening spinal canal surgical tools navigated underneath spinous process across spinal canal reach lamina opposite side vertebra perform second incision procedure smaller doctors need access one lamina yet perform bilateral bone lamina single unilateral laminotomy bilateral spinal decompression procedure developed almost years ago common successful surgical treatment lumbar spinal laminotomy typically used relieve pressure spinal canal excessive pressure spinal canal causes spinal canal spinal nerves compressed painful impair motor control andor sensation common disorder causes increased pressure spinal canal lumbar spinal stenosis lumbar spinal stenosis formally defined decline diameter length either neural foramina lateral recess spinal stenosis classified decaying disease causes canal gradually become narrow cause pain loss common symptoms lumbar stenosis pain fatigue weakness muscle stenosis caused old age injury vertebral column usually requires ct scan mri performing laminotomy relieve pressure spinal canal caused lumbar stenosis therefore alleviate laminotomies also performed create window spinal laminotomies frequently used way surgically repair spinal disc herniation level vertebral column cervical thoracic herniated disc compress spinal nerves cause intense pain impaired removing portion lamina allows physicians able access repair herniated disc laminotomies may also used treat intraspinal lesions spinal tumor problems blood vessels supplying spinal scenario inside spinal canal must accessed increase pressure spinal canal laminotomy may used treat disorder alleviate laminotomy procedure many benefits preferred spinal surgery since less invasive spinal procedures laminectomy spinal laminotomy procedure done patients great improvement pain laminotomies usually safer surgeries open surgery usually shorter spinal decompression procedures average duration minutes whereas decompression surgeries duration anywhere minutes laminotomies usually cost efficient surgical decompression surgeries seen laminotomies around whereas surgical procedures around smaller skin incisions scarring well less surgical trauma also benefit procedure usually faster recovery time shorter hospital stay one necessary surgery also benefit minimizing injury muscles ligaments bones spine since invasive surgeries greater risk damaging general anesthesia usually required postoperative spinal instability typically since procedure surgical technique many complications occur either surgery major complications occur cerebrospinal fluid leaks dural tears infection epidural death also risk however occurs per thousand potential complications nerve root damage lead nerve injury paraplegia significant amount blood loss lead blood historically laminectomies primary way treat lumbar spinal laminectomy invasive method aim decrease total amount pain numbness associated lumbar spinal surgery eliminates entire lamina allow nerves around region function laminectomies also often produce longer recovery time well greater risk postoperative complications typically damage surrounding muscle tissue accompanied since laminectomy involves excision entire lamina laminectomy usually cause spinal instability going option laminotomy procedure reduces total amount muscle severed laminotomy damage spinous process critical ligaments much muscle weakness pain lumbar instability seen laminotomies fairly new compared laminectomies involves using less invasive methods precise instruments minimize risk tissue radiographic imaging xray least effective way collect information observing patient lumbar spinal stenosis ct scan provides compiled view vertebrae precise since mri provides excellent imaging blood vessels tissues recognized best type imaging observe signs associated lumbar compression precise measurement diameter spinal canal particularly important component determining severity stenosis high strength mri machines utilized due increased vascular imaging capabilities better resolution capacity allows detailed observations healthcare provider sharp contrast high power mri outlines details vertebra critical examining patient lumbar spinal stenosis may need mri scanning post invasive surgery used see quality surgery yet appropriate postoperative time elapsed conducting mri debated ct scan effective imaging technique observing lumbar abnormalities however supplement mri detecting certain degenerative processes determining whether laminotomy beneficial patient healthcare provider must assess severity possible abnormalities potential reasons laminotomy performed lumbar spinal stenosis chief reason ct scans used specifically pinpoint buckled lumbar ligamentum flavum well facet hypertrophy main pathophysiological changes indicative lumbar spinal even though ct scan reveal pertinent signs lumbar spinal stenosis sometimes give cloudy image due shadowing tissue contrast occurs intrathecal myelography contrast conducted ct scan fix abnormal contrast ct scan also reveal increase cross sectional area vertebrae ultimately decreases cross sectional area spinal increase size vertebrae occurs pressure builds cauda equina commonly causing pain lower back lower extremities cauda equina compression also due stenosis region even though ct scan allows intensive image studying fixed nature image collection process alone enough reach definitive diagnosis lumbar spinal stenosis outcome ct scan help compile physiological evidence patient lumbar spinal stenosis patient may potentially benefit laminotomy improve quality static imaging processes ct scan also used observing changes spinal canal features laminotomy one main signs lumbar spinal stenosis thickening ligamentum flavum causing expand towards spinal observing cross sectional area spinal canal human cadaver found area decreased due ligamentum flavum thickening ligamentum flavum appear alter dynamic alterations dimensions spinal cord even intervertebral disc removed ligamentum flavum appear factor change dimensions spinal understanding magnitude role ligamentum flavum hypertrophy plays lumbar sacral stenosis necessity invasive lumbar spinal procedure accurately measuredcitation needed minimally invasive procedures common alternative due decreased risk damaging significant muscle tissue difference invasive minimally invasive spinal surgeries minimally invasive procedures involves series small incisions minimally invasive procedures performed anywhere along spine used treat various percutaneous pedicle screw fixation technique allows procedure presents minimal risk patient fluoroscopic image guided navigation portals allows surgeons perform efficient procedures minimally invasive procedures often yield much faster recovery time fully invasive surgeries making appealing patients laminectomies always gold standard treating lumbar spinal stenosis recently less invasive surgeries emerged safer alternative treatment helps maintain postoperative structural integrity spinal
