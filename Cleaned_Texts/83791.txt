takayasus arteritis ta also known aortic arch syndrome nonspecific aortoarteritis pulseless form large vessel granulomatous massive intimal fibrosis vascular narrowing commonly affecting young middleaged women asian descent though anyone affected mainly affects aorta main blood vessel leaving heart branches well pulmonary arteries females times likely affected disease often notice symptoms

older due obstruction main branches aorta including left common carotid artery brachiocephalic artery left subclavian artery takayasus arteritis present pulseless upper extremities arms hands wrists weak absent pulses physical examination may also commonly referred pulseless disease involvement renal arteries may lead presentation renovascular hypertension people develop initial inflammatory phase characterized systemic illness signs symptoms malaise fever night sweats weight loss joint pain fatigue fainting fainting may result subclavian steal syndrome carotid sinus also often anemia marked elevation esr creactive protein nonspecific markers inflammation initial inflammatory phase often followed secondary pulseless pulseless phase characterized vascular insufficiency intimal narrowing vessels manifesting arm leg claudication renal artery stenosis causing hypertension neurological manifestations due decreased blood flow note function renal artery stenosis causation high blood pressure normally perfused kidneys produce proportionate amount substance called renin stenosis renal arteries causes hypoperfusion decreased blood flow juxtaglomerular apparatus resulting exaggerated secretion renin high blood levels aldosterone eventually leading water salt retention high blood pressure neurological symptoms disease vary depending degree nature blood vessel

arteritis associated anca rheumatoid factor ana anticardiolipin people takayasu arteritis respond steroids prednisone usual starting dose approximately milligram per kilogram body weight per day people approximately milligrams day significant side effects longterm highdose prednisone use starting dose tapered several weeks dose controls symptoms limiting side effects steroidscitation needed promising results achieved mycophenolate treatment kept high standard longterm damage death occurcitation needed patients respond steroids may require revascularization either via vascular bypass angioplasty stenting outcomes following revascularization vary depending severity underlying disease first case takayasu arteritis described japanese ophthalmologist mikito takayasu annual meeting
