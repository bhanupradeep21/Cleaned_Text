dromaeosaurus ˌdroʊmiəˈsɔːrəs running lizard genus dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaur lived late cretaceous period middle late campanian maastrichtian sometime million years ago alberta canada western united states type species dromaeosaurus albertensis described william diller matthew barnum brown fossils unearthed dinosaur park formation teeth attributed genus found prince creek formation dromaeosaurus type genus dromaeosauridae dromaeosaurinae include many genera similar characteristics dromaeosaurus possibly closest relative dakotaraptor dromaeosaurus heavily built dromaeosaurs similar size like velociraptor despite receiving widespread attention popular books dinosaurs usage complete mounted skeleton cast museums throughout world dromaeosaurus poorly known actual preparation popular cast tyrrell museum made possible knowledge gained dromaeosaurids discovered recently first known dromaeosaurus remains discovered paleontologist barnum brown expedition red deer

considered nomina dubia nevertheless grown apparent dromaeosaurus albertensis even rarer habitat small theropods although first dromaeosaurid reasonably good cranial material genus chirostenotes considered synonymous dromaeosaurus one point dromaeosaurus mediumsized carnivore ft length kg lb body mouth full sharp teeth probably would sharply curved sickle claw foot lived campanian stage late cretaceous however fragmentary remains teeth may belong genus found late maastrichtian age hell creek lance formations dating million years teeth also found aguja formation dromaeosaurus relatively robust skull deep snout teeth rather large shaped like curved cone coat enamel covering nine teeth dromaeosaurus also vein back head vena capitis dorsalis drained front neck muscles two long canals running posterior surface meckelian groove dromaeosaurus rather shallow much matthew brown originally placed dromaeosaurus subfamily dromaeosaurinae within deinodontidae known tyrannosauridae based similarities general proportions john h ostrom recognized dromaeosaurus shared many features velociraptor newly discovered deinonychus assigned forms new family since many new relatives dromaeosaurus found exact relationships dromaeosaurus somewhat unclear although rugged build gives primitive appearance actually specialized analysis clade dromaeosaurinae species utahraptor achillobator yurgovuchia genus dakotaraptor classified sister taxon recent analysis recover close relationship cladogram senter et al dromaeosaurus recovered sister taxon yurgovuchia utahraptor bambiraptor adasaurus tsaagan velociraptor deinonychus achillobator dromaeosaurus utahraptor yurgovuchia cladogram follows analysis paleontologists robert depalma david burnham larry martin peter larson robert bakker using updated data theropod working group analysis dromaeosaurus classified sister taxon saurornitholestes velociraptor deinonychus atrociraptor achillobator utahraptor dakotaraptor dromaeosaurus dromaeosaurus differs relatives short massive skull deep mandible robust teeth teeth tend heavily worn relative saurornitholestes suggesting jaws used crushing tearing rather simply slicing flesh therrien et al estimated dromaeosaurus bite nearly three times powerful velociraptor suggested relied jaws sickle claw kill study predominantly centered around shuvuuia dromaeosaurus compared former also tyrannosaurus dromaeosaurus tyrannosaurus discovered diurnal dromaeosaurus feeding habits also discovered typical coelurosaurian theropods characteristic puncture pull feeding method studies wear patterns teeth animal angelica torices et al study regarding theropod feeding habits indicate dromaeosaurid teeth share similar wear patterns seen tyrannosauridae troodontidae respectively however microwear teeth indicated dromaeosaurus likely preferred larger prey items troodontids shared environment differentiations diet likely allowed theropod inhabit environment distant maniraptoran relatives study also indicated dromaeosaurus saurornitholestes also analyzed study likely included bone diet better adapted handle stresses associated attacking struggling prey troodontids equipped weaker jaws preyed softer animals prey items invertebrates carrion feeding strategy ability handle struggling prey also feature theropod also shared tyrannosaurids gorgosaurus
