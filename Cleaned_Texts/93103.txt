ideomotor apraxia often ima neurological disorder characterized inability correctly imitate hand gestures voluntarily mime tool use eg pretend brush ones hair ability spontaneously use tools brushing ones hair morning without instructed may remain intact often lost general concept apraxia classification ideomotor apraxia developed germany late early centuries work hugo liepmann adolph kussmaul arnold pick paul flechsig hermann munk carl nothnagel theodor meynert linguist heymann steinthal among others ideomotor apraxia classified ideokinetic apraxia liepmann due apparent dissociation idea action classifications various subtypes well defined present however owing issues diagnosis pathophysiology ideomotor apraxia hypothesized result disruption system relates stored tool use gesture information state body produce proper motor output system thought related areas brain often seen damaged ideomotor apraxia present left parietal lobe premotor cortex little done present reverse motor deficit seen ideomotor apraxia although extent dysfunction induces entirely clear ideomotor apraxia ima impinges ones ability carry common familiar actions command waving goodbye persons ima exhibit loss ability carry motor movements may show errors hold move tool attempting correct one defining symptoms ideomotor apraxia inability pantomime tool use example normal individual handed comb instructed pretend brush hair would grasp comb properly pass hair repeated patient ideomotor apraxia patient may move comb big circles around head hold upsidedown perhaps try brush teeth error may also temporal nature brushing exceedingly slowly characteristic symptom ideomotor apraxia inability imitate hand gestures meaningless meaningful request meaningless hand gesture something like someone make ninetydegree angle thumb placing nose hand plane face gesture meaning attached contrast meaningful gesture something like saluting waving goodbye important distinction refer actions consciously voluntarily initiated say person specifically asked either imitate someone else given verbal instructions wave goodbye people ideomotor apraxia know supposed eg know wave goodbye arm hand accomplish unable execute motion correctly voluntary type action distinct spontaneous actions ideomotor apraxia patients may still retain ability perform spontaneous motions someone know leaves room instance may able wave goodbye person despite unable request ability perform sort spontaneous action always retained however affected individuals lose capability recognition meaningful gestures eg understanding waving goodbye means seen seems unaffected ideomotor also shown individuals ideomotor apraxia may deficits general spontaneous movements apraxia patients appear unable tap fingers quickly control group lower maximum tapping rate correlated severe apraxia also demonstrated apraxic patients slower point target light sight hand compared healthy patients conditions two groups differ could see hands speed accuracy grasping objects also appears unaffected ideomotor patients ideomotor apraxia appear much reliant visual input conducting movements nonapraxic common cause ideomotor apraxia unilateral ischemic lesion brain damage one hemisphere brain due disruption blood supply stroke variety brain areas lesions correlated ideomotor apraxia initially believed damage subcortical white matter tracts axons extend cells bodies cerebral cortex main area responsible form apraxia lesions basal ganglia may also responsible although considerable debate whether damage basal ganglia alone would sufficient induce apraxia lesions lower brain structures however shown prevalent apraxic patients fact types lesions common nonapraxic patients lesions associated ideomotor apraxia left parietal premotor areas patients lesions supplementary motor area also presented ideomotor lesions corpus callosum also induce apraxiclike symptoms varying effects two hands although thoroughly addition ischemic lesions brain ideomotor apraxia also seen neurodegenerative disorders parkinsons disease alzheimers disease huntingtons disease corticobasal degeneration progressive supranuclear prevailing hypothesis pathophysiology ideomotor apraxia various brain lesions associated disorder somehow disrupt portions praxis praxis system brain regions involved taking processed sensory input accessing stored information tools gestures translating motor output buxbaum et al proposed praxis system involves three distinct parts stored gesture representations stored tool knowledge dynamic body schema first two store information representation gestures brain characteristic movements tools body schema brain model body position space praxis system relates stored information movement type dynamic ie changing body representation varies movement progresses still clear system maps onto brain although research given indications possible locations certain portions dynamic body schema suggested localized superior posterior parietal also evidence inferior parietal lobule may locus storage characteristic movements tool area showed inverse activation cerebellum study tool use tool connections areas become severed praxis system would disrupted possibly resulting symptoms observed ideomotor apraxiacitation needed one definitive test ideomotor apraxia several used clinically make ideomotor apraxia diagnosis criteria diagnosis entirely conserved among clinicians apraxia general distinguishing subtypes almost tests laid enable diagnosis ideomotor apraxia share common feature assessment ability imitate gestures test developed georg goldenberg uses imitation assessment tester demonstrates gesture patient rates whether gesture correctly imitated first attempt imitate gesture unsuccessful gesture presented second time higher score given correct imitation first trial second lowest score correctly imitating gesture gestures used meaningless placing hand flat top head flat outward fingers towards ear test specifically designed ideomotor apraxia main variation type number gestures used one test uses twentyfour movements three trials trialbased scoring system similar goldenberg protocol gestures also copied patient tester divided finger movements eg making scissor movement forefinger middle finger hand arm movements eg salute protocol combines meaningful meaningless gestures another test uses five meaningful gestures waving goodbye scratching head five meaningless gestures additional differences test verbal command initiate movement distinguishes accurate performance inaccurate recognizable performance one test utilizes tools including hammer key verbal command use tools patient copying testers demonstrated use tools tests shown individually unreliable considerable variability diagnoses delivered battery tests used however reliability validity may improved also highly advisable include assessments patient performs activities daily one newer tests developed may provide greater reliability without relying multitude tests combines three types tool use imitation gestures tool use section includes patient pantomime use tool present visual contact tool finally tactile contact tool test screens ideational ideomotor apraxia second portion aimed specifically ideomotor one study showed great potential test studies needed reproduce results said disorder often occurs degenerative neurological disorders parkinsons disease alzheimers disease comorbidities make difficult pick specific features ideomotor apraxia important point distinguishing ideomotor apraxia basic motor control intact high level dysfunction involving tool use gesturing additionally clinicians must careful exclude aphasia possible diagnosis tests involving verbal command aphasic patient could fail perform task properly understand directions given complexity medical problems facing people ideomotor apraxia usually experiencing multitude problems difficult ascertain impact ability function independently deficits due parkinsons alzheimers disease could well sufficient mask make irrelevant difficulties arising apraxia studies shown ideomotor apraxia independently diminish patients ability function general consensus seems ideomotor apraxia negative impact independence reduce individuals ability manipulate objects well diminishing capacity mechanical problem solving owing inability access information familiar parts unfamiliar system small subset patients known spontaneously recover apraxia rare however one possible hope phenomenon hemispheric shift functions normally performed one hemisphere shift event first damaged seems necessitate however portion function associated hemisphere begin dispute whether right hemisphere cortex involved praxis system evidence patients severed corpus callosums indicates may although little done substantially reverse effects ideomotor apraxia occupational therapy effective helping patients regain functional control sharing approach treating ideational apraxia achieved breaking daily task eg combing hair separate components teaching distinct component ample repetition proficiency movements acquired eventually combined create single pattern httpsenwikipediaorgwikiideomotorapraxia
