tertiary amine nndimethylaniline separating using distillation methyl isocyanate also manufactured nmethylformamide air latter process immediately consumed closedloop process make manufacturing methods methyl isocyanate reacts readily many substances contain nh oh groups water forms carbon dioxide evolution heat joules calories per gram mic relatively slow react increase rate elevated temperatures presence acid excess water half mic consumed heat efficiently removed reacting mixture rate reaction increase rapidly cause mic boil reaction triggered bhopal disaster large amount water introduced mic storage tank consequence control exothermic process runaway reaction direct release tons mic atmosphere mic excess formed along carbon alcohols phenols contain oh group react slowly mic reaction catalyzed trialkylamines dialkyltin dicarboxylate oximes hydroxylamines enols also react mic form reactions produce products described uses ammonia primary secondary amines rapidly react mic form substituted ureas nh compounds amides ureas react much slowly also reacts form trimer higher molecular weight polymers presence catalysts mic reacts form solid trimer trimethyl isocyanurate higher molecular weight polymer sodium methoxide triethyl phosphine ferric chloride certain metal compounds catalyze formation mictrimer highmolecularweight polymer formation catalyzed certain trialkylamines since formation mic trimer exothermic joules calories per gram mic reaction lead violent boiling mic highmolecularweight polymer hydrolyzes hot water form trimethyl isocyanurate since
