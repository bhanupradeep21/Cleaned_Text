population control practice artificially maintaining size population simply refers act limiting size animal population remains manageable opposed act protecting species excessive rates extinction referred conservation many abiotic biotic factors influence population control humans notably influential animal populations whether humans need hunt animals managing populations involves either providing nourishment neutering pets prevent reproduction specific population control plays important role wildlife populations based species dealt numerous ways populations wild controlled wildlife contraception act preventing reproduction wild subsequently decreases populations example includes maintenance deer populations use methods maintain populations include lethal trapping live trapping eggroost site manipulation liveammunition shooting chemical euthanization lethal trapping eggroost site manipulation liveammunition shooting chemical euthanization methods used eliminate animal populations prevent reproduction whereas live trapping captures species remove specific population control influenced variety factors humans greatly influence size animal populations directly interact example relatively common sometimes even legal requirement spay neuter dogs spaying removing ovaries uterus female animal medical term ovariohysterectomy neutering removing testes male animal medical term orchiectomy various humans activities eg hunting farming fishing industrialization urbanization impact various animal populations population control may involve culling translocation manipulation reproductive capability growth population may limited environmental factors food supply predation main biotic factors affect population growth include important abiotic factors affecting population growth include direct human impacts ways humans control animal populations often times humans indirectly controlling animal populations words humans aware actions controlling animal populations example new infrastructure roads lead animals displaced natural habitat new habitats forced move may provide necessities require survival result decreasing population result human actions animal euthanasia often used final resort controlling animal populations tangipahoa parish louisiana parish performed mass euthanasia entire animal shelter population including cats dogs put death due widespread disease outbreak spread among neutering another option available control animal populations annual spay day usa event established doris day animal league promote neutering pets especially animal shelters population remains wildlife contraception used regulate populations animals wild halt reproduction example vaccines currently used deer populations gonacon developed us department agriculture encourages production antibodies sex drive specifically said remove oestrous cycles females initially attracts males without oestrous cycles males interested another type vaccine used deer called porcine zona pellucida pzp works blocking sperm antibodies deers egg preventing reproduction fails control populations methods lethal trapping live trapping eggroost site manipulation liveammunition shooting chemical euthanization used maintain populations lethal trapping method used kill animals type method usually monitored order ensure ethical public concerns arise tactic commonly used small animals populations larger animals beavers foxes also controlled type live trapping method used capture variety animals small animals large animals type population control method uses barrel traps restraining snares leghold devices like lethal trapping method tactic also needs regularly monitored ensure ethical concerns arise well reduce animal distress specifically type population control method popular capturing eggroost site manipulation used birds prevent nesting prohibited areas water spray popular urban agricultural areas uses sprinklers omit surfactants surfactants control bird populations killing preventing future birds liveammunition shooting uses firearms eliminate animals birds bears type population control method restricted many parts world used control methods chemical euthanization refers use chemicals cause easy painless death divided three categories acute toxins anticoagulants decalcifiers acute toxins require single dose kill animals whereas anticoagulants decalcifiers require numerous doses time fumigants used suffocate animals type population control method poses ethical concerns world society protection animals wspa believes necessary human health safety animals ensure control method humane wspa states must painless achieve rapid unconsciousness followed death minimize animal fear distress reliable population control also plays significant role managing controlling invasive species eliminated becoming abundant causing ecological several efforts made control population ticks act vectors number diseases therefore pose risk humans efforts also continuously made control wildlife populations near airports specifically control measures approved bald eagles httpsenwikipediaorgwikipopulationcontrol
