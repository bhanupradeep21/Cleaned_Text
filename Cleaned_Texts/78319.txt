catscratch disease csd felinosis infectious disease often results scratch bite symptoms typically include nonpainful bump blister site injury painful swollen lymph people may feel tired headache symptoms typically begin within days following catscratch disease caused bacterium bartonella henselae believed spread cats young cats pose greater risk older occasionally dog scratches bites may

catscratch disease commonly presents tender swollen lymph nodes near site inoculating bite scratch neck usually limited one side condition referred regional lymphadenopathy occurs weeks lymphadenopathy commonly occurs arms neck jaw may also occur near groin around vesicle erythematous papule may form site initial people also develop systemic symptoms malaise decreased appetite associated complaints include headache chills muscular pains joint pains arthritis backache abdominal pain may take days long two months symptoms appear cases benign selflimiting lymphadenopathy may persist several months symptoms disease usually resolves spontaneously without treatment one month rare situations csd lead development serious neurologic cardiac sequelae meningoencephalitis
