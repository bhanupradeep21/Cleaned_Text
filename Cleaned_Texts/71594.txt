fossils found sokolki assemblage zone malokinelskaya formation european russia close ural mountains dating late permian lopingian million years ago first fossils uncovered russian paleontologist vladimir prokhorovich amalitskii documenting plant animal species upper permian sediments northern dvina river arkhangelsk district northern european russia amalitskii discovered site wife anne amalitskii continued oversee excavation recovering numerous nearly complete articulated natural position skeletons belonging menagerie different official diagnoses specimens delayed due world war first published name called scutosaurus karpinskii british zoologist david meredith seares watson captioned reconstruction based poorly preserved specimen pin pariasaurus karpinskyi amalitz giving credit amalitskii amalitskii died later year actual diagnosis animal posthumously published name pareiosaurus holotype specimen designated nearly complete skeleton pin three partial skulls also found amalitskii decided split new species p elegans p tuberculatus p pariasaurus pareiosaurus misspellings south african soviet vertebrate paleontologist aleksandra paulinovna anna hartmannweinberg said pareiasaur material north dvina represents species species distinct enough pareiasaurus justify placing new genus though amalitskii used unique genus name pareiosaurus accident declared pareiosaurus junior synonym pareiasaurus erected genus scutosaurus used spelling karpinskyi species switched karpinskii time also split another unique genus proelginia permiana based partial skull pin russian paleontologist n n kalandadze colleagues considered proelginia synonymous remains well preserved validity proelginia unclear russian paleontologist mikhail feodos πevich ivakhnenko erected new species itilensis based skull fragments pin resurrected tuberculatus australian biologist michael lee considered actions unjustified lee petitioned international commission zoological nomenclature formally

planteater living semiarid climate including deserts scutosaurus would wandered widely long time order find fresh foliage eat may stuck closely riverbanks floodplains plant life would abundant straying afield times drought teeth flattened could grind away leaves young branches digesting length large gut scutosaurus swallowed gastroliths digest plants given needed eat constantly scutosaurus probably lived alone small herds avoid denuding large areas edible plantscitation needed pareiasaurs long thought terrestrial difficult assess range locomotion given lack modern anatomical analogues ivakhnenko hypothesised aquatic amphibious due deep lowlying pectoral girdle short engorged limbs thick cartilage limb joints reminiscent aquatic dugong subsequent stable isotope analyses footprint various african eurasian remains reported results consistent terrestrial behavior caseids broadly similar build pareiasaurs possibly exhibited locomotory habits thin porous long bones consistent modern diving creatures overall heavy torso would impede behavior nonetheless similarly graviportal creatures much thicker long bones zoologist markus lambertz colleagues based thin bones short neck
