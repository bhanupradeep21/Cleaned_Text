teeth marsh named find pterodactylus oweni assigning wellknown much smaller european genus pterodactylus marsh also collected wing bones large pterosaur realizing name chosen already used harry seeleys european pterosaur species pterodactylus oweni marsh renamed giant north american pterosaur pterodactylus occidentalis meaning western wing finger description new specimen named two additional species based size differences pterodactylus ingens largest specimen far pterodactylus velox meanwhile marshs rival edward drinker cope unearthed several specimens large north american pterosaur based specimens cope named two new species ornithochirus umbrosus ornithochirus harpyia attempt assign large european genus ornithocheirus though misspelled name forgetting copes paper naming species published five days marshs paper resulted dispute fought published literature whose names priority obviously cope conceded marshs names priority maintained pterodactylus umbrosus distinct species genus marsh named reevaluation later scientists supported marshs case refuting copes assertion p umbrosus represented larger distinct first pteranodon wing bones collected marsh cope early first pteranodon skull found may along smoky hill river wallace county logan county kansas usa samuel wendell williston fossil collector working second smaller skull soon discovered well skulls showed north

also named several additional species pteranodon comptus pteranodon nanus named fragmentary skeletons small individuals pteranodon gracilis based wing bone mistook pelvic bone soon realized mistake reclassified specimen separate genus named nyctosaurus p nanus also later recognized nyctosaurus samuel williston examined question pteranodon classification noticed seeley mentioned existence partial set toothless pterosaur jaws cambridge greensand england named ornithostoma primary characteristic marsh used separate pteranodon pterosaurs lack teeth williston concluded ornithostoma must considered senior synonym pteranodon however pleininger pointed ornithostoma never scientifically described even assigned species name willistons work therefore nomen nudum could beat pteranodon naming priority williston accepted conclusion went back calling genus however williston pleininger incorrect unnoticed fact seeley finally described properly named ornithostoma assigning species sedgwicki research identity ornithostoma showed probably pteranodon even close relative may fact azhdarchoid different type toothless williston also first scientist critically evaluate pteranodon species classified cope marsh agreed marshs classification exceptions first believe p ingens p umbrosus could considered synonyms even cope come believe considered p velox p longiceps dubious first based nondiagnostic

understanding differences pteranodont anatomy eaton conducted experiments using clay models bones help determine effects crushing flattening shapes arm bones williston used classification eaton found differences bone shapes could easily explained pressures fossilization concluded pteranodon skeletons significant differences besides size therefore eaton left decide classification scheme based

sternbergia already use preoccupied finally miller named subgenus occidentalia p eatoni skull formerly associated p occidentalis miller expanded concept pteranodon include nyctosaurus fourth subgenus miller considered evolutionary progression primitive nyctosaurus time thought crestless giving rise occidentalia small crest turn gave rise pteranodon long backwards crest finally leading geosternbergia large upright crest however miller made several mistakes study concerning specimens marsh assigned species scientists disregarded work subject later research though wellnhofer followed millers species list schoch somewhat oddly published another revision essentially returned marshs original classification scheme notably sinking p longiceps synonym p early christopher bennett also published several major papers reviewing anatomy taxonomy life history fragmentary fossils assigned pteranodon also discovered skåne pteranodon species extremely well represented fossil record allowing detailed descriptions anatomy analysis life history specimens identified though less half complete enough give researchers good anatomical information still fossils material known pterosaur includes male female specimens various age groups possibly adult pteranodon specimens two major species divided two distinct size classes smaller class specimens small rounded head crests wide pelvic canals even wider much larger size class size pelvic canal probably allowed laying eggs indicating smaller adults females larger size class representing male individuals narrow hips large crests

flawed produced scaling modern animals bats birds pteranodon size despite fact pterosaurs vastly different body proportions soft tissue anatomy living distinguishing characteristics set pteranodon apart pterosaurs include narrow neural spines vertebrae platelike bony ligaments strengthening vertebrae hip relatively short tail last vertebrae fused long entire length tail long wingspan

level curvature suggests would extremely long unique form beak specimen led alexander kellner assign distinct genus dawndraco distinctive characteristic pteranodon cranial crest crests consisted skull bones frontals projecting upward backward skull size shape crests varied due number factors including age sex species male pteranodon sternbergi older species two described date nowadays placed genus geosternbergia vertical crest broad forward projection descendants pteranodon longiceps evolved narrower backwardprojecting females species smaller bore small rounded crests probably mainly display structures though may functions wing shape pteranodon suggests would flown rather like modernday albatross based fact pteranodon high aspect ratio wingspan chord length similar albatross pteranodon compared albatross albatrosses spend long stretches time sea fishing use flight pattern called dynamic soaring exploits vertical gradient wind speed near ocean surface travel long distances without flapping without aid thermals occur open ocean way pteranodon flight would depended soaring like longwinged seabirds probably required occasional active rapid burst flapping studies pteranodon wing loading strength wings vs weight body indicate capable substantial flapping flight contrary earlier suggestions big could however recent study suggests relied thermal soaring unlike modern seabirds much like modern continental flyers extinct like pterosaurs pteranodon probably took standing quadrupedal position using long forelimbs leverage would vaulted air rapid leap almost energy would generated forelimbs upstroke wings would occurred animal cleared ground followed rapid downstroke generate additional lift complete launch historically terrestrial locomotion pteranodon especially whether bipedal quadrupedal subject debate today pterosaur researchers agree pterosaurs quadrupedal thanks largely discovery pterosaur possibility aquatic locomotion via swimming discussed briefly several papers bennett bramwell whitfield diet pteranodon known included fish fossilized fish bones found stomach area one pteranodon fossilized fish bolus found jaws another pteranodon specimen amnh numerous specimens also preserve fragments fish scales vertebrae near torso indicating fish made majority diet pteranodon though may also taken traditionally researchers suggested pteranodon would taken fish dipping beaks water low soaring flight however probably based assumption animals could take water likely pteranodon could take water would dipped fish swimming rather flying even small female pteranodon could reached depth least centimeters long bill neck floating surface may reached even greater depths plungediving water air like modern longwinged bennett noted head neck shoulders pteranodon heavily built diving birds suggested could dive folding back wings like modern pteranodon notable skull crest though function crest subject debate explanations focused bladelike backward pointed crest male p longiceps however ignored wide range variation across age sex fact crests vary much rules practical functions use mating therefore display probably main function crest functions scientific interpretations crests function began george francis eaton proposed two possibilities aerodynamic counterbalance muscle attachment point suggested crest might anchored large long jaw muscles admitted function alone could explain large size bennett agreed eatons assessment crest large variable muscle attachment eaton suggested secondary function crest might counterbalance long beak reducing need heavy neck muscles control orientation wind tunnel tests showed crest function effective counterbalance degree bennett noted hypothesis focuses long crests male p longiceps larger crests p sternbergi small crests existed among females bennett found crests females counterbalancing effect crests male p sternbergi would negative effect balance head fact side side movement crests would required less neck musculature control dominik von kripp suggested crest may served rudder idea embraced several later one researcher ross stein even suggested crest may supported membrane skin connecting backwardpointing crest neck back increasing surface area effectiveness rudder hypothesis take account females p sternbergi upwardpointing backwardpointing crest bennett also found even capacity rudder crest would provide nearly much directional force simply maneuvering wings suggestion crest air brake animals would turn heads side order slow suffers similar additionally rudder air brake hypotheses explain large variation exists crest size even among alexander kellner suggested large crests pterosaur tapejara well species might used heat exchange allowing pterosaurs absorb shed heat regulate body temperature also would account correlation crest size body size evidence extra blood vessels crest purpose however large membranous wings filled blood vessels would served purpose much hypotheses ruled bestsupported hypothesis crest function seems sexual display consistent size variation seen fossil specimens females juveniles small crests males large elaborate variable adult pteranodon specimens may divided two distinct size classes small large large size class one half times larger small class small class twice common large class size classes lived alongside researchers previously suggested represent different species christopher bennett showed differences consistent concept represent females males pteranodon species sexually dimorphic skulls larger size class preserve large upward backward pointing crests crests smaller size class small triangular larger skulls also show evidence second crest extended long low toward tip beak seen smaller sex different size classes determined skulls pelvic bones contrary may expected smaller size class disproportionately large wideset pelvic bones bennett interpreted indicating spacious birth canal eggs would pass concluded small size class small triangular crests represent females larger largecrested specimens represent note overall size crest size also corresponds age immature specimens known females males immature males often small crests similar adult females therefore seems large crests developed males reached large adult size making sex immature specimens difficult establish partial fact females appear outnumbered males two one suggests modern animals sizerelated sexual dimorphism sea lions pinnipeds pteranodon might polygynous males competing association groups consisting large numbers females similar modern pinnipeds pteranodon may competed establish territory rocky offshore rookeries largest largestcrested males gaining territory success mating females crests male pteranodon would
