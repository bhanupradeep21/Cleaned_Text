syndrome alternating brainstem syndrome occurs damage dorsolateral posterior lateral medulla oblongata likely syphilitic hence also called alternating medulla oblongata syndromeclarification needed medulla oblongata lower half brainstem controls autonomic functions connects higher levels brain spinal cord responsible regulating several basic functions autonomic nervous system including respiration cardiac function vasodilation reflexes like vomiting coughing sneezing disorder caused damage part brain medullobulbar transitional area causes variety neurological symptoms affect one side body symptoms include ipsilateral side cerebellar ataxia sensory deficits face horners syndrome along weakness loss sensation contralateral opposite side first described later named neurologists initially investigated joseph babinski jean hoarseness paralysis right side tongue soft palate pneumonia respiratory distress dysphagia swallowing difficulties nausea vomiting dysarthria also known slurred speech hypertension also known high blood pressure hyperlipidemia abnormally high levels lipids blood miosis abnormal contraction constriction pupil eye blepharoptosis abnormal drooping upper
