foraging searching wild food resources affects animals fitness plays important role animals ability survive foraging theory branch behavioral ecology studies foraging behavior animals response environment animal lives behavioral ecologists use economic models categories understand foraging many models type optimal model thus foraging theory discussed terms optimizing payoff foraging decision payoff many models amount energy animal receives per unit time specifically highest ratio energetic gain cost foraging theory predicts decisions maximize energy per unit time thus deliver highest payoff selected persist key words used describe foraging behavior include resources elements necessary survival reproduction limited supply predator organism consumes others prey organism eaten part whole patches concentrations resources behavioral ecologists first tackled topic goal quantify formalize set models test null hypothesis animals forage randomly important contributions foraging theory made several factors affect animals ability forage acquire profitable resources learning defined adaptive change modification behavior based previous since animals environment constantly changing ability adjust foraging behavior essential maximization fitness studies social insects shown significant correlation learning foraging nonhuman primates young individuals learn foraging behavior peers elders watching group members forage copying observing learning members group ensure younger members group learn safe eat become proficient foragers one measure learning foraging animal consuming new food using new foraging technique response dynamic living foraging innovation considered learning involves behavioral plasticity animals part animal recognizes need come new foraging strategy introduce something never used maximize fitness survival forebrain size associated learning behavior animals larger brain sizes expected learn higher ability innovate linked larger forebrain sizes north american british isle birds according lefebvre et al study bird orders contained individuals larger forebrain sizes displayed higher amount foraging innovation examples innovations recorded birds include following tractors eating frogs insects killed using swaying trees catch another measure learning spatiotemporal learning also called timeplace learning refers individuals ability associate time event place type learning documented foraging behaviors individuals stingless bee species trigona studies showed fulviventris individuals learned locations times feeding events arrived locations thirty minutes feeding event anticipation food foraging behavior also influenced genetics genes associated foraging behavior widely studied honeybees reference following onset foraging behavior task division foragers workers bias foraging either pollen honey bee foraging activity occurs inside outside hive either pollen nectar similar behavior seen many social wasps species apoica flavissima studies using quantitative trait loci qtl mapping associated following loci matched functions onset foraging age size pollen loads collected workers shown influence sugar concentration nectar behaviors dominant others study using fruit fly larvae drosophila melanogaster two types foraging strategies rovers rovers used strategy moving across multiple patches search food sitters remained one patch inclination go searching strategies polymorphic traits naturally occur within larval stages fruit flies gene responsible major effects foraging behavior drosophila melanogaster larvae chaser csr study homozygous strains produced crossing rovers rovers sitters using method hybridization crossing rovers sitters offspring displayed rover foraging behavior thus demonstrating allele complete dominance presence predators prey animal foraging affects behaviour general foragers balance risk predation needs thus deviating foraging behaviour would expected absence example balanced risk observed foraging behavior parasitism affect way animals forage organism counteract procurement parasite may display avoidance towards certain areas parasites previously avoidance behavior tradeoff mechanism loss time energy avoiding food patches traded decrease risk contracting adaptations diet also help prevention parasitic infection avoiding foods high potential parasitic contamination well including food items contain antiparasitic properties diet antiparasitic properties used selfmedicating way either prophylactically foraging categorized two main types first solitary foraging animals forage second group foraging group foraging includes animals seen foraging together beneficial called aggregation economy detrimental called dispersion economy solitary foraging includes variety foraging animals find capture consume prey alone individuals manually exploit patches use tools exploit prey example bolas spiders attack prey luring scent identical female moths sex animals may choose forage resources abundant occur habitat rich number conspecifics foraging cases may need group addition foraging alone result less interaction foragers decrease amount competition dominance interactions animal deals also ensure solitary forager less conspicuous solitary foraging strategies characterize many phocids true seals elephant harbor seals example exclusive solitary forager south american species harvester ant pogonomyrmex animals typically classified two categories pattern movement exhibited foraging behaviors categories cruise searchers ambush cruise searchers forage continuously hunting prey outer borders area searched ambush searchers forage sitting waiting remain motionless long durations wait prey pass therefore initiating ambusher examples tool use include dolphins using sponges feed fish bury new caledonian crows use sticks get larvae chimpanzees similarly use sticks capture consume theory scientists use understand solitary foraging called optimal foraging theory optimal foraging theory oft first proposed two papers published independently robert macarthur eric j merritt theory argues key importance successful foraging individuals survival possible predict foraging behavior using decision theory determine behavior optimal forager would exhibit forager perfect knowledge maximize usable food intake behavior real animals inevitably departs optimal forager optimal foraging theory proved useful developing hypotheses describing real foraging behavior departures optimality often help identify constraints either animals behavioral cognitive repertoire environment previously suspected constraints identified foraging behavior often approach optimal pattern even identical words know optimal foraging theory animals foraging randomly even behavior doesnt perfectly match predicted oft many versions optimal foraging theory relevant different foraging situations models generally possess following components according stephens et al versions include optimal diet model analyzes behavior forager encounters different types prey must choose attack model also known prey model attack model model predator encounters different prey items decides whether spend time handling eating prey predicts foragers ignore low profitability prey items profitable items present objective model identify choice maximize fitness profitable prey item depends ecological variables time required find capture consume prey addition energy provides likely individual settle trade maximizing intake rate eating minimising search interval patch selection theory describes behavior forager whose prey concentrated small areas known patches significant travel time model seeks find much time individual spend one patch deciding move next patch understand whether animal stay patch move new one think bear patch berry bushes longer bear stays patch berry bushes less berries bear eat bear must decide long stay thus leave patch move new patch movement depends travel time patches energy gained one patch versus based marginal value theorem central place foraging theory version patch model model describes behavior forager must return particular place consume food perhaps hoard food feed mate offspring chipmunks good example model travel time patch hiding place increased chipmunks stayed longer patch recent decades optimal foraging theory often applied foraging behavior human huntergatherers although controversial coming kinds attack application sociobiological theory human behavior represent convergence ideas human ecology economic anthropology proved fruitful interesting group foraging animals find capture consume prey presence individuals words foraging success depends foraging behaviors behaviors others biological behavior also inspired development artificial intelligence algorithms try follow main concepts group foraging autonomous important note group foraging emerge two types situations first situation frequently thought occurs foraging group beneficial brings greater rewards known aggregation second situation occurs group animals forage together may animals best interest known dispersion economy think cardinal bird feeder dispersion economy might see group birds foraging bird feeder best interest cardinal birds amount food cardinal get bird feeder depends much take bird feeder also depends much birds take well red harvester ants foraging process divided three different types workers nest patrollers trail patrollers foragers workers utilize many different methods communicating foraging group guiding flights scent paths jostling runs seen eusocial bee melipona chimpanzees taï forest côte divoire also engage foraging meats achieved group foraging positive correlation observed success hunt size foraging group chimps also observed implying rules foraging benefit becoming involved allowing successful hunters first access already mentioned group foraging brings costs benefits members group benefits group foraging include able capture larger able create aggregations able capture prey difficult dangerous importantly reduction predation regard costs however group foraging results competition available resources group members competition resources characterized either scramble competition whereby individual strives get portion shared resource interference competition whereby presence competitors prevents foragers accessibility group foraging thus reduce animals foraging group foraging may influenced size group species like lions wild dogs foraging success increases increase group size declines optimal size exceeded myriad number factors affect group sizes different species example lionesses female lions make decisions foraging vacuum make decisions reflect balance obtaining food defending territory protecting young fact see lion foraging behavior maximize energy gain behaving optimally respect foraging defend territory protect young hunt small groups reduce risk caught another factor may influence group size cost hunting understand behavior wild dogs average group size must incorporate distance dogs theorizing hominid foraging aurignacian blades et al defined forager performing activity optimal efficiency individual considered balance costs search pursuit prey considerations prey selection also selecting area work within individual would decide correct time move another location corresponding perception yield remaining potential yields given area available quantitative model allows evaluation tradeoff decisions occur aquatic foraging arenas areas juvenile fish forage closer home also providing easier escape potential predators theory predicts feeding activity dependent upon density juvenile fishes risk predation within area balance growth mortality juvenile fishes reliant consequent duration foraging performed said juvenile components vary regards habitat theory scientists use understand group foraging called ideal free distribution null model thinking would draw animals groups forage would behave process model predicts animals make instantaneous decision forage based quality prey availability patches available time choose profitable patch one maximizes energy intake quality depends starting quality patch number predators already consuming
