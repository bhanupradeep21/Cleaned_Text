including defects despite insufficient evidence studies humans either support discount limited data available effects nursing mothers taking acetazolamide therapeutic doses create low levels breast milk expected cause problems common adverse effects acetazolamide include following paraesthesia fatigue drowsiness depression decreased libido bitter metallic taste nausea vomiting abdominal cramps diarrhea black stool polyuria kidney stones metabolic acidosis electrolyte changes hypokalemia whereas less common adverse effects include syndrome anaphylaxis blood contraindications possible might interact acetazolamide carbonic anhydrase inhibitor hence causing accumulation carbonic carbonic anhydrase enzyme found red blood cells many tissues catalyses following hence lowering blood ph means following reaction carbonic acid pka mechanism diuresis involves proximal tubule kidney enzyme carbonic anhydrase found allowing reabsorption bicarbonate sodium chloride inhibiting enzyme ions excreted along excess water lowering blood pressure intracranial pressure intraocular pressure general side effect carbonic anhydrase inhibitors loss potassium due function excreting bicarbonate blood becomes acidic causing compensatory hyperventilation deep respiration kussmaul breathing increasing levels oxygen decreasing levels carbon dioxide eye results reduction aqueous bicarbonate pka carbonate far physiologic ph likely accept proton donate one also far less likely either thus bicarbonate major species physiological ph normal conditions proximal convoluted tubule kidney carbonic acid produced intracellularly action carbonic anhydrase quickly dissociates cell bicarbonate h ion proton previously mentioned bicarbonate exits basal portion cell via sodium na symport chloride antiport reenters circulation may accept proton blood ph decreases thus acting weak basic buffer remaining h left intracellular production carbonic acid exits apical urinary lumen portion cell na antiport acidifying urine may join another bicarbonate dissociated h lumen urinary space exiting proximal convoluted kidney cellsglomerulus carbonic acid bicarbonate diffuse across cell membrane polar state replenish carbonic acid may reabsorbed cell produced via luminal carbonic anhydrase result whole process greater net balance h urinary lumen bicarbonate space acidic physiologic ph thus increased likelihood bicarbonate left lumen diffuses back cell carbonic acid short normal conditions net effect carbonic anhydrase urinary lumen cells proximal convoluted tubule acidify urine transport bicarbonate body another effect excretion needed maintain electroneutrality lumen well reabsorption na body thus disrupting process acetazolamide urinary na bicarbonate increased urinary h decreased inversely serum na bicarbonate decreased serum h increased generally follows sodium clinical diuretic effect achieved reduces blood volume thus preload heart improve contractility reduce blood pressure achieve desired clinical effects reduced blood volume reducing edema intracranial early description compound synthesis smaller clinical trials also shown promising results treatment
