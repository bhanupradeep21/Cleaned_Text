artificial skin collagen scaffold induces regeneration skin mammals humans term used late early describe new treatment massive burns later discovered treatment deep skin wounds adult animals humans scaffold induces regeneration developed commercially name integra used massively burned patients plastic surgery skin treatment chronic skin alternatively term artificial skin sometimes used refer skinlike tissue grown laboratory although technology still quite way away viable use medical field artificial skin also refer flexible semiconductor materials sense touch prosthetic limbs also experimental skin largest organ human skin made three layers epidermis dermis fat layer also called hypodermis epidermis outer layer skin keeps vital fluids harmful bacteria body dermis inner layer skin contains blood vessels nerves hair follicles oil sweat severe damage large areas skin exposes human organism dehydration infections result death traditional ways dealing large losses skin use skin grafts patient autografts unrelated donor cadaver former approach disadvantage may enough skin available latter suffers possibility rejection infection late twentieth century skin grafts constructed patients skin became problem skin damaged extensively making impossible treat severely injured patients autografts process inducing regeneration skin invented ioannis v yannas assistant professor fibers polymers division department mechanical engineering massachusetts institute technology john f burke chief staff shriners burns institute boston massachusetts initial objective discover wound cover would protect severe skin wounds infection accelerating wound closure several kinds grafts made synthetic natural polymers prepared tested guinea pig animal model late evident original objective reached instead experimental grafts typically affect speed wound closure one case however particular type collagen graft led significant delay wound careful study histology samples

myofibroblasts scaffold surface occurring within narrow time window required induction skin regeneration presence studies skin wounds extended transected peripheral nerves combined evidence supports common regeneration mechanism skin peripheral nerves using fabricating artificial skin difficulty mimicking living tissue similar biological mechanical performance outlined integra founders yannas burke three key factors consider creation artificial skin material biophysiochemical properties mechanical material selection important part designing artificial skin needs biocompatible body adequate properties adequate function human skin made type collagen elastin artificial skin integra made copolymer composed collagen collagen hydrophilic polymer whose degradation stiffness controlled degree cross linking however brittle susceptible breakdown enzyme collagenase order make material tougher resistant copolymer formed glycosaminoglycan gag gags long polysaccharides act shock absorbers collagengag cg matrices higher modulus elasticity energy needed fracture collagen alone making ideal outer layer silicone normally applied matrix order serve protective another material used synthetic skin elastin similar effect gag reduces tensile strength compressive modulus material increasing material biocompatible conducive proliferation also mechanical properties similar real skin order serve adequate substitute skin first line defense body subject lots chemical mechanical assaults artificial skin needs strong tear resistant stretching occurs everyday activity also needs strong enough

furthermore noted skin viscoelastic undergoes hysteresis time dependent stress relaxation factor goes separate path unloading another important consideration wettability material ability liquid maintain contact solid surface cg matrix membrane wet woundbed substrate properly air pockets form lead membrane must stiff drape surface furthermore shear lateral peeling normal forces displace membrane air pockets reform mitigated adding adhesive bond like eschar scab two surfaces although mechanical properties synthetic skin need exactly human main ones similar include modulus elasticity tear strength fracture ultimately goal synthetic skin close wound regrow new skin means first adheres wound creates airtight seal neodermal growth occur time synthetic skin must degrade space newly grown skin thus biocompatibility degradability also consideration research continually done artificial skin newer technologies autologous sprayon skin produced avita tested efforts accelerate healing minimize scarring fraunhofer institute interfacial engineering biotechnology working towards fully automated process producing artificial skin goal simple twolayer skin without blood vessels used study skin interacts consumer products creams medicines hope eventually produce complex skin used hanna wendt team colleagues department plastic hand reconstructive surgery medical school hannover germany found method creating artificial skin using spider silk however artificial skin grown using materials like collagen materials seem strong enough instead wendt team turned spider silk known

skin cells added meshwork silk found flourish environment providing nutrients warmth air however time using spider silk grow artificial skin mass quantities practical tedious process harvesting spider australian researchers currently searching new innovative way produce artificial skin would produce artificial skin quickly efficient way skin produced would millimeter thick would used rebuild epidermis also make skin millimetres thick would allow dermis repair needed would require bone marrow donation patients body bone marrow would used seed would placed grafts mimic dermis tested animals proven work animal skin professor maitz said australia someone fullthickness burn per cent body surface area every prospect surviving injury however quality life remains questionable unable present replace burned skin normal committed ensuring pain survival worth developing living skin another form artificial skin created flexible semiconductor materials sense touch prosthetic artificial skin
