bacteriological water analysis method analysing water estimate numbers bacteria present needed find sort bacteria represents one aspect water quality microbiological analytical procedure uses samples water samples determines concentration bacteria possible draw inferences suitability water use concentrations process used example routinely confirm water safe human consumption bathing recreational waters safe use interpretation action trigger levels different waters vary depending use made water whilst stringent levels apply drinking water relaxed levels apply marine bathing waters much lower volumes water expected ingested users common feature routine screening procedures primary analysis indicator organisms rather pathogens might cause concern indicator organisms bacteria nonspecific coliforms escherichia coli pseudomonas aeruginosa commonly found human animal gut detected may suggest presence sewage indicator organisms used even person infected pathogenic bacteria still excreting many millions times indicator organisms pathogens therefore reasonable surmise indicator organism levels low pathogen levels much lower absent judgements suitability water use based extensive precedents relate probability sample population bacteria able infective reasonable statistical level confidencecitation needed analysis usually performed using culture biochemical sometimes optical methods indicator organisms levels exceed preset triggers specific analysis pathogens may undertaken quickly detected suspected using specific culture methods molecular reliable methods direct plate
