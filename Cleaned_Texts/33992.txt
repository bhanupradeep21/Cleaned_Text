vasoconstriction narrowing blood vessels resulting contraction muscular wall vessels particular large arteries small arterioles process opposite vasodilation widening blood vessels process particularly important controlling hemorrhage reducing acute blood loss blood vessels constrict flow blood restricted decreased thus retaining body heat increasing vascular resistance makes skin turn paler less blood reaches surface reducing radiation heat larger level vasoconstriction one mechanism body regulates maintains mean arterial pressure medications causing vasoconstriction also known
