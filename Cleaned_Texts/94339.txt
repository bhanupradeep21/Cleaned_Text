nhandumirim meaning small rhea tupi language genus basal sauropodomorph dinosaur carnian age late triassic brazil currently considered saturnaliid sauropodomorph type species nhandumirim waldsangae known single immature specimen including vertebrae chevron pelvic material hindlimb found santa maria formation rio grande sul nhandumirim differentiated santa maria dinosaurs staurikosaurus saturnalia basis gracile longlegged proportions several specific skeletal features however noteworthy holotype nhandumirim immature individual several features tibia led describers genus species consider nhandumirim waldsangae possibly earliest theropod analyses study offer alternative positions within subsequent studies considered nhandumirim early sauropodomorph closelyassociated saturnalia nhandumirim known single partial skeleton lprpusp includes several vertebrae right ilium right hindlimb skeleton found site cerro da alemoa also known waldsanga sanga santa maria rio grande sul waldsanga historically important triassic site also preserved type specimens saturnalia rauisuchus gomphodontosuchus site preserves carnianage sediments santa maria formation lprpusp specifically comes top alemoa member site generic name nhandumirim roughly translates small rhea tupiguarani language specific name refers dorsal vertebrae spoolshaped centra times longer high making elongated herrerasaurids several areas dorsals incised sides centrum shallow depression rear neural arch postzygapophyseal centrodiapophyseal centrodiapophyseal fossae likely three sacral vertebrae least first one articulating hip akin primordial first sacral reptiles contrasts saturnalia first sacral vertebra incorporated dorsal vertebra without hallmarks primordial sacral sacral vertebrae thick wide fused respective sacral ribs complete sacral rib fan shaped seen cross section gradually curves upwards towards front also unlike saturnalia lshaped cross section caudal vertebrae increase length gradually reduce size transverse processes base tail tip caudals base tail pronounced midline keels along entire lower edge characteristic seemingly unique nhandumirim dinosauromorphs ventral keels proximal caudals dracoraptor paired midline keels efraasia restricted front third centrum zygapophyses caudals short unlike longer joints herrerasaurids ilium generally typical early dinosaurs perforated acetabulum conspicuous antitrochanter postacetabular process much longer preacetabular process ischiadic peduncle expanded fronttoback direction like neotheropods lshaped scar inner edge iliac blade received first sacral vertebra enough room two sacrals behind outer surface postacetabular process two holes pronounced incision along lower edge known brevis fossa dinosaurs brevis fossa clearly starts base postacetabular process according ridge delineates upper edge however nhandumirims brevis fossa occupies rear postacetabular process clear interaction main portion femur slender thinwalled proximal portion possessed early dinosaurian hallmarks anterior trochanter facies articularis antitrochanterica welldeveloped medial tubera separated deep ligament sulcus asymmetrical pronounced fourth trochanter femoral head also possessed deep curved groove appearance groove known variable within dinosaur species particularly informative nhandumirims classification trochanteric shelf present homologous muscle attachment scar exist area along proximallylocated anterolateral scar similar reported silesaurids unlike early dinosaurs dorsolateral trochanter characteristically short

pterosaurs rather curved bone dinosaurs isolated phalanges variable proportions one wide proximal articulation rest tall triangular proximal articulations welldeveloped joint surfaces unguals triangular cross section curved though extent seen advanced describers nhandumirim tested relations using two phylogenetic analyses focused around origin dinosaurs first one created previously cabreira et al considered basalmost theropod sister taxon neotheropods supported wide ischiadic peduncle several traits tibia cabreira et al analysis notable excluding several traditional basal theropods group include daemonosaurus tawa chindesaurus eodromaeus considered basal saurischians according adding nhandumirim second analysis created nesbitt ezcurra led inconclusive results strict consensus tree average result parsimonious trees nhandumirim part broad polytomy base saurischia along several traditional basal theropods herrerasaurids eoraptor hand frequently considered early sauropodomorph recent analyses wildcard taxon several equally likely positions within saurischia positions may include nhandumirim sister taxon saurischians sister taxon eoraptor sister taxon theropods also includes herrerasaurids option regardless authors considered unlikely nhandumirim particularly close staurikosaurus nonetheless phylogenetic position nhandumirim also tested article
