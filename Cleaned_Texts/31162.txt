cardiovascular disease women integral area research ongoing studies womens health cardiovascular disease cvd umbrella term wide range diseases affecting heart blood vessels including limited coronary artery disease stroke cardiomyopathy myocardial infarctions aortic since cvd leading cause death women despite presumed primarily male disease two types cvds shown leading causes death women globally according world health organization ischemic heart disease however recently genderspecific data available cardiovascular disease cvd sparse numerous reasons risks cvd unaccounted women due gender biases underrepresentation clinical trials lack factors contributed increase preventable deaths women due thus integral area research ongoing studies womens health overall factors instrumental key differences seen cvd presentation must accounted diagnostic treatment practices healthcare providers cardiovascular disease women may misdiagnosed underdiagnosed women number reasons cvd especially heart attacks often presents symptoms women differently men due anatomical hormonal research shown women may present symptoms classically associated heart attacks chest pain shortness breath also atypical symptoms neck jaw arm shoulder discomfort nausea vomiting heartburn indigestion fatigue headaches healthcare providers may misidentify causes symptoms attributing gastrointestinal psychological causes insteadcitation needed moreover although certain factors traditionally associated developing cvd include age hypertension smoking diabetes mellitus dyslipidemia similarly influential women men recent research found additional risks added list nontraditional emerging factors include pregnancyassociated disorders preeclampsia gestational diabetes polycystic ovary syndrome even depression discrepancy furthered underenrollment women research studies establishing cvd treatment baseline women healthcare furthermore anatomical features cardiovascular system differences size men women size vessels women generally smaller comparison men thus smaller blockage cause much damage women regularsized blockage women also smaller ventricle size men lowers volume pumped ventricle rest body thus requiring heart beat faster ensure similar amount blood pumped differences addition cardiovascular functional differences ie slower fight flight response sympathetic activity high rest digest response parasympathetic activity may result differing presentations womens according survey conducted aha women aware cvd leading cause death women close women aware women experience heart disease symptoms gradually later years initial hours treatment critical reducing damage brain heart supported study done italy found vast majority participants able successfully identify cvd leading cause death however many women still unaware impact cvd womens health may due infrequent exposure concerns deficit personalization education groups little involvement women cvd research numerous studies noted many women unable identify common risk factors acknowledge whether possible risk developing cvd quite even believing cvd maleexclusive lack awareness seems also prominent age groups years nearly women age group consider cancer leading cause death however age increases understanding heart diseases also shown increase national survey conducted aha suggested increased rates awareness consciousness according fifteenyear trend report significant changes follow recent aha survey awareness cvd leading cause death women decline last greatest differences seen among hispanic women nonhispanic black women age group year trends similar ones found survey done american heart association shift knowledge demonstrates great need cardiovascular health programs
