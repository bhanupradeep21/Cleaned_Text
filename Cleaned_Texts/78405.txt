carnot began working book steam engines achieved widely recognized economic industrial importance real scientific study newcomen invented first pistonoperated steam engine century years james watt made celebrated improvements responsible greatly increasing efficiency practicality steam engines compound engines engines one stage expansion already invented even crude form internalcombustion engine carnot familiar described detail book although existed intuitive understanding workings engines scientific theory operation almost nonexistent principle conservation energy still poorly developed controversial exact formulation first law thermodynamics still decade away mechanical equivalence heat would formulated another two decades prevalent theory heat caloric theory regarded heat sort weightless invisible fluid flowed equilibrium engineers carnots time tried means highly pressurized steam use fluids improve efficiency engines early stages engine development efficiency typical useful work able given quantity fuel carnot wanted answer two questions operation heat engines work available heat source potentially unbounded heat engines principle improved replacing steam working fluid gas attempted answer memoir published popular work years old entitled réflexions sur la puissance motrice du feu reflections motive power fire book plainly intended cover rather wide range topics heat engines rather popular fashion equations kept minimum called little simple algebra arithmetic except occasionally footnotes carnot indulged arguments involving calculus discussed relative merits air steam working fluids merits various aspects steamengine design even included ideas regarding possible practical improvements important part book concentrated abstract presentation idealized engine could used understand clarify fundamental principles generally applied heat engines independent design perhaps important contribution carnot made thermodynamics abstraction essential features steam engine known day general idealized heat engine resulted model thermodynamic system upon exact calculations could made avoided complications introduced many crude features contemporary steamengine idealizing engine could arrive clear indisputable answers original two questions showed efficiency idealized engine function two temperatures reservoirs operates however give exact form function later shown absolute temperature hotter reservoir note equation probably came kelvin thermal engine operating cycle efficient given operating temperatures carnot cycle efficient possible engine trivial absence friction incidental wasteful processes main reason assumes conduction heat parts engine different temperatures carnot knew conduction heat bodies different temperatures wasteful irreversible process must eliminated heat engine achieve maximum efficiency regarding second point also quite certain maximum efficiency attainable depend upon exact nature working fluid stated emphasis general proposition motive power heat independent agents employed realize quantity fixed solely temperatures bodies effected finally transfer caloric motive power heat would today say efficiency reversible heat engine rather transfer caloric would say reversible transfer entropy reversible transfer heat given temperature qt carnot knew intuitively engine would maximum efficiency unable state efficiency would concluded production motive power therefore due steam engines actual consumption caloric transportation warm body cold fall caloric motive power undoubtedly increases difference temperature warm cold bodies know whether proportional idealized model caloric transported hot cold body frictionless heat engine lacks conductive heat flow driven difference temperature yielding work could also used transport caloric back hot body reversing motion engine consuming amount work concept subsequently known thermodynamic reversibility carnot postulated caloric lost operation idealized engine process completely reversible executed kind heat engine efficient possible process assumption heat conduction driven temperature difference exist caloric lost engine guided design carnotcycle operated idealized engine cycle consequently composed adiabatic processes heatcaloric flows isothermal processes heat transferred temperature difference exists proof existence maximum efficiency heat engines follows cycle named carnot doesnt waste caloric reversible engine use cycle imagine two large bodies hot cold one postulates existence heat machine greater efficiency couple two idealized machines different connect hot cold body first less efficient one lets constant amount entropy qt flow hot cold cycle yielding amount work denoted w use work power machine would using amount work w gained cycle first machine make amount entropy flow cold hot body net effect flow entropy cold hot body net work done consequently cold body cooled hot body rises temperature difference temperature rises yielding work first greater successive cycles due second engine difference temperature two bodies stretches cycle even end set machines would perpetuum mobile exist proves assumption existence efficient engine wrong heat engine operates carnot cycle must efficient one means frictionless heat engine lacks conductive heat flow driven difference temperature shows maximum possible efficiency carnot concludes choice working fluid density volume occupied change maximum efficiency using equivalence working gas used heat engines deduced difference specific heat gas measured constant pressure measured constant volume must constant gases comparing operation hypothetical heatengines two different volumes occupied amount working gas correctly deduces relation

superheated steam better higher temperature consequent hot reservoir carnots theories efforts immediately help improve efficiency steam engines theories helped explain one existing practice superior others towards end nineteenth century carnots ideas namely heat engine made efficient temperature hot reservoir increased put practice carnots book however eventually real impact design practical
