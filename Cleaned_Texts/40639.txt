intelligence defined many ways capacity abstraction logic understanding selfawareness learning emotional knowledge reasoning planning creativity critical thinking problemsolving described ability perceive infer information retain knowledge applied adaptive behaviors within environment term rose prominence early psychologists believe intelligence divided various domains competencies intelligence often studied humans also observed nonhuman animals plants despite controversy whether forms life exhibit intelligence computers machines called artificial intelligence word intelligence derives latin nouns intelligentia intellēctus turn stem verb intelligere comprehend perceive middle ages word intellectus became scholarly technical term understanding translation greek philosophical term nous term however strongly linked metaphysical cosmological theories teleological scholasticism including theories immortality soul concept active intellect also known active intelligence approach study nature strongly rejected early modern philosophers francis bacon thomas hobbes john locke david hume preferred understanding place intellectus intelligence english philosophical hobbes example latin de corpore used intellectus intelligit translated english version understanding understandeth typical example logical intelligence therefore become less common english language philosophy later taken scholastic theories implies contemporary exactly intelligence could external observer prove agent intelligent definition intelligence controversial varying abilities whether

clarity achieved areas conceptualization yet answered important questions none commands universal assent indeed two dozen prominent theorists recently asked define intelligence gave two dozen somewhat

emotional intelligence thought ability convey emotion others understandable way well read emotions others theories imply heightened emotional intelligence could also lead faster generating processing emotions addition addition higher emotional intelligence thought help us manage emotions beneficial problemsolving skills emotional intelligence important mental health ties social social intelligence ability understand social cues motivations others oneself social situations thought distinct types intelligence relations emotional intelligence social intelligence coincided studies focus make

book smarts street smart contrasting views based premise people knowledge gained academic study may lack experience sensibly apply knowledge others knowledge gained practical experience may lack accurate information usually gained study effectively apply knowledge artificial intelligence researcher hector levesque noted given importance learning text personal lives culture perhaps surprising utterly dismissive tend sometimes derided merely book knowledge book smart contrast knowledge acquired direct experience apprenticeship called street knowledge street although humans primary focus intelligence researchers scientists also attempted investigate animal intelligence broadly animal cognition researchers interested studying mental ability particular species comparing abilities species study various measures problem solving well numerical verbal reasoning abilities challenges area defining intelligence meaning across species eg comparing intelligence literate humans illiterate animals also operationalizing measure accurately compares mental ability across different species contextscitation needed wolfgang köhlers research intelligence apes example research area
