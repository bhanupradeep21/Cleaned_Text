quantitative experiment lavoisier showed earthy sediment produced longcontinued reflux heating water glass vessel due conversion water earth rather gradual disintegration inside glass vessel produced boiling water also attempted introduce reforms french monetary taxation system help peasants farmers general held monopoly production import sale tobacco france taxes levied tobacco brought revenues million livres year revenue began fall growing black market tobacco smuggled adulterated commonly ash water lavoisier devised method checking whether ash mixed tobacco spirit vitriol aqua fortis acid solution poured ash immediate intense effervescent reaction accompanied easily detected noise lavoisier also noticed addition small amount ash improved flavour tobacco one vendor selling adulterated goods wrote tobacco enjoys good reputation province small proportion ash added gives particularly pungent flavour consumers look perhaps farm could gain advantage adding bit liquid mixture tobacco fabricated lavoisier also found adding lot water bulk tobacco would cause ferment smell bad addition small amount improved product thereafter factories farmers general added recommended consistent water volume tobacco allow addition farmers general delivered retailers seventeen ounces tobacco charging ensure authorised amounts added exclude black market lavoisier saw watertight system checks accounts supervision testing made difficult retailers source contraband tobacco improve profits bulking energetic rigorous implementing systems introduced deeply unpopular tobacco retailers across country unpopularity consequences french lavoisier urged establishment royal commission agriculture served secretary spent considerable sums money order improve agricultural yields sologne area farmland poor quality humidity region often led blight rye harvest causing outbreaks ergotism among population lavoisier presented report commission detailing ten years efforts experimental farm

referred generally chemical revolution lavoisier encountered much opposition trying change field especially british phlogistic scientists joseph priestley richard kirwan james keir william nicholson among others argued quantification substances imply conservation rather reporting factual evidence opposition claimed lavoisier misinterpreting implications research one lavoisiers allies jean baptiste biot wrote lavoisiers methodology one felt necessity linking accuracy experiments rigor opposition argued precision experimentation imply precision inferences reasoning despite opposition lavoisier continued use precise instrumentation convince chemists conclusions often results five eight decimal places nicholson estimated three decimal places meaningful stated denied results pretended true last figures must beg leave observe long rows figures instances extend thousand times nicety experiment serve exhibit parade true science need real degree accuracy experiments thus hidden contemplation somewhat disposed doubt whether exactitude scrupuleuse experiments indeed render proofs de lordre official version lavoisiers easter memoir appeared intervening period lavoisier ample time repeat priestleys latest experiments perform new ones addition studying priestleys dephlogisticated air studied thoroughly residual air metals calcined showed residual air supported neither combustion respiration approximately five volumes air added one volume dephlogisticated air gave common atmospheric air common air mixture two distinct chemical species quite different properties thus
