surgery replacing hip tha nonsurgical treatments associated outcomes summarized prognoses range surgical interventions although research seldom cause disease directed best treatment combinations many researchers concluded single conservative treatment basically ineffective interesting many researchers agree combination conservative treatments even combination minimally invasive conservative treatments good typical treatment moderate cases severe cases treated invasive treatment one technique mentioned studied bone grafting although traditional bone grafting receiving well remarks others
