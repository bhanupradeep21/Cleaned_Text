essential hypertension also called primary hypertension idiopathic hypertension form hypertension definition identifiable secondary common type affecting high blood remaining accounted various causes secondary primary hypertension tends familial likely consequence interaction environmental genetic factors prevalence essential hypertension increases age individuals relatively high blood pressure younger ages increased risk subsequent development hypertension hypertension increase risk cerebral cardiac renal recent classification recommends blood pressure criteria defining normal blood pressure prehypertension hypertension stages ii isolated systolic hypertension common occurrence among elderly readings based average seated blood pressure readings properly measured office visits individuals older years hypertension considered present persons blood pressure consistently least mmhg systolic mmhg diastolic patients blood pressures mmhg along type type diabetes kidney disease require resistant hypertension defined failure reduce blood pressure appropriate level taking threedrug guidelines treating resistant hypertension published uk hypertension one common complex disorders etiology hypertension differs widely amongst individuals within large definition essential hypertension identifiable cause however several risk factors identified genes examined association studies hypertension number constantly growing one genes angiotensinogen agt gene studied extensively kim et al showed increasing number agt increases blood pressure hence may cause single variant tests shown snps enriched variants associated adiposity type diabetes coronary heart disease kidney function previously published gwas providing evidence genetic loci related blood pressure contribute cardiovascular twins included studies measuring ambulatory blood pressure studies suggested large genetic influence essential supporting data emerged animal studies well clinical studies human populations majority studies support concept inheritance probably multifactorial number different genetic defects elevated blood pressure one phenotypic expressions however genetic influence hypertension fully understood moment believed linking hypertensionrelated phenotypes specific variations genome may yield definitive evidence another view hypertension caused mutations single genes inherited mendelian unhealthy diet includes excessive consumption unhealthy food recognized risk factor hypertension balanced diet recommended prevention hypertension also agerelated associated western diet lifestyle case likely one possible mechanism involves reduction vascular compliance due stiffening arteries build due isolated systolic hypertension widened pulse pressure decrease glomerular filtration rate related aging results decreasing efficiency sodium excretion developing certain diseases renal microvascular disease capillary rarefaction may relate decrease efficiency sodium excretion experimental evidence suggests renal microvascular disease important mechanism inducing saltsensitive obesity increase risk hypertension fivefold compared normal weight twothirds hypertension cases attributed excess cases occur body mass index bmi greater definitive link obesity hypertension found using animal clinical studies realized many mechanisms potential causes obesityinduced hypertension mechanisms include activation sympathetic nervous system well activation another risk factor salt sodium sensitivity environmental factor received greatest attention approximately one third essential hypertensive population responsive sodium sodium intake exceeds capacity body excrete kidneys blood volume expand due movement fluids osmosis blood vessels causes arterial pressure rise cardiac output increase local autoregulatory mechanisms counteract increasing vascular resistance blood flow order maintain normal pressure capillary blood vessels arterial pressure increases response high sodium chloride intake urinary sodium excretion increases higher excretion salt maintained expense increased arterial blood increased sodium ion concentration stimulates adh thirst mechanisms leading increased reabsorption water kidneys concentrated urine thirst higher intake water water transport cells interstitium plays minor rolecitation needed excessive alcohol consumption increase blood pressure time alcohol also contains high density calories may contribute renin elevation another risk factor renin enzyme secreted juxtaglomerular apparatus kidney linked aldosterone negative feedback loop consequence hypertensive patients defined lowrenin others essential hypertension lowrenin hypertension common african americans white americans may explain african americans tend respond better diuretic therapy drugs interfere systemcitation needed high renin levels predispose hypertension causing sodium retention following mechanism increased renin

resistance andor hyperinsulinemia components syndrome x metabolic syndrome insulin polypeptide hormone secreted cells islets langerhans contained throughout pancreas main purpose regulate levels glucose body antagonistically glucagon negative feedback loops insulin also exhibits vasodilatory properties normotensive individuals insulin may stimulate sympathetic activity without elevating mean arterial pressure however extreme conditions metabolic syndrome increased sympathetic neural activity may override vasodilatory effects insulincitation needed recent studies claim obesity risk factor hypertension activation system ras adipose also linked system insulin resistance claims one cause smoking directly cause high blood pressure however known risk factor serious cardiovascular suggested vitamin deficiency associated cardiovascular risk observed individuals vitamin deficiency higher systolic diastolic blood pressures average vitamin inhibits renin secretion activity therefore acts negative endocrine regulator system hence deficiency vitamin leads increase renin secretion one possible mechanism explaining observed link hypertension vitamin levels blood also authorities claim potassium might prevent treat regular physical exercise reduces blood pressure uk national health service advises minutes hours minutes moderateintensity aerobic activity per week help prevent cardiac
