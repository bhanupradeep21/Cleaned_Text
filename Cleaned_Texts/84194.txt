spawn eggs sperm released deposited water aquatic animals verb spawn refers process releasing eggs sperm act sexes called spawning aquatic animals except aquatic mammals reptiles reproduce process spawning spawn consists reproductive cells gametes many aquatic animals become fertilized produce offspring process spawning typically involves females releasing ova unfertilized eggs water often large quantities males simultaneously sequentially release spermatozoa milt fertilize fish reproduce spawning aquatic animals including crustaceans crabs shrimps molluscs oysters squid echinoderms sea urchins sea cucumbers amphibians frogs newts aquatic insects mayflies mosquitoes corals actually small aquatic plants fungi mushrooms also said spawn white fibrous matter forms matrix growcitation needed many variations way spawning occurs depending sexual differences anatomy sexes relate spawn released whether spawn subsequently guarded marine animals particularly bony fish commonly reproduce broadcast spawning external method reproduction female releases many unfertilised eggs water time male many males release lot sperm water fertilises eggs eggs contain drop nutrient oil sustain embryo develops inside egg case oil also provides buoyancy eggs float drift current strategy survival broadcast spawning disperse fertilised eggs preferably away coast relative safety open ocean larvae develop consume fat stores eventually hatch egg capsule miniature versions parents survive must become miniature predators feeding plankton fish eventually encounter others kind conspecifics form

externally many marine animals even spawning show little sexual dimorphism difference body shape size little difference colouration species dimorphic sharks guppies males often penislike intromittent organs form modified species semelparous individuals spawn lifetime iteroparous individuals spawn term semelparity comes latin semel pario beget iteroparity comes itero repeat pario beget semelparity sometimes called big bang reproduction since single reproductive event semelparous organisms usually large fatal classic example semelparous animal pacific salmon lives many years ocean swimming freshwater stream birth spawning dying spawning animals semelparous include mayflies squid octopus smelt capelin semelparity often associated rstrategists however fish spawning animals iteroparous internal ovaries egg masses fish certain marine animals ripe spawning called roe roe certain species shrimp scallop crab sea urchins sought human delicacies many parts world caviar name processed salted roe nonfertilized sturgeon term soft roe white roe denotes fish milt lobster roe called coral turns bright red cooked roe reproductive organs usually eaten either raw briefly cooked reproductive behaviour fishes remarkably diversified may oviparous lay eggs ovoviviparous retain eggs body hatch viviparous direct tissue connection developing embryos give birth live young cartilaginous elasmobranches eg sharks rays internal fertilization usually lay large heavyshelled eggs give birth live young characteristic features primitive bony fishes assemblage polyandrous many males breeding aggregations open water absence parental two main reproduction methods fish first method laying eggs second livebearing producing young alive monogamy occurs one male mates one female exclusively also called pair fish monogamous often alternate nonmonogamous behaviours monogamy occur feeding breeding grounds small difficult fish find partners sexes look many tropical cichlids rear young together locations must fiercely defend competitors predators pipefishes seahorses development eggs takes long time female place brood pouch male fertilized male pregnant female starts new batch eggs ready time male gives birth young previous mating close timing development promotes monogamy especially likelihood encountering another potential mate polygyny occurs one male gets exclusive mating rights multiple females polygyny large conspicuous male usually defends females males defends breeding females choose large males successfully defending prime breeding sites females find attractive example sculpin males defend caves underneath rocks suitable incubation embryos another way males get mate several females use leks leks places many fish come together males display based displays female selects male want mate example among cichlid cyrtocara eucinostomus lake malawi large colourful males display together lek four kilometres long females mouth brooders choose male want fertilize polyandry occurs one female gets exclusive mating rights multiple males happens among fish like clownfish change sex also happen males brooding handle eggs female produce males deep sea anglerfishes much smaller females find female bite skin releasing enzyme digests skin mouth body fusing pair bloodvessel level male slowly atrophies losing first digestive organs brain heart eyes ending nothing pair gonads release sperm response hormones females bloodstream indicating egg release ensures female ready spawn mate immediately single anglerfish female mate many males manner polygynandry occurs multiple males mate indiscriminately multiple females mutual promiscuity approach commonly used spawning animals perhaps original fish mating common examples forage fish herrings form huge mating shoals shallow water water becomes milky sperm bottom draped millions fertilized alternate male strategies allow small males engage cuckoldry develop species spawning dominated large
