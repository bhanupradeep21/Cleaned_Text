mutualism describes ecological interaction two species species net mutualism common type ecological interaction one come parasitic prominent examples include vascular plants engaged mutualistic interactions mycorrhizae flowering plants pollinated animals vascular plants dispersed animals corals zooxanthellae among many others mutualism contrasted interspecific competition species experiences reduced fitness exploitation parasitism one species benefits expense term mutualism introduced pierrejoseph van beneden book animal parasites messmates mean mutual aid among mutualism often conflated two types ecological phenomena cooperation symbiosis cooperation commonly refers increases fitness withinspecies intraspecific interactions although used especially past refer mutualistic interactions sometimes used refer mutualistic interactions symbiosis involves two species living close physical contact long period existence may mutualistic parasitic commensal symbiotic relationships always mutualistic mutualistic interactions always symbiotic despite different definition mutualistic interactions symbiosis mutualistic symbiosis largely used interchangeably past confusion use mutualism plays key part ecology evolution example mutualistic interactions vital terrestrial ecosystem function land plants species rely mycorrhizal relationships fungi provide inorganic compounds trace another example estimate tropical rainforest plants seed dispersal mutualisms animals ranges least addition mutualism thought driven evolution much biological diversity see flower forms important pollination mutualisms coevolution groups mutualism also linked major evolutionary events evolution eukaryotic cell symbiogenesis colonization land plants association mycorrhizal fungi mutualistic relationships thought form biological mycorrhizal associations plant roots fungi plant providing carbohydrates fungus return primarily phosphate also nitrogenous compounds examples include rhizobia bacteria fix nitrogen leguminous plants family fabaceae return energycontaining metabolite exchange multiple mutualistic species bacteria also observed process known serviceresource relationships common three important types pollination cleaning symbiosis zoochory pollination plant trades food resources form nectar pollen service pollen dispersal however daciniphilous bulbophyllum orchid species trade sex pheromone precursor booster components via floral synomonesattractants true mutualistic interactions males dacini fruit flies diptera tephritidae phagophiles feed resource ectoparasites thereby providing antipest service cleaning symbiosis elacatinus gobiosoma genera gobies feed ectoparasites clients cleaning zoochory dispersal seeds plants animals similar pollination plant produces food resources example fleshy fruit overabundance seeds animals disperse seeds service plants may advertise resources using colour variety fruit characteristics eg scent fruit aardvark cucumber cucumis humifructus buried deeply plant solely reliant upon aardvarks keen sense smell detect ripened fruit extract consume scatter c humifructuss geographical range thus restricted aardvarks another type ant protection aphids aphids trade sugarrich honeydew byproduct mode feeding plant sap return defense predators ladybugs strict serviceservice interactions rare reasons far one example relationship sea anemones anemone fish family pomacentridae anemones provide fish protection predators tolerate stings anemones tentacles fish defend anemones butterflyfish family chaetodontidae eat anemones however common many mutualisms one aspect anemonefishanemone mutualism waste ammonia fish feeds symbiotic algae found anemones therefore appears serviceservice mutualism fact serviceresource component second example relationship ants genus pseudomyrmex trees genus acacia whistling thorn bullhorn acacia ants nest inside plants thorns exchange shelter ants protect acacias attack herbivores frequently eat small enough introducing resource component serviceservice relationship competition plants trimming back vegetation would shade acacia addition another serviceresource component present ants regularly feed lipidrich foodbodies called beltian bodies acacia neotropics ant myrmelachista schumanni makes nest special cavities duroia hirsute plants vicinity belong species killed formic acid selective gardening aggressive small areas rainforest dominated duroia hirsute peculiar patches known local people devils relationships cost ants protection quite expensive cordia sp trees amazonian rainforest kind partnership allomerus sp ants make nests modified leaves increase amount living space available ants destroy trees flower buds flowers die leaves develop instead providing ants dwellings another type allomerus sp ant lives hirtella sp tree forests relationship tree turned tables ants tree ready produce flowers ant abodes certain branches begin wither shrink forcing

networks organized minimizes competition reduce spread indirect effects thus enhance ecosystem may even lead strong indirect facilitation pollinators conditions means pollinator species together
