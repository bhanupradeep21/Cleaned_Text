visceral pain pain results activation nociceptors thoracic pelvic abdominal viscera organs visceral structures highly sensitive distension stretch ischemia inflammation relatively insensitive stimuli normally evoke pain cutting burning visceral pain diffuse difficult localize often referred distant usually superficial structure may accompanied symptoms nausea vomiting changes vital signs well emotional manifestations pain may described sickening deep squeezing distinct structural lesions biochemical abnormalities explain type pain proportion patients diseases grouped gastrointestinal neuromuscular diseases ginmd others experience occasional visceral pains often intense nature without evidence structural biochemical histolopathologic reason symptoms diseases grouped functional gastrointestinal disorders fgid pathophysiology treatment vary greatly ginmd two major single entities among functional disorders gut functional dyspepsia irritable bowel visceral hypersensitivity hypersensitive visceral pain perception commonly experienced individuals functional gastrointestinal past viscera considered insensitive pain clear pain internal organs widespread social burden may surpass pain superficial somatic sources myocardial ischemia frequent cause cardiac pain common cause death united urinary colic produced ureteral stones categorized one intense forms pain human experience prevalence stones continuously increased reaching values developed surveys shown prevalence rates among adults intermittent abdominal pain chest pain women experience pelvic pain point time twothirds affected pain accepted part daily life symptoms selfmanaged small proportion defer specialists help visceral pain conditions associated diminished quality life exert huge cost burden medical expenses lost productivity visceral pain suspected vague midline sensations malaise reported patient true visceral pain characterized vague diffuse poorly defined regardless specific organ origin pain usually perceived midline spanning anywhere lower abdomen chest early phases pain perceived general area temporal evolution making onset sensation insidious difficult pain typically associated involvement autonomic nervous system symptoms include pallor sweating nausea vomit changes vital signs including blood pressure heart rate andor temperature strong emotional reactions also common presenting signs may include anxiety anguish sense impending doom visceral pathology may also manifest emotional reactions discomfort pain reported intensity visceral pain felt might relationship extent internal visceral pain changes nature progresses pain specific organ experienced referred different sites body pathology cause pain referred somatic sites however pain experienced location often significant intensity referred pain sharper better localized less likely accompanied autonomic emotional good example visceral pain common place embodies wide spectrum clinical presentations discussed myocardial infarction mi commonly known heart attack pain secondary ischemia cardiac tissue common presenting symptom chest pain often described tightness pressure squeezing onset symptoms usually gradual several minutes tends located central chest overlying sternum although experienced left chest right chest even abdominal area associated symptoms mostly autonomic nature include diaphoresis nausea vomiting palpitations anxiety often described sense impending referred pain experienced commonly radiating left arm however also radiate lower jaw neck back epigastrium patients especially elderly diabetics may present known painless myocardial infarction silent heart attack painless mi present associated symptoms heart attack including nausea vomiting anxiety heaviness choking classic chest pain described always important physician also patient remember dissociation magnitude injury internal organs intensity pain potentially dangerous overlooked example silent heart rarely intense visceral pain signify significant pathologic process example intense gas pains vague poorly defined sensation well temporal nature characteristic visceral pain due low density sensory innervation viscera extensive divergence visceral input within central nervous system phenomenon referred pain secondary convergence visceral afferent sensory nerve fibers entering spinal cord level superficial somatic structures experiencing pain leads misinterpretation incoming signals higher brain two goals treating visceral pain alleviate current experience pain address underlying pathology identifiable treatment pain many circumstances deferred origin symptoms identified masking pain may confound diagnostic process delay recognition lifethreatening conditions treatable condition identified reason withhold symptomatic treatment also cause pain found reasonable time symptomatic treatment pain could benefit patient order prevent longterm sensitization provide immediate symptomatic treatment visceral pain relies primarily upon pharmacotherapy since visceral pain result secondary wide variety causes without associated pathology wide variety pharmacological classes drugs used including variety analgesics ex opiates nsaids benzodiazepines antispasmodics ex loperamide antidepressants ex tca ssri snri well others ex ketamine clonidine gabapentin addition pharmacotherapy targets underlying cause pain help alleviate symptoms due lessening visceral nociceptive example use nitrates reduce anginal pain dilating coronary arteries thus reducing ischemia causing pain use spasmolytics antispasmodics help alleviate pain gastrointestinal obstruction inhibiting contraction issues associated pharmacotherapy include side effects ex constipation associated opiate use chemical dependence addiction inadequate pain relief invasive therapies general reserved patients pharmacological noninvasive therapies ineffective wide variety interventions available shown effective discussed approximately pelvic cancer pain patients benefit nerve nerve blocks offer temporary relief typically involve injection nerve bundle either local anesthetic steroid permanent nerve block produced destruction nerve tissue strong evidence multiple randomized controlled trials support use neurolytic celiac plexus block alleviate pain reduce opioid consumption patients malignant pain originating abdominal viscera neurostimulation device spinal cord stimulator scs refractory angina shown effective several randomized controlled scs may also used chronic pain conditions chronic pancreatitis familial mediterranean fever devices shown benefit reducing pain include transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulators tens targeted field stimulation used somatic
