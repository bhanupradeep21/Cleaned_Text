biology spore unit sexual fungi asexual reproduction may adapted dispersal survival often extended periods time unfavourable conditionscitation needed spores form part life cycles many plants algae fungi bacterial spores part sexual cycle resistant structures used survival unfavourable conditions myxozoan spores release amoeboid infectious germs amoebulae hosts parasitic infection also reproduce within hosts pairing two nuclei within plasmodium develops plants spores usually haploid unicellular produced meiosis sporangium diploid sporophyte favourable conditions spore develop new organism using mitotic division producing multicellular gametophyte eventually goes produce gametes two gametes fuse form zygote develops new sporophyte cycle known alternation generations spores seed plants produced internally megaspores formed within ovules microspores involved formation complex structures form dispersal units seeds pollen grains term spore derives ancient greek word σπορά spora meaning

difference spores seeds dispersal units spores unicellular first cell gametophyte seeds contain within developing embryo multicellular sporophyte next generation produced fusion male gamete pollen tube female gamete formed megagametophyte within ovule spores germinate give rise haploid gametophytes seeds germinate give rise diploid sporophytes vascular plant spores always haploid vascular plants either homosporous isosporous heterosporous plants homosporous produce spores size type heterosporous plants seed plants spikemosses quillworts ferns order salviniales produce spores two different sizes larger spore megaspore effect functioning female spore smaller microspore functioning male plants typically give rise two kind spores within separate sporangia either megasporangium produces megaspores microsporangium produces microspores flowering plants sporangia occur within carpel anthers respectively fungi commonly produce spores sexual asexual reproduction spores usually haploid grow mature haploid individuals mitotic division cells urediniospores teliospores among rusts dikaryotic dikaryotic cells result fusion two haploid gamete cells among sporogenic dikaryotic cells karyogamy fusion two haploid nuclei occurs produce diploid cell diploid cells undergo meiosis produce haploid spores spores classified several ways fungi funguslike organisms eg pseudofungi spores often classified structure meiosis spore production occurs since fungi often classified according sporeproducing structures spores often characteristic particular taxon fungi spores
