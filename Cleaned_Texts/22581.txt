fetal programming also known prenatal programming theory environmental cues experienced fetal development play seminal role determining health trajectories across lifespan three main forms programming occur due changes maternal environment changes maternal environmental due nutritional hormonal exposure toxins german blockade netherlands led lack food supplies causing dutch famine famine caused severe malnutrition among population including women various stages pregnancy dutch famine birth cohort study examined impact lack nutrition children born famine showed course life children greater risk diabetes cardiovascular disease obesity noncommunicable diseasescitation needed david barker began research study topic barker hypothesis thrifty phenotype forms basis much research conducted fetal programming hypothesis states fetus exposed low nutrition adapt particular environment nutrients diverted towards development heart brain essential organs fetus body also undergoes metabolic alterations ensure survival spite low nutrition may cause problems situations normal high leads increased risk metabolic syndrome developing fetus forms impression world born via mothers nutritional status development thus modulated create best chance survival however excessive insufficient nutrition mother provoke maladaptive developmental responses fetus turn manifest form postnatal diseases possible profound effect fetus adult life even outweigh lifestyle body mass index prior pregnancy weight gain pregnancy linked high blood pressure offspring adulthood mouse models suggest due high levels fetal hormone leptin present blood individuals overweight obese theory hormone negative impact regulatory systems fetus renders impossible maintain normal blood pressure preeclampsia involving oxygen deprivation death trophoblastic cells make placenta disease often associated maladaptive longterm consequences inappropriate fetal programming inadequately developed poorly functioning placenta fails meet fetus nutritional needs gestation either altering selection nutrients cross fetal blood restricting total volume thereof consequences fetus adult life include cardiovascular metabolic delicate balance hormones pregnancy regarded highly relevant fetal programming may significantly influence outcome placental endocrine transfer mother developing fetus could altered mental state mother due affected glucocorticoid transfer takes place across thyroid hormones play instrumental role early development fetuss brain therefore mothers suffering thyroidrelated issues altered thyroid hormone levels may inadvertently trigger structural functional changes fetal brain fetus able produce thyroid hormones onset second trimester however maternal thyroid hormones important brain development baby able synthesize hormones still due baby may experience increased risk neurological psychiatric diseases later cortisol glucocorticoids generally well studied hormonal mechanism may prenatal programming although cortisol normative developmental effects prenatal development excess cortisol exposure deleterious effects fetal postnatal function physiological systems hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis brain structure connectivity eg gestation cortisol concentrations maternal circulation ten times higher cortisol concentrations fetal maternaltofetal cortisol gradient maintained placenta forms structural enzymatic barrier first two trimesters gestation intrauterine cortisol primarily produced maternal adrenal however third trimester fetal adrenal glands begin endogenously produce cortisol become responsible intrauterine cortisol time fetus reaches mental state mother pregnancy affects fetus uterus predominantly via hormones mothers mood including maternal prenatal anxiety depression stress pregnancy correlates altered outcomes said every fetus exposed factors affected way degree genetic environmental factors believed significant degree maternal depression poses one greatest risks increased vulnerability adverse outcomes baby developing uterus especially terms susceptibility variety psychological mechanisms may explain connection maternal depression offsprings future health mostly unclear form current area active genetic inheritance may rendering child susceptible may play role including effect intrauterine environment baby whilst mother suffers maternally experienced psychological stress occurs either prior gestation intergenerational effects offspring stress experienced gestation linked preterm delivery low birth weight increased risk new mother may suffer aftereffects postpartum depression subsequently may find parenting difficult compared experience much stress toxins alcohol tobacco certain drugs baby exposed development thought contribute fetal programming especially via alterations hpa exposure occurs critical phase fetal development could drastic dire consequences prenatal andor early postnatal exposure alcohol ethanol found negative effect childs neuroendocrine behavioral alcohol passes placenta ingested mother pregnancy makes way baby changes posed fetus ethanol exposure may significantly effect growth development collectively known fetal alcohol spectrum disorders exact interaction ethanol developing fetus complex largely uncertain however several direct indirect effects observed fetus predominant among irregularities fetuss endocrine metabolic physiological negative consequences smoking wellknown may even apparent exposure tobacco smoke pregnancy commonly known utero maternal tobacco smoke exposure mtse contribute towards various problems babies smoking mothers smoke whilst pregnant associated increased risk complications preterm birth decreased fetal growth leading lower birth weight impaired fetal lung evidence pointing towards pharmacological programming fetus first one type drugs suspected influencing developing baby used pregnancy antihypertensive preeclampsia
