conjunction united states army state department stateville experiment viewed coercive offered shortened sentences green report written andrew conway ivy used nuremberg medical trial affected nuremberg code used discuss medical experimentation prisoners carried circumstances world war ii resulted urgent need development new malaria treatments first us soldiers deployed areas pacific extremely high rates malaria us army estimated millions manhours lost due malaria throughout war thus critically important mitigate effects disease interest military second conventional treatment malaria quinine largely unavailable throughout war japanese control philippines indonesia cut supply quinine united states adding need alternate new risks malaria posed world war ii called experimentation unprecedented scale particular focus human subjects prison offered environment conducive controlled scientific experimentation human subjects malaria experiments stateville penitentiary noteworthy utilization prison environment across aspects experiments prison population allowed researchers limit extraneous variables across subjects participants studies exclusively white men similar age health primary demographic stateville penitentiary population prisoners also inherently homogenous terms behavior due restrictions imposed maximumsecurity followup evaluations possible virtually subjects study since longterm sentences offers parole reevaluation well financial incentives typically experimental trial adjusted inflation yielded exceptionally high availability subjects willing us committee medical research formed contract university chicago test novel malaria treatments stateville penitentiary alf alving nephrologist university chicago directed research oversaw formation clinical research division prison hospital alving worked ray dern ernest beutler two physicians also university malaria research project primarily conducted floor prison hospital stateville penitentiary study aimed understand effect various antimalarial drugs relapses malaria primarily group compounds study marked first human test antimalarial drug experiment doctors university chicago bred anopheles quadrimaculatus mosquitoes mosquitoes infected plasmodium vivax malaria strain isolated military patient five malaria strains genus plasmodium protozoan parasites study considered chesson strain p vivax sourced military patient infected p vivax predominant form malaria pacific associated milder symptoms unlike plasmodium falciparum typically deadly strain known resistance standard treatment quinine frequent occurrences subjects prison maintained strain via blood inoculations control test subjects constant number mosquito bites infected insects administered researchers dissected mosquitoes determine intensity resultant researchers tested patient responses various potential treatments majority treatments yet evaluated humans toxicity potency thus unknown compounds analogs pamaquine existing alternative quinine unfavorable due higher toxicity researchers tested wide range doses including exceptionally high doses treatments known toxic purpose establish maximum margin safety observe manifestation side effects thus adverse side effects intentionally caused subjects demonstrate possible worstcase reaction extremely highpotency treatments one case subject died several days injected high dosage potential treatment considered prison environment study created unique complex social dynamic prisoners involved many aspects study subjects wellknown participant
