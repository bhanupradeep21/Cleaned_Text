ambiguous images reversible figures visual forms create ambiguity exploiting graphical similarities properties visual system interpretation two distinct image forms famous inducing phenomenon multistable perception multistable perception occurrence image able provide multiple although stable perceptions one earliest examples type illusion first published fliegende blätter german humor classic examples rubin wife motherinlaw drawing latter dating german postcard ambiguous images important field psychology often research tools used varying evidence whether ambiguous images represented majority research theorized mental images middle vision stage visual processing combines basic features scene distinct recognizable object groups stage vision comes highlevel vision understanding scene early vision determining basic features image perceiving recognizing images midlevel vision comes use need classify object seeing quickly whether perceived actual negative space play role higherlevel vision used object classified must recognized specific member group example midlevel vision perceive face highlevel vision recognize face familiar person midlevel vision highlevel vision crucial understanding reality filled ambiguous perceptual see image first thing attempt organize parts scene different one basic methods used finding edges edges include obvious perceptions edge house include perceptions brain needs process deeper edges persons facial features finding edges brains visual system detects point image sharp contrast lighting able detect location edge object aids recognizing object ambiguous images detecting edges still seems natural person perceiving image however brain undergoes deeper processing resolve ambiguity example consider image involves opposite change magnitude luminance object background eg top background shifts black white object shifts white black opposing gradients eventually come point equal degree luminance object background point edge perceived counter visual system connects image whole rather set edges allowing one see object rather edges nonedges although complete image seen brain able accomplish understanding physical world real incidents ambiguous ambiguous images illusion often produced illusory contours illusory contour perceived contour without presence physical gradient examples white shape appears occlude black objects white background white shape appears brighter background edges shape produce illusory illusory contours processed brain similar way real visual system accomplishes making inferences beyond information presented much way luminance gradient midlevel vision visual system utilizes set heuristic methods called gestalt grouping rules quickly identify basic perception object helps resolve allows perception fast easy observing patterns familiar images rather slow process identifying part group aids resolving ambiguous images visual system accept small variations pattern still perceive pattern whole gestalt grouping rules result experience visual system pattern perceived frequently stored memory perceived easily without requirement examining entire object example looking chess board perceive checker pattern set alternating black white squares principle good continuation provides visual system basis identifying continuing edges means set lines perceived tendency line continue one direction allows visual system identify edges complex image identifying points lines cross example two lines crossed x shape perceived two lines travelling diagonally rather two lines changing direction form v shapes opposite example ambiguous image would two curving lines intersecting point junction would perceived way x intersection seen lines crossing rather turning away illusions good continuation often used magicians trick rule similarity states images similar grouped together type object part object therefore similar two images objects likely grouped together example two squares among many circles grouped together vary similarity colour size orientation properties ultimately grouped together varying degrees grouping property proximity gestalt spatial distance two objects closer two objects likely belong group perception ambiguous without person perceiving ambiguous example two objects varying distances orientations viewer may appear proximal third object may closer one objects appear farther objects occupying common region image appear already members group include unique spatial location two objects occupying distinct region space outside groups objects close proximity appear though part distinct group various visual aids threshold colours separating two objects additionally objects visually connected ways drawing line going object similar hierarchical rules suggest gestalt rules override visual system also aid resolving ambiguities detecting pattern texture image accomplished using many gestalt principles texture provide information helps distinguish whole objects changing texture image reveals distinct objects may part group texture segmentation rules often cooperate compete examining texture yield information layers image disambiguating background foreground region texture completely surrounds another region texture likely background additionally smaller regions texture image likely parallelism another way disambiguate figure image orientation contours different textures image determine objects grouped together generally parallel contours suggest membership object group objects similarly symmetry contours also define figure extremal edge change texture suggests object front behind another object due shading effect edges one region texture giving appearance depth extremal edge effects overwhelm segmentations surroundedness size edges perceived also aid distinguishing objects examining change texture edge due nature camouflage used organisms escape predators achieved creating ambiguity texture segmentation imitating surrounding environment without able perceive noticeable differences texture position predator unable see many ambiguous images produced occlusion wherein objects texture suddenly stops occlusion visual perception one object behind front another object providing information order layers illusion occlusion apparent effect illusory contours occlusion perceived despite nonexistent ambiguous image perceived instance occlusion object occluded visual system information parts object seen rest processing must done deeper must involve memory accidental viewpoint single visual position produces ambiguous image accidental viewpoint provide enough information distinguish object often image perceived incorrectly produces illusion differs reality example image may split half top half enlarged placed away perceiver space image perceived one complete image single viewpoint space rather reality two separate halves object creating optical illusion street artists often use tricks pointofview create twodimensional scenes ground appear threedimensional figures drawn way avoids depth cues may become ambiguous classic examples phenomenon necker rhombille tiling viewed isometric drawing cubes go perceiving object recognize object recognizing object plays crucial role resolving ambiguous images relies heavily memory prior knowledge recognize object visual system detects familiar components compares perceptual representation representation object stored done using various templates object dog represent dogs general template method always successful members group may significantly differ visually may look much different viewed different angles counter problem viewpoint visual system detects familiar components object space components object perceived position orientation object memory recognition research shown people creative imagery better able resolve ambiguous images may due ability quickly identify patterns making mental representation ambiguous image way normal images part defined put onto mental representation complex scene longer takes process add memory large impact resolving ambiguous image helps visual system identify recognize objects without analyze categorize repeatedly without memory prior knowledge image several groups similar objects difficult perceive object ambiguous representation mistakenly categorized wrong groups without sufficient memory recognition object finding suggests prior experience necessary proper studies done use greebles show role memory object act priming participant exposure similar visual stimulus also large effect ease resolving prosopagnosia disorder causes person unable identify faces visual system undergoes midlevel vision identifies face highlevel vision fails identify face belongs case visual system identifies ambiguous object face unable resolve ambiguity using memory leaving affected unable determine gustave verbeek wrote comic series upside downs
