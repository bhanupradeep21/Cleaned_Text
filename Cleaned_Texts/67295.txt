certain john phillips assimilated pliosaur fossils discovered charles leeds oxford clay formation formation well known significant preservation plesiosaurians dated callovian stage middle period ranging million specimen consisting swimming paddle mandible rather well preserved assigned scientific name pleiosaurus grandis phillips specimen consisting elongated mandibular symphysis possessing pairs teeth fifth sixth anterior ones caniniform richard lydekker referred specimen newly named peloneustes philarchus following year lydekker assigned mandible proposed species peloneustes evansi due
