muraenosaurus latin muraena meaning eel sauros meaning lizard extinct genus cryptoclidid plesiosaur reptile oxford clay southern england genus given name due eellike appearance long neck small head muraenosaurus grew metres ft length lived roughly million years ago callovian middle jurassic charles e leeds collected first muraenosaurus described h g specimen may suffered damage due casual style charles leeds collection first muraenosaur recovered pieces missing skull many caudal vertebrae absent animal described charles leeds collection given name muraenosaurus leedsi leedsi complete specimen belonging genus muraenosaurus also species undoubtedly member two species tentatively referred members genus muraenosaurus reedii muraenosaurus beloclis seeley became separate genus picrocleidus muraenosaurus reedii discovered wyoming described maurice mehl university chicago fossilized fragments found consisted pieces pectoral pelvic girdles several vertebrae ribs relatively complete left pectoral paddle connections leedsi reedii drawn examining ribs structure paddle reedii similarly shaped elongated humerus relatively short species reedii fact junior synonym picrocleidus beloclis another plesiosaur originating middle jurassic found oxford clay formation picrocleidus previously considered synonymous muraenosaurus although doubts relationship two muraenosaurus mediumsized plesiosaur largest specimen measuring metres ft plesiosaur presacral vertebrae cervical starting base skull moving posteriorly cervical vertebrae elongate neural spines broaden may indicative increased muscle attachment towards base also gradual flattening reduction zygapohesis vertebra traces platform gone posterior cervical vertebrae muraenosaurus pectoral vertebrae thoracic pectoral vertebrae resemble terminal cervical vertebrae display broadened face centrum slight posterior incline neural spines dorsal vertebrae rib raised onto neural arch neural spines elongated anteroposteriorly compressed pectoral girdle muraenosaurus broader plesiosaurs helped situate animal member cryptoclididae coracoids reach widths nearly inches forelimb compressed mediolaterally compared hind limb well limbs compression represented aspect ratio muraenosaur limbs aspect ratio hind limbs much greater fore limbs representing longer slender high aspect ratio forelimbs may used increasing maneuverability cost animals endurance harry seeley first described muraenosaurus thought belong elasmosauridae instead cryptoclididae muraenosaurs elasmosaurs share plesiosauromorph body type typified small head end long like elasmosaurids muraenosaurus long neck presacral vertebrae muraenosaurus cervical initially believed innovation leads largely flexible neck relatively short sturdy body recent research shown mobile neck plesiosauromorphs flexible previously head muraenosaurus also small compared neck body length measuring centimetres traits common elasmosaurids led initial diagnosis muraenosaurs family elasmosauridae however actually case convergent evolution cryptoclidids clade cryptoclidids creates unique tree relation paleomorphology discovered specimens example within cryptocleidoidae short necked plesiosaurs kimmerosaurus well long necked muraenosaurus defining features cryptocleidoidia include low fin aspect ratio wide rounded interpterygoid vacuity extreme specialization cheek interpterygoid vacuity completely absent elasmosaur species well represented cryptoclidids including aspect ratio fore hind limbs muraenosaurus far lower aspect ratio elasmosaur specimens fore limbs especially resemble flippers pliosauridae extinct group less elongate marine reptiles shared seas plesiosaurs resemble typical plesiosaur morphology cryptoclidus another cryptoclidid plesiosaurimorph shares trait muraenosaurus initially discovered oxford clay represents ancient sea shallow average depth less meters warm oxford clay deposits found southern england parts france sea abundant nutrients light filtered easily shallow water create highly productive ecosystem sea floor littered bivalves arthropods gastropods foraminifera pelagic zone home wide variety species marine reptiles teleosts oxford clay productive genera recovered muraenosaurus role ecosystem probably comparable elasmosaurs cryptoclidids due plesiosauromorph body plans shared elasmosaurs muraenosaurs cryptoclidids varying morphology difficult assess ecological role collective unit long necked plesiosaurs discovered varying contents lithified within stomachs give indication muraenosaurus may preferred prey types seem teleost fish order exploit different prey species plesiosaurs would need multiple different feeding initially long necked plesiosaurs thought strictly fish eaters due conical teeth shared trait modern piscivores proposed plesiosaurimophs would swim straight neck attack pelagic straight neck would used order avoid creating drag arching neck upward water column additionally researchers proposed swimming head directly front body plesiosaurs would able reach pelagic fishes felt change water pressure caused large body plesiosaur essentially head would precede pressure also proposed species like muraenosaurus fed upon benthic fishes floating reaching head plesiosauromorphs may also employed strategy called benthic grazing would harvest relatively immobile species cephalopods sea floor gastroliths often found within stomachs extinct marine reptiles associated plesiosauromorph body type one proposed uses gastroliths grinding tough shelled foods like food chain stop plesiosaurimorphs oceans mesozoic dominated pliosaurs apex predators would preyed upon species like pliosaurs animals would fed muraenosaurus though evidence comes several cases shark teeth found plesiosaurimorph however certain specimens alive attacked whether sharks feeding carcasses deceased plesiosaurimorphs shredding teeth lamniform sharks indicates perhaps scavengers detrivores fed upon dead muraenosaurus important piece ecosystem carnivore source food species gastroliths common find among stomach contents extinct marine reptiles occurrence led two main hypotheses regarding significance first proposed usage described crush hard shelled food engulfed second hypothesis gastroliths swallowed order help maintain controllable buoyancy within water column modeling cryptoclidus body types indicated use gastroliths ballast order effect animals buoyancy muraenosaur would consume body mass observed masses stone collected plesiosaur stomachs far lower modeled mass required effect buoyancy however modeling new possibility emerged gastroliths may helped prevent rolling animals like muraenosaurus models indicated stones reduce pivoting depth also possible dampened ossilations plesiosaurs neck helping provide stability counter underwater httpsenwikipediaorgwikimuraenosaurus
