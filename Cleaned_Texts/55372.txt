discovered one two many specimens found dolese brothers limestone quarry near richards spur cacops morrisi skull differs c aspidephorus snout slightly longer postorbital region shorter distance orbit temporal emargination uncinate processes cacops woehri named honor daniel woehr amateur collector fossils specimens found dolese brothers limestone quarry near richards spur cacops woehri differs c aspidephorus c morrisi many attributes including shallow skull dorsally located orbits narrow opening tympanic embayment contribution postparietals skull roof also appears shorter c woehri c morrisi occipital flanges proportionately larger c woehri notable differences distinguishable c morrisi include absence lateral exposure ectopterygoid juveniles absence tusklike teeth anterior margin interpterygoid vacuities quadratojugal lacking anterior teeth c woehri also recurved c aspidephorus c morrisi showing instead distinct lingual curvature different skull shape theorized specific taxon may different ecology sister taxa possibly different prey suggests could different functional demands dissorophoids found oklahoma american paleontologist samuel w williston used details species

look however poor preservation specimens collected cacops bone bed texas researchers collected specimens localities described many cacops features features distinguish cacops dissorophids include large dorsal process quadrate shortened posterior skull boxlike cheeks aligned almost right angle skull table external cranial ornamentation noticeable skull table top ridges border numerous depressions one significant ontogenetic change cacops evenly distributed ornamentation adults like dissorophids temporal region cacops skull dominated tympanic embayment likely housed large tympanum marginal teeth recurved thinner temnospondyls cacops fewer larger teeth palatal dentition consists recurved tusks larger marginal teeth minute strongly recurved teeth cover palatal cacops mediumsized

flanges pterygoid extend level marginal tooth row interpreted adaptive capturing holding struggling feature also seen trematopids like many terrestrial tetrapods cacops exhibits evidence tympanic membrane form large smooth unornamented flange otic notch bears faint striations inferred sites among modern amniotes sensory perception requires specialized middle ear collects airborne sounds tympanic membrane delivers vibrations inner ear via multiple structures including thus discovery slender stapes cacops aspidephorus suggested cacops ability hear airborne early amniotes contemporary cacops lacked tympanum difference terrestrial vertebrates suggests two groups different abilities hear airborne locomotion cacops aspidephorus explored two studies david two series osteoderms presacral vertebral column affect biomechanics axial skeleton cacops internal series consist osteoderm fused distal tips neural spine external series lie dorsal segments internal series portions
