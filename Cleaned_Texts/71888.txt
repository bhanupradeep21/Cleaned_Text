certain conservation projects nature usually individuals well suited natural circumstances survive reproduce whereas humans select animals additional attractive docile productive characteristics protecting dangers found ancestral environment predation drought disease extremes weather lack mating opportunities etc cases selection criteria nature differ found domesticated conditions domesticated animals often differ significantly phenotype behaviour genetics wild forerunners hope breedingback programs reexpress within new breeding lineage wild ancient traits may lain buried dna

attempts result animal closer wild type primitive domestic breeds example heck cattle bear less resemblance aurochs many iberian fighting ideas creating aurochslike animal domestic cattle around since heinz lutz heck tried breed aurochs lookalike using central european dairy breeds southern european cattle result heck cattle hardy differ aurochs many respects although resemblance colour less
