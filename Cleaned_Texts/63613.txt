supported examining erosional features sam bones mesosuchus first found david meredith seares watson examining block sandstone kept private collection mr alfred block found middle deposits burgersdorp cynognathus assemblage zone near town aliwal north cape province south block sandstone contained many intermingled partial skeletons several small reptiles careful sorting watson considered unidentified skeletons belong single new species named mesosuchus browni etymology name suggests watson believed mesosuchus ancestral crocodile close affinities presumed primitive crocodilians proterosuchus erythrosuchus ornithosuchus however robert broom looked closely partial skeletons immediately determined fact skeletons two distinct though related species broom designated articulated skeleton single external naris pair supposed acrodont premaxillary teeth type remainder specimens assigned new genus species euparkeria capensis looking back see confusion watson giving name
