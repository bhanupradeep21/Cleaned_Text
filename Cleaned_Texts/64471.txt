toxic leukoencephalopathy rare condition characterized progressive damage pathy white matter leuko brain encephalo particularly myelin due causes exposure substance use environmental toxins chemotherapeutic drugs prevalence disease infrequent often goes unreported especially cases resulting substance use magnetic resonance imaging mri popular method study diagnose disease however even technological advances exact mechanism underlying pathophysiology toxic leukoencephalopathy remains unknown thought vary sources toxicity clinical severity toxic leukoencephalopathy also varies among patients exposure time concentration purity toxic agent reversibility condition seen many cases toxic agent removed symptoms vary widely sources toxicity dosage length time patient exposed toxic substance patient history patient genetics especially case leukoencephalopathy developing due substance use environmental toxins symptoms typically develop several days months exposure pharmacological clinical features range inattention forgetfulness changes personality dementia coma even obvious signs condition difficulty cognitive equilibrioceptioncitation needed common initial symptoms include confusion somnolence generalized seizures headaches vision young acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients methotrexateinduced leukoencephalopathy appear however toxic leukoencephalopathy induced substance use environmental toxins damaging side effects heroininduced leukoencephalopathy three stages first stage features soft pseudobulbar speech cerebellar ataxia motor restlessness intermediate stage includes pyramidal tract pseudobulbar signs spastic paresis myoclonic jerks choreoathetoid movements final terminal stage characterized stretching spasms akinetic mutism hypotonic paresis central pyrexia death similarly leukoencephalopathy induced orally administered methotrexate arthritis patients presents similar symptoms including ataxia dysarthria however longterm cognitive effects remain symptoms leukoencephalopathy caused overdose metronidazole medication include dysarthria gait disturbance weakness extremities mental despite pharmacological agent source toxicity patients completely recover toxic posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome pres also result medication symptoms similar leukoencephalopathy patients seen pres patients however prognosis toxic leukoencephalopathy typically slightly worse pres toxic leukoencephalopathy likely lead ataxia dementia hypoglycemic encephalopathy often seen diabetics result accidental overdose longacting

pharmacological agents known cause toxic leukoencephalopathy common causes substance use chemotherapy however disease also occurred rare occasion side effect certain medications environmental toxinscitation needed leukoencephalopathy may result inhalation intravenous injection ingestion addictive substances however occurrences rare sporadic often go undocumented leukoencephalopathy caused inhalation also known chasing dragon one studied rare occurrences even recognized twenty five believed researchers heroininduced leukoencephalopathy may caused contaminant cutting agent however agent

intoxicated pure morphine sulfate drugs associated toxic leukoencephalopathy much rare occurrences include psychoactive drug relationship substances remains unclearcitation needed various chemotherapy

contrast intravenous methotrexate cancer patients leukoencephalopathy induced orally taken methotrexate may associated cognitive dysfunction even deathcitation needed oxycodone main active ingredient various oral pain relief high doses opiates oxycodone lead leukoencephalopathy activity various opioid nociceptive receptors appear play role disease however exact mechanism remains unknowncitation
