hbtu hexafluorophosphate benzotriazole tetramethyl uronium coupling reagent used solid phase peptide synthesis introduced shows resistance used mild activating product obtained reaction hobt tetramethyl chloro uronium salt tmucl assigned uronium type structure presumably analogy corresponding phosphonium salts bear positive carbon atom instead phosphonium residue later shown xray analysis salts crystallize aminium rather corresponding uronium hbtu activates carboxylic acids forming stabilized hobt hydroxybenzotriazole leaving group activated intermediate species attacked amine aminolysis hobt ester create hobt ester carboxyl group acid attacks imide carbonyl carbon hbtu subsequently displaced anionic benzotriazole noxide attacks acid carbonyl giving tetramethyl urea byproduct activated ester aminolysis displaces benzotriazole noxide form desired httpsenwikipediaorgwikihbtu
