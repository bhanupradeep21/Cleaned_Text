pulmonary laceration chest injury lung tissue torn injury potentially serious pulmonary contusion pulmonary laceration involves disruption architecture pulmonary contusion pulmonary laceration commonly caused penetrating trauma may also result forces involved blunt trauma shear stress cavity filled blood air injury diagnosed collections air fluid found ct scan chest surgery may required stitch laceration drain blood even remove injured parts lung injury commonly heals quickly problems given proper treatment however may associated scarring lung complications complications common include infection lung abscess bronchopleural fistula fistula pleural space bronchial bronchopleural fistula results communication laceration bronchiole pleura cause air leak pleural space despite placement chest laceration also enlarge may occur injury creates valve allows air enter laceration progressively expanding one complication air embolism air enters bloodstream potentially fatal especially occurs left side air enter circulatory system damaged vein injured chest travel organ especially deadly heart positive pressure ventilation cause pulmonary embolism forcing air injured lungs blood pulmonary laceration common result penetrating trauma may also caused blunt trauma broken ribs may perforate lung tissue may torn due shearing result different rates acceleration deceleration different tissues violent compression chest cause lacerations rupturing shearing lung pulmonary laceration may result blunt penetrating forces occur injury may associated pulmonary lacerations lung tissue also occur compression alveoli ribs contusions pulmonary lacerations usually occur near solid structures chest pulmonary laceration suspected rib fractures pulmonary laceration cause air leak lacerated pleural space laceration goes pulmonary laceration invariably results pneumothorax due torn airways hemothorax due torn blood vessels hemopneumothorax blood air chest unlike hemothoraces occur due pulmonary contusion due lung laceration may large long however lungs usually bleed much blood vessels involved small pressure within therefore pneumothorax usually problem pneumothorax may form turned tension pneumothorax mechanical ventilation may force air tear laceration may also close cause trap blood potentially form cyst lung elastic tear forms round cyst called traumatic air cyst may filled air blood air usually shrinks period weeks lacerations filled air called pneumatoceles filled blood called pulmonary cases pneumatoceles hematomas exist injured pneumatocele become enlarged example patient mechanically ventilated acute respiratory distress syndrome case may go away pulmonary hematomas take longer heal simple pneumatoceles commonly leave lungs time walls lung lacerations tend grow thicker due edema bleeding pulmonary laceration may visible using chest xray associated pulmonary contusion hemorrhage may mask lung contusion clears usually within two four days lacerations begin become visible chest ct scanning sensitive better detecting pulmonary laceration xrays often reveals multiple lacerations cases chest xray showed ct scanning widely available pulmonary laceration considered unusual common find xray ct scan pulmonary lacerations show contused area typically appearing cavities filled air usually round ovoid shape due lungs hematomas appear chest radiographs smooth masses round ovoid like lacerations hematomas may initially hidden xray lung contusions become apparent contusion begins pneumatoceles similar shape hematomas thin smooth lacerations may filled completely blood completely air partially lacerations filled blood air display distinctive airfluid single laceration may occur many may present creating appearance like swiss cheese radiography pulmonary laceration usually accompanied hemoptysis coughing blood bloodstained thoracoscopy may used diagnosis treatment pulmonary healing laceration may resemble lung nodule radiographs unlike pulmonary nodules lacerations decrease size time group led rb wagner divided pulmonary lacerations four types based manner person injured indications found ct type lacerations occur mid lung area airfilled lung bursts result sudden compression also called compressionrupture lacerations type common type usually occur central location tend large ranging size shearing stress type results lower chest suddenly compressed lower lung suddenly moved across vertebral type also called tends occur near spine elongated type lacerations usually occur younger people flexible type caused punctures fractured ribs occur area near chest wall underlying broken also called rib penetration lacerations type lacerations tend accompanied commonly one type laceration type also called adhesion occur cases pleuropulmonary adhesion formed prior injury chest wall suddenly fractured pushed occur subpleural area result shearing forces sites transpleural chest injuries pulmonary contusion hemothorax pneumothorax pulmonary laceration often treated supplemental oxygen ventilation drainage fluids chest thoracostomy tube used remove blood air chest cases require surgery called thoracotomy especially likely needed lung fails reexpand pneumothorax bleeding coughing blood persist order remove clotted blood surgical treatment includes stapling oversewing wedging occasionally surgeons must perform lobectomy lobe lung removed pneumonectomy entire lung full recovery common proper pulmonary laceration usually heals quickly chest tube inserted usually associated major longterm pulmonary lacerations usually heal within three five lacerations filled air commonly heal within one three weeks occasion take however injury often takes weeks months heal lung may small pulmonary lacerations frequently heal material removed pleural space surgery may required larger lacerations heal properly httpsenwikipediaorgwikipulmonarylaceration
