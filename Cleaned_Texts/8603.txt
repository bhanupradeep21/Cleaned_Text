mating pool concept used evolutionary computation refers family algorithms used solve optimization search mating pool formed candidate solutions selection operators deem highest fitness current population solutions included mating pool referred parents individual solutions repeatedly included mating pool individuals higher fitness values higher chance included multiple times crossover operators applied parents resulting recombination genes recognized superior lastly random changes genes introduced mutation operators increasing genetic variation gene pool two operators improve chance creating new superior solutions new generation solutions thereby created children constitute next population depending selection method total number parents mating pool different size initial population resulting new population smaller continue algorithm equally sized population random individuals old populations chosen added new point fitness value new solutions evaluated termination conditions fulfilled processes come end otherwise repeated repetition steps result candidate solutions evolve towards optimal solution time genes become increasingly uniform towards optimal gene process called convergence population share version gene gene converged individual fitness values reached value best individual ie genes converged population convergence several methods applied create mating pool processes involve selective breeding particular number individuals within population multiple criteria employed determine individuals make mating pool left behind selection methods split three general types fitness proportionate selection ordinal based selection threshold based selection case fitness proportionate selection random individuals selected enter pool however ones higher level fitness likely picked therefore greater chance passing features next one techniques used type parental selection roulette wheel selection approach divides hypothetical circular wheel different slots size equal fitness values potential candidate afterwards wheel rotated fixed point determines individual gets picked greater fitness value individual higher probability chosen parent random spin wheel alternatively stochastic universal sampling implemented selection method also based rotation spinning wheel however case one fixed point result mating pool members selected ordinal based selection methods include tournament ranking selection tournament selection involves random selection individuals population subsequent comparison fitness levels winners tournaments ones highest values put mating pool parents ranking selection individuals sorted based fitness values selection parents made according rank candidates every individual chance chosen higher ranked ones last type selection method referred threshold based method includes truncation selection method sorts individuals based phenotypic values specific trait later selects proportion within certain threshold httpsenwikipediaorgwikimatingpool
