tooth replantation form restorative dentistry avulsed luxated tooth secured socket combination dental procedures purposes tooth replantation resolve tooth loss preserve natural landscape whilst variations procedure exist including allotransplantation tooth transferred one individual another individual largely defunct practice due improvements made within field dentistry due risks complications involved including transmission diseases well low success rate procedure resulted practice largely abandoned autotransplantation otherwise known intentional replantation dentistry defined surgical movement tooth one site individual another location rare modern dentistry uses replantation form proactive care prevent future complications protect natural cases root canal surgical endodontic treatments problematic modern context tooth replantation often refers reattachment avulsed luxated permanent tooth original socket one first recorded surgeries details tooth replantation made ambroise par√© however earlier dental interventions nature documented century ad made described replantation use ligatures splint replanted tooth earliest instances tooth replantation however traced back ancient egypt slaves forced give teeth pharaoh tooth replantation saw usage within century europe becoming popular nearing end century often form allotransplantation many cases older wealthy patients whose teeth decayed often paid poor people teeth removed replanted another instance similar situation occurred napoleonic wars soldiers forced donate teeth officers lost battle

endodontists oral surgeons prior implantation suitability avulsed tooth gum must assessed determine correct procedure tooth implantation prior beginning procedure local anaesthetic administered palatal lingual tissues numb surrounding area minimise discomfort gentle irrigation saline solution performed tooth remove blood clots possible contaminants tooth following preparation injury gum treated tooth reinserted socket kept stable use splints adjacent patient may given mild pain killers paracetamol pain antibiotics may also prescribed prevent infection patient avoid rinsing mouth spitting contact sports smoking first hours surgery limit food soft diet next days following surgery subsequent check ups may required evaluate success procedure leakage toxins infected pulp dentinal tubules start chain reaction stimulates osteoclasts resorb cementum dentin also alveolar bone starts aggressive resorption process lead loss root structure months following type trauma tooth possibility tooth discolour teeth damaged injured way internal bleeding occurs pulp chamber blood gets dentinal nerves gets trapped pulp staining dentin post trauma tooth discolour turn black grey within days injury mild tooth may return original status however severely traumatised tooth may darken gradually passing day indicating poor functioning dentinal nerves tooth ultimately loses vitality within months year require nerve replacement osseous resorption otherwise known ankylosis replanted teeth occurs root stripped periodontal membrane osteoclasts originating surrounding alveolar bone subsequently osteoblasts reach root surface crossing damaged periodontal ligament pdl allowing joining cementum number years adjacent bony socket remodel tooth replacing root bone leaving tooth root root replaced visible part tooth crown eventually give way replantation primary teeth uniformly cautioned primary teeth young patients whose facial development usually incomplete usually long enough roots successful due risks poor prognosis replanting primary tooth cautioned also due possible harms may pose future permanent delay minimise death tooth root cells avulsed tooth must stored suitable storage improper mediums cause damage cells tooth thereby decreasing chance successful replantations increasing potential risks considering potential suitable mediums factors fluid pressure osmolarity need taken account maintain normal cell metabolism extended periods time suitable storage mediums suit criteria include hanks balanced salt solution whole delayed replantation poor long term prognosis
