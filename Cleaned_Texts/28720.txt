article reviews evolution continuous noninvasive arterial pressure measurement cnap historical gap ease use intermittent upper arm instruments bulky continuous pulse writers sphygmographs discussed starting first efforts measure pulse published jules harrison sphygmographs led shadowy existence past riva roccis upper arm blood pressure measurement started triumphant success years ago recent times cnap measurement introduced jan penáz enabled first recording noninvasive beattobeat blood pressure resulting marketed products device successors recently novel method cnap monitoring designed patient monitoring perioperative critical emergency care blood pressure needs measured repeatedly even continuously facilitate best care patients prior quantitative measurement applied medicine century diagnostic possibilities hemodynamic activities limited qualitative sensing pulse palpation cultures sensitive palpation still main part medicine like pulse diagnosis traditional chinese

first instrument could measure force pulse mercury filled glass tube developed jules harrison jean léonard marie poiseuille invented first mercury hemodynameter forerunner sphygmomanometer first sphygmograph pulse writer continuous graphical registration pulse dates back karl von vierordt popular however improved sphygmograph french physiologist pioneer cinematography étiennejules marey famous book la méthode graphique studies photographic gun mareys work related cardiovascular movements heart besides mareys sphygmograph device developed austrian samuel von basch attracted attention introduced europe fluid filled bladder placed wrist able detect pulse pressure necessary disappearance pulses measured mercury manometer allowed first measurement systolic blood several sphygmographs developed late century especially great britain france instruments portable reasonably accurate widely available physicians even used bedside italian scipione rivarocci introduced first mercurysphygmomanometer placed upper enabled measurement absolute systolic blood pressure since finding characteristic sounds russian nikolai sergejev korotkoff upper arm method also allows registration absolute diastolic blood one year rivaroccis findings leonard erskine hill harold barnard reported blood pressure monitoring anesthesia first almost concurrently invented devices consisted narrow armlet occlude brachial artery small bicycletype metal pump metal manometer graduated seems surprising first report blood pressure monitoring anesthesia mention use sphygmographs already common use time one reason might former practice totally relied observation breathing sole method monitoring even palpation pulse ether chloroform administration recognized good practice another reason may found directly title report simple accurate form sphygmometer arterial pressure gauge contrived clinical use implying clinical use device must simple accuratecitation needed sphygmomanometer started triumphant advance pulse registration devices invented century plain plethysmographic devices like pulse oximeters course exception used blood pressure measurement measure blood volume changes volume changes easily transformed pressure elastic components arterial wall linear smooth muscles also consist nonelastic partscitation needed goal unload arterial wall order linearize phenomenon counter pressure high pressure inside artery blood volume kept constant applying corresponding pressure outside continuously changing outside pressure needed keep arterial blood volume constant directly corresponds arterial pressure instantaneous continuous measure arterial blood pressure basic principle socalled vascular unloading technique citation needed german physiologist richard wagner introduced mechanical system identification blood pressure arteria radialis using mechanical version vascular unloading technique counter pressure unloads arterial czech physiologist jan peňáz introduced vascular unloading technique finger means electropneumatic control loop control loop shown block diagram cuff placed finger suitable easily accessible region inside cuff blood volume finger arteries measured using infrared light source l light detecting photocell pc plethysmographic signal pg light signal compared constant electronic measure finger blood volume pg fed control unit proportionalintegraldifferential characteristics pid pidsignal added constant set point amplified fed electropneumatic transducer ept ept produces pressure cuff alters finger blood condition control loop described follows lightsignal pg shall become zero controlling alterable pressure cuff systole blood volume increases finger pidcontroller increases control point thus cuff pressure increased excess blood volume squeezed hand diastole blood volume finger decreased result pidcontroller decreases control point hence cuff pressure lowered overall blood volume remains constant blood volume thus pg held constant time pressure difference cuff pressure intraarterial pressure zero intraarterial pressure equal cuff pressure easily measured means manometer mcitation needed peňáz used single electronic control loop responsible fast tracking blood pressure changes well stability system however changes arterial diameter wall tension due vasoconstriction vasodilatation make longterm measurement single control loop almost impossible since true unloading arterial wall easily lost therefore groups improved peňáz principle vascular unloading innovative
