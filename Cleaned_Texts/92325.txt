fabry disease also known disease rare genetic disease affect many parts body including kidneys heart brain fabry disease one group conditions known lysosomal storage diseases genetic mutation causes fabry disease interferes function enzyme processes biomolecules known sphingolipids leading substances building walls blood vessels organs inherited xlinked manner fabry disease sometimes diagnosed using blood test measures activity affected enzyme called alphagalactosidase genetic testing also sometimes used particularly females treatment fabry disease varies depending organs affected condition underlying cause addressed replacing enzyme lacking first descriptions condition made simultaneously dermatologist johannes surgeon william symptoms typically first experienced early childhood difficult diagnose rarity fabry disease many clinicians sometimes leads misdiagnoses manifestations disease usually increase number severity individual fullbody localized pain extremities known acroparesthesia gastrointestinal gi tract common patients fabry disease pain increase time acroparesthesia believed related damage peripheral nerve fibers transmit pain gitract pain likely caused accumulation lipids small vasculature gi tract obstructs blood flow causes kidney complications common serious effects disease chronic kidney disease kidney failure may worsen throughout life presence protein urine causes foamy urine often first sign kidney involvement endstage kidney failure fabry disease typically occurs third decade life common cause death due diseasecitation needed fabry disease affect heart several ways accumulation sphingolipids within heart muscle cells causes abnormal thickening heart muscle hypertrophy hypertrophy cause heart muscle become abnormally stiff unable relax leading restrictive cardiomyopathy causing shortness fabry disease also affect way heart conducts electrical impulses leading abnormally slow heart rhythms complete heart block abnormally rapid heart rhythms ventricular tachycardia abnormal heart rhythms cause blackouts palpitations even sudden cardiac sphingolipids also build within heart valves thickening valves affecting way open close severe cause valves leak regurgitation restrict forward flow blood stenosis aortic mitral valves commonly affected valves right side angiokeratomas tiny painless papules appear region body predominant thighs around navel buttocks lower abdomen groin anhidrosis lack sweating common symptom less commonly hyperhidrosis excessive sweatingcitation needed additionally patients exhibit raynauds diseaselike symptoms neuropathy particular burning extremity paincitation needed ocular involvement may present showing cornea verticillata also known vortex keratopathy ie clouding corneas keratopathy may presenting feature asymptomatic patients must differentiated causes vortex keratopathy eg drug deposition clouding affect ocular findings include conjunctival retinal vascular abnormalities anteriorposterior spokelike cataract visual reduction manifestations uncommoncitation needed fatigue neuropathy particular burning extremity pain red hands feet cerebrovascular effects leading increased risk stroke early strokes mostly vertebrobasilar system tinnitus ringing ears vertigo nausea inability gain weight chemical imbalances diarrhea common symptomscitation needed fabry disease caused dna sequence gene functioning person inherits gene enough functioning enzyme known alphagalactosidase lack alphagalactosidase leads fabry disease deficiency alpha galactosidase agal encoded gla due mutation causes glycolipid known globotriaosylceramide abbreviated ceramide trihexoside accumulate within blood vessels tissues accumulation leads impairment proper functionscitation needed least diseasecausing mutations gla gene dna mutations cause disease xlinked recessive incomplete penetrance heterozygous females condition affects hemizygous males ie nonintersex males well homozygous many cases heterozygous females males typically experience severe symptoms women range asymptomatic severe symptoms research suggests many women experience severe symptoms ranging early cataracts strokes hypertrophic left ventricular heart problems kidney failure variability thought due xinactivation patterns embryonic development fabry disease inherited lysosomal storage disorder caused deficiency alphagalactosidase enzyme deficiency result accumulation glycosphingolipids found lysosomes cell types tissues leads considered multisystem disease indications include painful crisis angiokeratomas corneal dystrophy severe cases renal cerebrovascular cardiac involvement predominately responsible premature mortality fabry fabry disease xlinked manifests mostly homozygous males also heterozygous females cardiac involvement recurrent fabry patients patients developed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy arrhythmias conduction abnormalities valvular deficient activity lysosomal alphagalactosidase results progressive accumulation globotriaosylceramide within lysosomes believed trigger cascade cellular demonstration marked alphagalactosidase deficiency conclusive method diagnosis homozygous males may detected heterozygotous females often inconclusive due random xchromosomal inactivation molecular testing genotyping females fabry disease suspected based individuals clinical presentation diagnosed enzyme assay usually done leukocytes measure level alphagalactosidase activity enzyme assay reliable diagnosis disease females due random nature xinactivation molecular genetic analysis gla gene accurate method diagnosis females particularly mutations already identified male family members many diseasecausing mutations noted kidney biopsy may also suggestive fabry disease excessive lipid buildup noted pediatricians well internists commonly misdiagnose fabry immediate extended family members family family mutation one member family dna sequence analysis performed members family diagnosed performing targeted sequence analysis instead testing entire targeted sequencing quicker less expensive perform one study reported every first diagnosis family average five family members immediate extended also mri accurate accessing left ventricular mass thickness hypertrophy late gadolinium enhancement shows increased signal midwall inferolateral wall base left ventricle usually nonhypertrophic ventricle imaging show low signal due sphingolipid storage heart even without ventricular hypertrophy affected disease thus mri useful way diagnosing disease signal increased inflammation treatments available fabry disease divided therapies aim correct underlying problem decreased activity alpha galactosidase enzyme thereby reduce risk organ damage therapies improve symptoms life expectancy organ damage already occurredcitation needed pain associated fabry disease may partially alleviated enzyme replacement therapy patients pain management regimens may also include analgesics anticonvulsants nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs though latter usually best avoided kidney disease kidney failure seen fabry disease sometimes requires haemodialysis cardiac complications fabry disease include abnormal heart rhythms may require pacemaker implantable cardioverterdefibrillator restrictive cardiomyopathy often seen may require life expectancy fabry disease males years compared years general population females years compared years general population according registry data common cause death cardiovascular disease received kidney fabry disease panethnic due rarity determining accurate disease frequency reported incidences ranging one one general population may largely underestimate true newborn screening initiatives found unexpectedly high prevalence disease high one newborns italy identified surprisingly high frequency newborn males around one fabry disease first described dermatologist johannes surgeon william
