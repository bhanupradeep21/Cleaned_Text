silent mutations mutations dna observable effect organisms phenotype specific type neutral mutation phrase silent mutation often used interchangeably phrase synonymous mutation however synonymous mutations always silent vice synonymous mutations affect transcription splicing mrna transport translation could alter phenotype rendering synonymous mutation substrate specificity trna rare codon affect timing translation turn cotranslational folding reflected codon usage bias observed many species mutations cause altered codon produce amino acid similar functionality eg mutation producing leucine instead isoleucine often classified silent properties amino acid conserved mutation usually significantly affect protein genetic code translates mrna nucleotide sequences amino acid sequences genetic information coded using process groups three nucleotides along mrna commonly known set three nucleotides almost always produce amino acid exceptions like uga typically serves stop codon also encode tryptophan mammalian amino acids specified multiple codons demonstrating genetic code codons result amino codons code amino acid termed synonyms silent mutations base substitutions result change amino acid amino acid functionality altered messenger rna mrna translated example codon aaa altered become aag amino acid lysine incorporated peptide chain mutations often linked diseases negative impacts silent mutations extremely beneficial creating genetic diversity among species population germline mutations passed parent citations needed scientists predicted people approximately deadly mutations genomes essentially harmless usually one copy particular bad gene diseases silent mutations also produced insertions deletions cause shift reading silent mutations alter protein function often treated though evolutionarily neutral many organisms known exhibit codon usage biases suggesting selection use particular codons due need translational stability transfer rna trna availability one reasons silent mutations might silent conventionally different trna molecule codon example specific trna molecule codon ucu another specific codon ucc code amino acid serine instance thousand times less ucc trna ucu trna incorporation serine polypeptide chain would happen thousand times slowly mutation causes codon change ucu ucc amino acid transport ribosome delayed translation carried much slower rate result lower expression particular gene containing silent mutation mutation occurs within exon additionally ribosome wait long receive amino acid ribosome could terminate translation nonsynonymous mutation occurs genomic transcriptional levels one results alteration amino acid sequence protein product proteins primary structure refers amino acid sequence substitution one amino acid another impair protein function tertiary structure however effects may minimal tolerated depending closely properties amino acids involved swap premature insertion stop codon nonsense mutation alter primary structure case truncated protein produced protein function folding dependent position stop codon inserted amount composition sequence lost conversely silent mutations mutations amino acid sequence silent mutations lead change one letters triplet code represents codon despite single base change amino acid coded remains unchanged similar biochemical properties permitted degeneracy genetic code historically silent mutations thought little significance however recent research suggests alterations triplet code affect protein translation efficiency protein folding furthermore change primary structure critical fully folded tertiary structure protein dependent upon primary structure discovery made throughout series experiments discovered reduced denatured rnase unfolded form could refold native tertiary form tertiary structure protein fully folded polypeptide chain hydrophobic rgroups folded interior protein maximize entropy interactions secondary structures beta sheets alpha helixes since structure proteins determines function critical protein folded correctly tertiary form protein function properly however important note polypeptide chains may differ vastly primary structure similar tertiary structure protein silent mutations alter secondary structure mrna secondary structure proteins consists interactions atoms backbone polypeptide chain excluding rgroups one common type secondary structures alpha helix righthanded helix results hydrogen bonds nth amino acid residue amino acid residue common type secondary structure beta sheet displays righthanded twist parallel antiparallel depending direction direction bonded polypeptides consists hydrogen bonds carbonyl amino groups backbone two polypeptide mrna secondary structure necessarily linear like dna thus shape accompanies complementary bonding structure significant effects example mrna molecule relatively unstable rapidly degraded enzymes cytoplasm rna molecule highly stable complementary bonds strong resistant unpacking prior translation gene may expressed codon usage influences mrna furthermore since organisms contain slightly different genetic code mrna structures differ slightly well however multiple studies conducted show properly folded mrna structures dependent primary sequence polypeptide chain structure maintained dinucleotide relative abundances cell matrix also discovered mrna secondary structure important cell processes transcript stability translation general idea functional domains mrna fold upon start stop codon regions generally relaxed could aid signaling initiation termination oncoming ribosome pauses knot rna polypeptide could potentially enough time fold nonnative structure trna molecule add another amino acid silent mutations may also affect splicing transcriptional control silent mutations affect protein folding normally misfolded protein refolded help molecular chaperones rna typically produces two common misfolded proteins tending fold together become stuck different conformations difficulty singling favored specific tertiary structure competing structures rnabinding proteins assist rna folding problems however silent mutation occurs mrna chain chaperones bind properly molecule unable redirect mrna correct recent research suggests silent mutations effect subsequent protein structure timing

silent nucleotide change change amino acid although silent mutations supposed effect phenotypic outcome mutations prove otherwise like multidrug resistance gene codes pglycoprotein helps get rid drugs body located intestines liver pancreas brain mdr located places located enzyme helps get rid toxins drugs liver intestines silent mutations like mdr express change phenotypic response study done mice showed enough mdr gene body recognize ivermectin cyclosporine drug leading creation toxins fifty single nucleotide polymorphisms snps changes nucleotide base gene exon represents mutate changes transfer rna one often seen leading changes outcome translation example silent mutations always multidrug resistance genes exon exon exon studied snps occur time therefore making phenotypic function change suggests haplotype dependency exon exon polymorphisms example efavirenz nelfinavir two types drugs help decrease hiv infection persons body snp exon coupled snp exons drugs lower chance maintaining hiv infection although tt nucleotides exon expressed patient lower concentration virus genotype morphs cc ct infection able spread like normal leaving mdr gene almost defenseless changes bases exon mdr show correlation mdr gene mutations ability antiretroviral drugs suppress hiv exon also studied whether haplotype dependent presence snp exon changes phenotypic functions paired presence mutations exons acting alone affect phenotypic outcome strongly example exon haplotype dependency seen looking chemotherapy since mdr removes drugs cells inhibitors used block mrd ability remove drugs thus letting beneficial drugs like chemotherapy immunosuppressants aid body recovery efficiently different proteins help exile specific drugs cancer verapamil cyclosporine common inhibitors mdr unfortunately mutated mutation either exon exon three mutations occur time creating haplotype inhibitors less likely weaken function multiple silent mutated genes tend resistant looking molecular level reason exon mdr gene silent pace amino acids translated mrna secondary structures fold means different codons correspond different foldings mrna example exon changes atc att codons produce amino acid atc seen often mutation codon consequence amount time takes ribosome produce protein confirmation changed leads protein structure different usual shape protein leads different functions reasons behind silent mutation occurs messenger rna mrna codons also work exon splicing enhancers codons decide cut introns based codon reading mutated codons higher risk making mistake
