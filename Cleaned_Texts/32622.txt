bisphosphonates important class drugs originally commercialised mid late century used treatment osteoporosis bone disorders cause bone fragility diseases bone resorption excessive osteoporosis common postmenopausal women patients corticosteroid treatment biphosphonates proven valuable treatment also used successfully pagets disease myeloma bone metastases hypercalcemia bisphosphonates reduce breakdown bones inhibiting osteoclasts long history use today different types bisphosphonate drugs market around world bisphosphonates originally synthesized century used industry antiscaling anticorrosive properties late potential treat diseases related metabolism bones became evident first generation bisphosphonates included etidronic acid clodronic acid introduced first bisphosphonate drugs used successfully since developed intention make potent enhance distribution inside bone extend duration action made possible give zoledronate recent bisphosphonate drug placed market single annual dose intravenous original bisphosphonates first generation simple molecules small groups single atoms alkyl chains position rather weak inhibiting effect bone resorption inclusion amino group marked beginning second generation bisphosphonates higher potency first pamidronate similar analogues followed position nitrogen side chain key potent drug later became apparent nitrogen necessarily connected alkyl chain instead using heterocyclic group drugs developed placed market zoledronate notable one minodronic acid even potent placed market japan potency effective even picomolar development resulted placing market compounds equal potency arylalkyl substitutes pamidronate among recent bisphosphonates used clinically hydroxyl group position omitted ensure recent research area opened opportunity develop new bisphosphonate drug therapies bisphosphonates lipophilic character developed shown potential tumor suppressant operate slightly different mechanism inhibit key enzyme farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase fpps mevalonate pathway also geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase ggps enzyme also located mevalonate pathway affinity bone ggps since successfully inhibited novel bisphosphonate compound triazole group within methyl group may become useful therapies malignancies like multiple dendritic bisphosphonate introduced containing three bisphosphonate units shown potential bone specific delivery large therapeutic molecules taking advantage high affinity bisphosphonates bone minerals mechanism action bisphosphonates bps evolved new generations drugs developed function first generation bisphosphonates differs recent nitrogen containing bps apparently internalised endocytosis membranebound vesicle drug likely complex ions concern cells bone takes place selective uptake common function applies bisphosphonate drugs physicochemical interaction bone mineral prevent physical resorption bone osteoclasts especially relevant sites bone remodelling bisphosphonates intrinsic affinity calcium ions hydroxyapatite bone mineral endogenous pyrophosphates difference lies nonhydrolysable carbonphosphorus bond bisphosphonates prevents metabolism time ensure effective absorption gastrointestinal primary inhibiting action first generation bisphosphonates osteoclasts inducing apoptosis mechanism action apparently formation atp analogue metabolite bisphosphonates like etidronic acid clodronic acid atp analogue accumulates cytosol osteoclast cytotoxic primary mechanism action developed nitrogen containing bisphosphonates however cellular effects osteoclasts inhibition mevalonate pathway particular subsequent formation isoprenoid lipids inhibition takes place key branch point pathway catalyzed farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase isoprenoid lipids necessary posttranslational modifications small gtpbinding regulatory proteins like rac rho ras ras superfamily function osteoclasts depends variety cellular processes like bisphosphonates mimic endogenous inorganic pyrophosphate oxygen backbone replaced carbon pcp pop two additional groups side chains carbon backbone usually referred usually hydroxyl group enhances affinity calcium forming tridentate ligand along phosphate groups compound made potent optimizing structure group best inhibit bone phosphonate groups chemical structure important binding drug target enzyme studies showed removal replacement phosphonate group carboxylic acid causes drastic loss potency drug enzyme inhibitor longer goes isomerized modification side chain bisphosphonates minor today single hydroxyl group position seems give best results terms activity hydroxyl group plays role forming waterinduced bond glutamine target enzyme drugs hydroxyl group initially cause better inhibition parent compounds without hydroxyl group drug seems fit easily open active site absence hydroxyl group however reduces ability hold target enzyme complex isomerized state biological activity bisphosphonates hydroxyl group therefore appears longer nitrogen containing bisphosphonates current used drugs class studies showed nitrogen bisphosphonates forms hydrogen bond threonine carbonyl part lysine target enzyme therefore enhancing binding complex altering position nitrogen significantly change ability nitrogen hydrogen bond increased carbon length nitrogen side chain alters activity side chain made three carbons proven ideal length terms activity increasing decreasing length chain negative effect biological activity alendronate common bisphosphonate drug three carbon length side chain risedronate heterocyclic structure containing nitrogen heterocyclic nitrogen containing bisphosphonates revealed better results terms activity compared earlier bisphosphonates nitrogen bound carbon chain studies risedronate analogous different placement nitrogen ring shown measurable difference biological activity increased length carbon chain connected ring revealed negative zoledronate potent bisphosphonate drug today available intravenous injection bisphosphonate drug two nitrogen groups side chain hence potency route administration differs drugs
