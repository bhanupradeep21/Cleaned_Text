anencephaly studies shown addition folic acid diet women childbearing age may significantly reduce although eliminate incidence neural tube defects therefore recommended women childbearing age consume

ciliopathies underlying cause may dysfunctional molecular mechanism primary cilia structures cell organelles present many cellular types throughout human body cilia defects adversely affect numerous critical developmental signaling pathways essential cellular development thus offer plausible hypothesis often multisymptom nature large set syndromes diseases known ciliopathies include primary

serum vitamin high serum homocysteine levels obesity independently contributed risk increasing dietary folate intake protective research suggested overall female babies likely affected one issue concerning anencephalic newborns organ donation initial legal guidance came case baby theresa boundaries organ donation tested first infant organs scarce high demand pediatric organ transplants poses major public health issue found american children age two waiting transplant die organ becomes within medical community main ethical issues organ donation misdiagnosis anencephaly slippery slope argument anencephalic neonates would rarely source organs would undermine confidence organ slippery slope concerns major issue personhood debates across board regards anencephaly oppose organ donation argue could open door involuntary organ donors elderly person severe dementia another point contention number children would actually benefit discrepancies statistics however known anencephalic children proposals made bypass legal ethical issues surrounding organ donation include waiting death occur procuring organs expanding definition death creating special legal category anencephalic infants defining united kingdom child born anencephaly reported countrys youngest organ donor teddy houlston diagnosed anencephalic weeks gestation parents jess evans mike houlston decided abortion

florida law prohibited infants organs removed still alive time died nine days birth organs deteriorated past point uniform determination death act udda model bill adopted many us states stating
