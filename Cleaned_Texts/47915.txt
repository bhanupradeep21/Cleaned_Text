lafora disease rare adultonset autosomal genetic disorder results myoclonus epilepsy usually results death several years onset symptoms disease characterized accumulation inclusion bodies known lafora bodies within cytoplasm cells heart liver muscle lafora disease also neurodegenerative disease causes impairment development brain cerebral cortical neurons glycogen metabolism lafora disease ld described spanish neuropathologist gonzalo rodríguez lafora directing neuropathology section government hospital mental insane current nih lafora rare disease meaning rare children adolescents adults worldwide however lafora disease higher incidence among children adolescents ancestry regions consanguineous relationships common namely mediterranean north africa southern europe middle east india dogs also condition dogs lafora disease spontaneously occur breed miniature wirehaired dachshund bassett hound beagle predisposed human patients disease live past age twentyfive often leads death within ten years symptoms appearing late onset symptoms disease begin age depending genes present cure disease ways deal symptoms treatments medications symptoms lafora disease begin develop early adolescent years symptoms progress time passes prior generally indication presence disease though cases disease presents learning disorder around five years extremely rare cases symptoms may show late third decade life though cases slower progression typical common feature lafora disease seizures reported mainly occipital seizures myoclonic seizures cases generalized tonicclonic seizures atypical absence seizures atonic complex partial symptoms common seizures drop attacks ataxia temporary blindness visual hallucinations quicklydeveloping dramatic common signs symptoms associated lafora disease behavioral changes due frequency time affected lafora disease brain changes cause confusion speech difficulties depression decline intellectual function impaired judgement impaired areas cerebellum affected seizures common see problems speech coordination balance lafora dogs affected lafora disease common symptoms rapid shuddering shaking jerking canines head backwards high pitched vocalizations could indicate dog panicking seizures disease progresses dementia blindness loss within ten years developing symptoms life expectancy declines people advance adulthood tend lose ability daily tasks require comprehensive care symptoms progress extremely quickly early age patients receive comprehensive care besides medication means support daily activities physically mentally lafora disease autosomal recessive disorder caused loss function mutations either laforin glycogen phosphatase gene malin ubiquitin ligase gene mutations either two genes lead polyglucosan formation lafora body formation cytoplasm heart liver muscle graph shows data families affected lafora disease distribution cases around world graph shows large number cases italy higher occurrence gene mutation compared country graph shows percentage distribution cases either gene mutation gene mutation cases caused caused common mutation gene mutation genetic mutation cause lafora disease codes protein laforin dualspecificity phosphatase acts carbohydrates taking phosphates encodes protein malin ubiquitin ligase regulates amount laforin essential making normal structure glycogen molecule mutation occurs gene laforin protein downregulated less protein present none made also mutation gene makes protein malin laforin regulated thus less made less laforin means phosphorylation glycogen causing conformational changes rendering insoluble leading accumulation misformed glycogen neurotoxic effects laforin mutation glycogen would hyperphosphorylated confirmed laforin knockout research literature also suggests overactivity glycogen synthase key enzyme synthesizing glycogen lead formation polyglucosans inactivated phosphorylation various amino acid residues many molecules including protein phosphatase defective enzyme molecules participate production molecules malin excessive glycogen synthase activity occurs combination mutations laforin phosphorylates excess glycogen made rendering insoluble key player missing ubiquitin able degrade excess amount insoluble lafora bodies since mutations arise malin ubiquitin ligase directly interferes degradation laforin causing laforin degraded case laforin lafora disease distinguished presence inclusions called lafora bodies within cytoplasm cells lafora bodies aggregates polyglucosans abnormally shaped glycogen glycogen lafora disease patients abnormal chain lengths causes insoluble accumulate neurotoxic glycogen soluble must short chains high frequency branching points found glycogen lafora patients ld patients longer chains clustered arrangement branch points form crystalline areas double helices making harder clear bloodbrain glycogen ld patients also higher phosphate levels present greater lafora disease diagnosed conducting series tests neurologist epileptologist person specializes epilepsy geneticist confirm diagnosis eeg mri genetic testing biopsy may necessary well detect confirm presence lafora bodies reports published lafora disease shown overall prevalence disease cases per million individuals around world lafora disease much prevalent countries higher cases inbreeding usually locations geographically culturally isolated world cure lafora disease treatment limited controlling seizures antiepileptic anticonvulsant treatment usually based individuals specific symptoms severity symptoms examples medications include valproate levetiracetam topiramate benzodiazepines although symptoms seizures controlled long period using antiepileptic drugs symptoms progress patients lose ability perform daily activities leading survival rate approximately years symptoms quality life worsens years go patients requiring feeding tube get nutrition medication need order keep living necessarily recently metformin approved treatment disease named gonzalo rodríguez lafora spanish neuropathologist first recognized small inclusion bodies lafora patients early mid recent research investigated whether inhibition glycogen synthesis restriction glucose intake could potentially stop formation lafora bodies neurons laforindeficient mice models also reducing chances source needed researchers us canada europe formed lafora epilepsy cure initiative funding national institutes health group aims interrupt process mutations laforin malin interfere normal carbohydrate metabolism mice models
