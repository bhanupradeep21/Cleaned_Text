drugs known uk controlled drug term act refers general terms however many drugs also controlled medicines act many drugs controlled medicines act misuse drugs act drugs alcohol example controlled laws misuse drugs act sets three separate categories class class b class c class drugs represent deemed dangerous carry harshest punishments class c represents thought least capacity harm act demands lenient punishment reality potential harm little bearing led dissatisfaction drug found possession drug list dealt less seriously would deemed intent supply even without payment drug others possession intent supply carries maximum penalty life imprisonment regard lawful possession supply different set categories apply set misuse drugs regulations amended sets five schedules restrictions schedule contains substances considered government medicinal value hallucinogens use limited primarily research whereas schedules contain regulated drugs means although drugs may fall category class abc may also fall one schedules legitimate medicinal use example morphine class drug misuse drugs act lawfully supplied falls category schedule controlled drug substances may removed added different parts schedule statutory instrument provided report advisory council misuse drugs commissioned reached conclusion although secretary state bound councils findings list practice modified great number times sometimes removing substances commonly adding example many benzodiazepines became class c drugs many cathinones became class b drugs anabolic steroids hormones build muscle tissue benzodiazepines
