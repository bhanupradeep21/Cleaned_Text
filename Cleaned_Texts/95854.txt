hcg secreted blastocyst implantation factor measured pregnancy test hcg measured blood urine determine whether woman pregnant hcg secreted multiple pregnancy blood tests hcg also used check abnormal pregnancies vitro fertilization ivf alternative traditional vivo fertilization fertilizing egg sperm implanting embryo females womb many years embryo inserted uterus two three days fertilization however stage development difficult predict embryos develop best several embryos typically implanted several implanted embryos increased likelihood developing fetus also led development multiple fetuses major problem drawback using embryos ivf use blastocysts human ivf proved successful blastocyst implanted five six days eggs five six days much easier determine embryos result healthy live births knowing embryos succeed allows one blastocyst implanted cutting dramatically health risk expense multiple births nutrient requirements embryonic blastocyst development determined much easier
