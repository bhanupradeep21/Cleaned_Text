winner loser effect aggression phenomenon winner effect increased probability animal win future aggressive interactions experiencing previous wins loser effect increased probability animal lose future aggressive interactions experiencing previous overall effects either increase decrease animals aggressive behaviour depending effect affects species animals agkistrodon contortrix rivulus marmoratus sula nebouxii show either one outcomes winner loser effects help develop structure hierarchies nature used support game theory model theory underlying causation winner loser effect deals animals perception members resource holding essentially animal perceives high resource holding potential considers dominant member intraspecific animal perceives low resource holding potential considers less dominant perception resource holding potential enhanced disrupted aggressive challenges animal wins encounter perception resource holding potential increases animal loses perception resource holding potential animals regardless size higher perception resource holding potential likely initiate aggressive behaviour maintain dominance within community overall larger difference perception two fighting animals resource holding potential higher chance animal higher resource holding potential winning based theory animal assumes high resource holding individual likely dominantaggressive member animal assumes self low resource holding individual likely submissivenonaggressive member reason animal accept dominant submissive position hierarchy game theory model based hawk dove game hawk aggressive individual dove submissive individual beneficial depending fitness associated trait game theory discusses frequencydependent model traits aggressive vs submissive exist frequency meets evolutionary stable strategy animals winner loser effects shown cause hormonal differences blood hormones like corticosterone found higher animals experiencing loser effects experiencing winner corticosterone stress hormone likely raised due implications loss animals experiencing loser effect researchers even suggest increased level corticosterone caused loser effect inhibits regions brain involved learning memory formal literature supported hypothesis winner loser effects directly cause example increase corticosterone following loss seen copperhead testosterone another compound whose concentration within body affected winner loser research conducted using humans show completing competitive task another team winning teams testosterone goes losing teams testosterone goes also showed group setting team member topscoring player work received highest boost winner loser effects driven organisms previous experiences typically aggressive recent fighting experience greatest effect organism testing done rivulus marmoratus showed individuals lost recent encounters lw higher probability winning next encounter fish lost last encounter one literature also showed encounters happened two times aggressive event affect strength winner loser shown species last fight lost one lw higher probability winning next fight fish lost last encounter interaction winner loser effects also attributed formation study done xiphophorus helleri also known green swordtail shown individuals likely assume alpha higher ranked positions hierarchy individuals lost likely assume omega lower ranked positions neutral individuals little experience aggression interactions fall intermediate position winners losers forming winnerneutralloser wnl hierarchies also affected strength winner loser effects acting upon winner effects alone typically produce linear hierarchies organism wins encounters organism b wins encounters except organism organism c loses encounters except organism organism loses linear relationship typically shown b c loser effects unlike winner effects show linear relationship animals experiencing loser effects fight makes difficult assign position copperhead snakes rely aggressive behaviours fight prospective since aggressive behaviours species selected reproduction winner loser effects could effect aggressive behaviours therefore animals reproductive success male copperhead snakes aggressive interaction months put situation fight female likely win encounter basis body size larger copperhead snakes tested see winner effects affect ability win encounter found winner attributed winners always accept challenges males even larger found excitable indicated previous experience winners increase ability reproduce likely lose fight snake larger size challenges copperhead snakes also tested see loser effects present done first placing two neutral snakes size arena placing onetime loser snake neutral snake results could compared found loser effects present snakes lost previous encounters likely lose losing effect copperhead snake strong even encounters loser snake larger would always lose one previous bluefooted boobies show frequencydependent dominantsubmissive behavioural birds nestlings develop one following strategies either dominant submissive first born chicks showed aggression early towards siblings likely became dominant member chick nonaggressive early likely adopted submissive winner loser effects seen species due behavioural strategy winner effects shown established dominant chicks placed nonexperienced chicks study dominant chicks seen likely win aggressive encounter nonexperienced chick even nonexperienced chick larger dominant chick attributed established dominant chicks times aggressive nonexperienced chicks due previous loser effects shown established submissive chicks placed nonexperienced chicks study submissive chicks seen less likely win aggressive encounter nonexperienced chick even nonexperienced chick smaller submissive chick attributed established submissive chicks times less aggressive nonexperienced chicks due previous experiment performed drummond done days showed length study winner effects less powerful time strength loser effects remained studies also found evidence winner effect humans typically using sport competitions study looking tennis matches found close win loss set substantial effect chance win next study focused situations players end winning losing first set small margin two points end tiebreak lasting points finds winner first set chances winning second set compared loser first set effect observed male players another study found players winning tennis experience increase testosterone level losers experience famous hothand effect basketball also found exist players successful scoring match increase likelihood shoot successfully later humans disturb oldgrowth forests creating forest edges removal trees provide less shading allow species prefer shaded environment may adapted survive increased due increased sunlight possible sunlightadapted species thrive area compete shaded event shaded plants losers sunlightadapted plants significantly plants losers rate speciation increases winners far outpaced extinction projected effects plant loss biodiversity loss significant trophic level httpsenwikipediaorgwikiwinnerandlosereffects
