lymphocyte type white blood cell leukocyte immune system lymphocytes include cells cellmediated cytotoxic adaptive immunity b cells humoral antibodydriven adaptive innate lymphoid cells ilcs innate celllike cells involved mucosal immunity homeostasis natural killer cells important subtype functions cellmediated cytotoxic innate immunity main type cell found lymph prompted name lymphocyte cyte meaning lymphocytes make circulating white blood three major types lymphocyte cells b cells natural killer nk lymphocytes identified large nucleus cells thymus cells b cells bone marrow bursaderived cellsa major cellular components adaptive immune response cells involved cellmediated immunity whereas b cells primarily responsible humoral immunity relating antibodies function cells b cells recognize specific nonself antigens process known antigen presentation identified invader cells generate specific responses tailored maximally eliminate specific pathogens pathogeninfected cells b cells respond pathogens producing large quantities antibodies neutralize foreign objects like bacteria viruses response pathogens cells called helper cells produce cytokines direct immune response cells called cytotoxic cells produce toxic granules contain powerful enzymes induce death pathogeninfected cells following activation b cells cells leave lasting legacy antigens encountered form memory cells throughout lifetime animal memory cells remember specific pathogen encountered able mount strong rapid response pathogen detected known acquired immunity nk cells part innate immune system play major role defending host tumors virally infected nk cells modulate functions cells including macrophages distinguish infected cells tumors normal uninfected cells recognizing changes surface molecule called mhc major histocompatibility complex class nk cells activated response family cytokines called interferons activated nk cells release cytotoxic cellkilling granules destroy altered named natural killer cells require prior activation order kill cells missing mhc class x lymphocyte reported cell type expressing bcell receptor tcell receptor hypothesized implicated type existence cell type challenged two however authors original article pointed fact two studies detected x cells imaging microscopy facs additional studies required determine nature properties x cells also called dual expressers mammalian stem cells differentiate several kinds blood cell within bone process called lymphocytes originate process common lymphoid progenitor differentiating distinct lymphocyte types differentiation lymphocytes follows various pathways hierarchical fashion well plastic fashion formation lymphocytes known lymphopoiesis mammals b cells mature bone marrow core birds b cells mature bursa fabricius lymphoid organ first discovered chang b bursa bone marrow commonly believed cells migrate blood stream mature distinct primary organ called thymus following maturation lymphocytes enter circulation peripheral lymphoid organs eg spleen lymph nodes survey invading pathogens andor tumor cells lymphocytes involved adaptive immunity ie b cells differentiate exposure

helper cells memory cells remain peripheral tissues circulation extended time ready respond antigen upon future exposure live weeks several years long compared leukocytescitation needed microscopically wrights stained peripheral blood smear normal lymphocyte large darkstaining nucleus little eosinophilic cytoplasm normal situations coarse dense nucleus lymphocyte approximately size red blood cell μm lymphocytes show clear perinuclear zone halo around nucleus could exhibit small clear zone one side nucleus polyribosomes prominent feature lymphocytes viewed electron microscope ribosomes involved protein synthesis allowing generation large quantities cytokines immunoglobulins cells impossible distinguish cells b cells peripheral blood normally flow cytometry testing used specific lymphocyte population counts used determine percentage lymphocytes contain particular combination specific cell surface proteins immunoglobulins cluster differentiation cd markers produce particular proteins example cytokines using intracellular cytokine staining iccs order study function lymphocyte virtue proteins generates scientific techniques like elispot secretion assay techniques circulatory system move lymph node lymph contrasts macrophages rather stationary nodes lymphocyte count usually part peripheral complete blood cell count expressed percentage lymphocytes total number white blood cells counted general increase number lymphocytes known whereas decrease known lymphocytopenia increase lymphocyte concentration usually sign viral infection rare case leukemias found abnormally raised lymphocyte count otherwise normal high lymphocyte count low neutrophil count might caused lymphoma pertussis toxin ptx bordetella pertussis formerly known lymphocytosispromoting factor causes decrease entry lymphocytes lymph nodes lead condition known lymphocytosis complete lymphocyte count per μl adults per μl children unique many bacterial infections illustrate neutrophilpredominance instead lymphoproliferative disorders lpd encompass diverse group diseases marked uncontrolled lymphocyte production leading issues like lymphocytosis lymphadenopathy bone marrow infiltration disorders common immunocompromised individuals involve abnormal proliferation b cells often resulting immunodeficiency immune system dysfunction various gene mutations iatrogenic acquired implicated lpd one subtype xlinked lpd linked mutations x chromosome predisposing individuals natural killer cell lpd tcell lpd additionally conditions like common variable immunodeficiency cvid severe combined immunodeficiency scid certain viral infections elevate risk lpd treatment methods immunosuppressive drugs tissue transplantation also increase susceptibility lpds encompass wide array disorders involving bcell eg chronic lymphocytic leukemia tcell eg sezary syndrome abnormalities presenting distinct challenges diagnosis low normal low absolute lymphocyte concentration associated increased rates infection surgery one basis low cell lymphocytes occurs human immunodeficiency virus hiv infects destroys cells specifically subgroup lymphocytes become helper without key defense cells provide body becomes susceptible opportunistic infections otherwise would affect healthy people extent hiv progression typically determined measuring percentage cells patients blood hiv ultimately progresses acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids effects viruses lymphocyte disorders also often estimated counting numbers lymphocytes present blood cancers melanoma colorectal cancer
