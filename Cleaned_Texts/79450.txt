target minor crimes vandalism loitering public drinking jaywalking fare evasion help create atmosphere order lawfulness theory introduced article social scientists james q wilson george l popularized new york city police commissioner william bratton mayor rudy giuliani whose policing policies influenced theory theory became subject debate within social sciences public sphere broken windows policing enforced controversial police practices high use stopandfrisk new york city decade james q wilson george l kelling first introduced broken windows theory article titled broken windows march issue atlantic monthly social psychologists police officers tend agree window building broken left unrepaired rest windows soon broken true nice neighborhoods rundown ones windowbreaking necessarily occur large scale areas inhabited determined windowbreakers whereas others populated windowlovers rather one unrepaired broken window signal one cares breaking windows costs nothing always article received great deal attention widely cited criminology urban sociology book fixing broken windows restoring order reducing crime communities george l kelling catharine coles based article develops argument greater detail discusses theory relation crime strategies contain eliminate crime urban successful strategy preventing vandalism according books authors address problems small repair broken windows within short time say day week tendency vandals much less likely break windows damage clean sidewalk every day tendency litter accumulate rate littering much less problems less likely escalate thus respectable residents flee neighborhood oscar newman introduced defensible space theory book defensible space argued although police work crucial crime prevention police authority enough maintain

area broken windows vandalism still prevalent communities simply care damage regardless many times windows repaired community still must invest time keep safe residents negligence broken windowtype decay signifies lack concern community newman says clear sign society accepted unrepaired windows display vulnerability lack malcolm gladwell also relates theory reality new york city book tipping thus theory makes major claims improving quality neighborhood environment reduces petty crime antisocial behavior lowlevel disorder major crime also prevented result criticism theory tended focus latter reason state urban environment may affect crime consists three factors social norms conformity presence lack routine monitoring social signaling signal crime anonymous urban environment people
