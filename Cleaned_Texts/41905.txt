nature connectedness extent individuals include nature part includes understanding nature everything made even parts characteristics nature connectedness similar personality trait nature connectedness stable time across various describes three components make nature connectedness construct three components make nature connectedness required healthy relationship nature individual feels connected nature possibly spending time may inclined care nature protect recent research found nature exposure feeling connected nature trait level provides many benefits humans researchers describe nature connectedness construct simpler manner instance nature connectedness thought love nature also referred emotional affinity toward similarly nature connectedness defined much person believes nature specifically persons connectivity thought simply feeling emotionally connected nature connectedness construct also known nature relatedness connectivity nature emotional affinity toward nature inclusion nature self although nature relatedness stable individual trait change based ones experience meaning time individual spends nature connected feel nature concern may feel feeling connected nature state level many benefits well positive moods less negative even though humans derive many benefits nature modern lifestyles created disconnect natural environment wherein spend significantly time indoors researchers estimate humans spend lives particularly developed countries countries high rate urbanization level connection nature significantly disconnection nature negative impact humans missing beneficial effects nature result less connected nature feel less responsibility protect relationship natural environment understood concept biophilia biophilia hypothesis term defined humans innate need affiliate life plants essentially means humans desire near nature built desire may result spending majority evolutionary history closely connected biophilia genetic meaning humans closely connected nature throughout history would presumably better access food fresh water example someone lived close water near vegetation pet protector eg dog would survival advantages although evolutionary theory difficult test popularity camping hiking visiting provide support theory book kellert proposed biophilia close nature also provides us benefits increase thus disconnected natural environment negative effects humans wellbeing construct nature connectedness also related branch psychology called ecopsychology branch seeks examine human wellbeing related wellbeing natural theory
