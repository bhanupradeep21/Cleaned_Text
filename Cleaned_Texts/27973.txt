giardia duodenalis also known giardia intestinalis giardia lamblia flagellated parasitic protozoan microorganism genus giardia colonizes small intestine causing diarrheal condition known parasite attaches intestinal epithelium adhesive disc sucker reproduces via binary giardiasis spread parts gastrointestinal tract remains confined lumen small microorganism outer membrane makes possible survive even outside host render tolerant certain disinfectants giardia trophozoites anaerobic absorb nutrients intestinal lumen organism stained characteristic pattern resembles familiar smiley face chief pathways human infection include ingestion untreated drinking water common method transmission food soil contaminated human feces sewage phenomenon particularly common many developing contamination natural waters also occurs watersheds intensive grazing occurs giardia infections occur worldwide commonly identified intestinal parasite among children daycare centers hikers immunocompromised adults family members united states canada cases per year united states g duodenalis takes two morphologically distinct forms lifecycle replicative form motile pearshaped flagellated cell survives small intestine host called trophozoites swim intestinal mucus eventually adhere intestinal adhered trophozoites divide binary fission forming either trophozoites nonreplicative cyst cysts trophozoites pass hosts large intestine shed trophozoites survive outside host cysts survive months outside cold slower metabolic rate cysts remain dormant ingested host animal new potential host ingests water food contaminated feces cysts gain entry gastrointestinal tract new new host environmental conditions trigger cyst produce two trophozoites attach epithelial cells starting cycle trophozoite elaborate structure two nuclei eight pairs flagella allow swim within intestinal lumen host also adhesive disk ventral surface enables adhere intestinal epithelium organism lacks golgi mitochondria mitosomes probably evolved mitosomes lack mitochondrial genomes contain proteins former mitochondrial genes migrated cell nucleus trophozoite changes cyst form comes contact certain environmental stressors high ph cyst form primarily contains nucleus lacks structures trophozoite form flagella adhesive disks allows cyst remain dormant ingested new host point transforms back trophozoite g duodenalis causes infection called giardiasis disease infects around million people worldwide year resulting deaths affected demographic children years age globally g duodenalis commonly identified protozoal intestinal parasite highincome countries infection rate low middleincome countries infection rate cyst survive weeks months cold water present contaminated wells water systems especially stagnant water sources naturally occurring ponds stormwater storage systems even cleanlooking mountain streams cysts also found surfaces soil food water contaminated feces infected humans may also occur city reservoirs persist water treatment cysts resistant conventional watertreatment methods chlorination zoonotic transmission also possible giardia infection concern people camping wilderness swimming contaminated streams lakes especially artificial lakes formed beaver dams hence popular name giardiasis beaver fevercitation needed addition waterborne sources transmission also occur example daycare centers children may poor hygiene practices work children also risk infected family members infected individuals giardia infections symptomatic many people unknowingly serve carriers parasitecitation needed giardia infects humans also one common parasites infecting cats dogs birds mammalian hosts also include dozens including cattle cats cured easily lambs usually simply lose weight calves parasites fatal often responsive antibiotics electrolytes carriers among calves also asymptomatic parasite deadly chinchillas extra care must taken providing safe water dogs high infection rate population one year old known infected kennels infection prevalent puppies adult dogs infected dogs isolated treated entire pack kennel presumptively treated together kennels areas used

actively transcribe adjacent nucleus g duodenalis cells endoplasmic reticulum extends much trophozoites differentiate cysts also contain prominent vesicles termed encystationspecific vesicles disappear cyst wall construction unlike eukaryotes g duodenalis cells contain visible mitochondria instead contains substantially reduced metabolic organelle termed additionally cells appear contain golgi bodies instead secretory system consists entirely endoplasmic reticulum numerous vesicles dispersed throughout cell termed peripheral peripheral vesicles responsible taking extracellular nutrients expelling waste outside cell also contains pair rigid structures called median bodies make part g lamblia trophozoites adhere host epithelial cells via specialized diskshaped organelle called ventral cysts ovalshaped cells slightly smaller lack flagella covered smooth clear cyst cyst contains organelles two trophzoites four nuclei two ventral disks g duodenalis primarily generates energy breaking glucose via glycolysis well arginine deiminase pathway unable synthesize nucleotides instead salvaging host synthesis clusters done doublemembranebound compartment called mitosome

sexual reproduction widespread among extant eukaryotes recently sex seemed unlikely primordial fundamental feature eukaryotes probable reason view sex may fundamental eukaryotes sexual reproduction previously appeared lacking certain human pathogenic singlecelled eukaryotes eg giardia diverged early ancestors eukaryotic lineagecitation needed addition evidence cited recombination giardia malik et reported many meiosis specific genes occur giardia genome homologs genes also occur another unicellular eukaryote trichomonas vaginalis two species descendants lineages highly divergent among eukaryotes malik et suggested meiotic genes present common ancestor eukaryotes thus view earliest ancestor eukaryotes likely capable sexual reproduction furthermore dacks proposed based phylogenetic
