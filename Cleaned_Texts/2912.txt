turnersuchus extinct genus thalattosuchian group marine crocodylomorphs pliensbachian united kingdom oldest diagnostic member thalattosuchia also found groups basal member situated outside two major

analysis conducted determine position turnersuchus within thalattosuchia one based dataset wilberg et al another modified herrera et al datasets result turnersuchus recovered basalmost member thalattosuchia supported four five synapomorphies respectively inclusion turnersuchus within thalattosuchia thus well supported exclusion either teleosauroids metriorhynchoids less single synapomorphy

major gaps understanding thalattosuchia previously little known origin diversification relationship groups due lack basal members transitional forms linking crocodylomorpha whole phylogenetic analysis often yield contradictory results primarily nesting three different positions sister crocodyliformes also recovered turnersuchus using wilberg dataset derived mesoeucrocodylians similar position herrera dataset derived neosuchians allied pholidosaurids dyrosaurids understanding dispersal also heavily affected lacking fossil record early thalattosuchians prior turnersuchus oldest known thalattosuchians toarcian age point group already split two main branches rich species found across several turnersuchus recovered basalmost thalattosuchian several similarities recognized basal members teleosauroidea metriorhynchoidea namely plagiophthalmosuchus pelagosaurus helps solidify traits ancestral plesiomorphic traits group whole ancestral traits include presence large supratemporal fenestrae unflattened skull table temporal bars ornamented surface squamosal facet fused pterygoids prootic broadly exposed along side braincase quadrate particular shows several ancestral traits three taxa makes front top lower margin external otic aperture excluding squamosal bone contributing margins furthermore overlapped broad process otoccipital bone quadrate however also serves differentiate turnersuchus derived thalattosuchians less integrated braincase significance due general evolutionary trend crocodylomorphs progressively developing quadrates articulate bones braincase trend observed throughout paraphyletic sphenosuchians later continued crocodyliforms thalattosuchians show intermediate condition two turnersuchus displaying quadrate clearly less well integrated crocodyliforms even derived thalattosuchians development basioccipital tubera may ancestral trait turnersuchus displays tubera generally thought associated development elongated jaws longirostrine condition unique thalattosuchians however consistently found members clade due longirostrine skulls exceptions shortskulled dakosaurus andiniensis turnersuchus although turnersuchus slender jaws poorly developed tubera indicate elongated later forms thalattosuchians ancestrally addition helping uncover ancestral morphology thalattosuchia turnersuchus aids filling ghost lineage leading groups explosive radiation late early jurassic pushes known record thalattosuchians toarcian back pliensbachian shortening period time groups first estimated appearance first confirmed fossils however precise divergence remains uncertain bayesian analysis based two phylogenetic analysis yield vastly different results following interpretation thalattosuchians early diverging mesoeucrocodylians herrera dataset remaining ghost lineage would relatively short extending sinemurian stage early jurassic however indeed sister group crocodyliforms indicated wilberg dataset origin thalattosuchia would pushed back norian million years earlier indicated analysis maximum ranges highest posterior density analysis would suggest group could originated late triassic either norian rhaetian broadly
