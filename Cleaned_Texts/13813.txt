animal communication transfer information one group animals sender senders one animals receiver receivers affects current future behavior information may sent intentionally courtship display unintentionally transfer scent predator prey kairomones information may transferred audience several animal communication rapidly growing area study disciplines including animal behavior sociology neurology animal cognition many aspects animal behavior symbolic name use emotional expression learning sexual behavior understood new ways information sender changes behavior receiver information referred signal signalling theory predicts signal maintained population sender receiver usually receive benefit interaction signal production senders perception subsequent response receivers thought signals often involve multiple mechanisms eg visual auditory signal understood coordinated behaviour sender receiver require careful study sounds animals make important communicate animals animals species taught simple versions human animals use example electrolocation echolocation communicate prey many different types signals animals use differentiate position direction location distance practitioners study issues animal position geometric viewings environmental social influences indicators geometric animals rely signals called electrolocating echolocating use sensory senses order navigate find signals used form commutation environment active signals types signals influence receivers behavior signals move quicker distance reach many animals communicate vocalization vocal communication serves many purposes including mating rituals warning calls conveying location food sources social learning number species males perform calls mating rituals form competition males signal females examples include frogs hammerheaded bats red deer humpback whales elephant seals instances vocal communication include alarm calls campbell territorial calls gibbons use frequency greater spearnosed bats distinguish vervet monkey gives distinct alarm call four different predators reactions monkeys vary appropriately according call example alarm call signals python monkeys climb trees whereas eagle alarm causes monkeys seek hiding place prairie dogs also use complex calls signal predator differences according con slobodchikoff others prairie dog calls communicate type size speed approaching whale vocalizations found different dialects based social mammalian acoustic culture first discovered southern resident orcas animals use vocalization means auditory communication many arthropods rub specialized body parts together produce sound known stridulation crickets grasshoppers well known many others use stridulation well including crustaceans spiders scorpions wasps ants beetles butterflies moths millipedes centipedes another means auditory communication vibration swim bladders bony fish structure swim bladders attached sonic muscles varies greatly across bony fish families resulting wide variety striking body parts together also produce auditory signals wellknown example tail tip vibration rattlesnakes warning signal examples include bill clacking birds wing clapping manakin courtship displays chest beating burrowing animals species known whistle communicate threats sometimes mood species marmot species including groundhog woodchuck alpine marmot

serves many functions crucial one detection food function first arose singlecelled organisms bacteria living oceans early days life function evolved organisms began differentiate chemicals compounds emanating resources conspecifics species ie mates kin heterospecifics different species ie competitors instance small minnow species may well avoid habitat detectable concentration chemical cue associated predator species northern minnows ability perceive presence predators close enough seen respond adaptive behavior hiding likely survive atlantic salmon go step detecting predators cue individual damaged predator releases chemical cue also observed species acidification changes ph physically disrupt chemical cues various implications animal scent marking scent rubbing common forms olfactory communication example scent rubbing animal seen bears bears way mark territory let others know stay electrocommunication rare form communication animals seen primarily aquatic animals though land mammals notably platypus echidnas sense electric fields might used weakly electric fishes provide example electrocommunication together electrolocation fish use electric organ generate electric field detected electroreceptors differences waveform frequency changes field convey information species sex identity electric signals generated response hormones circadian rhythms interactions fish also serve mediate social hierarchy amongst species social predators sharks rays able eavesdrop electrogenic fish passive touch key factor many social interactions examples seismic communication exchange information using selfgenerated vibrational signals transmitted via substrate soil water spider webs plant stems blade grass form communication several advantages example sent regardless light noise levels usually short range short persistence may reduce danger detection predators use seismic communication found many taxa including frogs kangaroo rats mole rats bees nematode worms

whales echolocation involves emitting sounds interpreting vibrations return bats echolocation also serves purpose mapping environment capable recognizing space without visible light memorize patterns feedback get many functions animal communication however studied detail others includes described many animal gestures postures sounds convey meaning nearby animals signals often easier describe interpret tempting especially domesticated animals apes anthropomorphize interpret animal actions human terms quite misleading example apes smile often sign aggression also gesture may different

dancing cranes pattern changes cuttlefish gathering arranging materials bowerbirds evidence importance communication animals prioritisation physiological features function example birdsong appears brain structures entirely devoted production adaptations require evolutionary explanation two aspects required explanation significant contributions first problems made konrad lorenz early ethologists comparing related species within groups showed movements body parts primitive forms communicative function could captured context communication would functional one partners could evolve elaborate specialised form example desmond morris showed study grass finches beakwiping response occurred range species serving preening function species elaborated courtship second problem controversial early ethologists assumed communication occurred good species whole would require process group selection believed mathematically impossible evolution sexually reproducing animals altruism towards unrelated group widely accepted scientific community rather seen reciprocal altruism expecting behaviour others benefit living group sociobiologists argued behaviours benefited whole group animals might emerge result selection pressures acting solely individual genecentered view evolution proposes behaviours enabled gene become wider established within population would become positively selected even effect individuals species whole case communication important discussion john krebs richard dawkins established hypotheses evolution apparently altruistic mutualistic communications alarm calls courtship signals emerge individual selection led realization communication might always honest indeed obvious examples mimicry possibility evolutionarily stable dishonest communication subject much controversy amotz zahavi particular arguing exist long term sociobiologists also concerned evolution apparently excessive signaling structures peacocks tail widely thought emerge result sexual selection create positive feedback process leads rapid exaggeration characteristic confers advantage competitive mateselection situation one theory explain evolution traits like peacocks tail runaway selection requires two trait exists like bright tail preexisting bias female select trait females prefer elaborate tails thus males able mate successfully exploiting psychology female positive feedback loop enacted tail becomes bigger brighter eventually evolution level survival costs male allow trait elaborated two theories exist explain runaway selection first good genes hypothesis theory states elaborate display honest signal fitness truly better mate second handicap hypothesis explains peacocks tail handicap requiring energy keep makes visible predators thus signal costly maintain remains honest indicator signalers condition another assumption signal costly low quality males produce higher quality males produce simply higher quality males energy reserves available allocate costly ethologists sociobiologists characteristically analysed animal communication terms less automatic responses stimuli without raising question whether animals concerned understand meaning signals emit receive key question animal cognition signalling systems seem demand advanced understanding much discussed example use alarm calls vervet monkeys robert seyfarth dorothy cheney showed animals emit different alarm calls presence different predators leopards eagles snakes monkeys hear calls respond ability develops time also takes account experience individual emitting call metacommunication discussed also seems require sophisticated cognitive process reported bottlenose dolphins recognize identity information whistles even otherwise stripped characteristics whistle making dolphins animals humans shown transmit identity information independent callers voice location paper concludes fact signature whistle shape carries identity information independent voice features presents possibility use whistles referential signals either addressing individuals referring similar use names humans given cognitive abilities bottlenose dolphins vocal learning copying skills social structure possibility intriguing one demands investigation another controversial issue extent human behaviours resemble animal communication whether communication disappeared result linguistic
