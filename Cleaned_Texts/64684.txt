lewins equation b fp e heuristic formula proposed psychologist kurt lewin explanation determines behavior formula states behavior function person b displaystyle b behavior p displaystyle p person e displaystyle e environment equation first presented lewins book principles topological psychology published equation proposed attempt unify different branches psychology eg child psychology animal psychology psychopathology flexible theory applicable distinct branches equation directly related lewins field theory field theory centered around idea persons life space determines thus equation also expressed b fl l life lewins book first presents equation b fs behavior function whole situation extended original equation suggesting whole situation could roughly split two parts person p environment according lewin social behavior particular psychologically interesting relevant lewin held variables equation eg p e could replaced specific unique situational personal characteristics individual result also believed formula seemingly abstract theoretical distinct concrete applications many scholars even lewin acknowledged influence gestalt psychology lewins lewins field theory holds number different competing forces combine result totality situation single persons behavior may different unique situations acting partly response differential forces factors eg environment e physically identical environment psychologically different even man different similarly two different individuals placed exactly situation necessarily engage behavior even standpoint physicist environment identical nearly identical child adult psychological situation fundamentally reason lewin holds person eg p must considered conjunction environment p consists entirety person eg present motivations desires elements within p contained within life space elements within p interact lewin emphasizes desires motivations within person situation entirety sum competing forces combine form something larger life space notion speaks directly gestalt idea whole greater sum idea parts eg p e whole eg combine form interactive system called lewins dynamic approach term specifically refers regarding elements situationas parts lewin explicitly stated either person environment may important particular situations every psychological event depends upon state person time environment although relative importance different different thus lewin believed succeeded creating applicable theory also flexible enough justice enormous differences various events sense held inappropriate pick side classic psychological debate nature versus nurture held every scientific psychology must take account whole situations ie state person lewin stated question whether heredity environment plays greater part also belongs kind thinking transition galilean thinking involved recognition general validity thesis event always result interaction several lewin defined empirical law functional relationship various facts different characteristics event lewins original proposal equation specify exactly person environment interact produce behavior scholars noted lewins use comma equation p e represents lewins flexibility receptiveness multiple ways two may lewin indeed held importance person environment may vary casebycase basis use comma may provide flexibility support lewin differentiates multiple realities example psychological reality encompasses everything individual perceives believes true contained within psychological reality affect behavior contrast things may outside psychological reality bits physical reality social reality direct relation behavior lewin states psychological realitydoes depend upon whether contentexists physical social sensethe existence nonexistenceof psychological fact independent existence nonexistence content result reality contained within life space psychological reality reality direct consequences behavior example principles topological psychology lewin continually reiterates sentiment physical reality object concerned decisive degree psychological lewin refers example child living magic lewin asserts child realities magic world psychological reality thus must considered influence subsequent behavior even though magic world exist within physical reality likewise scholars familiar lewins work emphasized psychological situation defined lewin strictly composed facts individual perceives lewins theoretical framework whole life space contains person dynamic order accurately determine behavior lewins equation holds one must consider examine life space exact moment behavior occurred life space even moments behavior occurred longer exactly behavior occurred thus may accurately represent whole situation led behavior first focus present situation represented departure many theories time theories tended focus looking individuals past order explain present behavior sigmund freuds lewins emphasis present state life space preclude idea individuals past may impact present state life space influence previous history thought indirect dynamic psychology point view systematic causation past events influence present events past events position historical causal chains whose interweavings create present lewin referred concept principle contemporaneity
