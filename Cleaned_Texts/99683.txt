ectoderm one three primary germ layers formed early embryonic development outermost layer superficial mesoderm middle layer endoderm innermost emerges originates outer layer germ cells word ectoderm comes greek ektos meaning outside derma meaning generally speaking ectoderm differentiates form epithelial neural tissues spinal cord peripheral nerves brain includes skin linings mouth anus nostrils sweat glands hair tooth enamel types epithelium derived vertebrate embryos ectoderm divided two parts dorsal surface ectoderm also known external ectoderm neural plate invaginates form neural tube neural surface ectoderm gives rise epithelial tissues neural plate gives rise neural tissues reason neural plate neural crest also referred neuroectoderm heinz christian pander baltic biologist credited discovery three germ layers form embryogenesis pander received doctorate zoology university würzburg began studies embryology using chicken eggs allowed discovery ectoderm mesoderm endoderm due findings pander sometimes referred founder embryology panders work early embryo continued biologist named karl ernst von baer baer took panders concept germ layers extensive research many different types species able extend principle vertebrates baer also received credit discovery blastula baer published findings including germ layer theory textbook translates development animals released ectoderm first observed amphibians fish later stages gastrulation start process developing embryo divided many cells forming hollow ball called blastula blastula polar two halves called animal hemisphere vegetal hemisphere animal hemisphere eventually become like two germ layers ie mesoderm endoderm ectoderm forms shortly fertilization rapid cell division begins position ectoderm relative germ layers embryo governed selective affinity meaning inner surface ectoderm strong positive affinity mesoderm weak negative affinity endoderm selective affinity changes different stages development strength attraction two surfaces two germ layers determined amount type cadherin molecules present cells surface example expression ncadherin crucial maintaining separation precursor neural cells precursor epithelial likewise surface ectoderm becomes neuroectoderm induced along neural pathway notochord typically positioned process gastrulation bottle cells invaginate dorsal surface blastula form blastopore cells continue extend inward migrate along inner wall blastula form fluidfilled cavity called blastocoel superficial cells animal pole destined become cells middle germ layer called mesoderm process radial extension cells animal pole several layers thick divide form thin layer time thin layer dividing cells reaches dorsal lip blastopore another process occurs termed convergent extension convergent extension cells approach lip intercalate mediolaterally way cells pulled lip inside embryo two processes allow prospective mesoderm cells placed ectoderm endoderm convergent extension radial intercalation underway rest vegetal pole become endoderm cells completely engulfed prospective ectoderm top cells undergo epiboly ectoderm cells divide way form one layer creates uniform embryo composed three germ layers respective three germ layers established cellular differentiation occur first major process neurulation wherein ectoderm differentiates form neural tube neural crest cells epidermis three components give rise particular complement cells neural tube cells give rise central nervous system neural crest cells give rise peripheral enteric nervous system melanocytes facial cartilage epidermal region give rise epidermis hair nails sebaceous glands olfactory oral epithelium neurulation occurs two parts primary secondary neurulation processes position neural crest cells superficial epidermal layer deep neural tube primary neurulation notochord cells mesoderm signal adjacent superficial ectoderm cells reposition columnar pattern form cells ectodermal neural cells continue elongate group cells immediately notochord change shape forming wedge ectodermal region special cells called medial hinge cells mhps ectoderm continues elongate ectodermal cells neural plate fold inward inward folding ectoderm virtue mainly cell division continues another group cells forms within neural plate cells termed dorsolateral hinge cells dlhps formed inward folding ectoderm stops dlhp cells function similar fashion mhp cells regarding wedge like shape however dlhp cells result ectoderm converging convergence led ectodermal cells dlhp cells known neural crest neural crest cells eventually pull adjacent ectodermal cells together leaves neural crest cells prospective epidermis hollow neural organs rise ectoderm nervous system teeth

organs form dependent invagination epithelial important factor initiation tooth germ development rate epithelial invagination significantly increased action expressed epithelium mesenchyme helps stimulate epithelial cell proliferation order make larger tooth germs mammalian teeth develop ectoderm derived mesenchyme oral ectoderm neural crest epithelial components stem cells continuously growing teeth form tissue layers called stellate reticulum suprabasal layer surface ectodermal dysplasia rare severe condition tissue groups specifically teeth skin hair nails sweat glands derived
