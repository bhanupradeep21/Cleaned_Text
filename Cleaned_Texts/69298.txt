science forced changing views health illness doctors psychologists begin alike began questioning old methods treating new method thought biopsychosocial model heavily influenced two main issues specificity problem base rate problem address fact one environmental stressor often associated many different example would work stress stressed work lead hypertension however also lead coronary heart disease nearly impossible tell path taken result stress could result problem states hard predict whether presence stressor lead development disorder reason behind experiencing environmental stressor may lead developing disorder however diagnosing patient alone would result absurd number false example would smoking cancer doctors diagnose everyone ever smoked cigarette cigar cancer would quickly become apparent ineffective diagnostic criterion many individuals would develop lung cancercitation needed main premise biopsychosocial model separate biological factors environmental factors addressing illness must view person part whole system theory one best methods observe holistic model systems theory states individual exists within hierarchy subsystems eg cells person family society etc subsystems example one lose family member individual may feel stressed turn may weaken immune system cause catch cold cold considered biological nature ie bacterium virus aided outside factors
