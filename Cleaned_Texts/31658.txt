real forefins hindfins temnodontosaurus roughly length rather narrow elongated characteristic unlike posttriassic ichthyosaurs thunnosaurians forefins least twice length hindfins different posttriassic ichthyosaurs like ichthyosaurus possessing unreduced tripartite pelvic girdle primary digits one postaxial accessory digit like ichthyosaurs fins exhibited strong hyperphalangy fins involved body propulsion tail used main propulsive force movement although weak tail bend angle less caudal fin variously described either lunate semilunate made two lobes lower lobe skeletally supported whereas upper lobe unsupported proximal elements fin formed mosaic pattern distal elements relatively round also triangular dorsal fin two notches fins anterior margin paired fins used steer stabilize animal swimming instead paddling propulsion roughly less vertebrae axis atlas vertebrae fused together serving stabilization swimming trigonodon possessed unicipital ribs near sacral region
