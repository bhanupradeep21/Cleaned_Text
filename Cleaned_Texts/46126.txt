broken finger finger fracture common type bone fracture affecting symptoms may include pain swelling tenderness bruising deformity reduced ability move although finger fractures easy treat failing deal fracture appropriately may result longterm pain cause usually traumatic commonly falls crushing injuries sports injuries pathological fractures infection tumour hand bones note thumb blue middle

usually cause transverse fracture break across finger force angle likely produce oblique fracture twisting force likely cause spiral fracture crushing injuries may may shatter bone multiple pieces called comminuted fractures joints often caused jammed finger injuries hand equivalent stubbed toe tendon pulls away bit bone attached avulsion fracture shown image top page also lead fracture putting hand break fall landing badly fracture crushing injuries may occur finger gets shut door common among children eight accident machinery heavy jammed finger trauma blow end finger often caused trying catch ball may break finger misusing tools especially power also break occasionally infection tumour cause broken called pathological fracture symptoms include pain swelling deformity decreased range motion instability may pain injury sensation checked look nerve damage capillary refill blood circulation damage hand also checked injuries soft tissues like sprains tendon tears dislocations joints

mechanism bit bone attached tendon broken tendon cant extend finger tip finger fractures severe enough need surgery severe cases complications often occur eventually heal functionally rarely longterm complications including decreased range motion break affects joint surface may displaced step joint surface smooth hinder motion risks posttraumatic osteoarthritis usually reduced put back place surgically fracture unstable wont stay reduced joint dislocated partially dislocated hand surgeons agree surgically repaired open fractures skin broken also increase risk infection complications especially wound dirty parts open fractures usually operated busch fracture specific type finger fracture base distal phalanx without adequate treatment become mallet finger broken fingers treated emergency broken finger blue numb fracture displaced finger angle bone visible broken finger trapped object must way avoids injury relaxation elevation icing lubrication eg soapy water oil may suffice removal methodsclarification needed done doctor object portable often done paramedics fire hand injures rings bracelets removed immediately injury starts pulling rings forcefully may worsen swelling relaxation elevation icing lubrication rotating ring unscrewing may help methods dont work may possible remove ring temporarily wrapping finger slick string something like dental floss passing inner end thread ring unwrapping pushing ring ahead unwrapping string failing doctor may remove broken finger may may require surgery simple cases bone may put back place finger may put splint strapped another finger buddy wrap splints finger tight risk compartment syndrome finger numb tingling painful swollen skin wrap cool touch wrap may need splint needs kept dry may interfere daily tasks need done someone many finger fractures displaced simple displaced fractures may realigned reduced local surgery may needed unstable fracture one wont stay right place finger broken multiple fracture extends joint broken bone another bone fracture damaged tendon damaged rest ice elevation used reduce pain icing done minutes every minutes every ice isnt placed directly skin wrapped thin icing done awake first three days swelling goes elevation done resting hand upon cushion trying keep heart much reasonably overthecounter painkiller like paracetamol ibuprofen also used ibuprofen taken doctor diagnosed broken fingers thumbs usually heal weeks months full fingers mostly heal well weeks eating healthily smoking speed healing pain steadily decrease improvements starting within days steadily
