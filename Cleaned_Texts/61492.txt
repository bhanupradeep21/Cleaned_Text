medication overuse headache moh also known rebound headache usually occurs painkillers taken frequently relieve cases often referred painkiller rebound headaches frequently occur daily painful common cause chronic daily headache typically occur patients underlying headache disorder migraine tensiontype headache transforms time episodic condition chronic daily headache due excessive intake acute headache relief medications moh serious disabling wellcharacterized disorder represents worldwide problem considered thirdmost prevalent type headache proportion patients population chronic daily

preventive medications instead encouraged take painkillers reboundcausing medications preventive medications taken daily basis patients may require preventive medications many years others may require relatively short period time six months effective preventive medications found come many classes medications including neuronal stabilizing agents aka anticonvulsants antidepressants antihypertensives antihistamines effective preventive medications include elavil amitriptyline depakote valproate topamax topiramate inderal propranololmedical citation needed moh common treated overused medications must stopped patients headache resolve though limited evidence suggest done without using preventive clinical data shows treatment election abrupt drugs withdrawal followed starting prophylactic
