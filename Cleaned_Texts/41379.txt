indometacin also known indomethacin nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug nsaid commonly used prescription medication reduce fever pain stiffness swelling inflammation works inhibiting production prostaglandins endogenous signaling molecules known cause symptoms inhibiting cyclooxygenase enzyme catalyzes production patented approved medical use world health organizations list essential commonly prescribed medication united states thousand nsaid indometacin analgesic antiinflammatory antipyretic clinical indications indometacin include joint diseases headaches others general adverse effects indometacin similar nsaids instance indometacin inhibits inhibits production prostaglandins stomach intestines responsible maintaining mucous lining gastrointestinal tract indometacin therefore like nonselective cox inhibitors cause peptic ulcers ulcers result serious bleeding perforation requiring hospitalization patient reduce possibility peptic ulcers indometacin prescribed lowest dosage needed achieve therapeutic effect usually mgday always taken food nearly patients benefit ulcer protective drug eg highly dosed antacids ranitidine mg bedtime omeprazole mg bedtime common gastrointestinal complaints including dyspepsia heartburn mild diarrhea less serious rarely require discontinuation indometacin many nsaids particularly indometacin cause lithium retention reducing excretion kidneys thus indometacin users elevated risk lithium toxicity patients taking lithium eg treatment depression bipolar disorder less toxic nsaids sulindac aspirin preferred nsaids including indometacin also increase plasma renin activity aldosterone levels increase sodium potassium retention vasopressin activity also enhanced together may lead elevations serum creatinine serious renal damage acute kidney failure chronic nephritis nephrotic syndrome also possible conditions also often begin edema high potassium levels blood paradoxically yet uncommonly indometacin cause headache sometimes vertigo dizziness hearing loss tinnitus blurred vision without retinal damage unsubstantiated reports worsening parkinsons disease epilepsy psychiatric disorders cases lifethreatening shock including angioedema sweating severe hypotension tachycardia well acute bronchospasm severe lethal hepatitis severe bone marrow damage reported skin reactions photosensitivity also possible side effects frequency severity side effects availability better tolerated alternatives make indometacin today drug second choice use acute gout attacks dysmenorrhea wellestablished indications duration treatment limited days therefore serious side effects likely occur people undergo regular physical examination detect edema signs central nervous side effects blood pressure checks reveal development hypertension periodic serum electrolyte sodium potassium chloride measurements complete blood cell counts assessment liver enzymes well creatinine renal function performed particularly important indometacin given together ace inhibitor potassiumsparing diuretics combinations lead hyperkalemia andor serious kidney failure examinations necessary topical preparations spray gel applied rare cases shown use medication pregnant women effect fetal heart possibly resulting fetal death via premature closing ductus october us food drug administration fda required drug label updated nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications describe risk kidney problems unborn babies result low amniotic recommend avoiding nsaids pregnant women weeks later indometacin nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug nsaid similar mode action compared drugs group nonselective inhibitor cyclooxygenase cox enzymes participate prostaglandin synthesis arachidonic acid prostaglandins hormonelike molecules normally found body wide variety effects lead pain fever inflammation inhibiting synthesis prostaglandins indometacin reduce pain fever indometacin mechanism action along several nsaids inhibit cox described additionally indometacin recently found positive allosteric modulator pam cannabinoid receptor enhancing binding signalling endogenous cannabinoids anandamide pams may elicit increased cannabinergic signalling tissue specific manner reducing incidence problematic side effects psychoactivity maintaining antinociceptive besides indometacin logarithmic acid dissociation constant pka since physiologic body ph well pka range indometacin indometacin molecules dissociated ionized form leaving little unionized form indometacin cross cell membrane ph gradient across cell membrane high indometacin molecules trapped one side membrane higher ph phenomenon called ion trapping phenomenon ion trapping particularly prominent stomach ph stomach mucosa layer extremely acidic parietal cells alkaline therefore indometacin trapped inside parietal cells ionized form damaging stomach cells causing stomach irritation stomach irritation reduce stomach acid ph indometacins role treating certain headaches unique compared nsaids addition class effect cox inhibition evidence indometacin ability reduce cerebral blood flow modulation nitric oxide pathways also via intracranial precapillary indometacin property reducing cerebral blood flow useful treating raised intracranial pressure case report shown intravenous bolus dose indometacin given hours continuous infusion able reduce intracranial pressure minutes increases cerebral perfusion pressure reduction cerebral pressure may responsible remarkable efficacy group headaches referred indometacinresponsive headaches idiopathic stabbing headache chronic paroxysmal hemicranial exertional hand activation superior salivary nucleus brainstem used stimulate trigeminal autonomic reflex arc causing type headache called trigeminal autonomic cephalgia indometacin inhibits superior salivatory nucleus thus relieving type prostaglandins also cause uterine contractions pregnant women indometacin effective tocolytic able delay premature labor reducing uterine contractions inhibition prostaglandin synthesis uterus possibly calcium channel blockade indometacin readily crosses placenta reduce fetal urine production treat polyhydramnios reducing renal blood flow increasing renal vascular resistance possibly enhancing effects vasopressin fetal kidneys modes action indometacin indometacin inntooltip international
