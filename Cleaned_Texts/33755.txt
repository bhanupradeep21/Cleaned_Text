visual perception people see simply translation retinal stimuli ie image retina thus people interested perception long struggled explain visual processing create actually seen two major ancient greek schools providing primitive explanation vision works first emission theory vision maintained vision occurs rays emanate eyes intercepted visual objects object seen directly means rays coming eyes

illusions cases inference process goes wrong yielded much insight sort assumptions visual system makes another type unconscious inference hypothesis based probabilities recently revived socalled bayesian studies visual proponents approach consider visual system performs form bayesian inference derive perception sensory data however clear proponents view derive principle relevant probabilities
