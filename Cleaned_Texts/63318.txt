grey column refers somewhat ridgeshaped mass grey matter spinal presents three columns anterior grey column posterior grey column lateral grey column visible crosssection spinal cord anterior grey column made alpha motor neurons gamma motor neurons small neurons thought posterior grey column divided several rexed lateral grey column present thoracic region upper lumbar segments lateral grey column contains preganglionic cell bodies autonomic nervous system sensory relay neurons anterior grey column also known anterior horn spinal cord comprises three different types neurons large alpha motor neurons medium gamma motor neurons small neurons thought neurons differ morphology patterns organized manner muscles alpha motor neurons innervate extrafusal muscle fibers generate force neuromuscular junctions start muscle contraction large cell bodies receive proprioceptive shown reduce population size damage cell bodies lead severe muscle weakness loss gamma motor neurons innervate intrafusal muscle fibers control sensitivity muscle spindles stretch smaller cell bodies alpha motor neurons receive proprioceptive shown reduce numbers size physiology small neurons anterior column well understood effects excitatory inhibitory suspected interneurons shown reduce size numbers posterior grey column also known posterior dorsal horn spinal cord divided several laminae based type sensory information sent laminae ii sent information afferent neurons sense nociception temperature itching laminae iii iv sent information neurons sense mechanical pressure laminae v vi sent information known primary relay point haptic nociceptive posterior horn also known partially layered structure laminae ii well defined column also separated nociceptive nonnociceptive senses laminae ii important nociception laminae iii iv involved nociception lamina v involved nociception lamina also known marginal nucleus spinal cord majority posterior column projection neurons located lamina however neurons layer main areas neurons innervate caudal ventrolateral medulla cvlm nucleus solitary tract nts lateral parabrachial area lpb periaqueductal grey matter pag certain regions cvlm receives nociceptive cardiovascular nts receives cardiorespiratory inputs affects reflex tachycardia noxious lpb projects amygdala hypothalamus involved emotional response pag develops ways deal pain main target analgesics projects parts nuclei thalamus affect sensory motivational aspects neurons lamina distinguished morphology pyramidal spindle layer also known substantia gelatinosa rolando highest density neurons mediate activity nociceptive temperature afferent almost entirely made interneurons divided morphology four main morphological classes based shape dendritic structure islet central vertical radial cells interneurons also divided function excitatory inhibitory excitatory interneurons release glutamate main neurotransmitter inhibitory interneurons use gaba andor glycine main neurotransmitter neurons layer c fibers contain almost laminae also known nucleus proprius contain much smaller density neurons lamina projection neurons scattered throughout mechanosensitive beta fibers terminate layers receive input lamina ii also control pain temperature crude c fibers control nociception temperature sensory information mechanoreceptors relayed lamina also known neck posterior column receives information mechanoreceptors danger information different neurons different regions medial region contains mediumsized triangular neurons lateral region contains mediumsized multipolar lamina found cervical lumbar regions spinal cord receives afferent input muscle fibers lateral grey column lateral horn spinal cord part sympathetic nervous system receives input brain stem organs hypothalamus lateral column present thoracic region upper lumbar segments lateral grey column contains preganglionic cell bodies autonomic nervous system sensory relay neurons neurons anterior column shown affected amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als number large alpha motor neurons medium gamma motor neurons greatly reduced number small neurons either slightly greatly reduced depending type muscular atrophy also shown effect neurons anterior column large loss large alpha motor neurons medium gamma motor neurons small neurons recorded cases muscular damage lateral column result horners syndrome multiple system atrophy msa also linked lateral grey column msa shown reduce cell count lateral column posterior column prominent role pain system first central relay nociceptive pathway firstorder afferent neuron carries sensory information second order neuron dorsal horn axon second order neuron projection neuron interneuron goes third order neuron thalamus thalamus known gateway cortex third order neuron goes cerebral cortex afferent neurons either fibers c fibers fibers myelinated allowing faster signal conduction among beta fibers faster carry information nonpainful touch delta fibers slower thinner beta fibers c fibers myelinated therefore c fibers carry nociceptive signals divided two types fibers contain neuropeptides like substance p fibers contain two types terminate different areas nonpeptidergic c fibers linked skin innervate epidermis peptidergic c fibers innervate tissues deeper parts two main types nociceptive signals sensory affective sensory nociceptive signals provide information kind stimulus heat mechanical etc affecting body also indicates body stimulus sensory nociceptive neurons small receptive field help pinpoint exact location affective nociceptive signals affect emotions signals go limbic system tell body react danger stimulus ie removing hand hot stove neurons larger receptive fields emotional reaction pain stimuli
