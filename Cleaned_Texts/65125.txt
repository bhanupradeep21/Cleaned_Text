storage effect coexistence mechanism proposed ecological theory species coexistence tries explain wide variety similar species able coexist within ecological community guild storage effect originally proposed explain coexistence diverse communities coral reef fish however since generalized cover variety ecological theory proposes one way multiple species coexist changing environment species best instead species must unique response varying environmental conditions way buffering effects bad storage effect gets name population stores gains good years microhabitats patches help survive population losses bad years one strength theory unlike coexistence mechanisms storage effect measured quantified units percapita growth rate offspring per adult per storage effect caused temporal spatial variation temporal storage effect often referred simply storage effect occurs species benefit changes yeartoyear environmental spatial storage effect occurs species benefit variation microhabitats across storage effect operate requires variation ie fluctuations thus termed fluctuationdependent mechanism variation come large degree factors including resource availability temperature predation levels however storage effect function variation must change birth survival recruitment rate species year year patch competing species within community coexist meet one fundamental requirement impact competition species must exceed competitive impact species words intraspecific competition must exceed interspecific example jackrabbits living area compete food nesting grounds competition within species called intraspecific competition limits growth species members different species also compete instance jackrabbits cottontail rabbits also compete food nesting grounds competition different species called interspecific competition limits growth species stable coexistence occurs one species community limits growth strongly growth otherscitation needed storage effect mixes three essential ingredients assemble community competing species fulfill requirement correlation quality environment amount competition experienced population environment ie covariance environment competition differences species response environment ie speciesspecific environmental responses ability population diminish impact competition worsening environment ie buffered population ingredient described detail explanation combination three leads species coexistence growth population strongly influenced environment experiences environment consists physical elements resource abundance temperature level physical disturbance also biological elements abundance natural enemies usually organisms reproduce favorable environment ie either good year within good patch build population densities lead high level competition due increasing trend means higher quality environments usually correlate higher strength competition experienced organisms environments short better environment results stronger statistics correlation means nonzero covariance change population density response environment competition first ingredient called covariance environment competitioncitation needed covariance environment competition suggests organisms experience strongest competition optimal environmental conditions populations grow rapidly conditions nature often find different species community respond conditions distinctive manners example plant species different preferred levels light water availability affect germination physical growth differences response environment called speciesspecific environmental response means two species community best environment given year given patch result species optimal environmental conditions thus experiencing strongest intraspecific competition species community experience strongest interspecific competition coming species strongest intraspecific competition coming population decline environmental conditions worsen competition intensifies species limit impact competition hostile environment population crash become locally marvelously nature organisms often able slow rate population decline hostile environment alleviating impact competition able set lower limit rate population phenomenon called buffered population growth occurs variety situations temporal storage effect accomplished adults species long life spans relatively unaffected environmental stressors example adult tree unlikely killed weeks drought single night freezing temperatures whereas seedling may survive even seedlings killed bad environmental conditions longlived adults able keep overall population moreover adults usually adopt strategies dormancy hibernation hostile environment make less sensitive competition allows buffer double blades hostile environment competition rivals different example buffered population growth attained annual plants persistent seed thanks longlived seeds entire population destroyed single bad year moreover seeds stay dormant unfavorable environmental conditions avoiding direct competition rivals favored environment thus diminish impact competition bad temporal situations buffered population growth expected occur namely multiple generations overlap labords chameleon adults high mortality rate many aquatic insects populations eastern fence buffered growth occur spatial storage effect buffered population growth generally automatic effects detrimental microhabitat experienced individuals area rather population combined effect covariance environment competition speciesspecific response environment decouple strongest intraspecific interspecific competition experienced intraspecific competition strongest species favored environment whereas interspecific competition strongest rivals favored decoupling buffered population growth limits impact interspecific competition species favored environment consequence impact intraspecific competition species favored particular environment exceeds interspecific competition species less favored environment see fundamental requirement species coexistence fulfilled thus storage effect able maintain stable coexistence community competing species coexist community species must able recover low surprisingly coexistence mechanism storage effect helps species become rare making abundant species effect greater effect rare difference species response environmental conditions means rare species optimal environment competitors conditions rare species experience low levels interspecific competition rare species rare experience little impact intraspecific competition well even highest possible levels intraspecific competition free impact competition rare species able make gains good
