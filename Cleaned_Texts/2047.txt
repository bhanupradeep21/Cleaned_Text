corneocytes terminally differentiated keratinocytes compose stratum corneum outermost layer epidermis regularly replaced desquamation renewal lower epidermal layers essential function skin barrier corneocytes keratinocytes without nuclei cytoplasmic contain highly insoluble cornified envelope within plasma membrane lipids fatty acids sterols ceramides released lamellar bodies within epidermis corneocytes interlocked organized vertical columns cells form stratum corneocytes lower part stratum corneum bridged together specialized junctions corneodesmosomes junctions disintegrate corneocytes migrate toward surface skin result desquamation time loosened junctions encounter hydration expand connect together forming potential entry pores stratum corneum absorb three times weight water water

keratinocytes undergo multiple stages differentiation finally become corneocytes reach stratum corneum corneocytes continually eliminated desquamation rubbing skin washing detergents also continually formed keratinocyte corneocytes also referred squames latin squama meaning thin flake scales terminally differentiated anucleated cells keratinocyte lineage constitute majority stratum corneum outermost layer epidermis size corneocyte approximately µm diameter µm thick average area corneocytes surface skin reaches approximately may vary according anatomical location age external

high mechanical strength allows epidermis skin perform function physical chemical immunological barrier example corneocytes act uv barrier reflecting scattered uv radiation protecting cells inside

layer every corneocytes also capable absorbing storing small amounts water keep skin hydrated maintain corneocytes contain small molecules called natural moisturizing factors absorb small amounts water corneocytes thereby hydrating skin natural moisturizing factor collection watersoluble compounds produced degradation histidinerich proteins called filaggrin responsible aggregating keratin filaments form keratin bundles maintain rigid structure cells stratum filaggrin degraded urea pyrrolidone carboxylic acid glutamic acid amino acids collectively referred natural moisturizing factor
