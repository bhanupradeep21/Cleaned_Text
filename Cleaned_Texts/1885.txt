accidental explosion redlzipf rocket engine test facility liquid oxygen plant worked rocket technician oberth moved germany time study physics initially munich later university göttingen oberths proposed doctoral dissertation rocket science rejected utopian however professor augustin maior university cluj romania offered oberth opportunity defend original dissertation order receive successfully may next work published privately june somewhat controversial book die rakete zu den rocket planetary oberth expanded work book titled wege zur raumschiffahrt ways oberth commented later made deliberate choice write another doctoral dissertation wrote refrained writing another one thinking never mind prove able become greater scientist even without title oberth criticized german system education saying educational system like automobile strong rear lights brightly illuminating past looking forward things barely oberth became member verein für raumschiffahrt vfr spaceflight society amateur rocketry group taken great inspiration book oberth acted something mentor enthusiasts joined society included persons wernher von braun rolf engel rudolf nebel paul ehmayr oberth lacked opportunities work teach college university level many welleducated experts physical sciences engineering time period situation becoming much worse worldwide great depression started therefore

considerations calculations flights including landings moon asteroids mars venus mercury comets oberth initially outlined concept space mirrors book die rakete zu den planetenräumen rocket interplanetary space mirrors diameters ranging km envisioned composed grid network consisting individually adjustable facets oberths concept space mirrors orbit around earth serves purpose focusing sunlight specific regions planets surface redirecting space approach differs creating shaded areas lagrange point earth sun involve diminishing solar radiation across entire exposed surface according oberth colossal orbital mirrors possess potential illuminate individual cities safeguard natural disasters manipulate weather patterns climate even create additional living space billions people places significant emphasis capacity influence trajectories barometric high lowpressure areas however important acknowledge implementation climate engineering interventions including space mirrors requires extensive research practical applicability fully realized publications followed took account technical progress achieved point ways spaceflight menschen im weltraum neue projekte für

gravitational pull necessitates less energy launching components lunar orbit additionally earths atmosphere spared burden numerous rocket launches envisioned process involves launching components lunar surface lunar orbit using electromagnetic lunar slingshot subsequently stacking libration point components could transported orbit via electric spaceships designed oberth minimal recoil orbit components would assembled mirrors diameters ranging km oberths estimate suggested realization concept could occur oberth emphasized mirrors could potentially serve weapons given aspect coupled complexity project realization mirrors would feasible peace initiative undertaken space mirror devised oberth categorized within field climate engineering specifically solar radiation management srm
