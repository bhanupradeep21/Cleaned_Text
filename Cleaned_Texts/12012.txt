emotion recognition process identifying human emotion people vary widely accuracy recognizing emotions others use technology help people emotion recognition relatively nascent research area generally technology works best uses multiple modalities context date work conducted automating recognition facial expressions video spoken expressions audio written expressions text physiology measured wearables humans show great deal variability abilities recognize emotion key point keep mind learning automated emotion recognition several sources ground truth truth real emotion suppose trying recognize emotions alex one source would people say alex feeling case truth may correspond alex feels may correspond people would say looks like alex feels example alex may actually feel sad puts big smile people say looks happy automated method achieves results group observers may considered accurate even actually measure alex truly feels another source truth ask alex truly feels works alex good sense internal state wants tell capable putting accurately words number however people alexithymic good sense internal feelings able communicate accurately words numbers general getting truth emotion actually present take work vary depending criteria selected usually involve maintaining level uncertainty decades scientific research conducted developing evaluating methods automated emotion recognition extensive literature proposing evaluating hundreds different kinds methods leveraging techniques multiple areas signal processing machine learning computer vision speech processing different methodologies techniques may employed interpret emotion bayesian gaussian mixture hidden markov deep neural accuracy emotion recognition usually improved combines analysis human expressions multimodal forms texts physiology audio different emotion types detected integration information facial expressions body movement gestures technology said contribute emergence socalled emotional emotive existing approaches emotion recognition classify certain emotion types generally classified three main categories knowledgebased techniques statistical methods hybrid knowledgebased techniques sometimes referred lexiconbased techniques utilize domain knowledge semantic syntactic characteristics language order detect certain emotion typescitation needed approach common use knowledgebased resources emotion classification process wordnet conceptnet name one advantages approach accessibility economy brought large availability knowledgebased limitation technique hand inability handle concept nuances complex linguistic knowledgebased techniques mainly classified two categories dictionarybased corpusbased approachescitation needed dictionarybased approaches find opinion emotion seed words dictionary search synonyms antonyms expand initial list opinions corpusbased approaches hand start seed list opinion emotion words expand database finding words contextspecific characteristics large corpusbased approaches take account context performance still vary different domains since word one domain different orientation another statistical methods commonly involve use different supervised machine learning algorithms large set annotated data fed algorithms system learn predict appropriate emotion machine learning algorithms generally provide reasonable classification accuracy compared approaches one challenges achieving good results classification process need sufficiently large training commonly used machine learning algorithms include support vector machines svm naive bayes maximum deep learning unsupervised family machine learning also widely employed emotion wellknown deep learning algorithms include different architectures artificial neural network ann convolutional neural network cnn long shortterm memory lstm extreme learning machine popularity deep learning approaches domain emotion recognition may mainly attributed success related applications computer vision speech recognition natural language processing hybrid approaches emotion recognition essentially combination knowledgebased techniques statistical methods exploit complementary characteristics works applied ensemble knowledgedriven linguistic elements statistical methods include sentic computing ifeel adopted conceptlevel knowledgebased resource role knowledgebased resources implementation hybrid approaches highly important emotion classification since hybrid techniques gain benefits offered knowledgebased statistical approaches tend better classification performance opposed employing knowledgebased statistical methods independentlycitation needed downside using hybrid techniques however computational complexity classification data integral part existing approaches emotion recognition cases challenge obtain annotated data necessary train machine learning task classifying different emotion types multimodal sources form texts audio videos physiological signals following datasets available emotion recognition used society variety reasons affectiva spun mit provides artificial intelligence software makes efficient tasks previously done manually people

form video many products also exist aggregate information emotions communicated online including via like button presses via counts positive negative phrases text affect recognition increasingly used kinds games virtual reality educational purposes give players natural control social avatarscitation needed emotion recognition probably gain best outcome applying multiple modalities combining different objects including text conversation audio video physiology detect emotions text data favorable research object emotion recognition free available everywhere human life compare types data storage text data lighter easy compress best performance due frequent repetition words characters languages emotions extracted two essential text forms written texts conversations written texts many scholars focus working sentence level extract wordsphrases representing different emotion recognition text vocal signals used recognition extract emotions video data combination audio data image data
