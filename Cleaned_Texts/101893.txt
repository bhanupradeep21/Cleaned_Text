hartmann f stähelin october july swiss pharmacologist outstanding record basic applied cancer immunology research discovered two important drugs etoposide ciclosporin stähelins parents medical doctors preparatory school classical education emphasis greek latin stähelin studied medicine basel zürich florence first position graduation institute microbiology university basel investigated morphology sporulation anthrax bacilli help thennew phasecontrast microscope may stähelin first observe naked anthrax bacilli protoplasts called gymnoplasts left behind empty cell walls year later studies osmotic behavior discovered described occasional fusion naked seminal paper german immediately caught attention bacterial geneticist joshua lederberg personally requested copy stähelin successfully applied postdoctoral fellowship sponsored swiss national foundation snf work project phagocytosis inspired emanuel suter harvard later second dean university florida medical school stähelin rediscovered respiratory burst leucocytes manfred l karnovskys laboratory department bacteriology immunology harvard medical school boston experiments stirred interest karnovsky time unaware metabolic phenomenon first described twenty years earlier c w baldridge r w gerard stähelins elegant work subsequently paved way famous investigations aj sbarra karnovsky role oxygen defense boston biomedical

enders laboratory boston sponsored sandoz stähelin joined pharmacology department basel head newly created laboratory research group working cancer immunology stähelin quickly assumed leading role discovery development podophyllum compounds four including etoposide vepesid later marketed able detect partially purified chemically modified extract podophyllum plant presence thenunknown agent interesting properties first considered chemists dirt chemists direction von wartburg analysed impurity guided stähelins invitro invivo found active compound responsible good antitumor activity spg proresid oral spi proresid intravenous discovered april commercialized chemical modifications led wellknown thenylidene derivative teniposide vumon discovered october commercialized sandoz ethylidene derivative etoposide vepesid discovered october remains clinically successful teniposide etoposide found stähelin new mechanism action blocked entry cells mitosis arrest late phase contrast spg spi spindle poisons subsequent investigations showed early biochemical effect two epipodophyllotoxins proliferating cells vitro differed alkylating agents antimetabolites vinca alkaloids landmark clinical comparative analysis f muggia etoposide teniposide licensed bristolmyers clinical development years later november etoposide approved us food drug administration etoposide still considered potent welltolerated combination partner innumerable hematologic solid tumor treatment schedules including malignant lymphomas lung cancer also indispensable cure testicular stähelin also instrumental discovery process several microbial products inhibiting cell proliferation including cytochalasin b brefeldin verrucarin anguinine chlamydocin played important role basic cancer research stähelin made key decision include test system immunosuppression general screening program sandoz compounds extracts invented new procedure permitted use mice testing anticancer activity immunosuppression inhibition antibody formation one invivo test system considerably reduced number experimental animals quantity test substances required also decreased labour involved stähelins invention procedure initiated innovative screening system discovering immunosuppressant drugs lacking bone marrow toxicity first screen discovered screening process first used pharmacology department january jean f borel joined stähelins stähelin used similar screen discover nonmyelotoxic immunosuppressant ovalicin applying revised screen led discovery potent biological activity ciclosporin january drug revolutionize organ transplantation paper became citation classic february stähelin screen rapidly successfully adopted japanese pharmaceutical company fujisawa astellas subsequently discovered tacrolimus prograf second clinically used calcineurin inhibitor receiving american association cancer research bruce f cain award jointly colleague von wartburg stähelin wrote astonishing number coincidences etoposide cyclosporine first coincidence etoposide cyclosporine found developed chemical biological side groups present authors specific biological effects discovered one us second compounds approved united states food drug administration day november although submitted different companies furthermore drugs act via effect intranuclear isomerase topoisomerase ii peptide cistransisomerase respectively compounds potent immunosuppressants etoposide well cyclosporine used treatment leukemias malignancies latter bone marrow transplantation prevent graftversushost disease former also used conjunction bone marrow transplantation sometimes two compounds used concomitantly exploiting capacity cyclosporine reduce certain types multidrug resistance modify immunity tumors cured etoposide development drugs galenical problems arose related poor water solubility absorption intestinal tract experience gained etoposide area crucial overcoming several years later difficulties similar type cyclosporine
