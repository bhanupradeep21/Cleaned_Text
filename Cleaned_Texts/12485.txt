muscular system organ system consisting skeletal smooth cardiac muscle permits movement body maintains posture circulates blood throughout muscular systems vertebrates controlled nervous system although muscles cardiac muscle completely autonomous together skeletal system human forms musculoskeletal system responsible movement three distinct types muscle skeletal muscle cardiac heart muscle smooth nonstriated muscle muscles provide strength balance posture movement heat body keep approximately muscles adult male human kind elastic tissue makes muscle consists thousands tens thousands small muscle fibers fiber comprises many tiny strands called fibrils impulses nerve cells control contraction muscle fiber skeletal muscle type striated muscle composed muscle cells called muscle fibers turn composed myofibrils myofibrils composed sarcomeres basic building blocks striated muscle tissue upon stimulation action potential skeletal muscles perform coordinated contraction shortening sarcomere best proposed model understanding contraction sliding filament model muscle contraction within sarcomere actin myosin fibers overlap contractile motion towards myosin filaments clubshaped myosin heads project toward actin provide attachment points binding sites actin filaments myosin heads move coordinated style swivel toward center sarcomere detach reattach nearest active site actin filament called ratchet type drive process consumes large amounts adenosine triphosphate atp energy source cell atp binds crossbridges myosin heads actin filaments release energy powers swiveling myosin head atp used becomes adenosine diphosphate adp since muscles store little atp must continuously replace discharged adp atp muscle tissue also contains stored supply fastacting

adapting different levels stretch tension important maintaining proper blood flow movement materials digestive system neuromuscular junctions focal point motor neuron attaches muscle acetylcholine neurotransmitter used skeletal muscle contraction released axon terminal nerve cell action potential reaches microscopic junction called synapse group chemical messengers across synapse stimulate

coordination balance control frequently come direction cerebellum brain allows complex muscular coordination little conscious effort one drives car without thinking tendon piece connective tissue connects muscle muscle contracts pulls skeleton create movement tendon connects muscle bone making function possible rest body produces majority atp aerobically without producing lactic acid fatiguing byproducts exercise method atp production varies depending fitness individual well duration intensity exercise lower activity levels exercise continues long duration several minutes longer energy produced aerobically combining oxygen carbohydrates fats stored activity higher intensity possible duration decreasing intensity increases atp production switch anaerobic pathways use creatine phosphate phosphagen system anaerobic glycolysis aerobic atp production biochemically much slower used longduration lowintensity exercise produces fatiguing waste products removed immediately sarcomere body results much greater number atp molecules per fat carbohydrate molecule aerobic training allows oxygen delivery system efficient allowing aerobic metabolism begin quicker anaerobic atp production produces atp much faster allows nearmaximal intensity exercise also produces significant amounts lactic acid render highintensity exercise unsustainable several minutes phosphagen system also anaerobic allows highest levels exercise intensity intramuscular stores phosphocreatine limited provide energy exercises lasting ten seconds recovery quick full creatine stores regenerated within
