mechanical ventilation assisted ventilation medical term using machine called ventilator fully partially provide artificial ventilation mechanical ventilation helps move air lungs main goal helping delivery oxygen removal carbon dioxide mechanical ventilation used many reasons including protect airway due mechanical neurologic cause ensure adequate oxygenation remove excess carbon dioxide lungs various healthcare providers involved use mechanical ventilation people require ventilators typically monitored intensive care unit mechanical ventilation termed invasive involves instrument create airway placed inside trachea done endotracheal tube nasotracheal noninvasive ventilation people conscious face nasal masks used two main types mechanical ventilation include positive pressure
