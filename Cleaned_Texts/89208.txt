mental management concept within field cognitive psychology explores cognitive cerebral thoughtbased processes different forms originally developed french educator philosopher antoine de la garanderie mental management developed order individuals use mental activities processes effectively cognition developed mental management theory expanded several previous academic dialogues first emerged educational purposes mental management approach developed research french educator philosopher antoine de la garanderie identified distinct mental processes support learning research builds several previous theories including works introspection jean martin charcot alfred binet maine de biran albert burloud la garanderies professor today studies used four domains systematically individual functioning education therapy developments past century combined original newfound scientific techniques studies understanding mental processes hence improve mental management includes following activities processes manage mind well attention retrieval comprehension thinking managing mind well involves maximising effectiveness efficiency cognitive processes associated applying deliberate approaches processes activities computer revolution led turn cognitive revolution psychology focus upon information processing via analogies computers programs leading interest internal mental processes rather overt human behaviour led development cognitive mental process model compared behaviourist model outline distinction scope cognitive psychology components mental management explored detail french philosopher educator antoine de la garanderies research led creating awareness individuals mental activities processes make develop use effectively theory aimed establish educational profiles based mental gestures learning specific according individuals understanding memorising reproducing techniques information differentiated concept show different cognitive mechanisms play part thinking learning ultimately make mental three main components mental management include project evocation mental gestures defining project learning strategy differ requirements enable implement effective appropriate evocation voluntary mental reconstruction procedure perceptions coming external world evocation foundation stone la garanderies theory allowing individuals reproduce learn later point time three specific profiles evocation corresponding particular channel child uses imagine information visual evocation includes transformation textual information visual information example drawings diagrams use colour auditory evocation includes oral mental repetition information example listening lessons audio kinaesthetic evocation includes movements feelings smells tastes example use gestures movements constituting mental management organisation improvement use activities processes cognitive psychology study mind information rose great importance due dissatisfaction behaviourist psychological models emphasis psychology shifted away studying mind favour understanding human information processing relating perception attention language memory thinking consciousness main concern cognitive psychology information received senses processed brain processing directs humans behave multifaceted approach various cognitive functions work together understand individuals groups also society whole mental management falls within cognitive model psychology needs distinguished behaviourist model considers mental processes unobservable therefore akin black box specifically behaviourist model assumes process linking behaviour stimulus studied therefore describes conceptualisation psychological disorders terms overt behaviour patterns produced learning influence reinforcement contingencies treatment techniques associated approach include systematic desensitisation modelling focusing modifying ineffective maladaptive patterns contrast cognitive model represents theoretical view thought mental operations provides explanations observed phenomena makes predictions behavioural consequences specifically describes mental events connect input environment behavioural output approach assumes people continually creating accessing internal representations models experiencing world purposes perception comprehension behaviour selection action treatment techniques associated approach include cognitive behavioural therapy involves defining observing analysing interpreting patterns reframing optimal ways thinking five different processes mental management la garanderie distinguishes different types mental gestures psychology attention defined state cognitive resources focused certain aspects environment rather others central nervous system state readiness respond mental management describes essential first step required enable subsequent step retrieving memorized information gesture attention linked perception five senses evocation subject example parent teacher activate childs attention instructive phrases using imperative retrieval defined american psychological association process recovering locating information stored memory retrieval final stage memory encoding retention associated stages dealt implicit basis mental management retrieval distinguished la garanderie gesture memorisation involves bringing back evocations purpose reproducing short medium comprehension defined act capability understanding something especially meaning communication american psychological involves making sense subjective sense require understanding correct la garanderie distinguishes comprehension gesture understanding allows us constantly shift perceived evoked order find meaning new american psychological association defines thinking cognitive behaviour ideas images mental representations hypothetical elements thought experienced manipulated context mental management thinking process also involves selfreflection involves examination contemplation analysis ones thoughts feeling actions thinking gesture reflection involves selecting notions theory already learnt allow us think task imagination faculty produces ideas images absence direct sensory data often combining fragments previous sensory experiences new syntheses critical component mental management captures change involved improving optimising mental processes gesture creative imagination allows individual invent new approaches based already know allows individuals make comparisons develop responses problems outside logical measurement mental processes involve invasive noninvasive ways measure human activity brain known neuroimaging neuroimaging defined clinical specialty concerned producing images brain noninvasive techniques computed

imaging commonly referred mri noninvasive diagnostic technique produces computerised images internal body tissues based nuclear magnetic resonance atoms within body induced application radio waves advances help understand brain specificity therefore able contribute theories mental management processes methods measuring mental processes found different parts brain responsible different mental processes example frontal lobe responsible abstract thinking principles mental management apply practically many aspects real world particularly areas education individual development develop mental management processes education necessary knowledge skills methods techniques taught students order help understand minds work help discover ways work minds efficiently education teachings carried
