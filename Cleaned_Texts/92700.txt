denervation loss nerve supply regardless cause nerves lost denervation part neuronal communication specific function body altered loss physiological functioning denervation caused injury symptom disorder like postpolio additionally useful surgical technique alleviate major negative symptoms renal denervation denervation many harmful side effects increased risk infection tissue loss nerve supply caused injury disorders result surgical procedure denervation may result nerve injury three main types nerve injury neurapraxia axonotmesis neurotmesis three types distinguish severity nerve

denervation processes strong association symptoms seen postpolio syndrome post polio syndrome undergoing constant process denervation reinnervation process occurs acute poliomyelitis leads increased motor unit areas time motor unit areas soon increase point reinnervation longer possible causing uncompensated denervation motor units leads muscle atrophy loss muscular strength following acute polio infection diagnosis symptoms fatiguability general weakness pain believed correlated muscle much like postpolio syndrome amyotrophic lateral sclerosis also similar symptoms motor neuron degeneration
