cocktail party effect refers phenomenon wherein brain focuses persons attention particular stimulus usually auditory focus excludes range stimuli conscious awareness partygoer follows single conversation noisy ability widely distributed among humans listeners less easily able portion totality sound detected ears distinct streams subsequently decide streams pertinent excluding proposed persons sensory memory subconsciously parses stimuli identifies discrete portions sensations according allows people tune effortlessly single voice tuning others phenomenon often described selective attention selective hearing may also describe similar phenomenon occurs one may immediately detect words importance originating unattended stimuli instance hearing ones name among wide range auditory person lacks ability segregate stimuli way often said display cocktail party cocktail party may also described auditory processing disorder kingkopetzky syndrome auditory attention regards cocktail party effect primarily occurs left hemisphere superior temporal gyrus nonprimary region auditory cortex frontoparietal network involving inferior frontal gyrus superior parietal sulcus intraparietal sulcus also accounts acts attentionshifting speech processing attention target stream important information attended competinginterfering streams processed pathway within left hemisphere fmri scans show target streams treated attention competing furthermore activity superior temporal gyrus stg toward target stream decreasedinterfered competing stimuli streams typically hold significant value arise cocktail party effect ability detect significant stimuli multitalker situations also labeled cocktail party problem ability selectively attend simultaneously interferes effectiveness attention neurological cocktail party effect works best binaural effect requires hearing ears people one functioning ear seem much distracted interfering noise people two typical benefit using two ears may partially related localization sound sources auditory system able localize least two sound sources assign correct characteristics sources simultaneously soon auditory system localized sound source extract signals sound source mixture interfering sound however much binaural benefit attributed two processes betterear listening binaural betterear listening process exploiting better two signaltonoise ratios available ears binaural unmasking process involves combination information two ears order extract signals noise early much early attention research traced problems faced air traffic controllers time controllers received messages pilots loudspeakers control tower hearing intermixed voices many pilots single loudspeaker made controllers task effect first defined named cocktail party problem colin cherry cherry conducted attention experiments participants listened two different messages single loudspeaker time tried separate later termed dichotic listening work reveals ability separate sounds background noise affected many variables sex speaker direction sound coming pitch rate cherry developed shadowing task order study people selectively attend one message amid voices noises shadowing task participants wear special headset presents different message ear participant asked repeat aloud message called shadowing heard specified ear called cherry found participants able detect name unattended channel channel later research using cherrys shadowing task done neville moray able conclude almost none rejected message able penetrate block set except subjectively important selective attention shows across ages starting infancy babies begin turn heads toward sound familiar parents shows infants selectively attend specific stimuli environment furthermore reviews selective attention indicate infants favor baby talk speech adult preference indicates infants recognize physical changes tone speech however accuracy noticing physical differences like tone amid background noise improves infants may simply ignore stimuli something like name familiar holds higher meaning young age however research suggests likely scenario infants understand noise presented amidst distracting noise name thus ability filter unattended stimuli reaches prime young adulthood reference cocktail party phenomenon older adults harder time younger adults focusing one conversation competing stimuli like subjectively important messages make background examples messages catch peoples attention include personal names taboo words ability selectively attend ones name found infants young months age appears fully developed along multiple experts field anne treisman states people permanently primed detect personally significant words like names theorizes may require less perceptual information words trigger another stimulus reaches level semantic processing unattended channel taboo words often contain sexually explicit material cause alert system people leads decreased performance shadowing taboo words affect children selective attention develop strong vocabulary understanding language selective attention begins waver get older older adults longer latency periods discriminating conversation streams typically attributed fact general cognitive ability begins decay old age exemplified memory visual perception higher order functioning even recently modern neuroscience techniques applied study cocktail party problem notable examples researchers work include edward chang nima mesgarani charles schroeder using electrocorticography jonathan simon

electroencephalography jyrki ahveninen lee miller using functional magnetic resonance imaging information presented us processed theory selection pay attention random example driving drivers able focus traffic lights rather stimuli present scene cases mandatory select portion presented stimuli important basic question psychology selection issue developed early versus late selection controversy basis controversy found cherry dichotic listening experiments participants able notice physical changes like pitch change gender speaker stimuli like name unattended channel brought question whether meaning semantics unattended message processed early selection attention model little information processed selection occurs late selection attention models information like semantics processed selection earliest work exploring mechanisms early selective attention performed donald broadbent proposed theory came known filter model established using dichotic listening task research showed participants accurate recalling information actively attended far less accurate recalling information attended led broadbent conclusion must filter mechanism brain could block information selectively attended filter model hypothesized work following way information enters brain sensory organs case ears stored sensory memory buffer memory system hosts incoming stream information long enough us pay attention information processed filter mechanism allows attended information pass selected attention passed working memory set mechanisms underlies shortterm memory communicates longterm model auditory information selectively attended basis physical characteristics location others suggest information attended basis gestalt features including continuity broadbent explained mechanism people choose attend one source information time excluding others however broadbents model failed account observation words semantic importance example individuals name instantly attended despite unattended channel shortly broadbents experiments oxford undergraduates gray wedderburn repeated dichotic listening tasks altered monosyllabic words could form meaningful phrases except words divided across example words dear one jane sometimes presented sequence right ear words three aunt six presented simultaneous competing sequence left ear participants likely remember dear aunt jane remember numbers also likely remember words phrase order remember numbers order presented finding goes broadbents theory complete filtration filter mechanism would time switch channels suggests meaning may processed first later addition existing theory selective attention anne treisman developed attenuation model information processed filter mechanism completely blocked broadbent might suggest instead information weakened attenuated allowing pass stages processing unconscious level treisman also suggested threshold mechanism whereby words basis semantic importance may grab ones attention unattended stream ones name according treisman low threshold value ie high level meaning thus recognized easily principle applies words like fire directing attention situations may immediately require way happen treisman argued information processed continuously unattended stream diana deutsch best known work music perception auditory illusions also made important contributions models attention order explain detail words attended basis semantic importance deutsch proposed model attention includes second selection mechanism based meaning came known deutschnorman model information unattended stream processed way working memory treismans model would imply instead information unattended stream passed secondary filter pattern recognition unattended information recognized deemed unimportant secondary filter prevented entering working memory way immediately important information unattended channel come awareness daniel kahneman also proposed model attention differs previous models describes attention terms selection terms capacity kahneman attention resource distributed among various proposition received model describes attention focused focused according kahneman attention generally determined arousal general state physiological activity yerkesdodson law predicts arousal optimal moderate levels performance poor one underaroused particular relevance narayan et al discovered sharp decline ability discriminate auditory stimuli background noises numerous complex evidence negative effect overarousal thus arousal determines available capacity attention allocation policy acts distribute available attention among variety possible activities deemed important allocation policy attention given allocation policy affected enduring dispositions automatic influences attention momentary intentions conscious decision attend something momentary intentions requiring focused direction attention rely substantially attention resources enduring additionally ongoing evaluation particular demands certain activities attention say activities particularly taxing attention resources lower attention capacity influence allocation policy case activity draining capacity allocation policy likely cease directing resources instead focus less taxing tasks kahnemans model explains cocktail party phenomenon momentary intentions might allow one expressly focus particular auditory stimulus enduring dispositions include new events perhaps words particular semantic importance capture attention important note kahnemans model doesnt necessarily contradict selection models thus used supplement research demonstrated cocktail party effect may simply auditory phenomenon relevant effects obtained testing visual information well example shapiro et al able demonstrate name effect visual tasks subjects able easily recognize names presented unattended adopted position line late selection models attention treisman deutschnorman models suggesting early selection would account
