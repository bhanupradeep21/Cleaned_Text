molecular biology protein aggregation phenomenon intrinsicallydisordered misfolded proteins aggregate ie accumulate clump together either intra protein aggregates implicated wide variety diseases known amyloidoses including als alzheimers parkinsons prion synthesis proteins typically fold particular threedimensional conformation thermodynamically favorable native folding process driven hydrophobic effect tendency hydrophobic waterfearing portions protein shield hydrophilic waterloving environment cell burying interior protein thus exterior protein typically hydrophilic whereas interior typically hydrophobic protein structures stabilized noncovalent interactions disulfide bonds two cysteine residues noncovalent interactions include ionic interactions weak van der waals interactions ionic interactions form anion cation form salt bridges help stabilize protein van der waals interactions include nonpolar interactions ie london dispersion force polar interactions ie hydrogen bonds dipoledipole bond play important role proteins secondary structure forming alpha helix beta sheet tertiary structure interactions amino acid residues specific protein important proteins final structure changes noncovalent interactions may happen change amino acid sequence protein susceptible misfolding unfolding cases cell assist protein refolding degrade unfolded protein unfoldedmisfolded protein may aggregate exposed hydrophobic portions protein may interact exposed hydrophobic patches three main types protein aggregates may form amorphous aggregates oligomers amyloid protein aggregation occur due variety causes four classes causes categorized detailed mutations occur dna sequence may may affect amino acid sequence protein sequence affected different amino acid may change interactions side chains affect folding protein lead exposed hydrophobic regions protein aggregate misfoldedunfolded protein different addition mutations affected proteins protein aggregation could also caused indirectly mutations proteins regulatory pathways refolding pathway molecular chaperones ubiquitinproteasome pathway ubiquitin chaperones help protein refolding providing safe environment protein fold ubiquitin ligases target proteins degradation ubiquitin protein aggregation caused problems occur transcription translation transcription dna copied mrna forming strand premrna undergoes rna processing form translation ribosomes trna help translate mrna sequence amino acid problems arise either step making incorrect mrna strand andor incorrect amino acid sequence cause protein misfold leading protein aggregationcitation needed environmental stresses extreme temperatures ph oxidative stress also lead protein one disease cryoglobulinemia extreme temperatures weaken destabilize noncovalent interactions amino acid residues phs outside proteins ph range change protonation state amino acids increase decrease noncovalent interactions also lead less stable interactions result protein unfolding oxidative stress caused radicals reactive oxygen species ros unstable radicals attack amino acid residues leading oxidation side chains eg aromatic side chains methionine side chains andor cleavage polypeptide affect noncovalent interactions hold protein together correctly cause protein destabilization may cause protein cells mechanisms refold degrade
