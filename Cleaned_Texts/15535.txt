shortly opening first complex severe cases chronic obstructive pulmonary disease chronic bronchitis pulmonary emphysema bronchial asthma rose quickly among local inhabitants particularly isozu shiohama districts closest factories among males chronic symptoms included sore symptoms showed relief affected people left areas high air pollution isozu village affected population exhibiting study

rate bronchial asthma chronic bronchitis cases study mie university japan found significant correlation number yokkaichi asthma patients decrease expected grain yield may september summer clinical cases yokkaichi asthma began establishment oil refinery petroleum chemical plants complaints citizens offensive odors spurred investigation initially suspected sources odors included hydrogen sulfide methylmercaptan aldehydes substances found leaking however sulfur dioxide emitted combustion high sulfur content oil typically attributed cause disease since beginning despite common belief main source asthma investigating sulfur dioxide sulfur trioxide levels yokkaichi analyzing compound toxicity levels study conducted yokohama national university concluded respiratory diseases result sulfur dioxide rather due titanium oxide manufacturing plant venting concentrated sulfuric acid mists downwind onto populated urban areas high concentration yokkaichi asthma patients isozu village farther accounted conclusion source sulfur trioxide emissions kilometers south affected study several researchers environmental management journal confirmed analyzing effects humans likely real cause asthma
