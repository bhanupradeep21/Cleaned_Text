methylcholanthrene highly carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon produced burning organic compounds high temperaturesclarification needed methylcholanthrene also known iupac name short notation often used mca compound forms pale yellow solid crystals crystallized benzene melting point around boiling point around pressure methylcholanthrene used laboratory studies chemical carcinogenesis alkylated derivative benzaanthracene similar uv spectrum common isomer although methyl group occur places known carcinogen builds prostate due cholesterol breakdown implicated prostate cancercitation needed readily produces primary sarcomas first article methylcholanthrene published described synthesis compound many years later became clear compound toxic properties humans animals therefore lot interest shown compound used often toxicological research methylcholanthrene often tested mice rats derive information cancer medicine development due influence compound central nervous system responses change response compared also known due genetic mutations compound causes cancer cells last article appeared synthesis methylcholanthrene yield reached therefore adjustments made synthesis

reducing product hydriodic acid propionic acid resulted inhibitory function dimethylnitrosamine demethylase process rat livers inhibition could happen interfering demethylase conformations interfering synthesis andor degradation demethylase experiments showed km doesnt change treatment strongly indicates enzyme affinity influenced instead incubation leads decrease amount enzyme activity results point towards inhibition demethylase synthesis andor induction demetylase degradation unpublished observations venkatesan argus arcos suggest demethylase synthesis inhibition possible mechanism
