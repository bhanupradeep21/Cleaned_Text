chlorthalidone hydrochlorothiazide used create mild hypovolemia encourages salt water uptake proximal tubule thus improve nephrogenic diabetes amiloride additional benefit blocking na uptake thiazide diuretics sometimes combined amiloride prevent hypokalemia caused thiazides seems paradoxical treat extreme diuresis diuretic exact mechanism action unknown thiazide diuretics decrease distal
