existence allpowerful allknowing wholly good plantinga proposed freewill defense volume edited max black attempts refute logical problem evil argument existence evil logically incompatible existence omnipotent omniscient wholly good plantingas argument truncated form states possible god even omnipotent could create world free creatures never choose evil furthermore possible god even omnibenevolent would desire create world contains evil moral goodness requires free moral however arguments handling natural evil disputed according internet encyclopedia philosophy argument also conflicts important theistic doctrines notion heaven free saved souls reside without evil idea god free yet wholly good critics thus maintain take doctrines christians usually god could created free

plantingas contributions epistemology include argument dubs reformed epistemology according reformed epistemology belief god rational justified even without arguments evidence existence god

perhaps possible evolution undirected god anyone else somehow furnished us design paradigm case design plan like technological product designed human like radio wheel ultimately plantinga argues epistemological naturalism ie epistemology holds warrant dependent natural best supported supernaturalist case belief creator god designer laid design plan includes cognitive faculties conducive

evolutionaryetiological account provided ruth millikan dispositional view held john bigelow robert plantinga also discusses evolutionary argument naturalism later chapters warrant proper third book trilogy warranted christian belief published volume plantingas warrant theory basis theological end providing philosophical basis christian belief argument christian theistic belief enjoy warrant book develops two models beliefs ac aquinascalvin model extended ac model former attempts show belief god justified warranted rational extended model tries show specifically christian theological beliefs including trinity incarnation resurrection christ atonement salvation etc model christians justified beliefs work holy spirit bringing beliefs believer james beilby argued purpose plantingas warrant trilogy specifically warranted christian belief firstly make form argument religion argument whether christianity true skeptic would shoulder formidable task demonstrating falsity christian rather simply dismiss irrational addition plantinga attempting provide philosophical explanation christians think christian belief plantinga expressed modal logic version ontological argument uses modal logic develop rigorous formal way norman malcolms charles hartshornes modal ontological arguments plantinga criticized malcolms hartshornes arguments offered argued malcolm prove necessary existence greatest possible follows exists worlds whose greatness worlds surpassed argued demonstrate unsurpassed greatness attempt resolve problem plantinga differentiated greatness excellence beings excellence particular world depends properties world beings greatness depends properties worlds therefore greatest possible must maximal excellence every possible world plantinga restated malcolms argument using concept maximal greatness argued possible maximal greatness exist maximal greatness exists possible world case maximal greatness exists every world therefore conclusion relies form modal axiom states something possibly true possibility necessary possibly true worlds plantingas version suggests say p possibly necessarily true say regard one world true worlds case true worlds simply version argument plantinga argued although first premise rationally established contrary reason michael martin argued certain components perfection contradictory omnipotence omniscience first premise contrary reason martin also proposed parodies argument suggesting existence anything demonstrated plantingas argument provided defined perfect special every possible another christian philosopher william lane craig characterizes plantingas argument slightly different way according craig premises relatively uncontroversial among philosophers epistemic entertainability premise denial guarantee metaphysical furthermore richard gale argued premise three possibility premise begs question stated one epistemic right accept premise one understands nested modal operators one understands within system argument one understands possibly necessarily essence thus premise begs question conclusion embedded within systems general james garson writes words necessarily possibly many different uses acceptability axioms modal logic depends uses plantingas evolutionary argument naturalism argues evolution true undermines naturalism basic argument evolution naturalism true human cognitive faculties evolved produce beliefs survival value maximizing ones success four fs feeding fleeing fighting reproducing necessarily produce beliefs true thus since human cognitive faculties tuned survival rather truth naturalismevolution model reason doubt veracity products faculties including naturalism evolution hand god created man image way evolutionary process means plantinga argues faculties would probably reliable argument assume necessary correlation uncorrelation true beliefs survival making contrary fact relatively strong correlation truth human beliefforming apparatus evolved giving survival advantage ought yield truth since true beliefs confer survival advantage plantinga counters may overlap true beliefs beliefs contribute survival two kinds beliefs gives following example man named paul perhaps paul much likes idea eaten sees tiger always runs looking better prospect thinks unlikely tiger sees eat get body parts right place far survival concerned without involving much way true belief perhaps thinks tiger large friendly cuddly pussycat wants pet also believes best way pet run away clearly number beliefdesire systems equally fit given bit argument received favorable notice thomas william lane also criticized seriously flawed example elliott even though alvin plantinga believes god could used darwinian processes create world stands firm philosophical naturalism said interview relationship science religion religion science share common ground might think though science cant prove presupposes past example science cover whole knowledge plantinga participated groups support intelligent design movement member ad hoc origins supported philip e johnsons book darwin trial also provided backcover endorsement johnsons book shows darwinian evolution become fellow defunct prointelligent design international society complexity information presented number intelligent design march article chronicle higher education philosopher science michael ruse labeled plantinga open enthusiast intelligent letter editor plantinga made following response like christian indeed theist believe world created god hence intelligently designed hallmark intelligent design however claim shown scientifically im dubious far see god certainly could used darwinian processes create living world direct wanted go hence evolution imply direction history life implication evolutionary theory unguided evolution idea neither god person taken hand guiding directing orchestrating course evolution scientific theory evolution sensibly enough says nothing one way divine guidance doesnt say evolution divinely guided also doesnt say isnt like almost theist reject unguided evolution contemporary scientific theory evolution philosophical theological say evolution unguided like science general makes pronouncements existence activity attitude proposes elaborates upon conflict really lies science religion naturalism tension religion science two go hand hand actual conflict lies naturalism httpsenwikipediaorgwikialvinplantinga
