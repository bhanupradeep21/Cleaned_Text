finish bottom league division automatically dropped relegated lower level next season replaced teams promoted lower tier either finishing best records winning playoff england season teams birmingham city blackpool west ham united relegated premier league football league championship second level english football replaced top two teams second level queens park rangers norwich city automatic promotion well swansea city welsh club plays english system playoff tournament teams finished third sixth season teams wolverhampton wanderers blackburn bolton relegated championship replaced reading southampton west ham two former teams automatic promotion latter occupied last promotion spot defeated cardiff aggregate semifinals defeated blackpool final wembley stadium system originated england twelve clubs decided create professional football league expanded merging football alliance majority alliance teams occupying lower second division due divergent strengths teams differential overcome next five years winners second division went playoff worst placed team first division promoted top tier first club achieve promotion sheffield united replaced relegated accrington fc relegation often devastating financial consequences club owners lose tv sponsorship gate income may also see asset value shares club collapse leagues offer parachute payment relegated teams following years order protect bankruptcy team promoted back higher tier following year parachute payment second season distributed among teams lower course corresponding bonanza promoted clubs league choose cities teams top division example leeds fourthbiggest city england saw team leeds united relegated premier league championship went without topflight football seasons united returned premier league period united relegated thirdtier league one returned championship city loses premier league clubs relegation continue without club top league local club plays well enough promoted premiership famously french ligue lacked team paris frances capital largest city years likewise berlin clubs bundesliga rare due richer clubs located former west germany well right certain tier club also territorial rights area successful new team geographical location come dominate incumbents munich example tsv m√ºnchen initially successful citys current biggest team bayern current season london teams top four league levels including seven premier league teams clubs may sold privately new owners time happen often clubs based community membership agreement clubs require agreement members unlike shareholders corporations priorities money comes football club tradition local identity similar reasons relocation clubs cities rare mostly virtually cities towns europe football club sort size strength club usually relative towns size importance buying existing topflight club moving new location problematic supporters towns original club unlikely switch allegiance interloper means anyone wanting ownership high ranked club native city must buy local club stands work divisions usually hiring better talent cases existing owners chosen relocate difficult market better facilities realize market value land current stadium built upon famous example relocation wimbledon fc milton keynes us team relocations controversial supporters club protest loss leagues around world generally follow one systems variation sport leagues australia similar north american model using postseason playoffs relegation without geographical divisions notable examples australian football league aussie rules national rugby league rugby league nippon professional baseball japan uses north american system due american influence game cricket indian premier league launched also operates system super league top level rugby league united kingdom france included canadian team several years run franchise basis returned promotionrelegation model season another example franchised league european sport ice hockeys kontinental hockey league centered mainly russia teams also located belarus china kazakhstan rugby union also europeanbased franchised league united rugby championship historically celtic league founded teams celtic nations ireland scotland wales later added teams outside nations first italy south africa promotionrelegation system widely used football around world notably africa latin america well europe notable variation developed latin america many countries two league seasons per year scheduling allows many latin american nations lack national cup competition another notable variation brazilian system two parallel league systems separate promotion relegation one national another statelevel teams play leagues year european model also used europe even sports founded america showing league system adopted determined sport tradition sports organization region sports basketball spain lithuania use promotion relegation vein australias aleague men use pyramid structure normally found football instead follows tradition australian sports franchise model postseason playoff system model better suits country important central locations sport needs ensure team playing risk likewise american franchise model used rugby unions super rugby features noneuropean franchises australia new zealand five franchises one franchise represents fiji currently plays home games australia one franchise represents pacific islands whole mainly samoa tonga based new zealand super rugby also formerly featured franchises south africa japan argentina east asia places japan china south korea taiwan particular differentiation among leagues european sports football rugby use promotion relegation american sports baseball basketball use franchising minor leagues differences varying country country similar situation exists countries central america caribbean football baseball share several close markets major factor development north american closed membership system century distances cities teams separated half north american continent resulting high traveling costs national league professional base ball clubs established founders judged order prosper must make baseballs highest level competition closed shop strict limit number teams member exclusive local rights guarantee place league year year would permit club owner monopolize fan bases respective exclusive territories give confidence invest infrastructure improved ballparks turn would guarantee revenues needed support traveling across contrast shorter distances urban areas england allowed clubs develop large fan bases without incurring travel costs north america football league known english football league founded intended rival football association rather top competition within new league universally accepted englands topcalibre competition right away help win fans clubs outside football league system established worst teams end season would need win reelection clubs wishing join rival league football alliance formed two merged equal terms rather alliance clubs put new football league second division whose best teams would move first division place worst teams another merger top division southern league helped form third division similar fashion firmly establishing principle promotion httpsenwikipediaorgwikiprofessionalsportsleagueorganization
