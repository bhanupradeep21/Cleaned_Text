human mitochondrial molecular clock rate mutations accumulating mitochondrial genome hominids course human evolution archeological record human activity early periods human prehistory relatively limited interpretation controversial uncertainties archeological record scientists turned molecular dating techniques order refine timeline human evolution major goal scientists field develop accurate hominid mitochondrial molecular clock could used confidently date events occurred course human evolution estimates mutation rate human mitochondrial dna mtdna vary greatly depending available data method used estimation two main methods estimation phylogenybased methods pedigreebased methods produced mutation rates differ almost order magnitude current research focused resolving high variability obtained different rate estimates major assumption molecular clock theory mutations within particular genetic system occur statistically uniform rate uniform rate used dating genetic events practice assumption single uniform rate oversimplification though single mutation rate often applied often composite average several different mutation many factors influence observed mutation rates factors include type samples region genome studied time period covered rate mutations occur reproduction germline mutation rate thought higher observed mutation rates mutations successfully passed subsequent mtdna passed along matrilineal line therefore mutations passed sons lost random genetic drift may also cause loss mutations reasons actual mutation rate equivalent mutation rate observed population population dynamics believed influence observed mutation rates population expanding germline mutations preserved population result observed mutation rates tend increase expanding population populations contract population bottleneck germline mutations lost population bottlenecks thus tend slow observed mutation rates since emergence species homo sapiens years ago human population expanded thousand individuals living africa billion world however expansion uniform history human populations may consist bottlenecks mutation rate across mitochondrial genome uniformly distributed certain regions genome known mutate rapidly others hypervariable regions known highly polymorphic relative parts genome rate mutations accumulate coding noncoding regions genome also differs mutations coding region subject purifying selection reason studies avoid coding region nonsynonymous mutations calibrating molecular clock loogvali et al consider synonymous mutations recalibrated molecular clock human mtdna years per synonymous mutation mitochondrial soares et al consider coding noncoding region mutations arrive single mutation rate apply correction factor account selection coding region mutation rate observed vary time mutation rates within human species faster observed along humanape lineage mutation rate also thought faster recent times since beginning holocene years parallel mutation sometimes referred homoplasy convergent evolution occurs separate lineages mutation independently occur site genome saturation occurs single site experiences multiple mutations parallel mutations saturation result underestimation mutation rate likely individuals affected heteroplasmy mixture mtdna types new mutations without new mutations may may passed subsequent generations thus presence heteroplasmic individuals sample may complicate calculation mutation pedigree methods estimate mutation rate comparing mtdna sequences sample parentoffspring pairs analyzing

reconstructing haplotype recent common ancestor mrca sample two genetic lineages requirement time recent common ancestor tmrca sample lineages must already known independent sources usually archeological record average number mutations accumulated since mrca computed divided tmrca arrive mutation rate human mutation rate usually estimated comparing sequences modern humans chimpanzees reconstructing ancestral haplotype chimpanzeehuman common ancestor according paleontological record last common ancestor humans may lived around million years rates obtained pedigree methods times faster obtained phylogenetic methods several factors acting together may responsible difference pedigree methods record mutations living subjects mutation rates pedigree studies closer germline mutation rate pedigree studies use genealogies generations deep whereas phylogeny based methods use timescales thousands millions years deep according henn et al phylogeny based methods take account events occur long time scales thus less affected stochastic fluctuations howell et al suggests selection saturation parallel mutations genetic drift responsible differences observed pedigree based

direction tchlca error two major reasons method widely employed first pedigree based rates inappropriate estimates long periods time second archaeology anchored rates represent intermediate range archaeological evidence human colonization often occurs well colonization example colonization eurasia west east believed occurred along indian ocean however oldest archaeological sites also

high site saturation occurs direct chimpanzee human comparisons consequently study used transversions evolve slower rate common transition polymorphisms comparing chimp human mitogenomes noted transversions within hvr regions however made correction saturation hvr sequence obtained following study noted dinucleotide site experienced numerous transversions parsimony analysis many considered sequencing errors however sequencing feldhofer neanderthal revealed also transversion humans neanderthals addition soares et al noted three sites recurrent transversions occurred human lineages two hvr occurrences occurrencesnote therefore transversions underestimate likely number transversion events year study also used transitiontotransversion ratio study old world monkeys needed however examination chimp gorilla hvr reveals rate lower examination humans places rate therefore study underestimated level sequence divergence chimpanzee human estimated sequence divergence includes transversions significantly lower per site suggested soares et al two errors would result overestimate human mitochondrial tmrca however failed detect basal lineage analysis also failed detect
