cecidomyiidae family flies known gall midges gall gnats name implies larvae gall midges feed within plant tissue creating abnormal plant growths called galls cecidomyiidae fragile small insects usually mm length many less mm long characterised hairy wings unusual order diptera long antennae cecidomyiids also known strange phenomenon paedogenesis larval stage reproduces without maturing species daughter larvae consume mother others reproduction occurs later egg species genera described worldwide though certainly underestimate actual diversity dna metabarcoding study published

component insect diversity comprising species cecidomyiidae minute small mm rarely larger mm wing length mm flies delicate appearance except genera reduced wings eyes holoptic mouthparts reduced cecidomyiid antennae notably long segments sometimes fewer genera antennal segments either consist basal thickening petiole binodal proximal node intermediate petiole distal node basal medial apical whorls hairs occur antennal segments species whorls loopshaped sensory filaments also found basal medial one sometimes reduced gall flies one basal whorl hairs antennal segments sensoria transparent sensory appendages differ size shape filaments threadlike porricondylinae cecidomyiinae take form long loops supertribe cecidomyiidi ocelli present lestremiinae wings usually clear rarely patterned wing bears microtrichia often scales species macrotrichia number longitudinal veins reduced veins well developed species medial veins developed primitive groups costa usually break beyond vein legs long slender without apical bristles gall midge larvae many adults orange yellow color due cecidomyiidae among animals synthesize carotenoids unknown degree de novo biosynthesis carotenoids accounts characteristic color opposed dietary sequestration genes responsible carotenoid synthesis likely originate horizontal gene transfer fungal catochini wing veins cecidomyiinae wing veins lasiopterini

evolutionary sense gall flies often sclerotized parameres less transparent plate tegmen located theaedeagusthe tegmen higher gall flies parameres tegmen developed instead close aedeagus triangular basal outgrowth gonocoxites called gonosterna supporting structures called apodema located near base genitalia males often equipped two outgrowths ovipositor short lamelliform long mobile species
