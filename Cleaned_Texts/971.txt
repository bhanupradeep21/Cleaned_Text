mustard gas sulfur mustard several chemical compounds contain chemical structure wider sense compounds substituent known sulfur mustards nitrogen mustards respectively x cl br compounds potent alkylating agents interfere several biological processes also known mustard agents family compounds infamous cytotoxic blister agents long history use chemical weapons name mustard gas technically incorrect substances dispersed often gases fine mist liquid sulfur mustards viscous liquids room temperature odor resembling mustard plants garlic horseradish hence pure colorless used impure forms warfare usually yellowbrown mustard gases form blisters exposed skin lungs often resulting prolonged illness ending death typical mustard gas organosulfur compound called sulfur mustard type chemical

mustard agents rarely suffer immediate symptoms contaminated areas may appear completely normal victims unknowingly receive high doses within hours exposure victims experience intense itching skin irritation irritation goes untreated blisters filled yellow fluid pus start form wherever agent contacted skin chemical burns debilitating mustard gases easily penetrate clothing fabrics wool cotton exposed skin gets burned victims eyes exposed become sore starting conjunctivitis also known pink eye eyelids swell resulting temporary blindness extreme ocular exposure mustard gas vapors may result corneal ulceration anterior chamber scarring severe infrequent cases corneal transplantation used treatment miosis pupil constricts usual may also occur probably result cholinomimetic activity high concentrations inhaled mustard agents cause bleeding blistering within respiratory system damaging mucous membranes causing pulmonary edema depending level contamination mustard agent burns vary first second degree burns though also every bit severe disfiguring dangerous third degree burns severe ie covering victims skin often fatal death occurring days weeks mild moderate exposure mustard gases unlikely kill though victims still require lengthy periods medical treatment convalescence recovery complete mustard gases carcinogenic mutagenic effects mean victims even fully recover increased risk
