neurectomy nerve resection neurosurgical procedure peripheral nerve cut removed alleviate neuropathic pain permanently disable function nerve nerve intended grow back chronic pain may alternative failed nerve decompression target nerve motor function numbness neurectomies also used permanently block autonomic function eg excessive sweating involuntary muscle movement causing special sensory function related pain eg vestibular nerve dysfunction causing temporary nerve block anesthetic usually performed surgery confirm diagnosis neuropathic risks include numbness neuroma complications due lack innervation presacral neurectomy typically conducted decrease severe pain menstrual cramps lower abdomen pain region difficult treat noninvasive treatments endometriosis common cause severe pain one solution doctors often mistakenly recommend cure hysterectomy removal uterus however often relieve endometriosis pain disease left behind organs bladder bowels pelvic side walls thrive hormone supply another perform presacral neurectomy procedure interrupts nerves going towards andor around pain located either side lower abdomen mid line treated neurectomy individuals pain relieved use nsaids consider procedure techniques developed procedure performed incision typically directly navel normally three small holes made lower abdomen allow instruments various surgical tools nerve tissue runs uterus interrupted sacral promontory point spine tailbones meet best area access obtain clear view nerves uterus proper precautions must taken avoid unnecessary complications major blood vessels surrounding uterus complications postoperation include urinary retention well constipation neither reported cause lasting recent technological advances allowed procedure done robotically minimally invasive technique similar laparoscopy outcome procedure identical open approach laparotomy incisions much smaller allowing less postoperation pain less pain following surgery allows quicker recovery period two weeks opposed six weeks vestibular neurectomy operation severs vestibular nerve contributes balance sparing cochlear nerve contributes hearing procedure potential relieve vertigo may preserve ability important note procedure reverse effects deafness risks include hearing loss tinnitus dizziness facial weakness spinal fluid leak various several different surgical approaches used complete procedure middle cranial fossa retrolabrynthine retrosigmoid middle cranial fossa approach one often requires neurosurgical expertise advantage procedure vestibular nerve clearly visible sectioned without harming cochlear nerve general procedure begins positioning patient supine head turned side surgical ear upright incision made lower portion zygomatic root area temporal region

procedure done worseoff ear procedures done ears risk hearing loss becomes significantly ablations previously performed laparoscopically also offered via pulsed radiofrequency technique pulsed radiofrequency ablation relies delivering electrical field specifically neural tissue order damage minimizing injury surrounding area example technique used patients chronic shoulder pain way perform neurectomy suprascapular nerve less risk damage nearby muscles within rotator still lack evidence directly comparing efficacy safety technique compared traditional laparoscopic method evidence

incisions may inadvertently cause injury scarring entrapping cutaneous common tradeoff electing neurectomy numbness along nerve distribution expected studies measured bothersome numbness patients found patients bothered numbness ones find numbness minimally intercoastal neuralgia neuropathic condition involves intercoastal nerves primary symptom pain may localized distribution one intercoastal nerves manifesting chest abdominal treatment modality prior neurectomy eg systemic medications cryoablation therapeutic nerve blocks radioablation given effective pain relief none success outcome typically measured decrease visual analog scale vas scores numerical pain scores success rates often reported studies reporting intercoastal neurectomy often report cure rates reduction symptoms even
