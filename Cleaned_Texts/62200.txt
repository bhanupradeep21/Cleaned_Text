tick paralysis type paralysis caused specific types attached ticks unlike tickborne diseases caused infectious organisms illness caused neurotoxin produced ticks salivary gland prolonged attachment engorged tick transmits toxin host incidence tick paralysis unknown patients experience severe respiratory distress similar anaphylaxis tick paralysis results injection toxin tick salivary glands blood meal toxin causes symptoms within days beginning weakness legs progresses paralysis paralysis ascends trunk arms head within hours may lead respiratory failure death disease present acute ataxia without muscle weaknesscitation needed patients may report minor sensory symptoms local numbness constitutional signs usually absent deep tendon reflexes usually decreased absent ophthalmoplegia bulbar palsy occurcitation needed electromyographic emg studies usually show variable reduction amplitude compound muscle action potentials abnormalities repetitive nerve stimulation studies appear result failure acetylcholine release motor nerve terminal level may subtle abnormalities motor nerve conduction velocity sensory action potentialscitation needed tick paralysis believed due toxins found ticks saliva enter bloodstream tick feeding two ticks commonly associated north american tick paralysis rocky mountain wood tick dermacentor andersoni american dog tick dermacentor variabilis however tick species implicated human disease around north american cases tick paralysis occur april june adult dermacentor ticks emerge hibernation actively seek australia tick paralysis caused tick ixodes holocyclus prior fatal cases reported although tick paralysis concern domestic animals livestock united states well human cases rare usually occur children age needed tick paralysis occurs engorged gravid eggladen female tick produces neurotoxin salivary glands transmits host feeding experiments indicated greatest amount toxin produced fifth seventh day attachment often initiating increasing severity symptoms although timing may vary depending species tickcitation needed unlike lyme disease ehrlichiosis babesiosis caused systemic proliferation expansion microbes offending tick gone tick paralysis chemically induced tick therefore usually continues presence tick removed symptoms usually diminish rapidly however cases profound paralysis develop even become fatal anyone becomes aware ticks presencecitation needed diagnosis based symptoms upon finding embedded tick usually scalpcitation needed absence tick differential diagnosis includes syndrome early signs tick poisoning could change animals voice weakness back legs vomitingcitation needed human vaccine currently available tickborne disease except tickborne encephalitis individuals therefore take precautions entering tickinfested areas particularly spring summer months preventive measures include avoiding trails overgrown bushy vegetation wearing lightcoloured clothes allow one see ticks easily wearing long pants closedtoe shoes tick repellents containing deet nn diethylmtoluamide marginally effective applied skin clothing rarely severe reactions occur people use deetcontaining products young children may especially vulnerable adverse effects permethrin applied clothing much effective preventing tick bites permethrin repellent rather insecticide causes ticks curl fall protected clothingweasel words removal offending tick usually results resolution symptoms within several hours days tick removed toxin fatal study children reported mortality rates mostly due respiratory paralysis tick best removed grasping close skin possible pulling firm steady toxin lies ticks salivary glands care must taken remove entire tick including head symptoms may persist important note unlike toxin tick species toxin ixodes holocyclus australian paralysis tick may still fatal even tick removed affected animals food water intake worsen outcome toxin prevent animal swallowing properly people find tick animal advised remove immediately seek veterinary assistance animal shows signs illness tick placed tightly sealed plastic bag taken veterinarian although several attempts made isolate identify neurotoxin since first isolation exact structure toxin still kda protein fraction contains neurotoxin structure gene least tick species ixodes holocyclus since identified called holocyclotoxins species least three members trigger paralysis presynaptic inhibition neurotransmitter release via calcium dependent mechanism resulting reduction quantal content loss effective
