mucus ˈmjuːkəs mewkəs slippery aqueous secretion produced covering mucous membranes typically produced cells found mucous glands although may also originate mixed glands contain serous mucous cells viscous colloid containing inorganic salts antimicrobial enzymes lysozymes immunoglobulins especially iga glycoproteins mucins produced goblet cells mucous membranes submucosal glands mucus serves protect epithelial cells linings respiratory digestive urogenital systems structures visual auditory systems pathogenic fungi viruses mucus body produced gastrointestinal tract amphibians fish snails slugs invertebrates also produce external mucus epidermis protection pathogens help movement also produced fish line gills plants produce similar substance called mucilage also produced human respiratory system mucus part airway surface liquid asl also known epithelial lining fluid elf lines respiratory tract airway surface liquid consists sol layer termed periciliary liquid layer overlying gel layer termed mucus layer periciliary liquid layer named surrounds cilia lies top surface periciliary liquid layer surrounding cilia consists gel meshwork celltethered mucins mucus blanket aids protection lungs trapping foreign particles enter particular nose normal mucus made fluid component around water mucin secretions goblet cells submucosal glands glycoproteins proteoglycans lipids proteins major mucins secreted large polymers give mucus rheologic viscoelastic main gelforming mucin secreted goblet cells form threads thin sheets polymeric protein secreted submucosal glands goblet cells form trachea bronchi lining mucus produced specialized airway epithelial cells called goblet cells submucosal glands small particles dust particulate pollutants allergens well infectious agents bacteria caught viscous nasal airway mucus prevented entering system process together continual movement cilia respiratory epithelium toward oropharynx mucociliary clearance helps prevent foreign objects entering lungs breathing explains coughing often occurs smoke cigarettes bodys natural reaction increase mucus production addition mucus aids moisturizing inhaled air prevents tissues nasal airway epithelia drying mucus produced continuously respiratory tract mucociliary action carries nasal passages rest tract pharynx swallowed subconsciously sometimes times respiratory illness inflammation mucus become thickened cell debris bacteria inflammatory cells known phlegm may coughed sputum clear increased mucus production upper respiratory tract symptom many common ailments common cold influenza nasal mucus may removed blowing nose using nasal irrigation excess nasal mucus cold allergies due vascular engorgement associated vasodilation increased capillary permeability caused may treated cautiously decongestant medications thickening mucus rebound effect following overuse decongestants may produce nasal sinus drainage problems circumstances promote infection cold dry seasons mucus lining nasal passages tends dry meaning mucous membranes must work harder producing mucus keep cavity lined result nasal cavity fill mucus time air exhaled water vapor breath condenses warm air meets colder outside temperature near nostrils causes excess amount water build inside nasal cavities cases excess fluid usually spills externally lower respiratory tract impaired mucociliary clearance due conditions primary ciliary dyskinesia may result mucus accumulation dysregulation mucus homeostasis fundamental characteristic cystic fibrosis inherited disease caused mutations cftr gene encodes chloride channel defect leads altered electrolyte composition mucus triggers hyperabsorption dehydration lowvolume viscous acidic mucus reduced antimicrobial function facilitates bacterial thinning mucus layer ultimately affects periciliary liquid layer becomes dehydrated compromising ciliary function impairing mucociliary respiratory therapist recommend airway clearance therapy uses number clearance techniques help clearance lower respiratory tract excessive mucus production bronchi bronchioles known mucus chronic mucus hypersecretion results chronic productive cough chronic generally synonymous excessive mucus narrow airways limit airflow accelerate decline lung human digestive system mucus used lubricant materials must pass membranes eg food passing esophagus mucus extremely important gastrointestinal tract forms essential layer colon small intestine helps reduce intestinal inflammation decreasing bacterial interaction intestinal epithelial layer mucus gastric mucosa lining stomach vital protect stomach lining highly acidic environment within human female reproductive system cervical mucus prevents infection provides lubrication sexual intercourse consistency cervical mucus varies depending stage womans menstrual cycle ovulation cervical mucus clear runny conducive sperm postovulation mucus becomes thicker likely block sperm several fertility awareness methods rely observation cervical mucus one three primary fertility signs identify womans fertile time midpoint cycle awareness womans fertile time allows couple time intercourse improve odds pregnancy also proposed method avoid general nasal mucus clear thin serving filter air inhalation times infection mucus change color yellow green either result trapped due bodys reaction viral infection green color mucus comes heme group ironcontaining enzyme myeloperoxidase secreted white blood cells cytotoxic defense respiratory burst case bacterial infection bacterium becomes trapped alreadyclogged sinuses breeding moist nutrientrich environment sinusitis uncomfortable condition may include congestion mucus bacterial infection sinusitis cause discolored mucus would respond antibiotic treatment viral infections typically resolve without almost sinusitis infections viral antibiotics ineffective recommended treating typical case viral infection cold flu first stage also last stage infection cause production clear thin mucus nose back throat body begins react virus generally one three days mucus thickens may turn yellow green viral infections treated antibiotics major avenue misuse treatment generally symptombased often sufficient allow immune system fight virus obstructive lung diseases often result impaired mucociliary clearance associated mucus hypersecretion sometimes referred mucoobstructive lung techniques airway clearance therapy help clear secretions maintain respiratory health prevent inflammation unique umbilical cord lining epithelial stem cell expresses termed clecmuc shown good potential regeneration mucus able absorb water dehydrate ph variations swelling capacity mucus stems bottlebrush mucin within hydrophilic segments provide large surface area water absorption moreover tunability swelling effect controlled polyelectrolyte effect polymers charged molecules called polyelectrolytes mucins kind polyelectrolyte proteoglycans main component mucus provides polyelectrolyte effect process inducing effect comprises two steps attraction counterions water compensation exposed physiological ionic solution charged groups polyelectrolytes attract counterions opposite charges thereby leading solute concentration gradient osmotic pressure introduced equalize concentration solute throughout system driving water flow low concentration areas high concentration areas short influx outflux water within mucus managed polyelectrolyte effect contribute mucus tunable swelling ionic charges mucin mainly provided acidic amino acids including aspartic acid glutamic acid charges acidic amino acids change environmental ph value due acid dissociation association aspartic acid example negative side chain ph value neutrally charged side chain introduced ph value drops thus number negative charges mucus influenced ph value surrounding environment polyelectrolyte effect mucus largely affected ph value solution due charge variation acidic amino acid residues mucin backbone instance charged residue mucin protonated normal ph value stomach approximately ph case scarcely polyelectrolyte effect thereby causing compact mucus little swelling capacity however kind bacteria helicobacter pylori prone producing base elevate ph value stomach leading deprotonation aspartic acids glutamic acids ie neutral negativecharged negative charges mucus greatly increase thus inducing polyelectrolyte effect swelling mucus swelling effect increases pore size mucus decreases mucus viscosity allows bacteria penetrate migrate mucus cause high selective permeability mucus plays crucial role healthy state human beings limiting penetration molecules nutrients pathogens drugs charge distribution within mucus serves charge selective diffusion barrier thus significantly affecting transportation agents among particles various surface zeta potentials cationic particles tend low depth penetration neutral ones possess medium penetration anionic ones largest penetration depth furthermore effect charge selectivity changes status mucus varies ie native mucus threefold higher potential
