research mental disorder schizophrenia involves multiple animal models tool including preclinical stage drug development several models simulate schizophrenia defects fit four basic categories pharmacological models developmental models lesion models genetic models historically pharmacological druginduced models widely used involve manipulation various neurotransmitter systems including dopamine glutamate serotonin gaba lesion models area animals brain damaged arose theories schizophrenia involves neurodegeneration problems neurodevelopment cause disease traditionally rodent models schizophrenia mostly targeted symptoms analogous positive symptoms schizophrenia models also symptoms similar negative symptoms recent developments schizophrenia research however targeted cognitive
