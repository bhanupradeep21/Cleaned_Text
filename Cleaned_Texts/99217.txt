ovarian follicle activation defined primordial follicles ovary moving quiescent inactive growing phase primordial follicle ovary makes pool follicles induced enter growth developmental changes change preovulatory follicles ready released ovulation process development primordial follicle preovulatory follicle called folliculogenesis activation primordial follicle involves following morphological change flattened cuboidal granulosa cells proliferation granulosa cells formation protective zona pellucida layer growth widely understood androgens act primarily preantral follicles activity important preantral follicle growth additionally thought androgens involved primordial follicle activation however influence androgens primordial follicle recruitment whether response primary secondary still uncertain primordial follicles activated grow antral follicles communication oocytes surrounding somatic cells granulosa cells theca cells involved control primordial follicle activation various activator signalling pathways involved control ovarian follicle activation including neurotropin nerve growth factor ngf tyrosine receptor kinase neurotrophin brainderived neurotrophic factor bdnf receptor additional ligands role facilitating primordial follicle activation transforming growth factorbeta tgfb growth differentiation factor bone morphogenic protein follicular activation rate increased experiments recombinant added additionally vitro addition human ovarian cortical tissue causes enhanced activation follicular survival removing mice knockout
