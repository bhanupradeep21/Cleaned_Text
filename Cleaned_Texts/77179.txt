chignon artificially induced caput succedaneum temporary swelling caused buildup bloody fluid left infants head delivered vacuum extraction vacuum extraction type assistance used vaginal delivery obstetrician midwife second stage labor cervix fully dilated allowing fetus delivery anatomically resembles regular caput succedaneum one two frequently occurring birth injuries head cephalohematoma usually harmless condition blood accumulates newborns scalp vaginal vacuum extraction cup attached infants head exposing infant trauma due vacuum pressure pulling force involved form assisted delivery typically required labor stalled due difficulties stages labor arising infants head found high birth canal due prolonged pressure tension induces accumulation interstitial fluid fluid surrounds cells well possible minor hemorrhages ultimately resulting scalp chignon mistaken bruises similar fetal head traumas relating vacuum chignon begin resolve within hour may take hours completely longterm consequences newborn birth traumas recommended attended vacuum applied infants head tension creates difference pressure atmosphere infants scalp causes soft tissue layers scalp fill inside suction subsequently interstitial fluid small hemorrhages build causing head swell forming localized chignon must formed performing vacuum extraction hard plastic metal cup order effectively adhere infants occurs hard cup spread head like soft takes maximum minutes chignon form vacuum extraction completed within minutes order prevent injury soft cup require chignon form associated less trauma infant despite higher risk cup detachment lead injuries lacerations chignon firm cross suture lines often circular appearance due shape suction swelling may shift side depending position infants chignon caput succedaneum anatomically chignon induced suction cup used vacuum extraction true caput succedaneum natural buildup fluid caused pressure induced infants head passes mothers chignon always involves buildup serosanguinous fluid caput succedaneum involve either serosanguineous hemorrhagic serosanguinous fluid defined fluid collected leaving body containing blood well liquid portion blood clinically caput succedaneum soft uneven depth cm include petechiae small pinpoint red purple spots due bleeding purpura purple rash due blood vessel leakage andor bruised like chignon caput succadaneum usually benign resolve within days unlike chignon caput succedaneum lead complications halo scalp ring form hair loss cases caput succadaneum cause permanent hair loss finally jaundice also known possible complication caput unlike chignon longterm consequences subgaleal hemorrhage severe instance trauma associated vacuum extraction forceps delivery however commonly caused vacuum extraction subgaleal hemorrhage introduced loose connective tissue found within subgaleal space ultimately causing hypovolaemia hypovolemia defined state depleted circulating blood volume fluids issue arises infant loses circulating blood volume leading complications hypovolemic shock anemia subgaleal hemorrhage rare complication considered clinical manifestations subgaleal hemorrhage variable recommended mean time diagnosis typically within hours birth especially infant delivery vacuum delivery prolonged due close monitoring newborn infant prompted minimum eight hour observation infants delivered vacuum extractions forceps subgaleal hemorrhage may initially look like caput succedaneum chignon blood crosses suture lines three however notifiable signs subgaleal hemorrhage include fluctuant scalp swelling lesion crossing suture lines pitting edema continuing head fluid wave subgaleal hemorrhage suspected measures hemoglobin count performed immediately monitored every hours also imaging subgaleal hemorrhage ct mri radiographs skull done order identify notifiable early recognition careful monitoring hypovolemic shock avoided form assisted delivery devices used labor individuals caring child must notified child must regularly examined monitored increasing awareness chignons subgaleal hemorrhages lead earlier identification referral chignon cephalohematoma relatively common birth injuries occur newborns head vacuum delivery cephalohematoma chignon considered pose longterm consequences newborns cephalohematoma occurs live births pressure vaginal delivery fetal head causes blood vessels rupture periosteum membrane layer covering bone exterior leading blood accumulation subperiosteal space space situated chignon may cross suture lines cranial sutures strong tissue naturally found connecting bones skull together boundaries accumulation blood subperiosteal space relatively slow unlike chignon immediately occurs upon use vacuum extraction cephalohematomas arise first one three days cephalohematomas frequently occur delivery infants assigned male birth compared infants assigned female birth however reasons unknown common factors cause cephalohematoma using forceps vacuumassisted delivery methods vaginal delivery large infants primigravida first pregnancy conceived pregnant person infant nonideal position delivery prolonged second stage similar chignon treatment cephalohematoma required body expected reabsorb fluid accumulating subperiosteal space attempting drain aspirate collected fluid may result infection abscess formation therefore chignons essentially normal harmless byproducts vacuumassisted delivery practically cases chignons disappear within couple days postpartum necessitate medical however noted chignons side effects induced vacuumassisted delivery therefore still necessary keep eye healing process event possible prolonged vacuum traction improper cup placement sudden cup detachment factors contributing maternal neonatal complications need considered applying vacuum despite known risks vacuumassisted delivery nowadays tends commonly used birthassisting tool due relatively lower occurrences maternal neonatal complications compared methods using forceps csection tends last resort option due risks significantly greater maternal also developed practices minimize impact vacuumassisted delivery neonatal head method use proper vacuum cup apply pressure rhythmically sync vacuum uterine contractions order expedite delivery process minimize tractioninduced scalpel infants head regularly checked throughout hospital crucial know stop longer delay higher chance maternal neonatal complications communicating updating healthcare personnel key parents caretakers encouraged immediately report
