diabolotherium extinct genus megatheriine ground sloth known late pleistocene unlike extinct mainland sloths seems climber similar extinct sloths caribbean fossils genus found coastal piedra escrita site andean casa del diablo diabolotherium relatively small member megatherioidea though specific phylogenetic position unclear known number individual bones partial skeleton complete skull known yet based fragmentary skull immature individual profile line parietal bones slightly arched likely crest formed adult individuals viewed behind occiput rectangular shape low relatively wide joints cervical vertebrae pointed slightly downwards prominent feature also occurs several extant representatives megalonychidae caribbean islands posterior section zygomatic arch started directly front ear canal temporal bone extremely short positioned angle central axis skull curved slightly downwards front part arch began upper jaw second third tooth lower jaw known fragments two complete specimens far differ size anterior spatulate extension symphysis typical numerous sloths preserved posterior part full length unknown base process outer mental foramen inner one positioned mm front first tooth lower jaw reached greatest height first tooth measured cm became continuously lower towards rear making megatheriidae nothrotheriidaecharacteristic protuberance lower margin lower jaw missing articular process protruded mandibular joint least cm posterior angular process angular majority jaw finds far edentulous structure dentition determined using structure arrangement alveoli dentition typical structure sloth five teeth per half jaw upper four lower jaw total teeth formed teeth closed row molar shape reminiscent megatheriidae differs megalonychids frontmost tooth reshaped like canine due diastema separated posterior teeth shape teeth also showed similarities large megatheria rectangular shape upper jaw square shape lower jaw foremost slightly triangular outline chewing surface teeth found showed two typical transverse ridges length lower row teeth postcranial skeleton fully known atlas narrowed front back three articular surfaces connected following axis contact total ten tail vertebrae handed date elongated narrower transverse processes compared megatheriidae limb bones became long slender compared ground sloths thus resembled todays tree sloths humerus reached cm length shaft made bone ridge crista deltoidea served muscle attachment point particularly strong middle part sloths lower end joint massive construction ulna almost length upper articular process olecranon relatively longer todays tree extinct ground sloths spoke length cm short massive circular shaped head started directly front ulna hand comprised least four digits ii v may inner digit fused parts wrist form bone complex typical large ground sloths metacarpalcarpal complex mcc four formed digits however three ii iv functional noteworthy metacarpal bones almost size whose length cm unusual extinct sloths megatheriidae nothrotheriidae length metacarpals increased significantly second fourth ray terminal phalanges triangular shape longitudinal section indicating claws length last phalanx central ray cm built narrow slightly curved downwards suggests correspondingly shaped claw compared todays tree sloths however seems comparatively shorter posterior musculoskeletal system apart slender iliac bone talus heel bone well individual parts metatarsus hardly bone elements generic name commemorates type location casa del diablo cave specific epithet nordenskioldi refers erland nordenskioldi discoverer holotype already use lucas kraglievich specific epithet nothropus nordenskioldi taxon originally described kraglievich member genus nothropus redescribed found distinct enough placed separate genus diabolotherium placed family megalonychidae though type skull missing teeth teeth found instead found within megatheroidea larger grouping contains megalonychidae well nothrotheriidae megatheriidae find close clustering aforementioned diabolotherium noteworthy long slender limb bones rarely found extinct sloths usually appear shorter robust however similar todays tree sloths clearly spherical head humerus characteristic sloths enables flexible arm movement connection shoulder blade design upper articular process ulna olecranon decisive main activity secondary articular animals mammals olecranon extremely long burrowing secondary articulated animals armadillos large ground sloths enables animals muster strength need dig triceps attach increases leverage due greater length purely terrestrial forms much shorter extension shortest occurs todays sloths hanging backs branches diabolotherium longer olecranon recent sloths significantly shorter burrowing representatives proportions correspond roughly extinct hapalops semiscansorial locomotion attributed whereby climbing method corresponded todays tamanduas fact diabolotherium able climb supported upper joint capsule ulna circumscribes open circle therefore extraordinarily wide together lower joint humerus engages forms elbow joint wide opening joint capsule ulna gave forearm significantly freedom movement connection position spoke pushed front ulna circular upper head assumed forearm could turned well overall mobile resulted highly flexible upperlower arm connection several bone ridges shaft spoke also show strongly developed forearm muscles turn led rotatable hand also confirmed sometimes short design carpal bones three equally long rays hand turn indicate increased ability grip severely limited large ground sloths diabolotherium one extinct sloths known pursued type climbing locomotion diabolotherium originally associated solely arboreal way life analogous todays sloths forms known lower miocene santa cruz formation cupisnique desert first partial skeleton comes existence oases pleistocene could proven could support possibility climbing since large part recent finds discovered high altitudes andes caves rock roofs difficult access today thus assumed diabolotherium much adapted climbing rocky impassable sometimes extensive joint surfaces enabled high flexibility arm bones also limited stability joint connections therefore likely diabolotherium tended move httpsenwikipediaorgwikidiabolotherium
