megalencephaly macrencephaly abbreviated meg growth development disorder brain abnormally large characterized brain average weight standard deviations mean general approximately children said characteristics megalencephaly general mutation pathway believed primary cause brain proliferation ultimately root cause megalencephaly mutation produced classification brain overdevelopment consists two syndromes including megalencephalycapillary malformation mcap megalencephalypolydactylypolymicrogyriahydrocephalus megalencephaly usually diagnosed birth confirmed mri several neuropsychiatric disorders linked megalencephaly however studies shown autism prevalent association malformation although treatment currently exists megalencephaly management methods focused reducing deficits linked autism recent research targeted creating inhibitors reduce mutational pathway causes macrocephaly term used refer person abnormally large head circumference head must percentile least standard deviations mean normal weight gender groups united person macrocephaly necessarily indicate megalencephaly also present large skulls usually exhibit neurodevelopment conditions meaning individuals macrocephaly healthycitation needed hemimegalencephaly extremely rare form macrocephaly characterized uneven development brain hemispheres one half brain larger present association phakomatosis hemigigantism additionally hemimegalencephaly frequently cause severe epilepsy focal neurological deficits macrocrania mild severe intellectual megalencephalycapillary mcap one two major syndromes megalencephaly typically mcap mpph distinguished somatic mcap includes many characteristics observed birth including cutaneous vascular malformations especially capillary malformations face cutis marmorata polydactyly connective tissue dysplasia focal segmental body furthermore mcap occasionally linked asymmetric brain overgrowth hemimegalencephaly well segmental overgrowth body megalencephalypolymicrogyriapolydactylyhydrocephalus mpph one two major syndromes contributing megalencephaly typically mcap mpph distinguished somatic differentiation mcap mpph lacks consistent somatic features postaxial furthermore brain body development normally symmetric majority patients appear mpph extremely high association megalencephaly autism approximately autistic children megalencephaly making common physical characteristic people present megalencephaly autistic characteristics usually also show signs hyperactivity major symptom however definitive evidence autism primary causeresult megalencephalycitation needed since children megalencephaly also autism goal treatment meg focused managing signs symptoms associated autismcitation needed megalencephaly also seen following although little still known direct cause megalencephaly recent studies begun provide early indications possible sources formation recent research shown strong link genetic pathways cause brain develop mutations pathway result brain overgrowthcitation needed recent studies shown mutations phosphoinositide akt also known protein kinase b pathway identified mcap mpph pathway proven integral part brain growth development area interest many researchers study cause megalencephaly mutations pathway shown cause gain function activation cellular pathway critical regulation diverse cell functions including cell growth proliferation metabolism survival apoptosis angiogenesis tumorigenesis importantly regards megalencephaly brain akt crucial signaling molecule part pathway also involved many cellular functions functions include brain development synaptic plasticity neurodevelopment loss function akt cause microcephaly humans inactivation pathway cause also several cancers shown linked mutations akt pathway including melanoma lung puralpha purÎ± sequencespecific singlestranded dna rnabinding protein studies shown protein primarily active early development believed role brain although exact function still controversial believed puralpha responsible neuronal proliferation neurogenesis well maturation thus puralpha also considered potential root cause megalencephaly brain overgrowthcitation needed one impact megalencephaly complete lack motor development one medical study assessed three patients presenting megalencephaly showed severely impaired motor speech development well distinct facial abnormalities including skull bossing low nasal bridge large diagnosis megalencephaly changed years however development advanced equipment physicians able confirm disorder better accuracy usually physical exam first performed characteristics megalencephaly appeared typically occurs birth early child development physician take head measurements order determine circumference known head family background recorded order determine history megalencephaly neurological exam performed using technology mri machine order confirm diagnosis megalencephaly imaging tests give detailed information regarding brain size volume asymmetry irregular developments linked mcap mpph also strong correlation epilepsy megalencephaly aid doctors diagnosis megalencephaly confirmed child referred specialist focuses managing symptoms improving lifestyle since megalencephaly usually presented autism goal treatment improve deficiencies associated autistic causes additionally since patient unique symptoms one specific treatment method therefore heavily reliant symptoms associated individualcitation needed since treatment methods focused managing megalencephaly future research targeted inhibiting mutation pathway however next step could met several complications understanding underlying mechanism mutation difficult task genetic coding initiates single mutation sporadic patterns hard detect many even though little research done create inhibitors pathway several pharmaceutical companies begun focus interests designing prevention method currently specific treatment megalencephaly however periodic head measurements may assessed determine rate brain growth individuals develop neurological disorders may prescribed antiepileptic drugs studies shown reducing epilepsy increase cell apoptosis reduce proliferation neurons ultimately leads brain prognosis megalencephaly depends heavily underlying cause associated neurological majority megalencephaly cases linked autism prognosis equivalent corresponding condition since hemimegalencephaly associated severe seizures hemiparesis intellectual disability result poor prognosis cases diagnosed type megalencephaly usually survive approximately one every children general population said additionally said megalencephaly affects times males females individuals classified macrocephaly general head overgrowth said megalencephaly rate timecitation needed believed megalencephaly discovered prior diagnoses used mri scanning way confirm brain overgrowth cases megalencephaly diagnosed autopsy physical brain measured future research targeted understanding mutations lead mcap mpph syndromes majority studies megalencephaly included mice present brain abnormalities overgrowth next step move clinical trials involving humans order determine exact genetic mutation causing sequences additionally scientists pharmaceutical companies begun show interest mutation inhibition designing preventative methods eliminate underlying cause megalencephaly intracranial volume also affects pathology since related size httpsenwikipediaorgwikimegalencephaly
