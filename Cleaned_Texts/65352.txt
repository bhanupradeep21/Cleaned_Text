biology cell theory scientific theory first formulated midnineteenth century organisms made cells basic structuralorganizational unit organisms cells come preexisting cells cells basic unit structure organisms also basic unit reproduction theory universally accepted biologists consider noncellular entities viruses living thus disagree first tenet universally accepted definition life discussion still continues continual improvements made microscopes time magnification technology became advanced enough discover cells discovery largely attributed robert hooke began scientific study cells known cell biology observing piece cork scope able see pores shocking time believed one else seen support theory matthias schleiden theodor schwann also studied cells animal plants discovered significant differences two types cells put forth idea cells fundamental plants animals discovery cell made possible invention microscope first century bc romans able make glass discovered objects appeared larger glass expanded use lenses eyeglasses century probably led wider spread use simple microscopes magnifying glasses limited magnification compound microscopes combine objective lens eyepiece view real image achieving much higher magnification first appeared europe around robert hooke used microscope six inches long two convex lenses inside examined specimens reflected light observations book micrographia hooke also used simpler microscope single lens examining specimens directly transmitted light allowed clearer extensive microscopic study done anton van leeuwenhoek draper took interest microscopes seeing one apprenticeship amsterdam point life able learn grind lenses eventually led leeuwenhoek making unique microscope made one single lens able use single lens small glass sphere allowed magnification large progression since magnification maximum leeuwenhoek much progress microscope technology two hundred years later carl zeiss german engineer manufactured microscopes began make changes lenses used optical quality improve hired otto schott eventually ernst optical microscopes focus objects size wavelength larger giving restrictions still advancement discoveries objects smaller wavelengths visible light development electron microscope made possible view objects smaller optical wavelengths opening new possibilities reproduction anton van leeuwenhoeks century microscope magnification robert hookes microscope setup depicted micrographia cell first discovered robert hooke found described book micrographia book gave observations detail various objects coarse compound microscope one observation thin slices bottle cork hooke discovered multitude tiny pores named cells came latin word cella meaning small room like monks lived also cellulae meant sixsided cell honeycomb however hooke know real structure function hooke thought cells actually empty cell walls plant tissues microscopes time low magnification hooke unable see internal components cells observing therefore think cellulae alive cell observations gave indication nucleus organelles found living cells micrographia hooke also observed mould bluish color found leather studying microscope unable observe seeds would indicated mould multiplying quantity led hooke suggesting spontaneous generation either natural artificial heat cause since old aristotelian theory still accepted time others reject disproved leeuwenhoek later discovered generation achieved anton van leeuwenhoek another scientist saw cells soon hooke made use microscope containing improved lenses could magnify objects microscopes leeuwenhoek found motile objects letter royal society october states motility quality life therefore living organisms time wrote many papers described many specific forms microorganisms leeuwenhoek named animalcules included protozoa unicellular organisms like bacteria though much formal education able identify first accurate description red blood cells discovered bacteria gaining interest sense taste resulted leeuwenhoek observe tongue ox leading study pepper water also found first time sperm cells animals humans discovering types cells leeuwenhoek saw fertilization process requires sperm cell enter egg cell put end previous theory spontaneous generation reading letters leeuwenhoek hooke first confirm observations thought unlikely cells animal tissues observed later plants tissues fragile difficult study biologists believed fundamental unit life henri dutrochet unclear besides stating cell fundamental element organization dutrochet claimed cells also physiological karl rudolphi j h f link awarded prize solving problem nature cells meaning first prove cells independent cell walls königliche societät der wissenschaft royal society science thought cells shared walls fluid passed way credit developing cell theory usually given two scientists theodor schwann matthias jakob rudolf virchow contributed theory credited attributions toward schleiden suggested every structural part plant made cells result cells also suggested cells made crystallization process either within cells however original idea schleiden claimed theory though barthelemy dumortier stated years crystallization process longer accepted modern cell theory theodor schwann states along plants animals composed cells product cells major advance field biology since little known animal structure point compared plants conclusions plants animals two three tenets cell theory postulated schleidens theory free cell formation crystallization refuted robert remak rudolf virchow albert rudolf virchow added third tenet cell theory latin tenet states omnis cellula e cellula translated however idea cells come preexisting cells already proposed robert remak suggested virchow plagiarized remak published observations cell division claiming schleiden schawnn incorrect generation schemes instead said binary fission first introduced dumortier reproduction new animal cells made tenet added classical cell theory complete generally accepted parts modern cell theory include cell first discovered robert hooke using microscope first cell theory credited work theodor schwann matthias jakob schleiden theory internal contents cells called protoplasm described jellylike substance sometimes called living jelly time colloidal chemistry began development concepts bound

lipid oil plasma membrane major weakness lipid membrane lack explanation high permeability water nathansohn proposed mosaic theory view membrane pure lipid layer mosaic areas lipid areas semipermeable gel ruhland refined mosaic theory include pores allow additional passage small molecules since membranes generally less permeable anions leonor michaelis concluded ions adsorbed walls pores changing permeability pores ions electrostatic repulsion michaelis demonstrated membrane potential proposed related distribution ions across harvey danielli proposed lipid bilayer membrane covered side layer protein account measurements surface tension boyle conway showed membrane frog muscle permeable k apparently na idea electrical charges pores unnecessary since single critical pore size would explain permeability k h well impermeability na ca time period shown procter wilson gels semipermeable membrane would swell dilute solutionscitation needed jacques loeb also studied gelatin extensively without membrane showing properties attributed plasma membrane could duplicated gels without membrane particular found electrical potential difference gelatin outside medium could developed based h concentration criticisms membrane theory developed based observations ability cells swell increase surface area factor lipid layer stretch extent without becoming patchwork thereby losing barrier properties criticisms stimulated continued studies protoplasm principal agent determining cell permeability propertiescitation needed fischer suer proposed water protoplasm free chemically combined protoplasm represents combination protein salt demonstrated basic similarity swelling living tissues swelling gelatin fibrin gels dimitri nasonov viewed proteins central components responsible many properties cell including electrical properties bulk phase theories well developed membrane theories brooks brooks published monograph permeability living cells rejects bulk phase theoriescitation
