dental emergency issue involving teeth supporting tissues high importance treated relevant professional dental emergencies always involve pain although common signal something needs looked pain originate tooth surrounding tissues sensation originating teeth caused independent source orofacial pain toothache depending type pain experienced experienced clinician determine likely cause treat issue tissue type gives different messages dental emergency many emergencies exist range bacterial fungal viral infections fractured tooth dental restoration requiring individual response treatment unique situation fractures dental trauma occur anywhere tooth surrounding bone depending site extent fracture treatment options vary dental restoration falling fracturing also considered dental emergency impact function regards aesthetics eating pronunciation tended haste loss tooth tissue dental emergencies treated supervision guidance dental health professional order preserve teeth long possible contrast medical emergency often precisely defined acute condition presents immediate threat life limb vision longterm health consequently dental emergencies rarely described medical emergencies terms define dental emergency terms individuals willingness attend emergency dental treatment time short notice stating persons fussy available treatment true emergency often divergent opinions clinicians patients constitutes dental emergency eg person may suddenly lose filling crown bridge etc although completely painfree still great cosmetic concerns appearance teeth demand emergency treatment basis perceived social disability pain described unpleasant sensory emotional experience associated actual potential tissue damage described terms one common reasons patients seek dental treatment many diseases conditions may responsible odontogenic pain pain associated teeth originating dental pulp andor periradicular following table shows different classifications pulp peri radicular pain pulpal origin commonly due disease pulp extending periradicular tissues also periodontal origin due periodontal apical periodontitis acute inflammation periodontal ligament surrounding tooth caused inflammatory mediators irreversibly inflamed pulp bacterial toxins necrotic pulp restorations property contoured cases treatments endodontic acute chronic form acute apical periodontitis features include moderate severe pain usually stimulated touch pressure may also include spontaneous chronic form condition asymptomatic may also include pain surrounding tissues apical abscess extension apical periodontitis bacteria infiltrated peri radicular tissues causing severe inflammatory response also acute chronic form acute apical abscess cause facial swelling cause systemic consequences high temperature feelings cases condition lifethreatening inflammation compromises airway termed ludwigs chronic apical abscess asymptomatic pressure inflammation drained sinus tract draining sinus usually seen periodontal abscess localised inflammation affecting periodontal caused bacteria preexisting periodontal pockets traumatic insertion bacteria foreign body occur periodontal condition rapid onset stimulated touch involves spontaneous important note apical abscess may drain periodontal pocket giving false interpretation periodontal abscess periodontal abscess may appear
