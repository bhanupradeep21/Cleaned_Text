retinal summation describes relationship different types cells retina cone photoreceptor cells bipolar cells ganglion cells high retinal summation large number photoreceptor cells converge smaller number bipolar cells transferring signals ganglion cells zero summation occurs cone photoreceptor cell contacts single ganglion cell via single bipolar high summation increases sensitivity light expense visual acuity low retinal summation results high visual acuity individual photoreceptor cells sending signals high retinal summation yields high sensitivity low light levels signal summed reaching advantageous signals reaching individual photoreceptor cells high retinal summation adaptation low light levels low retinal summation high light levels thus sharpening httpsenwikipediaorgwikiretinalsummation
