heart nanotechnology engineering functional systems molecular scale nanotechnology nanotechnology deals structures materials approximately one onehundred nanometers length microscopic level quantum mechanics take place effect resulting behaviors would seem quite strange compared humans see naked eye regular matter nanotechnology used wide variety fields technology ranging energy electronics medicine category medicine nanotechnology still relatively new yet widely adopted field possible nanotechnology could new breakthrough medicine may eventually solution cure many health problems humans encounter nanotechnology may lead cure illnesses common cold diseases cancer already starting used treatment serious health issues specifically used treat heart cancercitation needed nanotechnology field medicine commonly referred nanomedicine nanomedicine deals helping heart really starting take gain popularity compared fields nanomedicine currently offer several heart problems nanotechnology promising evidence effective treatment heart disease near future hopefully able treat heart valves defective detect treat arterial plaque heart nanotechnology made clear nanomedicine able help heal hearts people already victims heart disease heart attacks hand also play key role finding people high risk heart disease able help prevent heart attacks happening first place nanotechnology heart lot less invasive surgery everything occurring minuscule level body compared relatively large tissues dealt surgery technology today heart surgeries performed treat damaged heart tissue resulted heart attack major surgery usually takes couple months recover webmd better information better health period patients extremely limited activities long recovery process inconvenience patients growth medicine likely wont long efficient method treating heart attack patients developed usedcitation needed method frontrunner replace major heart surgery use nanotechnology couple alternate ways heart surgery nanotechnology potentially able offer future people heart disease suffered heart attack hearts often damaged weakened minor forms heart failure require surgery often treated medications webmd better information better health use nanotechnology treating damaged hearts replace milder heart problems rather serious heart problems currently require surgery sometimes even heart transplants group engineers doctors materials scientists mit childrens hospital boston teamed together starting movement finding way use nanotechnology strengthen weakened heart tissue mit massachusetts institute technology first method uses nanotechnology combined tissue engineering gold nanowires placed woven damaged parts heart essentially replacing nonfunctioning dead approach would potentially use minuscule nanoparticles would travel body find dying heart tissue nanoparticles would carrying objects stem cells growth factors drugs therapeutic nanoparticles would release compounds inject damaged heart tissue would theoretically lead regeneration able fix cardiac tissue damaged heart attack heart disease simple one major challenges today field tissue engineering popular science heart cells easiest objects create lab takes enormous amount special care work develop cells beat sync one another popular science even heart cells finally made also large task insert cells inoperable parts heart get working unison tissues still working properly popular science several successful examples use stemcell based heart patch developed duke university researchers popular science biomaterials make patch usually made either biological polymers like alginate synthetic polymers polylactic acid nature nanotechnology materials good organizing cells functioning tissues however act insulators poor conductors electricity major problem especially heart nature nanotechnology since electrical signals sent calcium ions control cardiomyocytes heart contract makes heart beat stemcell heart patch efficient effective doctors would like popular science results patch conductive cells able attain smooth continuous beat throughout entire tissue containing stem cells results heart functioning properly turn could mean heart problems might arise due implanting stem cells recentlywhen new developments field nanotechnology efficient poorly conducting stemcellbased patch nature nanotechnology scientists researchers found way stem cell patches also known tissue scaffolds conductive therefore become exponentiallycitation needed effective nature nanotechnology found growing gold nanowires patches able greatly increase electrical nanowires thicker original scaffold cells better organized also increase production proteins needed muscle calcium binding gold nanowires poke stem cells scaffolding material strengthens electrical communication surrounding heart without nanowires stem cell patches produced minute current cells would beat small clusters stimulation nanowires cells seem contract together even clustered far away source use gold nanowires stem cell heart patches still relatively new concept probably awhile used humans hoped nanowires tested live animals near another way nanotechnology potentially used help fix damaged heart tissues use guided nanoparticle nanoparticles cling attach artery walls secrete medicine slow rate mitmassachusetts institute technology
