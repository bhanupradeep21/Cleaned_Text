sensory deprivation perceptual deliberate reduction removal stimuli one senses simple devices blindfolds hoods earmuffs cut sight hearing complex devices also cut sense smell touch taste thermoception heatsense ability know way sensory deprivation used various alternative medicines psychological experiments eg isolation tank deprived sensation brain attempts restore sensation form shortterm sessions sensory deprivation described relaxing conducive meditation however extended forced sensory deprivation result extreme anxiety bizarre thoughts related phenomenon perceptual deprivation also called ganzfeld effect case constant uniform stimulus used instead attempting remove stimuli leads effects similarities sensory sensory deprivation techniques developed armed forces within nato means interrogating prisoners within international treaty european court human rights ruled use five techniques british security forces northern ireland amounted practice inhuman degrading treatment also used prisons many different numbers basic methods restricted environmental stimulation including therapy rest chamber rest flotation rest chamber rest subject lies bed completely dark soundreducing average db room hours movement restricted experimental instructions mechanical restraints food drink toilet facilities provided room discretion tester communicate participants using open intercom subjects allowed leave room hours complete however fewer actually find chamber chamber rest affects psychological functioning thinking perception memory motivation mood psychophysiological processes flotation rest room contains tank pool flotation medium consists skintemperature solution water epsom salts specific gravity allows patient float supine without worry safety fact turn solution requires major deliberate effort fewer subjects tested leave session duration ends usually around hour flotation spas sometimes provide commercial float tanks use relaxation flotation therapy academically studied us sweden published results showing reductions pain relaxed state also involves lowered blood pressure lowered levels cortisol maximal blood flow besides physiological effects rest seems positive effects wellbeing several differences exist flotation chamber rest example presence medium flotation rest subject reduced tactile stimulation experiencing weightlessness addition epsom salts attain desired specific gravity may therapeutic effect hypertonic muscles since one main results chamber rest state relaxation effects chamber rest arousal less clearcut attributed nature also due inherent immobilization experienced flotation rest able roll become uncomfortable several hours subject unable experience session durations chamber rest may allow subject experience changes attitudes thinking associated chamber additionally research questions asked technique different chamber rest questions stemmed research began explored variety questions need stimulation nature arousal relationship external stimulation practitioners area explored utility treatment major psychiatric dysfunctions substance abuse contrary flotation rest seen recreational tool tested use stressrelated disorders pain reduction numerous studies debated method effective treatment process however one explored statistically nineteen subjects used chamber flotation rest induce relaxation treat smoking obesity alcohol intake chronic pain analyzed statistic interest measure size treatment effect reference considered moderate effect large effect subjects underwent chamber rest six flotation rest subjects showed additionally examining subjects undergoing rest treatment rest conjunction another treatment method little however flotation rest advantage lower duration required minutes opposed hours sensory deprivation used help support arguments philosophers minds work one example floating man argument proposed ibn sīnā whose primary objective affirm existence human soul ibn sīnā one important philosophers medieval period investigated existence self explored selfs nature like many others proposed argument support claim regarding relationship mind body based investigation floating man argument proposes man floating air vacuum perceive anything even substance man unable see anything external arms legs separated rest body meet words man experiencing extreme sensory deprivation order separate physical body perception stimuli person experience consciousness might ibn sīnās thought experiment man later reflects existence question exists able affirm legs arms internal organs exist guarantees essence exists awareness length depth therefore thought experiment man affirm exist mans self affirm make part essence like arm argument concludes since man affirm existence subjected extreme sensory deprivation soul something different physical soul said immaterial substance separate body considered dualist argument philosophy mind separates mind body affirm existence oneself dualism presupposes world made physical perceived senses immaterial perceived senses rené descartes philosopher proposed cartesian dualism also called substance dualism since claims existence two kinds substances mental states material stuff takes space descartes mind entity different physical entity since mind descartes point view exist independently without physical body reason concluded mind use rest explored aiding cessation smoking studies ranging months five years rest patients achieved longterm abstinence rest combined effective smoking cessation methods example behavior modification resulted longterm abstinence also combined weekly support groups rest resulted patients achieving longterm abstinence comparatively use nicotine patch alone success rate alcoholism also target research associated rest conjunction antialcohol educational messages patients underwent two hours rest treatment reduced alcohol consumption first two weeks treatment reduction consumption maintained followups conducted three six months first treatment however possible caused placebo effect addition rest tested determine effect users drugs university arizona study used chamber rest complement traditional outpatient substance abuse treatment found four years later patients still sober drugfree eight months later one control group remained studies conducted test effect sensory deprivation brain one study took volunteers tested lower upper percentiles questionnaire measures tendency healthy people see things really placed pitchblack soundproof booth minutes completed another test measures psychosislike experiences originally used study recreational drug users five subjects reported seeing hallucinations faces six reported seeing shapesfaces actually four noted heightened sense smell two reported sensing presence evil room people scored lower first test experienced fewer perceptual distortions however still reported seeing variety hallucinations many studies conducted understand main causes hallucinations considerable evidence accumulated indicating long periods isolation arent directly related level experienced schizophrenics appear tend experience fewer hallucinations rest compared nonpsychotic individuals possible explanation could nonpsychotic individuals normally exposed greater degree sensory stimulation everyday life rest brain attempts recreate similar level stimulation producing hallucinatory according study published journal nervous mental disease hallucinations caused brain misidentifying source currently experiencing phenomenon called faulty source study conducted individuals underwent rest effects phencyclidine pcp showed lower incidence hallucination comparison participants take pcp effects pcp also appeared reduced undergoing
