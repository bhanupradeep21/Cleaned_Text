pregnancy test used determine whether female pregnant two primary methods testing female pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin hcg blood urine using pregnancy test kit scanning testing blood hcg results earliest detection almost pregnant women positive urine pregnancy test one week first day missed menstrual identified early century human chorionic gonadotropin hcg glycoprotein hormone rises quickly first weeks pregnancy typically reaching peak gestational hcg produced become hcg testing performed blood serum sample typically done medical facility urine performed medical facility home assays used detect presence hcg blood urine generally reliable inexpensive secretion hcg occur soon days following ovulation average days following ovulation earliest hcg detected blood hcg concentration blood higher urine therefore blood test positive urine test still qualitative tests yesno positivenegative results look presence beta subunit human chorionic gonadotropin hcg blood urine qualitative test thresholds positive test generally determined hcg cutoff least pregnant women would get positive result day first missed qualitative urine pregnancy tests vary sensitivity highsensitivity tests common typically detect hcg levels milliinternational unitsml miuml lowsensitivity tests detect hcg levels miuml unique clinical applications including confirmation medication abortion qualitative urine tests available home use typically designed lateral flow tests quantitative tests measure exact amount hcg sample blood tests detect hcg levels low miuml typically clinicians diagnose positive pregnancy test qualitative test miuml depending test lowsensitivity qualitative test miuml depending test miuml depending test quantitative test miuml ultrasensitive test multilevel urine pregnancy test mlpt measures hcg levels semiquantitatively hcg levels measured miuml test utility determining success medication obstetric ultrasonography may also used detect diagnose pregnancy common positive athome urine pregnancy test ultrasound abdominal vaginal ultrasound may used vaginal ultrasound allows earlier visualization pregnancy obstetric ultrasonography gestational sac intrauterine fluid collection visualized weeks gestation yolk sac weeks gestation fetal pole weeks gestation ultrasound used diagnose multiple systematic review published showed home pregnancy test kits used experienced technicians almost accurate professional laboratory testing used consumers however accuracy fell review authors noted many users misunderstood failed follow instructions included false positive pregnancy test results rare may occur several reasons including spurious evaporation lines may appear many home pregnancy tests read suggested minute window reaction time independent actual pregnancy false positives may also appear tests used past expiration false positive pregnancy test happen due phantom hcg due people human antianimal heterophilic false positives also caused order incidence quiescent pregnancy pituitary sulfated hcg heterophilic antibody familial hcg syndrome urine tests falsely positive taking medications chlorpromazine promethazine phenothiazines aspirin carbamazepine drugs cause high urinary false negative readings occur testing done early hcg levels rise rapidly early pregnancy chances false negative test results diminish time increasing gestational less sensitive urine tests qualitative blood tests may detect pregnancy three four days menstruation occurs average days ovulation likelihood false negative low menstrual period late ovulation may occur predictable time menstrual cycle number factors may cause unexpectedly early late ovulation even people history regular menstrual rare false negative results also occur due hook effect sample high level hcg tested without dilution causing invalid pregnancy tests may used predict pregnancy likely continue abnormal miscarriage spontaneous abortion pregnancy loss common early serial quantitative blood tests may done usually hours apart interpreted based knowledge hcg viable normal pregnancy rises rapidly early pregnancy example starting hcg level miuml less hcg continuing normal pregnancy increase least hours however pregnancies higher starting hcg miuml hcg rise least starting hcg greater miuml hcg increase least failure rise minimums may indicate pregnancy normal either failed intrauterine pregnancy possible ectopic ultrasound also common tool determining viability location pregnancy serial ultrasound may used identify nonviable pregnancies pregnancies grow size develop expected structural findings repeated ultrasounds week interval may identified occasionally single ultrasound may used identify pregnancy nonviable example embryo greater certain size lacks visible heart beat may confidently determined viable without need follow ultrasound research identified least one possible marker may appear earlier exclusively pregnancy example early pregnancy factor epf detected blood within hours fertilization rather however reliable use pregnancy test remains unclear studies shown presence physiological situations besides pregnancy application humans remains records attempts pregnancy testing found far back ancient greek ancient egyptian cultures ancient egyptians watered bags wheat barley urine possibly pregnant woman germination indicated pregnancy type grain sprouted taken indicator fetuss hippocrates suggested woman missed period drink solution honey water bedtime resulting abdominal distention cramps would indicate presence pregnancy avicenna many physicians middle ages performed uroscopy nonscientific method evaluate urine selmar aschheim bernhard zondek introduced testing based presence human chorionic gonadotropin hcg early studies hcg concluded produced pituitary gland doctor georgeanna jones discovered hcg produced pituitary gland placenta discovery important relying hcg early marker aschheim zondek test infantile female mouse injected subcutaneously urine woman tested mouse later killed dissected presence ovulation indicated urine contained hcg meant subject pregnant similar test developed using immature rabbits killing animal check ovaries necessary beginning hillel shapiro harry zwarenstein researchers university cape town discovered urine pregnant woman injected south african xenopus frog frog ovulated indicated subject pregnant test known frog test used throughout world xenopus frogs exported great shapiros advisor lancelot hogben claimed developed pregnancy test refuted shapiro zwarenstein letter british medical journal later article independently authored granted hogben credit principle using xenopus determine gonadotropin levels pregnant womans urine usage functional pregnancy hormonal pregnancy tests primodos duogynon used uk germany tests involved taking dosed amount hormones observing response days later pregnant woman react producing hormones pregnancy subject pregnant responds absence hormone beginning new menstrual cycle test generally considered accurate research advancements replaced simpler immunologic pregnancy tests introduced wide gemzell presented test based invitro hemagglutination inhibition first step away invivo pregnancy initiated series improvements pregnancy testing leading contemporary athome direct measurement
