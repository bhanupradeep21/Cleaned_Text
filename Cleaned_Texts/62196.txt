hnrnpk gene located chromosome position hnrnpk codes heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein k ribonucleoproteins proteins form complexes rna involved transcription dna rna nucleus usually bind precursor messenger rna premrna messenger rna yet introns removed splicing ready translation mutation one two copies hnrnpk results defects dna transcription therefore developmental processes disrupted mutations hnrnpk reported include nonsense mutations protein truncated usually nonfunctional result frameshift mutations splicesite mutations microdeletions encompassing gene rarely missense
