small intestinal bacterial overgrowth sibo also termed bacterial overgrowth small bowel bacterial overgrowth syndrome sbbos disorder excessive bacterial growth small intestine unlike colon large bowel rich bacteria small bowel usually fewer organisms per patients bacterial overgrowth typically develop symptoms may include nausea bloating vomiting diarrhea malnutrition weight loss caused number mechanisms diagnosis bacterial overgrowth made number techniques gold aspirate jejunum grows excess bacteria per millilitre risk factors development bacterial overgrowth include dysmotility anatomical disturbances bowel including fistulae diverticula blind loops created surgery resection ileocecal valve gastroenteritisinduced alterations small intestine use certain medications including proton pump inhibitors small bowel bacterial overgrowth syndrome treated elemental diet antibiotics may given cyclic fashion prevent tolerance antibiotics sometimes followed prokinetic drugs prevent recurrence dysmotility suspected cause symptoms traditionally linked sibo include bloating diarrhea constipation abdominal paindiscomfort steatorrhea may seen severe bacterial overgrowth cause variety symptoms many also found conditions making diagnosis challenging many symptoms due malabsorption nutrients due effects bacteria either metabolize nutrients cause inflammation small bowel impairing absorption symptoms bacterial overgrowth include nausea bloating abdominal distension abdominal pain discomfort fatigue weakness sibo also causes increased permeability small patients may lose weight children bacterial overgrowth may develop malnutrition difficulty attaining proper growth steatorrhea sticky type diarrhea fats properly absorbed spill stool may also patients bacterial overgrowth longstanding develop complications illness result malabsorption laboratory test results may include elevated folate less commonly vitamin deficiency nutritional anemia may occur variety mechanisms many nutrients involved production red blood cells absorbed affected small bowel iron absorbed proximal parts small bowel duodenum jejunum patients malabsorption iron develop microcytic anemia small red blood cells vitamin absorbed last part small bowel ileum patients malabsorb vitamin develop megaloblastic anemia large red blood recent years several proposed links sibo disorders made however usual methodology studies involves use breath testing indirect investigation sibo breath testing criticized authors imperfect test sibo multiple known false studies reported patients irritable bowel syndrome ibs sibo using hydrogen breath test ibsd associated elevated hydrogen numbers breath tests ibsc associated elevated methane numbers breath subsequent studies demonstrated statistically significant reduction ibs symptoms following therapy various mechanisms involved development diarrhea ibsd bacterial overgrowth first excessive bacterial concentrations cause direct inflammation small bowel cells leading inflammatory diarrhea malabsorption lipids proteins carbohydrates may cause poorly digestible products enter colon cause diarrhea osmotic drive molecules also stimulate secretory mechanisms colonic cells leading secretory lack consensus however regarding suggested link ibs sibo authors concluded abnormal breath results common ibs patients suggest sibo state abnormal fermentation timing dynamics breath test findings support role abnormal intestinal bacterial distribution general consensus breath tests abnormal ibs however disagreement lies whether representative certain people predisposed development bacterial overgrowth certain risk factors factors grouped four categories disordered motility movement small bowel anatomical changes lead stasis disorders immune system interference

connections bacteriarich colon small bowel increase bacterial load small bowel patients crohns disease diseases ileum may require surgery removes ileocecal valve connecting small large bowel leads increased reflux bacteria small bowelcitation needed bariatric surgery obesity connections stomach ileum formed may increase bacterial load small diagnosis bacterial overgrowth made physicians various ways malabsorption detected test called dxylose absorption test xylose sugar require enzymes digested dxylose test involves patient drink certain quantity dxylose measuring levels urine blood evidence dxylose urine blood suggests small bowel absorbing properly opposed problems enzymes required gold standard detection bacterial overgrowth aspiration bacteria per millilitre small bowel normal small bowel less bacteria per millilitrecitation needed experts however consider aspiration positive flora predominately colonic type bacteria types bacteria considered pathological excessive numbers small intestine reliability aspiration diagnosis sibo questioned sibo patchy reproducibility low percent breath tests reliability problems high rate false positive doctors factor patients response treatment part breath tests developed test bacterial overgrowth tests either based bacterial metabolism carbohydrates hydrogen methane hydrogen sulfide based detection byproducts digestion carbohydrates usually metabolized hydrogen breath test involves patient fast minimum hours drink substrate usually glucose lactulose measuring expired hydrogen methane concentrations typically period several hours compares well jejunal aspirates making diagnosis bacterial overgrowthcitation needed based tests also developed based bacterial metabolism dxylose increased bacterial concentrations also involved deconjugation bile acids glycocholic acid breath test involves administration bile acid glycocholic acid detection would elevated bacterial overgrowthcitation needed however physicians suggest suspicion bacterial overgrowth high enough best diagnostic test trial treatment symptoms improve empiric diagnosis bacterial overgrowth insufficient evidence support use inflammatory markers fecal calprotectin detect sibo may defined increased number bacteria measured via exhaled hydrogen andor methane gas following ingestion glucose via analysis small bowel aspirate nevertheless definition sibo clinical entity lacks precision consistency term generally applied clinical disorder symptoms clinical signs andor laboratory abnormalities attributed changes numbers bacteria composition bacterial population small main obstacle accurately define sibo limited understanding normal intestinal microbial population future advances sampling technology techniques counting bacterial populations metabolites provide muchneeded archaeon methanobrevibacter smithii associated symptoms sibo result positive methane breath addition archaeon bacteria also produce methane members clostridium bacteroides genus production methane therefore may bacterial limited small intestine proposed condition classified separate intestinal methanogen overgrowth treatment strategies focus identifying correcting root causes possible resolving nutritional deficiencies administering antibiotics especially important patients indigestion although whether antibiotics first line treatment matter debate experts recommend probiotics first line therapy antibiotics reserved second line treatment severe cases sibo prokinetic drugs options research humans variety antibiotics including tetracycline amoxicillinclavulanate metronidazole neomycin cephalexin trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole used however best evidence use rifaximin poorlyabsorbed although irritable bowel syndrome shown respond treatment poorlyabsorbed antibiotics limited evidence effectiveness treatment cases sibo randomized controlled trials still needed confirm eradicating effect treatment course one week antibiotics usually sufficient treat condition however condition recurs antibiotics given cyclical fashion order prevent tolerance example antibiotics may given week followed three weeks antibiotics followed another week treatment alternatively choice antibiotic used still limited data guide clinician developing antibiotic strategies sibo therapy remains part empiric however concerns exist potential risks longterm broadspectrum antibiotic probiotics bacterial preparations alter bacterial flora bowel cause beneficial effect animal research demonstrated probiotics barrier enhancing antibacterial immune modulating antiinflammatory effects may positive effect management sibo lactobacillus casei found effective improving breath hydrogen scores weeks treatment presumably suppressing levels small intestinal bacterial overgrowth fermenting
