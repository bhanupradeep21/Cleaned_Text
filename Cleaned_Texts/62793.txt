sperm pl sperm sperms male reproductive cell gamete anisogamous forms sexual reproduction forms larger female reproductive cell smaller male one animals produce motile sperm tail known flagellum known spermatozoa red algae fungi produce nonmotile sperm cells known flowering plants contain nonmotile sperm inside pollen basal plants like ferns gymnosperms motile sperm cells form process known spermatogenesis amniotes reptiles mammals takes place seminiferous tubules process involves production several successive sperm cell precursors starting spermatogonia differentiate spermatocytes spermatocytes undergo meiosis reducing chromosome number half produces spermatids spermatids mature animals construct tail flagellum gives rise mature motile sperm cell whole process occurs constantly takes around months start finish sperm cells divide limited lifespan fusion egg cells fertilization new organism begins developing starting totipotent zygote human sperm cell haploid chromosomes join chromosomes female egg form diploid cell paired chromosomes mammals sperm stored epididymis released penis ejaculation fluid known semen word sperm derived greek word σπέρμα sperma meaning seed generally accepted isogamy ancestor sperm eggs however fossil records evolution sperm eggs isogamy leading strong emphasis mathematical models understand evolution widespread hypothesis states sperm evolved rapidly direct evidence sperm evolved fast rate male main sperm function reach ovum fuse deliver two subcellular structures male pronucleus contains genetic material ii centrioles structures

filamentous core many mitochondria spiralled around used atp production journey female cervix uterus uterine tubes fertilization sperm provides three essential parts oocyte signalling activating factor causes metabolically dormant oocyte activate haploid paternal genome centriole responsible forming centrosome microtubule spermatozoa animals produced spermatogenesis inside male gonads testicles via meiotic division initial spermatozoon process takes around days complete process starts production spermatogonia germ cell precursors divide differentiate spermatocytes undergo meiosis form spermatids spermatid stage sperm develops familiar tail next stage becomes fully mature takes around days called sperm cells carried male body fluid known semen human sperm cells survive within female reproductive tract days post semen produced seminal vesicles prostate gland urethral glands scientists nanjing medical university claimed produced cells resembling mouse spermatids mouse embryonic stem cells artificially injected spermatids mouse eggs produced sperm quantity quality main parameters semen quality measure ability semen accomplish fertilization thus humans measure

antheridia via mitotic division flowering plants sperm nuclei produced inside motile sperm cells typically move via flagella require water medium order swim toward egg fertilization animals energy

life cycle plants many ferns lycophytes cycads ginkgo multiflagellated carrying one nematodes sperm cells amoeboid crawl rather swim towards egg nonmotile sperm cells called spermatia lack flagella therefore swim spermatia produced spermatia swim depend environment carry egg cell red algae polysiphonia produce nonmotile spermatia spread water currents spermatia rust fungi covered sticky substance produced flaskshaped structures containing nectar attract flies transfer spermatia nearby hyphae fertilization mechanism similar insect pollination flowering fungal spermatia also called pycniospores especially uredinales may confused conidia conidia spores germinate independently fertilization whereas spermatia gametes required fertilization fungi neurospora crassa spermatia identical microconidia perform functions fertilization well giving rise new organisms without almost embryophytes including gymnosperms angiosperms male gametophytes pollen grains primary mode dispersal example via wind insect pollination eliminating need water bridge gap male female pollen grain contains spermatogenous generative cell pollen lands stigma receptive flower germinates starts growing pollen tube carpel tube reaches ovule nucleus generative cell pollen grain divides gives rise two sperm nuclei discharged tube ovule protists fertilization also involves sperm nuclei rather cells migrating toward egg cell fertilization tube oomycetes form sperm nuclei syncytical antheridium surrounding egg cells sperm nuclei reach eggs fertilization tubes similar pollen tube mechanism
