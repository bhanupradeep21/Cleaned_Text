preservation digit ii makes hypothesis difficult infraorder coelurosauria coined friedrich von huene traditionally taxonomic wastebasket small theropods ornitholestes due small size therefore generally classified jacques gauthier redefined several paleontological terms rigorous fashion based cladistic methods tetanurae defined modern birds theropods closely related modern birds ceratosaurs coelurosauria comprised members tetanurae closely related modern birds gregory paul suggested ornitholestes similar skull structure proceratosaurus middle jurassic theropod placed two genera together new subfamily speculated closely related much larger allosaurus small however classification ornitholestes proceratosaurus allosaur relatives proved untenable latter since proved tyrannosauroid paul eventually abandoned published cladistic analyses shown ornitholestes coelurosaur defined gauthier analysis shown support hypothesis primitive member group maniraptora though thorough analyses suggested primitive maniraptoriformes possibly close relative compsognathid juravenator following family tree illustrates synthesis relationships major coelurosaurian groups based various studies
