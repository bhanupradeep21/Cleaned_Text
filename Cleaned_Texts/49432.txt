extinction behavioral phenomenon observed operantly conditioned classically conditioned behavior manifests fading nonreinforced conditioned response time operant behavior previously reinforced longer produces reinforcing consequences behavior gradually stops classical conditioning conditioned stimulus presented alone longer predicts coming unconditioned stimulus conditioned responding gradually stops example pavlovs dog conditioned salivate sound metronome eventually stopped salivating metronome metronome sounded repeatedly food came many anxiety disorders post traumatic stress disorder believed reflect least part failure extinguish conditioned dominant account extinction involves associative models however debate whether extinction involves simply unlearning unconditional stimulus us conditional stimulus cs association eg account alternatively new learning inhibitory association masks original excitatory association eg konorski pearce hall account third account concerns nonassociative mechanisms habituation modulation response fatigue myers davis review fear extinction rodents suggested multiple mechanisms may work depending timing circumstances extinction given competing views difficult observations various accounts researchers turned investigations cellular level often rodents tease apart specific brain mechanisms extinction particular role brain structures

targets cellular level new treatments learning extinction also occur classical conditioning paradigm model neutral cue context come elicit conditioned response paired unconditioned stimulus unconditioned stimulus one naturally automatically triggers certain behavioral response certain stimulus environment become conditioned cue conditioned context respectively paired unconditioned stimulus example process fear conditioning paradigm using mouse instance tone paired mild footshock become conditioned cue eliciting fear response presented alone future way context footshock received

unconditioned stimulus animal learns cue context longer predicts coming unconditioned stimulus conditioned responding gradually decreases extinguishes operant conditioning paradigm extinction refers

considered successful responding presence extinction stimulus red light teacher giving bad student attention instance zero behavior reappears gone extinction called spontaneous recovery extinction result challenging behaviors longer occurring without need reinforcement relapse reinforcements given problem behavior return extinction long process therefore requires facilitator procedure completely invested beginning end order outcome fewer challenging behaviors observed extinction likely produce less significant spontaneous working towards extinction different distributions schedules administer reinforcements people may use intermittent reinforcement schedule include fixed ratio variable ratio fixed interval variable interval another option use continuous reinforcement schedules fixed variable also number reinforcements given interval vary positive classroom environment wields better results learning growth therefore order children successful classroom environment free

benefit extinction may include offtask behaviors blurting yelling interrupting use inappropriate use extinction used primarily problem behaviors interfered successful classroom methods used conjunction extinction positive outcomes likely extinction used behavior extinction implemented consistently time results eventual decrease undesired behavior short term subject might exhibit called extinction burst extinction burst often occur extinction procedure begun usually consists sudden temporary increase responses frequency followed eventual decline extinction behavior targeted elimination novel behavior emotional responses aggressive behavior may also example pigeon reinforced peck electronic button training history every time pigeon pecked button received small amount bird seed reinforcer thus whenever bird hungry peck button receive food however button turned hungry pigeon first try pecking button past food forthcoming bird likely try repeatedly period frantic activity pecking behavior yields result pigeons pecking decrease frequency although explained reinforcement theory extinction burst understood using control theory perceptual control theory degree output involved action proportional discrepancy reference value desired rate reward operant paradigm current input thus reward removed discrepancy increases output increased long term reorganisation learning algorithm control theory would adapt control system output reduced evolutionary advantage extinction burst clear natural environment animal persists learned behavior despite resulting immediate reinforcement might still chance producing reinforcing consequences animal tries animal would advantage another animal gives easily despite name however every explosive reaction adverse stimuli subsides extinction indeed small minority individuals persist reaction indefinitely extinctioninduced variability serves adaptive role similar extinction burst extinction begins subjects exhibit variations response topography movements involved response response topography always somewhat variable due differences environment idiosyncratic causes normally subjects history reinforcement keeps slight variations stable maintaining successful variations less successful variations extinction increase variations significantly subject attempts acquire reinforcement previous behaviors produced
