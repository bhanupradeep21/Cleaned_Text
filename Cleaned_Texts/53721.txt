coordinate used early form poincaré expressed lack interest fourdimensional reformulation new mechanics opinion translation physics language fourdimensional geometry would entail much effort limited hermann minkowski worked consequences notion needed like others poincaré discovered relation mass electromagnetic energy studying conflict actionreaction principle lorentz ether theory tried determine whether center gravity still moves uniform velocity electromagnetic fields noticed actionreaction principle hold matter alone electromagnetic field momentum poincaré concluded electromagnetic field energy electromagnetic wave behaves like fictitious fluid fluide fictif mass density center mass frame defined mass matter mass fictitious fluid fictitious fluid neither created motion center mass frame remains uniform electromagnetic energy converted forms energy poincaré assumed exists nonelectric energy fluid point space electromagnetic energy transformed also carries mass proportional energy way motion center mass remains uniform poincaré said one surprised assumptions since mathematical fictions however poincarés resolution led paradox changing frames hertzian oscillator radiates certain direction suffer recoil inertia fictitious fluid poincaré performed lorentz boost order vc frame moving source noted energy conservation holds frames law conservation momentum violated would allow perpetual motion notion abhorred laws nature would different frames reference relativity principle would hold therefore argued also case another compensating mechanism ether poincaré came back topic st louis lecture possibility energy carries mass criticized solution compensate abovementioned problems apparatus recoil cannon projected energy ball contradicts principle newton since present projectile mass matter energy shall say space separates oscillator receiver disturbance must traverse passing one empty filled ether air even interplanetary space subtile yet ponderable fluid matter receives shock receiver moment energy reaches recoils disturbance leaves would save newtons principle true energy propagation remained always attached material substratum matter would carry light along fizeau shown least air nothing kind michelson morley since confirmed might also suppose motions matter proper exactly compensated ether would lead us considerations made moment ago principle thus interpreted could explain anything since whatever visible motions could imagine hypothetical motions compensate explain anything allow us foretell nothing allow us choose various possible hypotheses since explains everything advance therefore becomes useless quote refers hertz assumption total aether entrainment falsified fizeau experiment experiment indeed show light partially carried along substance finally revisits problem ends abandoning principle reaction altogether favor supporting solution based inertia aether seen fizeaus experiment permit retaining theory hertz necessary therefore adopt theory lorentz consequently renounce principle reaction also discussed two unexplained effects nonconservation mass implied lorentzs variable mass γ displaystyle gamma abrahams theory variable mass kaufmanns experiments mass fast moving electrons nonconservation energy radium experiments marie curie albert einsteins concept equivalence body losing energy radiation heat losing mass amount poincarés paradox without using compensating mechanism within hertzian oscillator loses mass emission process momentum conserved frame however concerning poincarés solution center gravity

experience connection noneuclidean geometry connection special relativity years death einstein commented poincaré one pioneers relativity saying lorentz already recognized transformation named essential analysis maxwells equations poincaré deepened insight still poincarés work development special relativity well though historians stress despite many similarities einsteins work two different research agendas interpretations poincaré developed similar physical interpretation local time noticed connection signal velocity contrary einstein continued use etherconcept papers argued clocks rest
