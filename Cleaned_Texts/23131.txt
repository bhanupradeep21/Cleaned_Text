ill poor sick homeless indeed anyone whose expressions individuality unwelcome philosopher philip stokes university reading noted overall foucaults work dark pessimistic though however leave room optimism illustrates discipline philosophy used highlight areas domination stokes claimed ways dominated become better understood may strive build social structures minimise risk development close attention detail detail eventually individualizes later life foucault explained work less analyzing power phenomenon trying characterize different ways contemporary society expressed use power

criticism psychology reference texts raymond roussel one first notable experimental writers foucault also gave lecture responding roland barthes famous essay death author titled author later published according literary theoretician kornelije kvas foucault denying existence historical author account hisher irrelevance interpretation absurd author function text organizes foucaults analysis power comes two forms empirical theoretical empirical analyses concern historical modern forms power emerged previous forms power foucault describes three types power empirical analyses sovereign power disciplinary power foucault generally critical theories try give absolute answers everything therefore considered theory power closer method typical theory according foucault people misunderstand power reason makes clear power completely described foucault critical considering phenomena power claims theories power completely describe forms power foucault also claims liberal definition power effectively hidden forms power extent people uncritically accepted foucaults power analysis begins microlevel singular force relations richard lynch defines foucaults concept force relation whatever ones social interactions pushes urges compels one according foucault force relations effect difference inequality unbalance exists forms relationships sexual economic force power however something person group holds sovereign definition power instead power complex group forces comes everything therefore exists everywhere relations power always result inequality difference unbalance also means power always goal purpose power comes two forms tactics strategies tactics power microlevel example person chooses express clothes strategies hand power macrolevel state fashion moment strategies consist combination tactics time power nonsubjective according foucault posits paradox according lynch since someone exert power time someone exerting according lynch paradox solved two observations according foucault force relations constantly changing constantly interacting force relations may weaken strengthen change one another foucault writes power always includes resistance means always possibility power force relations change way according richard lynch purpose foucaults work power increase peoples awareness power shaped way thinking acting increasing awareness making possible change way thinking sovereign power foucault alludes power structure similar pyramid one person group people top pyramid holds power normal oppressed people bottom pyramid middle parts pyramid people enforce sovereigns orders typical example sovereign power absolute historical absolute monarchies crimes considered personal offense sovereign hisher power punishment often public spectacular partly deter others committing crimes also reinstate sovereigns power however expensive led far often people sympathizing criminal modern times disciplinary power dominant criminals instead subjected various disciplinary techniques remold criminal law abiding according chloë taylor characteristic sovereign power sovereign right take life wealth services labor products sovereign right take life enslave life right control life way later happens disciplinary systems power according taylor form power philosopher thomas hobbes concerned sovereign power according hobbes people free long literally placed foucault calls disciplinary power aims use bodies skills effectively useful body becomes obedient also become purpose use bodies skills also prevent skills used revolt disciplinary power individuals object target instrument according foucault individual however construct created disciplinary disciplinary powers techniques create rational practice means disciplinary power internalized therefore doesnt continuously need external force foucault says disciplinary power primarily oppressing form power rather productive form power disciplinary power doesnt oppress interests desires instead subjects bodies reconstructed patterns behavior reconstruct thoughts desires interests according foucault happens factories schools hospitals disciplinary power creates certain type individual producing new movements habits skills focuses details single movements timing speed organizes bodies time space controls every movement maximal effect uses rules surveillance exams activities follow certain plans whose purpose lead bodies certain predetermined goals bodies also combined reach productivity greater sum bodies disciplinary power according foucault especially successful due usage three technologies hierarchical observation normalizing judgement hierarchical observation bodies become constantly visible power observation hierarchical since single observer rather hierarchy observers example mental asylums century psychiatrist observer also nurses auxiliary staff observations scientific discourses norm established used judge observed bodies disciplinary power continue exist judgement normalized foucault mentions several characteristics judgement deviations even small ones correct behavior punished repeated rule violations punished extra exercises used behavior correcting technique punishment rewards used together punishment establish hierarchy good bad behaviorpeople rankgradesetc used punishment reward examinations combine hierarchical observation judgement exams objectify individualize observed bodies creating extensive documentation every observed body purpose exams therefore gather information individual track development compare results according foucault formula disciplinary power seen philosopher jeremy benthams plan optimal prison panopticon prison consists circleformed building every cell inhabited one prisoner every cell two let light outside one pointing middle circleformed building middle tower guard placed observe prisoners since prisoners never able know whether watched given moment internalize disciplinary power regulate behavior constantly watched foucault says construction creates individuality separating prisoners physical room since prisoners know watched given moment internalize disciplinary power regulate behavior always watched surveillance makes possible create extensive documentation prisoner behavior according foucault panopticon used model also disciplinary institutions mental asylums biopower foucault refers power bios populations biopower primarily rests norms internalized people rather external force encourages strengthens controls observes optimizes organize forces foucault sometimes described biopower separate disciplinary power times described disciplinary power expression biopower biopower use disciplinary techniques contrast disciplinary power target populations rather biopower studies populations regarding example number births life expectancy public health housing migration crime social groups overrepresented deviations norm regarding health crime etc tries adjust control eliminate norm deviations one example age distribution population biopower interested age distribution compensate future current lacks labor power retirement homes etc yet another example sex sex connected population growth sex sexuality great interest biopower disciplinary level people engaged nonreproductive sexual acts treated psychiatric diagnoses perversion frigidity sexual dysfunction biopowerlevel usage contraceptives studied social groups various means encouraged children others poor sick unmarried women criminals people disabilities discouraged prevented era biopower death become scandal catastrophe despite biopower according foucault killed people form power ever done sovereign power sovereign king could kill people exert power start wars simply extend kingdom era biopower wars instead motivated ambition protect life similar motivations also used genocide example nazi germany motivated attempt eradicate jews mentally ill disabled motivation jews threat german health money spent healthcare mentally ill disabled people would better spent viable germans chloë taylor also mentions iraq war motivated similar tenets motivation first iraq thought weapons mass destruction connections alqaeda however bush blair administrations didnt find evidence support either theories motivation war changed new motivation cause war said saddam hussein committed crimes population taylor means modern times war concealed rhetoric humanitarian aid despite fact wars often cause humanitarian century slums increasing number size across western world criminality illness alcoholism prostitution common areas middle class considered people lived slums unmoral lazy middle class also feared underclass sooner later would take population growth greater slums middle class fear gave rise scientific study eugenics whose founder francis galton inspired charles darwin theory natural selection according galton society preventing natural selection helping weak thus causing spread negative qualities rest according foucault body something objective stands outside history culture instead foucault argues body continuously shaped society work diet body ideals exercise medical interventions etc foucault presents theory body write discipline punish well history sexuality foucault critical purely biological explanations phenomena sexuality madness criminality foucault argues body sufficient basis selfunderstanding understanding discipline punish foucault shows power body tied together example disciplinary power primarily focusing individual bodies behavior foucault argues power manipulating bodiesbehavior also manipulates peoples minds foucault turns platonic saying body prison soul phaedo instead posits soul prison according foucault sexology tried exert science referring material body contrast foucault argues sexology pseudoscience sex pseudoscientific idea foucault idea natural biologically grounded fundamental sexuality normative historical construct also used instrument power describing sex biological fundamental cause peoples gender identity sexual identity sexual behavior power effectively able normalize sexual gendered behavior made possible evaluate pathologize correct peoples sexual gendered behavior comparing bodies behaviors constructed normal behavior foucault normal sexuality much construct natural sexuality therefore foucault also critical popular discourse dominated debate sexuality time popular discourse argued liberation sexuality cultural moral capitalistic oppression foucault however argues peoples opinions experiences sexuality always result cultural power mechanisms liberate sexuality one group norms means another group norms takes place however mean foucault considers resistance futile foucault argues rather impossible become completely free power simply natural sexuality power always involves dimension resistance therefore also possibility change although foucault considers impossible step outside powernetworks always possible change networks navigate according foucault body obedient passive object dominated discourses power body also seed resistance dominant discourses power techniques body never fully compliant experiences never fully reduced linguistic descriptions always possibility experience something possible describe words discrepancy also possibility resistance dominant foucaults view historical construction body influenced many feminist queertheorists according johanna oksala foucaults influence queer theory great considered one founders queer theory fundamental idea behind queer theory natural fundament lies behind identities gay lesbian heterosexual etc instead identities considered cultural constructions constructed normative discourses relations power feminists help foucaults ideas studied different ways women form bodies plastic surgery diet eating disorders etc foucaults historization sex also affected feminist theorists judith butler used foucaults theories relation subject power sex question gendered subjects butler follows foucault saying true gender behind gender identity constitutes biological objective fundament however butler critical foucault argues foucault naively presents bodies pleasures ground resistance power without extending historization sexuality gendered subjectsbodies foucault received criticism feminists susan bordo kate johanna oksala argues foucault saying sexsexuality constructed doesnt deny existence sexuality oksala also argues goal critical theories foucaults liberate body sexuality oppression rather question deny identities posited natural essential showing identities historical cultural foucault considered primary project investigation people history made subjectivity foucault state active according foucault subject western philosophers usually considered something given natural objective contrary foucault considers subjectivity construction created foucault talks assujettissement french term foucault refers process power creates subjects also oppressing using social norms foucault social norms standards people encouraged follow also used compare define people example assujettissement foucault mentions homosexual historically contingent type subjectivity created sexology foucault writes sodomy previously considered serious sexual deviation temporary one homosexuality however became species past childhood type life homosexuals power created subjectivity discriminated due homosexuality considered deviation normal sexuality however foucault argues creation subjectivity homosexuality negative consequences people homosexuality also led creation gay bars pride according foucault scientific discourses played important role disciplinary power system classifying categorizing people observing behavior treating behavior considered abnormal defines discourse form oppression require physical force identifies production controlled selected organized redistributed certain number procedures driven individuals aspiration knowledge create rules systems translate social moreover discourse creates force extends beyond societal institutions could found social formal fields health care systems education law enforcement formation fields may seem contribute social development however foucault warns discourses harmful aspects society sciences psychiatry biology medicine economics psychoanalysis psychology sociology ethnology pedagogy criminology categorized behaviors rational irrational normal abnormal human inhuman etc created various types subjectivity internalized people truths people adapted behavior get closer sciences labeled example foucault claims psychological observationsurveillance psychological discourses created type psychologycentered subjectivity led people considering unhappiness fault psychology rather society also according foucault way society resist society turned individual psychological according foucault subjectivity necessarily something forced upon people also something established persons relation example happen person trying find something edward mcgushin describes typical modern activity quest true self self established two levels passive object true self searched active searcher ancient cynics philosopher friedrich nietzsche posited true self found going great hardship andor danger ancient stoics philosopher rené descartes however argued self found quiet solitary introspection yet another example socrates argued selfawareness found debates others debaters question others foundational views opinions foucault however argued subjectivity process rather state foucault argued true self found rather self constitutedcreated activities ones employed find self words exposing oneself hardships danger reveal true self according foucault rather creates particular type self subjectivity however according foucault form subject great part already constituted power selfconstituting practices employed schools workplaces households government institutions entertainment media healthcare sector disciplinary power contribute forming people particular types todd may defines foucaults concept freedom within specific historical context condition according foucault aware situation createdaffected still affected power according may two aspects power shaped peoples way thinking acting described books foucault deals disciplinary power history sexuality however may argues always aspects peoples formation unknown hence constant necessity type analyses foucault foucault argues forces affected people changed people always capacity change factors limit freedom thus state way relation oneself others according todd may foucaults concept freedom also includes constructing histories like ones foucault history disciplinary power investigate describe forces influenced people becoming knowledge reached investigations people thereafter decide forces believe acceptable consider intolerable changed freedom foucault type experimentation different transformations since experiments controlled completely may argues may either lead reconstruction intolerable power relations creation new ones thus may argues always necessary continue experimentation foucauldian foucaults alternative modern subjectivity described cressida heyes critique foucault good bad forms subjectivity since result power way foucault argues good bad norms norms institutions time enabling oppressing therefore foucault argues always crucial continue practice critique foucault practice searches processes events led way questioning came critical ontology present shows peoples current fact historically contingent unstable changeable construction foucault emphasizes since current way necessity also possible change critique also includes investigating people enabled oppressed current norms institutions finding ways reduce limitations freedom resist normalization develop new different way relating oneself others foucault argues impossible go beyond power relations always possible navigate power relations different alternative modern search true part work foucault discusses antique greek term epimeleia heautou care self ἐπιμέλεια ἑαυτοῦ according foucault among ancient greek philosophers selfawareness goal rather something sought order care oneself care self consists foucault calls art living technologies goal techniques according foucault transform oneself ethical person example foucault mentions stoic activity contemplating past future actions evaluating actions line ones values goals contemplation nature contemplation nature another stoic activity consists reflecting small ones existence compared greater foucault described mary beth mader epistemological constructivist foucault critical idea humans reach absolute knowledge world fundamental goal many foucaults works show traditionally considered absolute universal true fact historically contingent foucault even idea absolute knowledge historically contingent idea however lead epistemological nihilism rather foucault argues always begin anew comes time foucault critical modern western philosophy lacking spirituality spirituality foucault refers certain type ethical processes lead state foucault argues spirituality natural part ancient greek philosophy knowledge considered something accessible ethical character according foucault changed cartesian moment moment rené descartes reached insight selfawareness something given cogito ergo sum think therefore insight descartes drew conclusions god world knowledge according foucault since descartes knowledge something separate ethics modern times foucault argues anyone reach knowledge long rational beings educated willing participate scientific
