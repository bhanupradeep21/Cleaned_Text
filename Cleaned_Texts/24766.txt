july one problems encountered launch phase came separation first second stages solidfuel ullage rockets removed interstage first second stages rockets used settle fuel oxidizer sii first stage also carried four retrorockets whereas previous missions used eight first stage engines cutoff cleanly taking four seconds drop thrust zero meant sic closer sii planned ignition second stage disabled

open rocket firing something fact happening precaution crew opened circuit breakers controlled valves stop opened short circuit causing engine fire period troubleshooting determined short circuit deltav thrust switch switch opened valves sps cause switch meant engine fine new procedures would used operating engine stop accidental ignition one reasons success apollo program redundancy critical case sps two independent valve systems engine short switch affected one sets valves still possible fire engine instead sets valves open start ignition troublefree valves would used long burns valves affected short would opened ten seconds closed end burn mission control decided cancel first midcourse correction would give chance fire sps engine second planned correction cancellation meant tasks would done later could brought forward crew could get sleep sooner tasks included water dump putting spacecraft passive thermal control ptc often called barbecue mode spacecraft put slow roll even heat distribution nearly hours launch crew switched lights cabin went sleep second day apollo centered around second planned midcourse correction preliminary check lunar module falcon mission control first got crew perform second burn sps engine planned second course correction designed isolate location short deltav thrust switch burn allowed mission control confirm sps would ignited accidentally faulty switch armed found flight inch mm length wire found way switch shorted engine burn good enough adding fts ms speed mission control cancelled planned second third course corrections venting

replacing hatch crew ate went bed end first full day space morning third day centered around eye flash experiment previous crews experienced bright flashes even closed eyes irwin reported seen two previous sleep periods experiment involves crew facing direction wearing blindfolds placed shades windows described position color time flashes spent hour thought flashes caused cherenkov radiation high energy cosmic rays passing eyes crew entered falcon second time mission control vacuum spacecraft leave vacuum cleaner running rest housekeeping effort remove glass particles left cabin period spacecraft passed point lunar gravity becomes stronger earths felt apollo quiet day crew problems discovered water leak due zerogravity water large ball although spacecraft waterresistant grown large broken apart water everywhere would unpleasant crew leak came loose fitting chlorine injector outlet flight crew would add chlorine water stop bacterial fungal growths place injected tank come loose fourth day saw fourth planned midcourse correction although second actually performed mission burn lasted seconds adding fts ms speed crew put space suits jettisoning sim bay door door jettisoned using explosive cord small risk could cause spacecraft depressurize possible emergency crew spend cruise back earth pressurized space major event day lunar orbit insertion loi occurring behind moon
