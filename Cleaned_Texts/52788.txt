continuously changing common recommendation remaining physical cognitive rest exercise implemented soon possible initial rest period lowers risk post concussion syndrome pcs overall symptoms moderate intensity aerobic exercise provide therapeutic benefits reintroduce body movement patients begin minutes brisk walking exercise bike set mild resistance exacerbates symptoms like headache dizziness
