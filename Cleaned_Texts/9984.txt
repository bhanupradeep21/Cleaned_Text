metabolism biological activity indicating close relationship hexobarbital cytochrome biological effects hexobarbital depend primarily ability penetrate central nervous hexobarbital potentiate gabaa receptors like barbiturates found years enantiomer hexobarbital potentiates gabaa receptors effectively r gaba binds gabaa receptor chloride ion channels open chloride ions flow neuron causes hyperpolarization membrane potential neuron makes less likely neuron start action potential therefore type receptor major inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor mammalian central nervous gabaa receptor potentiator hexobarbital binds barbiturate binding site localized chloride ion channel thereby increasing binding gaba benzodiazepines respective binding site moreover hexobarbital causes chloride ion channel opening longest open state milli seconds thereby causing postsynaptic inhibitory effect contrast gaba glutamate major excitatory neurotransmitter mammalian brain addition inhibitory effect hexobarbital blocks like barbiturates ampa receptors kainate receptors neural acetylcholine receptors barbiturates inhibit glutamate release causing open channel block activated calcium hexobarbital

metabolizes r enantiomer preferentially metabolizes reaction thus stereoselective enantiomers however form α βisomers total four enantiomers metabolized reaction catalyzed cytochrome isomers formed undergo metabolism via glucuronidation dehydrogenation undergoes glucuronidation reaction via udpglucuronosyl transferases ugts readily excreted also undergo dehydrogenation forming reactive ketone biotransformation via enzyme dehydrogenase nadp linked enzyme part aldoketo reductase akr superfamily humans high preference reactions also stereospecific r conformation preferentially forms highest
