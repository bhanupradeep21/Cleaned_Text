bhāskaras wheel hypothetical perpetualmotion machine design created around ce indian mathematician bhāskara ii wheel consisted curved tilted spokes partially filled motion mercury would flow one side spoke another thus forcing wheel continue motion constant dynamic equilibrium like perpetualmotion machines bhaskaras wheel longdiscredited mechanism truly overbalance wheel torque one direction greater cause motion radius spokes would altered throughout course wheels motion would done actively thus consuming energy process machine would cease perpetualmotion engine also important consider wheel moves placed overbalanced position math makes appear overall perfectly possible wheel exert motion placed balance much way pendulum swing moved perfectly vertical position motion continue indefinitely eventually counteracted physicsrelated article stub help wikipedia expanding
