viral load monitoring hiv regular measurement viral load individual hivpositive people part personal plan treatment count viral load routine start hiv various viral load tests might used one way classify tests whether nucleic acid test nonnucleic acid variation cost time takes get result may factors selecting type test viral load monitoring used hivpositive people develop plan personal treatment count viral load routine start hiv treatment changed viral load monitored testing every months confirm stable low viral patients medically stable low viral load two years may get viral load counts every months instead viral load count stable sufficiently low might reason modify hiv hiv treatment changed viral load tested weeks previous treatment guidelines recommended anyone viral load greater copiesml blood begin treatment standard care united states begin antiretroviral treatment upon discovery hiv positive status hiv retrovirus rna virus enters host cell uses host dna replication machinery enzyme reverse transcriptase produce dna viral rna genome hiv also produces integrase enzyme used integrate newly produced viral dna hosts dna virus replicated every time host cells dna replicates due nature virus drugs used treat hiv called antiretroviral medicines course treatment called antiretroviral therapy art potent medicines cure individual however manage virus slow progression hiv infection strict compliance prescribed art regimen vital controlling diseasecitation needed highly active antiretroviral therapy haart current recommended treatment hiv haart entails taking combination regimen three art medications least two different classes drugs six classes art medicationscitation needed class medications uses different mode action blocks virus treatment effective controlling virus combination medications different classes used haart also reduces risk developing drug resistance viral load tests used monitor effects art track viral suppression detect treatment failure successful combination art give fall viral load logs fold within six weeks viral load falling limit detection within four six laboratory monitoring schedule patients using art viral load monitoring hiv complements count another sort test associated monitoring hiv confusion take test results viral load test help determine count cells primary target hiv test quantifies helper cells often combined viral load testing monitor progression hiv testing shows strength immune system report viral activity established centers disease control prevention cdc person hiv count percentage considered increased count result immune response infection recent vaccination decreased count combination higher numbers viral load test indicates increased risk getting sick opportunistic diseasescitation needed receiving art patients undetectable viral load measurements may experience increase viral load low level usually copiesml blood returned undetectable level transient blips indicate virus developing resistance drug therapy blips appear common winter suggesting connection illness colds viral load blips partially explained various patient related factors thought relatively common high level sustained increases viral load frequently related development drug resistance andor viral mutations often dictate changes artcitation needed window period test amount time initial infection event disease exposure hiv followed replication virus may take long six months reach level detectable many testing methods hiv antibody test usually detects hiv antibodies within two eight weeks valid negative result long months initial infection viral load tests also used diagnose hiv infection especially children months born mothers hiv presence maternal antibodies prevents use antibodybased elisa diagnostic pooled viral rna testing shortens window period median days ci although standard care use test diagnosis communities high hiv prevalence test significantly improved negative predictive value generation tests detecting acute hiv safe sex practices recommended people low viral load everyone researchers questioned whether people told low viral load respond information lowering use safe sex research might clarify uncertainty around january researchers switzerland published would termed swiss statement controversially arguing hivpositive individuals antiretroviral therapy viral load copies per ml sexually transmitted diseases partners could assumed transmit disease healthy hivnegative concerns raised bloodbased measures hiv viral concentrations time might reflect actual viral counts semen thus statement could encourage needlessly risky sexual practices though statement authors argued taken june fda approved first diagnostic test capable detecting hiv antigens hiv antibodies abbott architect hiv agab combo test fourthgeneration test increased sensitivity detecting infections acute phase compared generation tests immune system still developing antibodies virus replicating unchecked one study able detect person may unaware infection highly infectious time yet may test negative hiv using tests detect antihiv antibodies although nucleic acid amplification testing naat expensive take week processing argued may still preferred way screen higher viral load value viral elements blood body fluids example individuals hiv contagious earliest acute stages infection sometimes millions copies hiv per centiliter blood according one estimate majority transmissions among gay men uk occur primary phase immune response still developing antibody levels virus acute infection often low detected meaning antibody test highly infectious individual come back negativecitation needed least one documented case hivpositive individual undetectable viral load infecting nevertheless two recent major studies serodiscordant couples positive partner undetectable viral load found linked transmission events despite least unprotected sex among hptn third study found one linked transmission event test group although unclear whether originally infected partner case achieved undetectable viral load time viral load blood corresponds imperfectly viral load parts body individuals undetectable viral loads blood might undetectable viral loads bodily fluids semen vaginal secretions one recent study men undetectable viral loads slight undetectable viral loads however unclear much actually increases transmission riskcitation needed nucleic acid tests typical way measure viral load including hiv three steps procleix ultrio assay done
