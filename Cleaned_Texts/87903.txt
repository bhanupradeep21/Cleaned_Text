mesozoic mammals trochanter zhangheotherium bigger tall vertical trochanter akidolestes smaller broader triangular shape similar differences postcranial skeleton akidolestes cifellii related taxa allow insights ecological differentiation within early therian mammal correlation limb posture locomotor function akidolestes cifellii indicates hypertrophied parafibular process fibula helped flexed function knee joint short neck femur asymmetrical condyles humerus indicate horizontal orientation femur akidolestes probably parasagittal forelimb posture likely semierect sprawling posture forelimbs akidolestes considered traditional terrestrial mammal like zhangheotherium maotherium although debate whether asymmetrical femoral condyles suggest akidolestes terrestrial mammal arboreal postcranial skeleton cretaceous mammal akidolestes cifellii locomotor adaptations author argued zhangheotherium maotherium considered terrestrial mammals symmetrical knee author noted asymmetrical femoral condyles indicate akidolestes lived arboreal hypertrophied parafibula fibula medial malleolus tibia suggests akidolestes terrestrial however girdle important factor inferring habitat preference akidolestes well pectoral girdle akidolestes glenoid fossa smaller humeral head offer great range rotation moreover akidolestes scapula triangular outline similar ornithorhynchus haldanodon scapula zhangheotherium rectangular ornithorhynchus semifossorial semiaquatic monotreme swim haldanodon terrestrial mammal semifossorial semiaquatic time hooklike large coracoid process scapula make akidolestes closer arboreal mammals terrestrial overall akidolestes likely terrestrial mammal restricted singular living akidolestes cifellii fossil found yixian yixian formation one composition jehol
