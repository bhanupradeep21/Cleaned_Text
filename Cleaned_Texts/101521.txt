hiv drug reaction adverse drug reaction caused drugs used treatment hivaids drug reactions major cause mortality morbidity around world special populations people hivpositive hundred times susceptible immunemediated adverse drug reactions general commonly prescribed medications hiv sulfonamides anticonvulsants antibacterials antifungals antimycobacterials notably antiretrovirals increased incidence adverse cutaneous drug reactions hivpositive individuals even greater escalation incidence people advanced disease progression form specific mechanism hiv infection increases risk drug reactions hivpositive individuals unclear many factors contribute increased risk adverse drug reactions found among people hiv explanations involve polypharmacy slow acetylator status glutathione deficiency addition also thought caused immune hyperactivation altered immunoregulatory pathways reactivation comorbid herpes viral infections altered redox balance uncontrolled immune activation loss thelper cells single defined cause association prescription medications likely cause adverse drug reactions others nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors shown highest rate causing immunerelated drug reactions people hiv positive trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole also known brands bactrim septra caused adverse cutaneous drug reactions incidence general population patients hiv infection retrospective study adult patients pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia aids admitted veterans general hospital taiwan january december treated trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole demonstrated high incidence adverse drug reactions mostly involved skin liver significant risk factors daily dose greater mgkg trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole age older use antiretroviral therapies decreased risk early mortality improved quality life people hivpositive significant increase use medications seen years estimated million people receiving antiretrovirals therapies approximately million estimated people worldwide despite success efforts treat control disease medications reports people received treatment developed severe adverse drug reaction druginduced liver injury dili antiretrovirals including nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors nnrtis transcriptase inhibitors nrtis reported cause dili people hiv genetic variations drug metabolizing enzymes associated higher risk adverse drug reactions people hiv taking antiretrovirals may become recommended practice precision medicine screen genetic susceptibility adverse effects based enzymes reported incidence antiretroviral therapy induced liver injury range people hiv among people needed change medication plan even discontinue current therapy druginduced liver injury common cause prolonged hospital stays people hiv severe reactions lifethreatening antiretrovirals may also cause damage cells person hiv decreasing function crucial cells releasing toxins body thus discontinuing offending medication may cause loss control viral load ultimately treatment failure studies reported efavirenz potential agent caused drug induced liver injury hivpositive patients taking first line antiretroviral therapy efavirenztenofovir disoproxil fumarateemtricitabine reported risk factors drug induced liver injury female gender young age high count classes antiretroviral medications could cause drug induced liver injury classes medications may toxic research needed better understand analyze potential differences risk levels classes antiretrovirals diagnosis hiv drug caused drug induced liver injury dili important way figure whether art drug causes drug dili blood test see ast alt level ast alt level increase hiv drugs causing addition high level ast alt level bilirubin gammaglutamiltranspeptidase ggt may also increase art hiv treatment normally hepatic toxicity may suspected bilirubin ggt levels higher normal level however studies shown art drug may inhibit udpglucuronosyltransferase causes indirect total bilirubin moreover increase ggt may indication cholelithiasis cholelithiasis could worse damage hepatocyte however increasing ggt may variable reasons mechanism art causes high ggt still unknown gold standard determine cholelithiasis occurs alkaline diagnosis zidovudine related zidovudine counters hiv two ways directly inhibit reverse transcriptase converting viral rna dna hiv integrate human dna addition zidovudine works dna replication chain terminator dna chain terminator feature bone marrow may suppressed production red blood cells decreased moreover zidovudine may also increase destruction red blood may continue decrease red blood cell count blood smears cases zidovudinerelated anemia usually show megaloblastic macrocytic anemia associated vitamin folic acid deficiency mechanism occur still unknown diagnosis nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor nrti related lactic nrti increase lactate production disrupting normal mitochondrial metabolic pathway nadnadh cycle impair lipid betaoxidation oxidative phosphorylation long chain fatty acids unable broken preferred metabolic pathway oxidation changed glycolysis glycolysis produces excessive lactic acid leading lactic acidosis test results indicate lactic acidosis two types lactic acidosis commonly seen termed type type b lactic acidosis type lactic acidosis mainly caused systemic ischemia since oxygen trouble delivered tissues biochemical metabolic pathway shifted glycolysis generate atp therefore shifting increases lactic acid level leads lactic acidosis type b lactic acidosis likely caused exogenous toxins nrti since treatment lactic acidosis mainly treat underlying causes important differentiate type type b lactic acidosis since type lactic acidosis likely caused ischemia use additional imaging blood test screen ischemia condition ischemia found type lactic acidosis eliminated multiple preventative measures shown decrease incidences immune medicated adverse drug reactions abacavir hiv medication cause adverse reactions like hives fevers additionally contraindicated rechallenging thus making important people seeking start abacavir proceed caution advancement precision medicine genetic testing shown decrease incidence adverse drug however cost accessibility genetic testing often barrier populations benefit precision medicine hiv medications contraindicated rechallenging desensitization viable option starting new medication desensitization slowly increasing strength dose medication proven reduce adverse drug reactions example people living hiv higher likelihood developing adverse drug reaction cotrimoxazole however desensitization methods shown lower rate hypersensitivity compared trying rechallenge another example desensitization treatment yearold female infected hiv years gone multiple antiretroviral therapy treatments developed cutaneous adverse reaction generations nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors nrtis darunavirr chosen first therapy drug resistance susceptibility mind eight days treatment forced halt medication therapy developed severe pruritic cutaneous adverse reaction darunavirr thought rechallenging turned due severity adverse reaction however limited options desensitization protocol darunavirr initiated dosed every minutes starting ending first day treatment treatment completed problem generalized pruritus without rash contained use antihistamines week antihistamine treatment future signs adverse reactions continuing unlike precision medicine greater number medications existing desensitization protocols proven help decrease incidence adverse drug reactions people considering treatment adverse drug reaction needs analysis weighing risks versus benefits many people living hiv comorbid conditions may lead increasing need introducing new medications people living hiv may increase burden polypharmacy majority cutaneous adverse reactions benign thus treatment often required however monitoring still required prevent complications may arise worsening adverse drug aging leads changes bodys physiologic functions elderly people years age decreased liver function decreased renal clearance drugs compared younger due physiologic changes pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics impacted leading increased decreased drug effect increased risk experiencing adverse drug important consider physiologic changes prescribing administering medications treat hiv hivpositive individuals years age older age smoking longer duration hiv infection associated increased risk developing multiple conditions addition hiv hypertension
