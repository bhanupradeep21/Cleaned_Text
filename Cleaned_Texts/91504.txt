anatomical study lenins brain german neurologist psychiatrist oskar vogt significant event history neuroscience study aimed understand neural basis lenins political intellectual abilities research conducted request soviet government wanted prove lenins supposed genius result brains superior vogts leadership kaiser wilhelm institute brain research berlin established study lenins brain one institutes first major histological analysis methods used examine tissue samples helped establish procedure viable way studying brain though certain structural aspects lenins brain said contribute heightened cognitive ability vogt nonetheless unable identify particular region within lenins brain provided structural proof lenins genius study limitations controversies significant context field vladimir lenin russian communist revolutionary politician played key role bolshevik revolution became first head soviet union served position death lenins leadership ideas instrumental establishment socialist state russia spread communism around world lenins death sparked debate among soviet scientists intellectuals nature genius argued abilities result upbringing education political experience others believed rooted brains unique structure latter view prevailed soviet government commissioned vogt study lenins brain study lenins brain vogt conducted context emerging field neuropsychology aimed understand relationship brain function behavior time dominant theory neuropsychology phrenology held shape skull indicative persons personality intellectual abilities vogt however rejected phrenology instead used modern technique histological analysis study lenins brain involved examining tissue samples microscope identify structural differences could account lenins abilities vogts study lasting impact neuroscience helped establish histological analysis viable method studying brain led research relationship brain structure function today study brain anatomy function thriving field contributed understanding cognition behavior neurological disorders one limitations vogts study conducted postmortem relied small number tissue samples additionally vogts study take account possibility functional changes brain resulting environmental factors learning experience despite limitations vogts study remains important historical scientific landmark highlighting role neuroscience understanding human behavior complex interplay biology environment shaping cognition personality study dissection lenin brain directly attributed field phrenology neuroscientific field developed franz joseph gall examines relationship mental ability brain reasons behind dissecting lenin brain means pursuit soviet deification lenin unique event rather due fact lenin considered genius geniusness identifiable within brain historical search biological roots extraordinary brain capacity particular interest throughout centuries built franz joseph gall late century idea would scientifically beneficial examine brains geniuses mental qualities faculties derived conjunction lifelong consideration lenin one greatest geniuses time immediate action examine brain upon death sought provide insight relationship intellectual capabilities brain expectation results dissecting lenin brain due lenin mentally extraordinary gifted individual brain must unique identifiable within brain vladimir ilyich ulyanov death occurred january gorki near moscow january autopsy performed professor aleksey abrikosov russian pathologists professor otfried foerster attendance brain lenins brain weighed grams showed signs degeneration particularly left additionally two areas softening observed right occipitotemporal border blood vessels corpora quadrigemina congested blood signs hemorrhage abrikosov diagnosed deceased diffuse atherosclerosis primarily brain arteries however researchers since argued lenin diagnosed neurosyphilis according recent studies mutation gene given soviet union attempts conceal lenins venereal disease well hide illness entirely diagnosis remains debate neuroanatomical research pursuit identifying intellectual genius recurrent russian universities medical faculties collected brains medical professors notable individuals donated organs scientific research lenin considered greatest geniuses brain expected unique therefore following death oskar vogt neuroanatomist university berlin requested conduct histological examinations brain research institute institute especially established vogt conduct analyses lenins vogt conducted comprehensive analysis lenins brain involving pages fifteen albums brain methodologies adopted vogt included cutting mounting staining serial sections entire brain obtain minute parcellation cerebral cortex significant finding unusually high number size pyramidal cells third layer cerebral cortex vogt called association neurons seen confirmation lenins supposed november vogt presented findings highranking officials pantheon hall moscow brain research abundance pyramidal neurons attributed lenins exceptional intellectual organizational skills well rigorous mental training political wilder penfield wrote letter mother confirming validity vogts study lenins brain according penfield visit brain research institute berlin visitors shown many large nerve cells third layer gray matter lenins brain lack reliable morphometric statistical controls limited significance cytoarchitectonic observations finding association neurons sufficient please politbureau without compromising vogts integrity germanys relationship presentation vogt emphasized need comparative quantitative research including brains elite individuals well diverse ethnic groups due hitlers rise power changing political climate germany russia bringing end cooperation neuroscientific research vogt activities moscow brain research institute ceased proceed comparative experimentation vogt fired directorship kaiser wilhelm institute brain contrary lenin autopsy found many irregularities related deteriorated condition upon last years life dissection brain purpose physically identifying extraordinary mental prowess generally today general agreement among neuroscientists broad concepts genius extraordinary mental prowess pinned physical locations furthermore upon conclusion dissection lenin brain existed many indications expressing perplexity matter amongst neuroscience community well regret within vogt potentially overexposing turn brings question validity acceptance project conclusions despite vogt concluded dissection lenin brain exclaiming lenin brain athlete association giant heightened ability brain conclusion lenin still prevalent overseers dissection brain married couple neurologists oskar cecile
