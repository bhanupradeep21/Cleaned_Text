hallucinatory palinopsia subtype palinopsia visual disturbance defined persistent recurrence visual image stimulus palinopsia broad term describing group symptoms divided hallucinatory palinopsia illusory hallucinatory palinopsia refers projection alreadyencoded visual memory similar complex visual hallucination creation formed visual image none exists hallucinatory palinopsia usually arises posterior cortical lesions seizures presenting symptom serious neurological disease hallucinatory palinopsia describes afterimages scenes formed longlasting high resolution isochromatic palinoptic images typically reliant environmental parameters often present homonymous visual field deficits hallucinatory palinopsia occurs unpredictably persistent images appear anywhere visual field regardless location original stimulus patient often episodes hallucinatory palinopsia visual perseveration synonymous palinopsia term greek palin opsia seeing formed image perseveration refers single stationary object remains fixed ones visual field pathological afterimages look realistic color clarity original stimulus palinopsia lasts least seconds may persist hours days example patient sees cat identical copy cat remains fixed field view patient commonly complains perseverated fingers examiner afterimages often occur visual field deficits may occur anywhere visual field regardless location original stimulus generation afterimages affected external conditions length fixation brightness stimulus contrast motion palinoptic image appear immediately seeing original image may delayed time scene perseveration refers seeing previouslyviewed short stereotyped scene continuously replays several minutes example patient might view person throwing ball hour later perceives action sequence repeated many palinoptic scene usually color clarity original understanding visual memory considers short scene unit memory similar thus scene perseveration probably mechanistically related formed image perseveration categorical incorporation refers seeing object feature superimposing onto comparable objects people example seeing person wearing hat hat seen subsequent person seen person sees spire building incorporates top structures palinoptic images characteristics original stimulus episodes categorical incorporation usually last minutes categorical incorporation highlights brains use constructs process stimuli patterned visual spread describes spread pattern field view example patient sees checkered pattern lamp contiguously spreads objects floor desk contextual clues influence patterned visual spread distinguishing categorical incorporation published cases palinopsia posterior cortical lesions seizures described hallucinatory hallucinatory palinopsia may caused many types posterior cortical lesions arteriovenous hallucinatory palinopsia seizures may secondary focal cortical lesion may secondary nonstructural disturbance causes seizures reported cause palinopsia include metabolic disturbances carnitine ion channel seizures unknown hallucinatory palinopsia dysfunction visual memory caused localized cortical hyperexcitability hyperactivity posterior visual pathway postgeniculate cortical lesions seizures may cause cortical deafferentation focal cortical irritation epileptic discharges proposed mechanisms hallucinatory palinopsia palinopsia occur posterior visual pathway postgeniculate deafferentation causes homonymous visual field deficits mechanism thought similar deafferentation hyperexcitability seen visual release hallucinations charles bonnet distinguished palinopsia whether formed image scene previously occurred hypothesized deafferentation hyperexcitability cause neuropathic pain molecular changes deafferentation include increase presynaptic neurotransmitter vesicles heightened postsynaptic receptor palinopsia epileptic discharges confirmed electroencephalogram reported seizure aura seizure seizures originate anywhere posterior visual pathway depending location pathology palinoptic seizures rarely generalize case reports palinopsia symptom visual seizures persistent continual palinoptic episodes often occur palinopsia occurs neurosurgical procedures cerebrovascular accidents partly attributed focal cortical symptoms associated perilesional hyperperfusion may reflect focal cortical instability subsequent reports palinopsia individual mechanism usually combination aforementioned mechanisms example hallucinatory palinopsia may present patient seizure symptoms visual field deficits neurosurgical suggests cortical hyperactivity mechanism additive hallucinatory palinopsia considered disorder nondominant parietooccipital lobe since shown occur lesions dominant nondominant temporal parietal occipital lobes predominance lesions certain cortical areas likely due uneven distribution functional variation visual cortexhippocampal neurons hallucinatory palinopsia symptoms occur concomitantly patient one lesion supports current evidence objects features scenes units visual memory perhaps different levels processing alludes neuroanatomical integration visual memory creation palinopsia necessitates full ophthalmologic neurologic history physical exam hallucinatory palinopsia warrants automated visual field testing neuroimaging since majority hallucinatory palinopsia caused posterior cortical lesions seizures generally easy diagnose underlying cause hallucinatory palinopsia medical history typically includes concerning symptoms neuroimaging usually reveals cortical lesions patients hallucinatory palinopsia unremarkable neuroimaging blood tests clinical history often hints cause practitioner considering visual seizures cases palinopsia cerebrovascular accidents generally resolves spontaneously treatment focused vasculopathic risk factors palinopsia neoplasms avms abscesses require treatment underlying condition usually also resolves palinopsia palinopsia due seizures generally resolves correcting primary disturbance andor treating seizures persistent hallucinatory palinopsia trial antiepileptic drug attempted antiepileptics reduce cortical excitability could potentially treat
