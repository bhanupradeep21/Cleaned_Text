pepsin ˈpɛpsɪn endopeptidase breaks proteins smaller peptides produced gastric chief cells stomach lining one main digestive enzymes digestive systems humans many animals helps digest proteins food pepsin aspartic protease using catalytic aspartate active one three principal endopeptidases enzymes cutting proteins middle human digestive system two chymotrypsin trypsin also exopeptidases remove individual amino acids ends proteins carboxypeptidases produced pancreas aminopeptidases secreted small intestine process digestion enzymes specialized severing links particular types amino acids collaborate break dietary proteins components ie peptides amino acids readily absorbed small intestine cleavage specificity pepsin broad amino acids like tyrosine phenylalanine tryptophan increase

hydrochloric acid creates acidic environment allows pepsinogen unfold cleave autocatalytic fashion thereby generating pepsin active form pepsin cleaves amino acids pepsinogen create pepsin pepsinogens

pepsin fully denatured irreversibly inactivated ph therefore pepsin solutions ph reactivated upon reacidification stability pepsin high ph significant implications disease attributed laryngopharyngeal reflux pepsin remains larynx following gastric reflux mean ph laryngopharynx ph pepsin would inactive could reactivated upon subsequent acid reflux events resulting damage local tissues pepsin exhibits broad cleavage specificity pepsin digest ingested amide residues important determining cleavage probability generally hydrophobic amino acids positions increase cleavage probability phenylalanine leucine methionine position phenylalanine tryptophan tyrosine position result highest cleavage cleavage disfavoured positively charged amino acids histidine lysine arginine pepsin one primary causes mucosal damage laryngopharyngeal pepsin remains larynx ph following gastric reflux enzymatically inactive environment pepsin would remain stable could reactivated upon subsequent acid reflux exposure laryngeal mucosa enzymatically active pepsin irreversibly inactivated pepsin acid results reduced expression protective proteins thereby increases laryngeal susceptibility pepsin may also cause mucosal damage weakly acidic nonacid gastric reflux weak nonacid reflux correlated reflux symptoms mucosal nonacid conditions neutral ph pepsin internalized cells upper airways larynx
