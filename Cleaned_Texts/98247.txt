tcell depletion tcd process cell removal reduction alters immune system responses depletion occur naturally ie hiv induced treatment purposes tcd reduce risk graftversushost disease gvhd common issue transplants idea tcd allograft eliminate gvhd first introduced humans first tcd performed severe combined immunodeficiency cell depletion methods broadly categorized either physical immunological examples physical separation include using counterflow centrifugal elutriation fractionation density gradients differential agglutination lectins followed rosetting sheep red blood cells immunological methods utilize antibodies either alone conjunction homologous heterologous rabbit complement factors directed cells addition techniques used techniques performed either vivo ex vivo ex vivo techniques enable accurate count cells graft also option addback set number cells necessary currently ex vivo techniques commonly employ positive negative selection methods using immunomagnetic separation contrast invivo tcd performed using antit cell antibodies recently posthsct method depletion occurs heavily affect results ex vivo tcd predominantly used gvhd prevention offers best however complete tcd via ex vivo especially acute myeloid leukemia aml patients usually improve vivo depletion often uses monoclonal antibodies eg alemtuzumab haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation vivo tcd suppressed lymphocytes early however incidence rate cytomegalovirus cmv reactivations elevated problems overcome combining tcd haploidentical graft posthsct contrast vivo tcd alemtuzumab vitro tcd selection performed although tcd beneficial prevent gvhd problems cause delay recovery immune system transplanted individual decreased graftversustumor effect problem partially answered selective depletion depletion αβtcell b cell preserves important cells immune another method addition cells back graft comprehensive tcd method examples reintroduction natural killer cells nk γδ regulatory cells early apparent tcd good preventing gvhd also led increased graft rejection problem solved transplanting hematopoietic stem cells procedure called megadose transplantation prevents rejection stem cells ability ie veto cell killing protect hosts immune experiments show transplantation types veto cells along megadose haploidentical hsct allows reduce toxicity conditioning regimen makes treatment much safer applicable many veto cells also exert graft vs tumor hiv confirmed target cells destroy making cell depletion important hallmark comparison hiv individuals cells proliferate higher rate hiv apoptosis also occurs frequently hiv depletion regulatory cells increases immune activation regulation associated activation cells thus expression used track loss cells antiretroviral therapy common treatment patients hiv shown restore cell body responds cell depletion producing equal amount cells however time individuals immune system longer continue replace called tap drain hypothesis tcds role cancer increasing rise immunotherapies investigated specifically target selfantigens one example antigenspecific cell tolerance serves primary mechanism restricting immunotherapeutic responses endogenous self antigen guanylyl cyclase c colorectal however cases selective cell tolerance provides unique therapeutic opportunity maximize self antigentargeted immune antitumor responses without inducing autoimmunity incorporating self antigenindependent cell epitopes cancer mammary carcinoma model depletion regulatory cells increase amount target kill phenotypic functional characteristics regulatory cells lupus patients differ healthy patients however depletion regulatory cells results intense flares systemic lupus erythematosus vivo depletion regulatory cells hypothesized occur via early apoptosis induction follow exposure self ags arise mcmv rare herpesvirus cause disseminated fatal disease immunodeficient animals similar disease caused human cytomegalovirus immunodeficient humans depletion cells prior mcmv infection effectively upregulates antiviral activity natural killer cells depletion post infection effect nk preliminary study effect tcd arthritis mice models shown regulatory cells play important role delayedtype hypersensitivity arthritis dtha inflammation occurs tcd inducing increased neutrofils activity tcd heavily used haploidentical stem cell transplantation hsct process cancer patients receive infusion healthy stem cells compatible donor replenish bloodforming patients acute myeloid leukemia aml first remission ex vivo tcd greatly reduced incidence rate gvhd though survival comparable conventional allogeneic bone marrow transplants bmt transplanted stem cells derive bone marrow cases donors genetically similar identical risk gvhd first ex vivo tcd trials used monoclonal antibodies still high incidence rates gvhd additional treatment using complement immunotoxins along antitcell antibody improved depletion thus increasing prevention depleting αβ cells infused graft spares γδ cells nk cells promotes homeostatic reconstitution thus reducing risk vitro tcd selectively monoclonal antibody lowers rate acute chronic gvhd post allogeneic bmt immune suppressive medications usually unnecessary cells removed donor patients relapse even tcd allogeneic bone marrow transplant though patients chronic myelogenous
