tropics subtropics made palythoa corals ostreopsis dinoflagellates possibly bacteria occurring organisms found many species like fish crabs due process biomagnification also found organisms living close palytoxin producing organisms like sponges mussels starfish people rarely exposed palytoxin exposures happened people eaten sea animals like fish crabs also aquarium hobbyists handled palythoa
