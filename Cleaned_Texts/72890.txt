pallesthesia ˌpalesˈthēzhēə vibratory sensation ability perceive sensation often conducted skin bone usually generated mechanoreceptors pacinian corpuscles merkel disk receptors tactile receptors stimulate action potential afferent nerves sensory neurons found various layers skin body afferent neuron travels spinal column brain information processed damage peripheral nervous system central nervous system result decline loss pallesthesia diminished sense vibration known determine whether patient diminished absent pallesthesia testing conducted using tuning fork hz placing skin overlying bone works bones good resonators pacinian corpuscles merkel disk receptors tactile corpuscles encapsulated nerve endings involved tactile pacinian corpuscles located within deeper layer skin skin subcutaneous tissues within muscles periosteum deeper layers body merkel disk receptors located superficial epidermis hair follicles tactile corpuscles concentrated heavily merkel disk receptors tactile corpuscles respond best low frequencies producing action potential sensory conduction pathway allows cognitive recognition vibration occurs afferent neurons also known sensory neurons outside stimulus vibration activates one three encapsulated nerve endings based upon sensation felt intensity vibration must cause neurons reach surpass threshold order action potential propagated signal travels dorsal lemniscus pathway pathway composed dorsal column within spinal cord medial lemniscus brain collectively ascending sensory fibers called dorsal column ascending fibers gather dorsal

determines intensity duration vibration lower limbs higher threshold upper limbs stronger stimulus needed accuracy homologous sites left right side body need tested person may lose perception pallesthesia switching sides probably due sensory adaptation receptors require larger threshold produce action potential previous stimulation person reports asymmetrical perception may indicate underlining neurological lack perception tuning fork applied normal area applied abnormal area opposite side vibration testing often used distinguish different neurological disorders understand neurological pathways functions often conducted older people advancing age leads decline vibratory sensation older people may complete loss vibratory sensation toes determine cause age neurological disorder useful compare another person benefit pallesthesia testing used identify disorders within neural pathways areas neural pathway sensation perception vibration disturbed testing enables doctors accurately diagnose patients health help identify effects diseases nervous system diabetes mellitus peripheral nervous system composed afferent efferent neurons disorder neurons called peripheral neuropathy vibration examination detect localize disorders peripheral nervous system gradual loss sensation toes knees consistent peripheral nerve problem whereas impairment perceiving vibration extremities sign posterior column impairments classified peripheral nervous system posterior column indicators demyelination afferent neurons variety causes myelopathy disorder within spinal cord compression spinal cord bony projections displaced disk cervical spine common causes inflammation illness neurodegenerative nutritional vascular disorders also contribute myelopathy quantitative vibratory testing used assess patient myelopathy examiner detects uniform loss vibration certain spinal level example examination normal iliac crest knees pallesthesia absent knees toes would consistent central nervous system composed spinal cord brain many neurological studies conducted patients lesions scientists learn functions different brain areas looking damage areas thus studies conducted lesion patients pallesthesia common disease central nervous system multiple sclerosis disease immune system attacks myelin sheath surrounding neurons deterioration myelin sheath drastically reduces conduction speed neurons thus affecting sensation motor control body patients exhibit largest reduction pallesthesia perceive vibration hz however studies shown hz perceived young multiple sclerosis diabetes mellitus disorder body break glucose either insulin produced body produce enough insulin causes glucose accumulate blood high concentrations glucose blood injure nerve fibers resulting diabetic cases nerve damage occurs afferent neurons foot lower limbs nerve damage assessed pallesthesia inability sense vibration applied tuning fork nerve damage occurred doctor assesses damage places patient treatment severe cases may include amputation foot limb early pallesthesia used research method many disorders sensory system scientists hoped find new therapy reconstruct neuronal outputs understood damage central nervous system could repaired however hoped rewire peripheral nervous system give patients sensation back one study looked effects pallesthesia stroke theorized sinusoidal stimulation may effective therapy however results inconclusive rare current research use pallesthesia better methods testing sensory system developed
