microbial dna barcoding use dna metabarcoding characterize mixture microorganisms dna metabarcoding method dna barcoding uses universal genetic markers identify dna mixture using metabarcoding assess microbial communities long history back carl woese mitchell sogin stephen sogin first tried detect several families within bacteria using rrna years later new tree life three domains proposed woese colleagues first use small subunit ribosomal rna ssu rrna gene distinguish bacteria archaea approach ssu rrna gene made way frequently used genetic marker prokaryotes rrna eukaryotes rrna tedious process cloning dna fragments sequencing got fastened steady improvement sequencing technologies development hts highthroughputsequencing early ability deal massive data using modern bioinformatics cluster algorithms investigating microbial life got much easier genetic diversity varying species species therefore possible identify distinct species recovery short dna sequence standard part genome short sequence defined barcode sequence requirements specific part genome serve barcode high variation two different species much differences gene two individuals species make differentiating individual species bacteria archaea rrnardna gene used common housekeeping gene prokaryotic organisms therefore used standard barcode assess prokaryotic diversity protists corresponding rrnardna gene distinguish different species fungi internal transcribed spacer region ribosomal cistron existing diversity microbial world unraveled completely yet although know mainly composed bacteria fungi unicellular taxonomic identification microbial eukaryotes requires exceedingly skillful expertise often difficult due small sizes organisms fragmented individuals hidden diversity cryptic prokaryotes simply taxonomically assigned using traditional methods like microscopy small morphologically indistinguishable therefore via use dna metabarcoding possible identify organisms without taxonomic expertise matching short high throughput sequences htsderived gene fragments reference sequence database eg mentioned qualities make dna barcoding costeffective reliable less timeconsuming method compared traditional ones meet increasing need largescale environmental assessments lot studies followed first usage woese et al covering variety applications biological ecological research metabarcoding used also medicine human biology bacterial barcodes used eg investigate microbiome bacterial colonization human gut normal obese comparison studies newborn child adult gut bacteria additionally barcoding plays major role biomonitoring eg rivers grassland conservation parasitology environmental parasitology paleoparasitology rely barcoding useful tool disease investigating management cyanobacteria group photosynthetic prokaryotes similar prokaryotes taxonomy cyanobacteria using dna sequences mostly based similarity within ribosomal thus common barcode used identification cyanobacteria rdna marker difficult define species within prokaryotic organisms marker used determining individual operational taxonomic units otus cases otus also linked traditionally defined species therefore considered reliable representation evolutionary however analyzing taxonomic structure biodiversity whole cyanobacterial community see dna metabarcoding informative use markers specific cyanobacteria universal bacterial primers used successfully isolate cyanobacterial rdna environmental samples also recover many bacterial use phytospecific markers commonly used focusing cyanobacteria sets primers tested barcoding metabarcoding environmental samples gave good results screening majority nonphotosynthetic noncyanobacterial number sequenced cyanobacterial genomes available databases besides marker phylogenetic studies could therefore include also variable sequences sequences proteincoding genes gyrb rpoc rbcl internal transcribed spacer ribosomal rna genes phycocyanin intergenic spacer however nifd nifh used identification nitrogenfixing cyanobacterial strains dna barcoding cyanobacteria applied various ecological evolutionary taxonomical studies examples include assessment cyanobacterial diversity community identification harmful cyanobacteria ecologically economically important assessment cyanobacterial symbionts marine potential serve part routine monitoring programs occurrence cyanobacteria well early detection potentially toxic species waterbodies might help us detect harmful species start form blooms thus improve water management strategies species identification based environmental dna could particularly useful cyanobacteria traditional identification using microscopy challenging morphological characteristics basis species delimitation vary different growth identification microscope also timeconsuming therefore relatively costly molecular methods detect much lower concentration cyanobacterial cells sample traditional identification methods reference database collection dna sequences assigned either species function used link molecular obtained sequences organism preexisting taxonomy general databases like ncbi platform include kind sequences either whole genomes specific marker genes organisms also different platforms sequences distinct group organisms stored eg unite exclusively fungi sequences database solely protist ribosomal databases curated allows taxonomic assignment higher accuracy using uncurated databases reference httpsenwikipediaorgwikimicrobialdnabarcoding
