alzheimers neuropsychological assessments definitively diagnose prosopagnosia one commonly used test famous faces tests individuals asked recognize faces famous persons however test difficult standardize benton facial recognition test bfrt another test used neuropsychologists assess face recognition skills individuals presented target face six test faces asked identify test face matches target face images cropped eliminate hair clothes many people prosopagnosia use hair clothing cues recognize faces male female faces used test first six items one test face matches target face next seven items three test faces match target faces poses different reliability bfrt questioned study conducted duchaine nakayama showed average score selfreported prosopagnosics within normal one reason may way test designed people developmental prosopagnosia often use piecemeal strategies test encourages providing target face compare possible matching faces test increases difficulty facial features become obscured due position lighting leading normal control subjects rely exact strategy looking individual features match target test may useful identifying patients apperceptive prosopagnosia since mainly matching test unable recognize familiar unfamiliar faces would unable pass test would useful diagnosing patients associative prosopagnosia since able match facescitation needed cambridge face memory test cfmt developed duchaine nakayama better diagnose people prosopagnosia test initially presents individuals three images six different target faces presented many threeimage series contain one image target face two distracters duchaine nakayama showed cfmt accurate efficient previous tests diagnosing patients prosopagnosia study compared two tests patients diagnosed cfmt patients diagnosed bfrt however similar bfrt patients asked essentially match unfamiliar faces seen briefly start test test widely used need testing considered prosopagnosia index freely available validated selfreport questionnaire used alongside computerbased face recognition tests help identify individuals prosopagnosia validated using objective measures face perception ability including famous face recognition tests cambridge face memory test less general population score less widely accepted management strategies acquired prosopagnosia person difficulty recognizing peoples faces stroke generally low rate acquired prosopagnosia sometimes spontaneously selective inabilities recognize faces documented early century included case studies hughlings jackson charcot however named term prosopagnosia first used joachim bodamer de german neurologist described three cases including man sustained bullet wound head lost ability recognize friends family even face however able recognize identify sensory modalities auditory tactile even visual stimuli patterns gait physical mannerisms bodamer gave paper title die prosopagnosie derived classical greek πρόσωπον prósōpon meaning face αγνωσία agnōsía meaning nonknowledge october bill choisser began popularizing term face blindness earliestknown use term medical case prosopagnosia dr p oliver sacks book man mistook wife hat though properly considered one general visual agnosia although dr p could recognize wife face able recognize voice recognition pictures family friends appeared based highly specific features brothers square jaw big teeth oliver sacks prosopagnosia know much study prosopagnosia crucial development theories face perception prosopagnosia unitary disorder ie different people may show different types levels impairment argued face perception involves number stages cause qualitative differences impairment different persons prosopagnosia may sort evidence crucial supporting theory may specific face perception system brain researchers agree facial perception process holistic rather featural perception objects holistic perception face involve explicit representation local features ie eyes nose mouth etc rather considers face prototypical face specific spatial layout eyes always located nose nose located mouth beneficial use holistic approach recognize individualspecific faces group similar layouts holistic processing face exactly damaged able recognize specific spatial layout characteristics facial features unable process one entire face counterintuitive many people everyone believes faces special perceived different way objects rest world though evidence suggests visual objects processed holistic manner eg dogs dog experts size effects smaller less consistently demonstrated faces study conducted diamond carey showed true performing tests dogshow judges showed pictures dogs judges control group inverted pictures showed dogshow judges greater difficulty recognizing dogs inverted compared control group inversion effect increased difficulty recognizing picture inverted shown effect previously believed inversion effect associated faces study shows may apply category also argued prosopagnosia may general impairment understanding individual perceptual components make structure gestalt object psychologist martha farah particularly associated developmental prosopagnosia difficult thing child understand cope many adults developmental prosopagnosia report long time idea deficit face processing unaware others could distinguish people solely facial prosopagnosia children may overlooked may appear shy slightly odd due inability recognize faces may also hard time making friends may recognize classmates often make friends children clear distinguishing featurescitation
