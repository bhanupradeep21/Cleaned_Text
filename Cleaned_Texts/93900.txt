rely development refinement image acquisition representation analysis visualization interpretation functional structural neuroimaging core mapping aspect brain mapping scientists criticized brain imagebased claims made scientific journals popular press like discovery part brain responsible things like love musical abilities specific memory many mapping techniques relatively low resolution including hundreds thousands neurons single voxel many functions also involve multiple parts brain meaning type claim probably unverifiable equipment used generally based incorrect assumption brain functions divided may brain functions described correctly measured much finegrained measurements look large regions instead large number tiny individual brain circuits many studies also technical problems like small sample size poor equipment calibration means reproduced considerations sometimes ignored produce sensational journal article news headline cases brain mapping techniques used
