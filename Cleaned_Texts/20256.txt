molars molar teeth large flat teeth back mouth developed mammals used primarily grind food chewing name molar derives latin molaris dens meaning millstone tooth mola millstone dens tooth molars show great deal diversity size shape across mammal groups third molar humans sometimes vestigial humans molar teeth either four five cusps adult humans molars four groups three back mouth third rearmost molar group called wisdom tooth last tooth appear breaking front gum age although varies among individuals populations many cases tooth human mouth contains upper maxillary lower mandibular molars maxillary first molar maxillary second molar maxillary third molar mandibular first molar mandibular second molar mandibular third molar mammals crown molars premolars folded wide range complex shapes basic elements crown less conical projections called cusps valleys separate cusps contain dentine enamel whereas minor projections crown called crenulations result different enamel thickness cusps occasionally joined form ridges expanded form crests cingula often incomplete ridges pass around base mammalian multicusped cheek teeth probably evolved singlecusped teeth synapsids although diversity therapsid molar patterns complexity molars earliest mammals make determining happened impossible according widely accepted differentiation theory additional cusps arisen budding outgrowth crown rivalling concrescence theory instead proposes complex teeth evolved clustering originally separate conical teeth therian mammals placentals marsupials generally agreed evolved ancestor tribosphenic cheek teeth three main cusps arranged major cusp upper molar called cone identified prefix dependent relative location tooth proto para meta hypo ento suffixes added names id added cusps lower molar eg protoconid ule minor cusp eg protoconulid shelflike ridge lower part crown upper molar called cingulum feature lower molar cingulid minor cusp example cingular cuspule design considered one important characteristics therian mammals called tribosphenic molar among living mammals tribosphenic tooth found insectivorous mammals well young platypuses even though adults platypuses toothless tribosphenic teeth lower molar divided two regions threecusped trigonid shearing end talonid crushing heel modern tribosphenic molars trigonid towards front jaw talonid towards rear trigonid defined three large cusps protoconid buccallabial cheek side tooth anterior paraconid posterior metaconid lingual tongue side upper molars look like threepointed mountain ranges features mirrored lower molars protocone cusp lingual side tooth anterior paracone posterior metacone buccal side protocone upper molar talonid basin lower molar mesh together crushing system similar mortar pestle tribosphenic molars present direct ancestors three living mammal groups likely ancestral mammals whole many paleontologists argue developed independently monotremes australosphenidans rather inherited common ancestor share marsupials placentals boreosphenidans idea still example dentition early cretaceous monotreme steropodon similar peramus dryolestoids suggests monotremes related pretribosphenic hand status neither two groups wellestablished jurassic mammaliaforms docodonts shuotheriids reversed tribosphenic molars talonidlike structure develops towards front lower molar rather towards rear variant regarded example convergent primitive tribosphenic tooth molars diversified several unique morphologies many groups fourth cusp hypocone hypoconid subsequently evolved see quadrate also called quadritubercular euthemorphic molars hypocone additional fourth cusp lingual tongue side upper molar located posterior protocone quadrate molars appeared early mammal evolution present many species including hedgehogs raccoons many primates including may fifth cusp many mammals additional smaller cusps called conules appear larger cusps named locations eg paraconule located paracone metacone hypoconulid located hypoconid bunodont molars cusps low rounded hills rather sharp peaks common among omnivores pigs bears bunodont molars effective crushing devices often basically quadrate hypsodont dentition characterized highcrowned teeth enamel extends far past gum line provides extra material wear examples animals hypsodont dentition cattle horses animals feed gritty fibrous material hypsodont molars continue grow throughout life example species arvicolinae herbivorous hypsodont molars lack crown neck occlusal surface rough mostly flat adapted crushing grinding plant material body covered cementum gingival line layer enamel covering entire length body cementum enamel invaginate thick layer opposite condition hypsodont called brachydont brachyodont brachys short type dentition characterized lowcrowned teeth human teeth brachydont tooth crown gingival line neck least one root cap enamel covers crown extends neck cementum found gingival line occlusal surfaces tend pointed wellsuited holding prey tearing zalambdodont molars three cusps one larger lingual side two smaller labial side joined two crests form v Î»shape larger inner cusp might homologous paracone tribosphenic molar also fused metacone protocone typically missing two smaller labial cusps located expanded shelf called stylar shelf zalambdodont molars found example golden moles like zalambdodont molars dilambdodont molars distinct ectoloph shaped like two lambdas w lingual side bottom w metacone paracone stylar shelf labial side protocone present lingual ectoloph dilambdodont molars present shrews moles insectivorous lophodont teeth easily identified differentiating patterns ridges lophs enamel interconnecting cusps crowns present herbivores patterns lophs simple ringlike edge mole rats complex arrangement series ridges crossridges oddtoed ungulates lophodont molars hard elongated enamel ridges called lophs oriented either along perpendicular dental row lophodont molars common herbivores grind food thoroughly examples include tapirs manatees many two lophs form transverse often ringshaped ridges tooth arrangement called bilophodont pattern common primates also found lagomorphs hares rabbits pikas extreme forms lophodonty elephants rodents otomys known african elephant belongs genus called loxodonta feature selenodont molars sonamed moon goddess selene major cusp elongated crescentshaped ridge examples include eventoed ungulates cattle many carnivorous mammals enlarged bladelike teeth especially adapted slicing chopping called carnassials general term
