life among transgender people several different types antiandrogens including certain antiandrogens combine multiple example steroidal antiandrogen cyproterone acetate potent ar antagonist potent progestogen hence antigonadotropin weak glucocorticoid hence anticorticotropin weak androgen synthesis side effects antiandrogens vary depending type antiandrogen namely whether selective ar antagonist lowers androgen levels well presence offtarget activity antiandrogen instance whereas antigonadotropic antiandrogens like gnrh modulators cyproterone acetate associated pronounced sexual dysfunction osteoporosis men selective ar antagonists like bicalutamide associated osteoporosis associated minimal sexual differences thought related fact antigonadotropins suppress androgen levels extension levels bioactive metabolites androgens like estrogens neurosteroids whereas selective ar antagonists similarly neutralize effects androgens leave levels androgens hence metabolites intact fact even increase result progonadotropic another example steroidal antiandrogens cyproterone acetate spironolactone possess offtarget actions including progestogenic antimineralocorticoid andor glucocorticoid activity addition antiandrogen activity offtarget activities result additional side males major side effects antiandrogens demasculinization side effects include breast paintenderness

selective ar antagonist monotherapy found range addition antiandrogens cause infertility osteoporosis hot flashes sexual dysfunction including loss libido erectile dysfunction depression fatigue

mediating biological ar antagonists classified two types based chemical structure steroidal steroidal ar antagonists structurally related steroid hormones like testosterone progesterone whereas nonsteroidal ar antagonists steroids structurally distinct steroidal ar antagonists tend offtarget hormonal actions due structural similarity steroid contrast nonsteroidal ar antagonists selective ar offtarget hormonal reason sometimes described pure although described antiandrogens indeed show effects generally steroidal ar antagonists actually silent antagonists ar rather weak partial agonists able activate receptor absence potent ar agonists like testosterone may clinical implications specific context prostate cancer example steroidal ar antagonists able increase prostate weight accelerate prostate cancer cell growth absence potent ar spironolactone found accelerate progression prostate cancer case addition whereas cyproterone acetate produces ambiguous genitalia via feminization male fetuses administered pregnant found produce masculinization genitalia female fetuses pregnant contrast steroidal ar antagonists nonsteroidal ar antagonists silent antagonists ar activate may greater efficacy steroidal ar antagonists treatment prostate cancer important reason largely replaced indication nonsteroidal antiandrogens relatively low affinity ar compared steroidal ar example bicalutamide around affinity dht ar around affinity cpa despite low affinity ar however lack weak partial agonist activity nsaas appears improve potency relative steroidal example although flutamide
