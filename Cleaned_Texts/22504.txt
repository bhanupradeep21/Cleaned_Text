spondylolysis defect stress fracture pars interarticularis vertebral vast majority cases occur lower lumbar vertebrae spondylolysis may also occur cervical majority cases spondylolysis presents asymptomatically make diagnosis difficult patient present symptoms general signs symptoms clinician look cause spondylolysis remains unknown however many factors thought contribute development condition present population majority usually present research supports hereditary acquired risk factors make one susceptible defect disorder generally prevalent males females tends occur earlier males due involvement strenuous activities younger young athlete spine still growing many ossification centers leaving points weakness spine leaves young athletes increased risk particularly involved repetitive hyperextension rotation across lumbar spondylolysis common cause low back pain preadolescents adolescent athletes accounts low back believed repetitive trauma inherent genetic weakness make individual susceptible sports involving repetitive forceful hyperextension spine especially combined rotation main mechanism injury spondylolysis stress fracture pars interarticularis occurs side opposite activity instance righthanded player fracture occurs left side spondylolysis higher occurrence following although condition caused repetitive trauma lumbar spine strenuous sports risk factors also predispose individuals spondylolysis males commonly affected spondylolysis one study looking youth athletes found mean age individuals spondylolysis years spondylolysis also runs families suggesting hereditary component predisposition weaker spondylolysis bony defect fracture within pars interarticularis vertebral arch spinal column vast majority spondylolysis occur lumbar vertebrae however also seen cervical lumbar vertebra consist body pedicle lamina pars interarticularis transverse process spinous process superior inferior articular facets form joints link vertebrae together examining vertebra pars interarticularis bony segment superior inferior articular facet joints located anterior lamina posterior pedicle separation pars interarticularis occurs spondylolysis present spinal spondylolysis typically caused stress fracture bone especially common adolescents overtrain activities pars interarticularis vulnerable fracture spinal hyperextension especially combined rotation experiencing force landing stress fracture commonly occurs concave lumbar spine transitions convex sacrum significant number individuals spondylolysis develop spondylolisthesis true several imaging techniques used diagnose spondylolysis common imaging techniques include xray mri bone scintigraphy bone scan computed tomography ct scancitation needed xrays electromagnetic radiation projected body produce image internal structures radiation attenuated absorbed denser tissues body ie bone softer tissues ie muscles organs etc creating picture composed shades grey ranging white black vertebra fracture defect pars interarticularis dark mark region bone since difficult see ap anterior posterior xray view oblique xray lumbar spine usually identify spondylolysis inconclusive ct scan produce images clearly show defect although exam increases patients radiation dose least order magnitude plain also known bone scan bone scintigraphy involves injection small amount radioactive tracer bloodstream tracer decays emits radioactive energy detected special camera camera produces black white image areas shown dark black indicate bone damage kind black spot lumbar vertebrae eg indicates damage potentially spondylolysis test positive ct scan usually ordered confirm commonly known ct scan cat scan form imaging similar xray technology produces many images xray multiple images produce crosssectional views possible xray allows physician radiologist examine images many angles xray allows reason ct scan much accurate detecting spondylolysis xray bone scintigraphy combined ct scan considered gold standard means best detecting mri newer technique used diagnose spondylolysis favorable reasons mri much accurate xray also use radiation mri uses powerful magnets radio frequencies produce detailed images many different densities tissue including bone soft treatment spondylolysis ranges bracing activity restriction extension exercises flexion exercises deep abdominal strengthening administered physical therapy duration physical therapy patient receives varies upon severity spondylolysis however typically ranges three six months goal physical therapy minimize movement unstable defect pars interarticularis patient completes physical therapy displays symptoms inflammation lower back cleared continue daily athletic activities however patient may need maintain variety rehabilitation techniques physical therapy prevent recurrence aim deep abdominal cocontraction exercises train muscles surrounding lumbar spine provide stability spine spondylolysis results spinal instability disrupts patterns corecruitment muscle synergies specifically local muscles attach directly spine affected lumbar multifidus transversus abdominis play direct role stabilizing lumbar spine instead local muscles individuals spondylolysis vulnerable dysfunction results abnormal spinal stability causing chronic low back pain compensate large torque producing global muscles used stabilize one study patients taught train cocontraction deep abdominal muscles lumbar multifidus static postures functional tasks aerobic activities technique shown reduce pain functional disability compared conservative treatments results also long term effect reducing levels pain functional disability motor programming eventually became automatic conscious control longer needed contract deep abdominal muscles activity restriction spondylolysis advised short period time patient becomes symptomatic followed guided physical therapy program spondylolysis diagnosed treatment often consists short rest period two three days followed physical therapy program restriction heavy lifting excessive bending twisting avoidance work recreational activities participation sport causes stress lumbar activity restriction help eliminate control patients symptoms able resume normal activity restriction commonly used conjunction rehabilitation techniques including bracingcitation needed acute spondylolysis commonly treated use antilordotic brace boston brace control limit spinal movement reduce stress injured spinal bracing immobilizes spine flexed position short period allow healing bony defect pars antilordotic brace commonly utilizes plastic component contoured closely fit antilordotic bracing subsequently reduces athletes symptoms decreasing amount stress low back allows prompt return sport typically bracing utilized order brace effective must worn every day required amount time patients given brace schedule determined physical therapist explains amount time brace must worn daily braces effectiveness increases adherence bracing schedule patients follow bracing schedule likely symptoms research demonstrated braces used prescribed full compliance successful preventing spondylolysis patients spondylolysis require surgery symptoms relieved nonsurgical treatments condition progresses high grade spondylolisthesis patients may require surgery two main types surgery spondylolysis huge impact young athletes career may impede future ability important understand social psychological factors may affect rehabilitation injured athlete frustration anger confusion fear depression psychological factors injured athletes experience therefore debilitating injury large impact athletes mental psychological factors also affect recovery return sport fear reinjury often prevents athletes adhering rehabilitation returning sport full social factors also impact cognitive behavioural physical responses injury specifically social isolation team profound psychological effect makes essential provide social support supportive listening emotional support personal assistance reality also critical educate athletes rehabilitation process know expect instance explaining activities avoid cause pain well duration treatment process addition important select correct treatment option individual conservative methods adherence exercise requires motivated patients tedious timeconsuming instance one study looking deep abdominal cocontraction reported take long weeks achieve pattern cocontraction httpsenwikipediaorgwikispondylolysis
