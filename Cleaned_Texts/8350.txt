asthma triggers factors stimuli provoke exacerbation asthma symptoms increase degree airflow disruption lead asthma asthma attack characterized obstruction airway hypersecretion mucus bronchoconstriction due contraction smooth muscles around respiratory tract symptoms include wide range manifestations breathlessness coughing tight chest asthma attack usually mediated inflammatory pathway trigger allergen could lead series immune response mediated various types immune common triggers asthma include allergens like pet dander dust mites pollens molds types triggers like exercise air pollutants tobacco smoke humidity cold air certain medicines may also play role triggering proposed asthma triggers classified three types allergic triggers environmental triggers physical triggers universal categorization asthma triggers yet studies also classified asthma triggers psychological factors air pollutants physical activity allergens asthma extremely common chronic disease affecting million people million children recognizing trigger asthma avoiding simple yet effective way deal disease avoid asthma although cure asthma yet invented various treatment methods available longterm control immediate relieve asthma pathophysiology asthma mainly involves inflammatory pathway associated several types immune cells body mainly helper cells cells b cells mast cells nut shell stimulus allergen comes contact asthma patient activates various types immune cells leading inflammatory response causing bronchial hyperresponsiveness bronchoconstriction excessive mucus secretion airflow obstruction asthma detail rundown process provided first sensitization phase cells interact dendritic cells dendritic cells present specific antigen allergen cells leading afterward activated cells would release type cytokine promote b cells another type immune cell differentiate intoallergenspecific memory b cells plasma plasma cells extensively produce allergenspecific ige antibodies captured type receptor fceri mast mast cells immune cells usually located tissues exposed environment skin respiratory tract mucosa digestive tract equipped preformed granules loaded vasoactive amines fceri receptors mast cells capture ige antibodies produced cells become sensitive specific allergen due mast cells activated exposed specific allergen allergen binds ige antibodies mast cell surface clustering crosslink formation fceri takes leads recruitment activation several tyrosine kinases type enzyme phosphorylates consequently kinase activation contributes intracellular influx series reaction level surge results cytoskeletal rearrangement allowing exocytosis degranulation intracellular granules thus releasing vasoactive amines vasoactive amines histamine heparin serotonin released mast cell granules cause vasodilation increased vascular permeability smooth muscle contraction increased mucus secretioncitation needed mast cells degranulation also results release eosinophil chemotactic factors neutrophil chemotactic factors factors attract eosinophils neutrophils body respectively intensify inflammation moreover elevated level also leads arachidonic acid enzymatic pathway activation contributing release lipid lipid mediators particularly prostaglandins leukotrienes elicit vasodilation increased vascular permeability smooth muscle moreover increase level also leads activation certain transcription factors induces proinflammatory cytokines proinflammatory cytokines tnf lead acute inflammation leukocyte allergic triggers factors chemicals could induce airway sensitization inflammation bronchospasm asthmatic allergens common trigger allergic asthma examples triggers asthma include naturally occurring aeroallergens like house dust mites animal feces pets molds pests also potential asthma patient inhales come contact withsuch allergen mast cells airway tract releases vasoactive amines proteases leads release cytokines mediates broad range inflammatory allergic addition allergens studies revealed environmental factors may also increase risk triggering asthma examples factors include respiratory tract viral exposure air pollutants change lifestyle involves decrease exposure microbes products like although mechanism action still unknown vivo demonstrated environmental factors lead accumulation neutrophil extracellular traps net releasing neutrophils lungs increased release nets found associated asthmatic symptoms mucus another environmental risk factor exposure formaldehyde chemical cause irritation respiratory tract addition may react macromolecules albumin induce production ige antibodies bind mast cells lead hyperresponsiveness respiratory exercise induced asthma common asthma although mechanism phenomenon still unclear researchers proposed body gasps oxygen exercise cold dry air inhaled passage cold dry air causes loss moisture mucosal membrane respiratory tract osmolarity changes brought action lead increased release proinflammatory mediators cytokines leading hypersensitivity cooling respiratory tract may also activate cholinergic receptors induce bronchoconstriction mucus secretion narrowing swimmers asthma may also inhale excess amount contaminated irritating air compound derived chlorine gas increase risk asthma aspirin induced asthma aspirinexacerbated respiratory disease refers situations use aspirin worsen asthma nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids inhibits enzyme may also lead asthma attack inhibition enzyme nsaids accumulation arachidonic acid resulted turn would increase production leukotrienes leukotrienes inflammatory mediator accumulation proinflammatory leukotrienes would overstimulate cysteinyl leukotriene receptors respiratory system leading bronchoconstriction oversecretion mucus thus blocking betablocker betaadrenergic antagonists may also induce bronchial constriction block action betareceptor targeted asthmatic drugs leading worsening asthma therefore asthma patients cautious inform physicians asthma occupational asthma refers type asthma resulted repeated exposure agent causes exacerbates asthma although primary cause occupational asthma varies situation situation common agents metal diesel cleaning agents dimethylsulphate diisocyanates latex persulfate aldehydes isocyanates wood dusts flour handled great firsthand secondhand tobacco smoke trigger asthma may worsen condition asthma irritant induces studies also indicated psychological stress may associated higher chance asthma patients psychological stress found reduced awareness controlling asthma less desirable physical one clinical asthmatic symptoms shortness breath due narrowing respiratory tract caused mucus plug formation bronchoconstriction smooth muscles another typical symptom wheezing expiration turbulent airflow crushes narrowed respiratory tract leading wheezing moreover increased mucus secretion may limited respiratory tract symptoms watery eyes rhinitis also furthermore increased vasodilation vascular permeability may result angioedema swelling skin severe complications ventilation impaired acute respiratory failure may occur due inadequate amount oxygen circulatory another lifethreatening condition pneumothorax collapse lungs due understanding specific asthma triggers patient avoiding simple way preventing asthma regularly washing beddings quitting smoking pest controls keeping sensitized living environment removing stagnant water avoiding products potential irritants etc effective avoiding asthma education asthma triggers done physicians help patients understand activities materials avoided reduction exposure asthma triggers done asthmatic patient parents asthmatic children also cautious common asthma triggers order reduce risks asthma quickrelief medicine used treating acute asthma attack first line medicine treating situation shortterm agonists drugs stimulate adrenergic receptors bronchodilators effectively relieve symptoms clearing airway examples include albuterol commonly used portable inhaler allow patient administer medicine attack another common medicine acute attack anticholinergic drugs ipratropium tiotropium also work blocking cholinergic receptors reduces mucus secretion another type treatment acute asthma attack immunosuppressive drugs like corticosteroids also alleviate asthmatic examples include prednisone methyl prednisone usually administered orally intravenously treating acute however note long term use corticosteroids may lead severe side effects continuous longterm use certain medicines help reduce risk asthma attack keep disease control long term use certain types corticosteroids fluticasone propionate may administered pulmonary route reduce risk asthma oral use leukotriene receptor antagonist zafirlukast may also used long term control asthma addition moreover another option use cromolyn sodium prevent asthma attack halting influx thus preventing mast cell degranulation subsequent asthmatic complications drugs alternative treatment method desensitization involves exposure wellcontrolled small increasing amounts specific allergen long duration rationale trigger antigen competition development allergenspecific igg antibodies reduce risk allergic longacting betaagonists salmetrol used combination corticosteroids control asthma symptoms drugs stimulate adrenergic receptors mediate bronchodilation effect hours however recent study found treatment method could increase risk asthmarelated deaths food drug administration fda also recommending
