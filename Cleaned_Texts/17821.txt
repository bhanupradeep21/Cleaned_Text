joystick eye tracking could whereas switch access scanning often used indirect unlike direct selection eg typing keyboard touching screen users target scanning make selections scanning indicator cursor electronic device desired unable point typically calibrate eyes use eye gaze way point blocking way select desired words phrases speed pattern scanning well way items selected individualized physical visual cognitive capabilities augmentative alternative communication typically much slower users generally producing words per rate enhancement strategies increase users rate output around words per result enhance efficiency communication given sgd may large number vocal expressions facilitate efficient effective communication including greetings expressing desires asking sgds multiple pages symbols accommodate large number vocal expressions thus portion symbols available visible one time communicator navigating various speechgenerating devices generally display set selections either using dynamically changing screen fixed two main options increasing rate communication sgd encoding encoding permits user produce word sentence phrase using one two activations iconic encoding strategies semantic compaction combine sequences icons picture symbols produce words numeric alphanumeric letter encoding also known abbreviationexpansion words sentences coded sequences letters numbers example typing hh greeting may retrieve hello prediction rate enhancement strategy sgd attempts reduce number keystrokes used predicting word phrase written user user select correct prediction without needing write entire word word prediction software may determine choices offered based frequency language association words past choices user grammatical however users shown produce words per minute using scanning interface static keyboard layout predictive grid layout suggesting cognitive overhead reviewing new arrangement cancels benefits predictive layout using scanning another approach rateenhancement uses language models arithmetic coding present alternative letter targets screen size relative likelihood given rate words produced depend greatly conceptual level system talk system allows users choose large numbers sentencelevel utterances demonstrated output rates excess fixed display devices refer symbols items fixed particular format sources refer static display devices simpler learning curve devices fixed display devices replicate typical arrangement lowtech aac devices lowtech defined devices need batteries electricity electronics like communication boards share disadvantages example typically restricted limited number symbols hence important note technological advances made twentyfirst century fixeddisplay sgds commonly used anymore dynamic displays devices usually also touchscreen devices typically generate electronically produced visual symbols pressed change set selections displayed user change symbols available using page links navigate appropriate pages vocabulary messages home page dynamic display device may show symbols related many different contexts conversational topics pressing one symbols may open different screen messages related example watching volleyball game user may press sport symbol open page messages relating sport press symbol showing scoreboard utter phrase whats score advantages dynamic display devices include

text messaging work link√∂ping university shown email writing practices allowed children sgd users develop new social skills increase social low cost systems also include keyboard audio speaker combination without dynamic display visual screen type keyboard sends typed text direct audio speaker permit phrase spoken without need visual screen always required one simple benefit talking keyboard used standard telephone speakerphone enable voice impaired individual way conversation telephonecitation needed output sgd may digitized andor synthesized digitized systems play directly recorded words phrases synthesized speech uses texttospeech software carry less emotional information permits user speak novel messages typing new today individuals use combination recorded messages texttospeech techniques however devices limited one type output words phrases entire messages digitised stored onto device playback activated process formally known voice advantages recorded speech include provides natural prosody speech naturalness eg person age gender aac user selected record b provides additional sounds may important user laughing whistling moreover digitized sgds provide degree normalcy patient families lose ability speak major disadvantage using recorded speech users unable produce novel messages limited messages prerecorded depending device may limit length sgds use synthesized speech apply phonetic rules language translate users message voice output speech users freedom create novel words messages limited prerecorded device smartphones computers increased use synthesized speech devices creation apps allow user select list phrases messages spoken voice language user chosen apps speakit assistive express iphone provide cheap way use speechgenerating device without visit doctors office learn use specialized machinery synthesized sgds may allow multiple methods message creation used individually combination messages created letters words phrases sentences pictures synthesized speech virtually unlimited storage capacity messages demands memory synthesized speech engines available many engines parameters speech rate pitch range gender stress patterns pauses pronunciation exceptions manipulated selection set sgd set messages symbols codes available person using content organisation updating selection set areas active research influenced number factors including users ability interests selection set aac system may include words user know yet included user grow content installed given sgd may include large number preset pages provided manufacturer number additional pages produced user users care team depending users needs contexts device used researchers beukelman mirenda list number possible sources family members friends teachers care staff selection initial content sgd range sources required general one individual would knowledge experience generate vocal expressions needed given example parents therapists might think add slang terms previous work analyzed vocabulary use typically developing speakers word use aac users generate content new aac devices processes work well generating core set utterances vocal expressions less effective situations particular vocabulary needed example terms related directly users interest horse riding term fringe vocabulary refers vocabulary specific unique individuals personal interests needs typical technique develop fringe vocabulary device conduct interviews multiple informants siblings parents teachers coworkers involved researchers musselwhite st louis suggest initial vocabulary items high interest user frequently applicable range meanings pragmatic criteria widely used aac field ecological check sgd beukelman mirenda emphasize vocabulary selection also involves ongoing vocabulary however difficulty aac users carers must program new utterances manually eg names new friends personal stories existing commercial solutions automatically adding number research approaches attempted overcome range inferred input generating content based log conversation users friends data mined internet find language materials webcrawler moreover making use lifelogging based approaches devices content changed based events occur user accessing users data highquality messages generated risk exposing sensitive user example making use global positioning systems devices content changed based geographical many recently developed sgds include performance measurement analysis tools help monitor content used individual raises concerns privacy argue device user involved
