neuroanatomy optic nerve also known second cranial nerve cranial nerve ii simply cn ii paired cranial nerve transmits visual information retina brain humans optic nerve derived optic stalks seventh week development composed retinal ganglion cell axons glial cells extends optic disc optic chiasma continues optic tract lateral geniculate nucleus pretectal nuclei superior optic nerve classified second twelve paired cranial nerves technically myelinated tract central nervous system rather classical nerve peripheral nervous system derived outpouching diencephalon optic stalks embryonic development consequence fibers optic nerve covered myelin produced oligodendrocytes rather schwann cells peripheral nervous system encased within peripheral neuropathies like syndrome affect optic nerve however typically optic nerve grouped eleven cranial nerves considered part peripheral nervous system optic nerve ensheathed three meningeal layers dura arachnoid pia mater rather epineurium perineurium endoneurium found peripheral nerves fiber tracts mammalian central nervous system limited regenerative capabilities compared peripheral nervous therefore mammals optic nerve damage results irreversible blindness fibers retina run along optic nerve nine primary visual nuclei brain major relay inputs primary visual cortex optic nerve composed retinal ganglion cell axons glia human optic nerve contains million nerve axons retinal ganglion cells one retina fovea high acuity ganglion cells connect photoreceptor cells areas retina connect thousands photoreceptors optic nerve leaves orbit eye socket via optic canal running posteromedially towards optic chiasm partial decussation crossing fibers temporal visual fields nasal hemiretina eyes proportion decussating fibers varies species correlated degree binocular vision enjoyed axons optic nerve terminate lateral geniculate nucleus information relayed visual cortex axons terminate pretectal involved reflexive eye movements axons terminate suprachiasmatic nucleus involved regulating sleepwake cycle diameter increases mm within eye mm orbit mm within cranial space optic nerve component lengths mm globe mm orbit mm optic canal mm cranial space joining optic chiasm partial decussation occurs fibers cross form optic tracts fibers terminate lateral geniculate based anatomy optic nerve may divided four parts indicated image top

information including brightness perception color perception contrast visual acuity also conducts visual impulses responsible two important neurological reflexes light reflex accommodation reflex

patient likely experience varying vision loss eye pain condition tends episodic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy commonly known stroke optic nerve affects optic nerve head nerve exits eyeball usually sudden loss blood supply nutrients optic nerve head vision loss typically sudden commonly occurs upon waking morning condition common diabetic patients years old optic nerve problems less common optic nerve hypoplasia underdevelopment optic nerve resulting little vision affected eye tumors especially pituitary gland put pressure optic nerve causing various forms visual loss similarly cerebral aneurysms swelling blood vessels also affect nerve trauma cause serious injury nerve direct optic nerve injury occur penetrating injury orbit nerve also injured indirect trauma severe head
