adverse uv chemical reactions butterflies absorb uv rays flavonoids offer chemical defense predators pathogens flavonoid sequestration much effective coming natural host plants experimentally offered diets females sequester flavonoids males richness females may increase visibility could also confer information feeding history consequentially quality potential flavonoid sequestration important component intraspecific visual communication sexual signaling polyommatus butterflies oviposition females must locate potential host plant evaluate suitability host plant oviposition p icarus uses visual cues conduct task females use several plants family fabaceae larval host plants many could also potentially function nectar sources p icarus prefers plants flowers plants without prefers
