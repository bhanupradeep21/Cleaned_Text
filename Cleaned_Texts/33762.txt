working memory cognitive system limited capacity hold information important reasoning guidance decisionmaking working memory often used synonymously shortterm memory theorists consider two forms memory distinct assuming working memory allows manipulation stored information whereas shortterm memory refers shortterm storage working memory theoretical concept central cognitive psychology
