neuromuscular drugs chemical agents used alter transmission nerve impulses muscles causing effects temporary paralysis targeted skeletal muscles neuromuscular drugs available quaternary ammonium compounds derived acetylcholine allows neuromuscular drugs act multiple sites neuromuscular junctions mainly antagonists agonists postjunctional nicotinic neuromuscular drugs classified four main groups depolarizing neuromuscular blockers nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers acetylcholinesterase inhibitors butyrylcholinesterase clinically neuromuscular drugs used anesthesia cause paralysis

tubocurarine major constituent responsible paralyzing effect acting neuromuscular anasthesiologists harold griffith enid johnson first documented successful use curare clinical trial facilitate muscle relaxation healthy patient undergoing appendicectomy prior use curare anesthesiologist required large doses anesthetic chloroform achieve similar paralyzing effects hence increased risk lifethreatening effects elderly patients cardiac ever since neuromuscular agents commonly used practice anesthetic clinical trial conducted griffith johnson also paved way discovery many neuromuscular drugs surgical neuromuscular blocking agents classified following two groups depolarizing neuromuscular blockers depolarizing neuromuscular blockers directly bind postsynaptic cholinergic receptors neuromuscular junction generate sustained action potential causes prolonged stimulation desensitization neuroreceptors causing skeletal muscle relaxation effects depolarizing neuromuscular blockers notably succinylcholine tend preferred nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers due longacting rapidonset nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers directly bind acetylcholine receptors postsynaptic neuron cause depolarization neuromusuclar junction act competitive inhibitors acetylcholine blocking binding acetylcholine receptors postsynaptic membrane inhibit membrane inhibition neurotransmitter binding neuromuscular junction induces paralyzing effects comparison depolarizing neuromuscular blockers nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers tend slower onset times shorter duration aside neuromuscular blocking agents acetylcholinesterase inhibitors butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors act neuromuscular junction enhance neurotransmitter transmission voluntary involuntary additionally antibiotics aminoglycosides may also exert undesired side effects neuromuscular acetylcholinesterase inhibitors acetylcholinesterase inhibitors prevent degradation acetylcholine subsequently increasing concentration duration action neuromuscular acetylcholinesterase inhibitors primarily used treat symptoms dementia alzheimer disease parkinson disease myasthenia butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors butyrylcholinesterease inhibitors prevent degradation butyrylcholine increases concentration duration action neuromuscular junction like acetylcholinesterase inhibitors butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors regarded therapeutic option alzheimers aminoglycosides aminoglycosides frequently used combinational antibacterial therapies nosocomial respiratory tract infections complicated intraabdominal infections septicemia osteomyelitis caused aerobic gramnegative bacilli complicated urinary tract seven neuromuscular drugs approved us food drug administration drugs include streptomycin plazomicin neomycin amikacin tobramycin gentamicin clinically proven aminoglycosides exert neuromuscular blocking side aminoglycosides neuromuscular blocking side effects major class neuromuscular drugs depolarizing neuromuscular blockers depolarizing agents act agonists acetylcholine receptors succinylcholine currently depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drug placed ongoing clinical use pharmacological structure resembles two acetylcholine molecules combined acetate methyl contains two quaternary ammonium radicals associate two alpha subunits nicotinic receptor cause nicotinic receptors respond acetylcholine located central peripheral nervous system muscle tissue act primary receptor muscle motor nervemuscle communication signals muscle normal conditions without interference depolarizing neuromuscular blockers depolarization triggered voltagegated sodium channels activated due sensing depolarization activation acetylcholine causes rapid opening sodium channels closure brief period becoming membrane potential required reset reactivation sodium process occurs almost instantly acetylcholine within one ms rapidly hydrolyzed acetylcholinesterase however depolarizing neuromuscular blockers applied modified structure succinylcholine unable hydrolyzed acetylcholinesterase causes extensive activation nicotinic receptors inactivation sodium resulting blockage junctional transmission muscles causing muscle contract remain contrastingly prolonged use succinylcholine may cause desensitization block neuromuscular junction acetylcholine receptors insensitive channel opening effect agonists eg acetylcholine acetylcholineagonist drugs refer adverse reactions depolarizing neuromuscular drugs nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers nondepolarizing agents act competitive inhibitors acetylcholine upon binding nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers neurotransmission consequently depolarizing musclecontracting effects decreased nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers generally reversible hence permanent effects acetylcholine unlike depolarizing neuromuscular blockers nondepolarizing drugs produce conformational changes blockers bind acetylcholine receptors dynamic mechanism repeated association dissociation thus concentration antagonists increases concentration binding subsequently effective neuromuscular block nondepolarizing neuromuscular drugs occurs acetylcholine receptors occupied occupancy rate junctional potential unable reach threshold value required muscle contraction main difference two major classes neuromuscular blocking agents respective reversal process paralyzing effects nondepolarizing blockers reversed acetylcholinesterase inhibitor drugs increase concentration acetylcholine behaves competitive antagonists acetylcholine receptors reducing binding nondepolarizing blockers whereas depolarizing blockers mimic acetylcholine would increased pharmacological effects administered alongside acetylcholinesterase therefore inhibition reversal depolarizing neuromuscular blockers occurs naturally within specific period halflife achieved acetylcholinesterase butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors cholinesterase inhibitors share similar mechanisms action active site cholinesterases consists anionic site esteric phosphorylation anionic site cholinesterase inhibitors prevents binding acetylcholine acetylcholinesterase butyrylcholine butyrylcholinesterase result acetylcholine butyrylcholine accumulate neuromuscular depolarizing drug succinylcholine dosage succinylcholine patientspecific determined based total body weight physical condition thus extensive patient assessment evaluation required accurate calculation current recommended dose succinylcholine indicated tracheal intubation fda adults whereas studies shown lowdose succinylcholine mgkg suitable optimal intubation conditions asa emergency nonpreparedpatients patient severe systemic disease constant threat dosage generate profound blockage within seconds short onset quicker neuromuscular drugs currently available neuromuscular blockage begins recover within minutes completely recovered within estimating dose higher intubation preferred underdosing reasonably higher dose produces similar paralysis little known dose associated risks whereas underdosing shown inadequate paralysis creating difficulties whilst performing intubation operative nondepolarizing drug nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers indicated general anesthesia facilitate endotracheal intubation aid surgeries via muscle
