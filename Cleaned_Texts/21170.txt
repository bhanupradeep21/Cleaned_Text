tetraploid complementation assay technique biology cells two mammalian embryos combined form new used construct genetically modified organisms study consequences certain mutations embryonal development study pluripotent stem cells normal mammalian somatic cells diploid chromosome thus every gene present duplicate excluding genes x chromosome absent chromosome assay starts producing tetraploid cell every chromosome exists fourfold done taking embryo twocell stage fusing two cells applying electrical current resulting tetraploid cell continue divide daughter cells also tetraploid tetraploid embryo develop normally blastocyst stage implant wall uterus tetraploid cells form extraembryonic tissue placenta etc however proper fetus rarely develop tetraploid complementation assay one combines tetraploid embryo either morula blastocyst stage normal diploid embryonic stem cells es different organism embryo develop normally fetus exclusively derived es cell extraembryonic tissues exclusively derived tetraploid cells httpsenwikipediaorgwikitetraploidcomplementationassay
