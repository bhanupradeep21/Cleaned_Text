lowgrade fibromyxoid sarcoma lgfms rare type lowgrade sarcoma first described h l evans lgfms soft tissue tumors mesenchymederived connective tissues microscopic examination found composed spindleshaped cells resemble fibroblastic spindleshaped cells neoplastic cells cases lgfms express fusion genes ie genes composed parts two different genes form result world health organization classified lgfms specific type tumor category malignant fibroblastic myofibroblastic lgfms tumors occur individuals almost age less yearsold tumors typically involve proximal extremities occur virtually anywhere progression tumors commonly takes indolent prolonged course involving many years decades time however tumors often recur site surgical removal andor metastasize usually lung pleural tissues surrounding metastasis develop decades tumors initial presentation lgfms difficult distinguish mesenchymal particularly sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma lgfms tumors present many clinical pathological features similar sef indeed current studies suggest lgfms may early form sef example tumor may present features typical lgfms time progress features typical sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcomas progression may particularly evident recurrent metastatic lgfms since world health organization classified lgfms one malignant fibroblastic myofibroblastic tumors distinctly different sef lgfms regarded separate tumor forms individuals initially diagnosed lgfms characterized young adults mean age years children years old although recent study reported individuals first diagnosed disease ranged age years mean age lgfms generally presents painless mass located subcutaneous subfacial ie beneath skin tissues upper lower limbs less commonly head neck areas within gastrointestinal tract heart kidney retroperitoneum mediastinum abdominal tumors occurring subcutaneous subfacial tissues often cm size largest sites tumor go undetected long periods abdominal reported large cm respectively magnetic resonance imaging computed tomography scans often give results suggesting tumor lgmfs tumors typically contain one multiple nodules embedded greywhite whorled cut surface appear infiltrating adjacent structurestissues minority cases microscopic histopathologic views hematoxylin eosin stained tumor tissue show whorled bundled uniform blandappearing slender fibroblastic spindleshaped cells elongated tapered nuclei cells scant cytoplasm appear rapidly proliferating defined low rate mitosis spindleshaped cells typically occur alternating fibrous myxoid ie blue purple compared normal connective tissue excessive uptake hematoxylin stain background however tissues may contain sites dominated epithelioid cells elements indistinguishable sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma hybrid pattern often seen recurrent metastatic lggms tumors may progress dominate tissues may therefore warrant changing diagnosis lgfmd sclerosing epithelioid definitive lgmfs tumors dominated cells undifferentiated immature roundcell morphology may aggressive tumors typical cell immunohistochemical analyses lgfms tumors shows cells express also termed ema andor proteins cases sma proteins rare cases desmin caldesmon cytokeratin proteins virtually however protein express tumor cells almost lgfms therefore commonly used sensitive specific marker since small subset lgfms tumors reported consist cells diagnosis lgfms absolutely dependent finding tumor neoplastic cells lgfms tumors express one various fusion genes fusion genes abnormal genes consisting parts two different genes merge result large scale gene mutations chromosomal translocations interstitial deletions inversions fusion genes lgfms merge part fus gene one fet protein family genes part ie camp responsive element binding protein like ie camp responsive element binding protein like gene fusion gene expressed majority lgmfs cases fusion gene expressed minority lgmfs cases fusion genes containing part afet gene family gene occur wide range tumors though contribute development least role cited fusion genes development lgfms known presence one fusion genes helpful diagnosing diagnosis lgfms rest primary tumors histology consisting spindleshaped fibroblastic cells appropriate background express protein either fusion gene magnetic resonance imaging computed tomography scan findings also help findings differentiate lgfms various spindleshaped cell myxoid neoplasms including benign soft tissue tumors malignant soft tissue tumors eg desmoid fibromatosis sarcomas eg malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumora lowgrade myxofibrosarcoma myxoid dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans rare cases extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma synovial sarcomas prominent myxoid background myxoid however sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma tumors may contain areas histopathologically indistinguishable contain neoplastic cells expression protein fusion gene cases fusion gene cases fusion gene rare based relative rates expression two tumor types presence tumor neoplastic cells express marker protein fusion gene otherwise rearranged fus gene strongly suggest tumor express fusion gene suggest tumor sef case unlikely lowgrade fibromyxoid express fusion gene likely lowgrade fibromyxoid sarcoma sef ie fusion gene present lowgrade fibromyxoid sarcomas sef tumor express fusion gene likely sef generally recommended treatment lgfms aggressive wide surgical excision including even located difficult access sites complete removal tumor tissue critical lowering rates recurrences long term surgically resected lgfms tumors tended recur site resection recurrences develop long years median years initial diagnosis following initial surgical resection metastases reported develop metastases diagnosed years median years initial diagnosis lgfms found mostly lungs pleura chest wall occasionally pericardium ie sac containing heart rarely bone liver recurrences tumors site resection well many metastases treated surgical resections treatment may repeated multiple times individuals develop repeated local recurrences andor metastases radiation therapy combined partial surgical resection radiation therapy alone used cases primary recurrent metastatic tumor safely totally however experiences radiation therapy chemotherapy treat lgfms limited tumor appear sensitive either treatment one longterm study treated individuals lgfms died tumors years median years initial diagnosis alive years median years diagnosis individuals persistent tumors
