continued protection patents develop many descriptions gurt differ others even basic description many gurts process typically composed four genetic components target gene promoter trait switch genetic switch sometimes slightly different names different papers example typical gurt works similarly follows plant gurt technology target gene dna expresses activated promoter gene however separated gene blocker sequence prevents promoter accessing target plant receives given external input genetic switch plant takes input amplifies converts biological signal trait switch receives amplified signal creates enzyme cuts blocker sequence finally blocker sequence eliminated promoter gene able make target gene express versions process operator must bind trait switch order make enzymes cut blocker sequence however repressors bind trait switch prevent case external input applied repressors bond instead trait switch allowing enzymes created cut blocker sequence trait variations gurt range widely including systems letting genetic switch directly affect blocker sequence bypass need trait conceptually two types vgurts developed first patents ranging throughout tgurts developed later sometimes considered second generation differences two types gurt mainly rely target gene activated variety specific genetic use restriction technologies vgurt produce sterile seeds seed crop could used seeds
