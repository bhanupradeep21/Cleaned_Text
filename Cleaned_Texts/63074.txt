echinococcus multilocularis fox tapeworm small cyclophyllid tapeworm found extensively northern hemisphere e multilocularis along members echinococcus genus especially e granulosus produce diseases known echinococcosis unlike e granulosus e multilocularis produces many small cysts also referred locules spread throughout internal organs infected animal resultant disease called alveolar echinococcosis caused ingesting eggs e multilocularis parasite commonly maintained wildlife life cycle involving two mammalian hosts wild canids dogs less commonly cats act definitive hosts harbouring adult stage tape worm voles intermediate ingestion rodent containing alveolar hydatid cysts wild canid result heavy infestation tapeworms human alveolar echinococcosis characterized lengthy incubation period years immunocompetent individuals progression disease potentiated immunocompromised patients following ingestion eggs e multilocularis metacestode larval stage parasite typically embeds liver disease progresses larval stage proliferates exogenously within tissue behaving similar hepatic neoplasia patients human alveolar echinococcosis typically present headache nausea vomiting abdominal

parasite ongoing infection visualization parasitic mass required confirm diagnosis frequently used serological tests include antibody tests elisa indirect hemaglutination iha intradermal allergic reaction test casoni test also used diagnose patients imaging tests include xrays ct scans mri histology another important diagnostic tool use past pas staining technique proven beneficial helping determine infections caused echinococcus multiocularis recently new immunohistochemistry technique uses monoclonal antibody provided professionals accuracy precision diagnosing echinococcus
