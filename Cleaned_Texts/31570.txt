hybrid incompatibility phenomenon plants animals wherein offspring produced mating two different species populations reduced viability andor less able reproduce examples hybrids include mules ligers animal world subspecies asian rice crop oryza sativa plant world multiple models developed explain phenomenon recent research suggests source incompatibility largely genetic combinations genes alleles prove lethal hybrid incompatibility solely influenced genetics however affected environmental factors genetic underpinnings hybrid incompatibility may provide insight factors responsible evolutionary divergence hybrid incompatibility occurs offspring two closely related species viable suffer infertility charles darwin posited hybrid incompatibility product natural selection stating phenomenon outcome hybridizing species diverging rather something directly acted upon selective underlying causes incompatibility varied earlier research focused things like changes ploidy plants recent research taken advantage improved molecular techniques focused effects genes alleles hybrid parents first major breakthrough genetic basis hybrid incompatibility dobzhanskymuller model combination findings theodosius dobzhansky joseph muller model provides explanation negative fitness effect like hybrid incompatibility selected hypothesizing incompatibility arose alterations two loci rather one incompatible alleles one hybrid individual first time rather throughout population thus hybrids infertile develop parent populations remain viable negative fitness effects infertility present original way hybrid infertility contributes part speciation ensuring gene flow diverging species remains limited analysis issue supported model although include conspecific genic interactions potential factor recent research begun look decades research dobzhansky muller specifics hybrid incompatibility explored jerry coyne h allen orr using introgression techniques analyze fertility drosophila hybrid nonhybrid offspring specific genes contribute sterility identified study chungi wu expanded coyne orrs work found hybrids two drosophila species made sterile interaction around studies widened scope dobzhanskymuller model thought likely two genes would ubiquity drosophila model organism allowed many sterility genes sequenced years since wus studycitation needed modern molecular techniques researchers able accurately identify underlying genetic causes hybrid incompatibility led development expansions dobzhanskymuller model recent research also explored possibility external influences sterility well extension dobzhanskymuller model snowball effect accumulation incompatible loci due increased species divergence since model posits sterility due negative allelic interaction hybridizing species species become diverged follows negative interactions develop snowball effect states number incompatibilities increase exponentially time divergence particularly two loci contribute incompatibility concept exhibited tests flowering plant genus solanum findings supporting genetic underpinnings dobzhanskymuller overall results indicate accumulation sterility loci follows different trajectory accumulation loci quantitative species differences consistent unique genetic basis expected underpin species reproductive isolating barriers uncover direct empirical support dobzhanskymuller model hybrid incompatibility snowball prediction though primary causes hybrid incompatibility appear genetic external factors may play role well studies focused primarily model plants found viability hybrids dependent environmental influence several studies rice arabidopsis species identify temperature important factor hybrid viability generally low temperatures seem cause negative hybrid symptoms expressed high temperatures suppress although one rice study found opposite also evidence arabidopsis species poor environmental conditions case high temperatures hybrids express negative symptoms viable populations environmental conditions return normal however negative symptoms expressed hybrids incompatible though multitude evidence supports dobzhanskymuller model hybrid sterility speciation rule possibility situations besides inviable combination benign genes lead hybrid incompatibility one situation incompatibility way gene duplication lynch force model put forth michael lynch allan force gene duplication occurs possibility redundant gene rendered nonfunctional time mutations lynch forces paper divergent resolution genomic redundancies one population loses function one copy second population loses function second copy different chromosomal location leads chromosomal repatterning gametes produced hybrid individuals completely lacking functional genes duplicate hypothesis relatively recent compared dobzhanskymuller support well possible contributor hybrid incompatibility fits lynch force model better dobzhanskymuller model epigenetic inheritance epigenetics broadly refers heritable elements affect offspring phenotype without adjusting dna sequence offspring particular allele epigenetically modified referred epiallele study found arabidopsis
