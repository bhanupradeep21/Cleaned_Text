plant cutting piece plant used horticulture vegetative asexual propagation piece stem root source plant placed suitable medium moist soil conditions suitable plant piece begin grow new plant independent parent process known striking stem cutting produces new roots root cutting produces new stems plants grown leaf pieces called leaf cuttings produce stems roots scions used grafting also called propagating plants cuttings ancient form several advantages cuttings mainly produced offspring practically clones parent plants plant favorable traits continue pass advantageous genetic information offspring especially economically advantageous allows commercial growers clone certain plant ensure consistency throughout cuttings used method asexual reproduction succulent horticulture commonly referred vegetative reproduction cutting also referred propagule succulents evolved ability use adventitious root formation reproduction increase fitness stressful environments succulents grow shallow soils rocky soils desert seedlings sexual reproduction low survival rate however plantlets excised stem cuttings leaf cuttings broken natural environment cuttings water carbon stored available resources needed plant establishment detached part plant remains physiologically active allowing mitotic activity new root structures form water nutrient asexual reproduction plants also evolutionarily advantageous allows plantlets better suited environment retention epigenetic memory heritable patterns phenotypic differences due changes dna rather histone modification dna epigenetic memory heritable mitosis thus advantageous stress response priming retained plantlets excised adventitious root formation refers roots form structure plant root roots form part normal development due stress adventitious root formation excised stem cutting wound response molecular level cutting first excised stem immediate increase jasmonic acid known necessary adventitious root cutting excised original root system root inhibiting hormones cytokinin strigolactone made root transported stem decrease polyphenol degradation decreases increasing auxin concentration increased auxin concentration increases nitric oxide concentration initiates root formation mapk signal cascade cgmpdependent pathway regulate mitotic division necessary initiation adventitious root root primordia form cambial cells propagation detached succulent leaves leaf cuttings root primordia typically emerges basal callous tissue leaf primordia known early acid iaa also known auxin applied stem root cuttings increase average number adventitious roots compared cuttings treated researchers also applied compound stems without leaves normally would root formation found auxin induced root formation thus determining auxin necessary root identification hormone important industries rely vegetative sometimes applied fresh cuttings stimulate root growth plants form roots much easily others stem cuttings woody plants treated differently depending maturity wood plant cuttings stem pieces root system therefore likely die dehydration proper conditions met require moist medium however wet lest cutting rot number media used process including limited soil perlite vermiculite coir rock wool expanded clay pellets even water given right conditions succulent cuttings left open air cut surface dries may improve root formation cutting later planted temperate countries stem cuttings may taken soft green semiripe wood hard wood specific differences practice certain conditions lead favorable outcomes cuttings timing size location plant amount foliage important stem cuttings young wood taken spring upper branches cuttings hardened wood taken winter lower branches common bounds length stem cuttings centimetres soft wood centimetres hard wood soft wood cuttings best two thirds foliage hard wood stem cuttings need complete foliage removal cut needs done either immediately inch besides placing cuttings directly soil also possible root cuttings water water needs replaced often prevent bacteria buildup possibility root rot also requires enough oxygen water reason moist atmosphere use plastic sheeting hence needed environment softwood semihardwood cuttings generally kept attained placing cuttings plastic sheet another confined space air kept partial shade prevent cutting drying cuttings medium typically watered fine mist avoid disturbing plants following initial watering aim keep soil moist wet waterlogged medium allowed almost dry misting rooting hormone may administered encourage growth increase success rate plant though essential several compounds may used promote formation roots signaling activity plant hormone auxins among commonly used chemicals acid iba used powder liquid solution gel compound applied either cut tip cutting foliar spray rooting hormone manufactured naturally soaking yellowtipped shoots weeping willow tree water preparing tea bark willow tree shoots bark better soaked hours prior extract obtained crushing leaves bulbs cocograss cyperus rotundus used excellent rooting cuttings seedlings various plant honey though contain plant hormones also aid rooting success natural antiseptic antifungal cinnamoncitation needed aspirin tablet also aid rooting many vegetative parts plant used common methods although species willow blackberry pelargoniums grown simply placing cutting moist ground majority species require attention species require humid warm partially shaded conditions strike thus requiring approach followed particularly difficult species may need cool air warm soil addition many difficult cuttings one use type cutting chance success particular plant ways improving growth stem cutting propagations intensifying light allows cuttings root sprout faster though heat thus generated could cause propagation material azalea cuttings mildly heated water disinfect fungus pathogen rhizoctonia could potentially used depending type cutting ie tree shrub succulent cacti different potting soil mixes used many commercial companies sell medium specifically growing cuttings although several options used usually plastic used cover softwood semihardwood cuttings soil trays increase air moisture soil tray kept moist waterlogged completely saturated trays cuttings sit best placed stones prevent capillary action keep soil inside trays wet soil trays kept automated overhead misting systems boom systems fog used greenhouses typical misting frequency sticking callusing includes misting seconds every minutes period days misting reduced seconds every minutes day less frequently night roots become visible stage misting reduced stage toning little misting done day using plastic tents far less misting needed twice greenhouse cold frame ventilated prevent formation molds manually air temperature softwood semihardwood cuttings optimal around temperatures low acceptable heating air stimulates growth ventilating manually automatic window openers greenhouse cold frame lower air temperature automated thermostat systems also used greenhouses keep heat specific temperature bottom heating soil tends ideal root initiation since growing media temperature best maintained whereas cuttings need kept warm amount light needs provided needs kept direct ways accomplish include using white wash semiwhite plastic retractible shade curtains deployed sun temporarily pierces optimum light levels around first stage callus formed stage roots start form take water stage root development phase light intensity levels gradually increased propagators find moles per day ie observed using daily light integral sensor result consistent rooting plants propagated stem leaf andor tip cuttings verification see discussion note plants
