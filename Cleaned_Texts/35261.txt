pinwheel shape roulade cooled chilling removed poaching salt serves four main purposes preservation food charcuterie kitchen first inducing osmosis process involves movement water outside membranes cells turn reabsorb salted water back cell process assists destruction harmful pathogens second dehydration means salt pulls excess water protein aids shelf life protein less moisture present bacterial growth fermentation third salt assists halting fermentation process would otherwise completely break meat finally salt assists denaturing proteins essence means structure proteins effectively shifted similar effects discovery nitrates nitrites german chemists around curing done unrefined salt saltpeter saltpeter gives inconsistent results preventing bacterial growth nitrate nitrite forms sodium nitrite sodium nitrate increased popularity consistent results nitrates take considerably longer period time break cured foods nitrites nitrates preferred curing salts lengthy curing drying periods nitrites often used foods require shorter curing time used item fully eventually portion nitrates converted bacterial action nitrite multiple purposes curing process one purpose flavor nitrites giving sharp piquant flavor meat second nitrites react substances meat produce nitric oxide nitric oxide prevents iron breaking fat meat thus halting rancidity binding also creates characteristic reddish color found cured meat finally nitrite inhibits growth botulismcausing organisms would ordinarily thrive oxygendeprived environment sausage casing german scientists originally

called prague powder ii instacure also colored pink differentiate table salt contains sodium nitrite sodium nitrate table salt mixture used dry sausages require longer drying period requires presence sweeteners flavoring agents necessary production many cured products due harsh flavors salt number sweeteners used curing foods including dextrose sugar corn syrup honey maple syrup dextrose seen often cured meat mellows harshness also increases moisture content cured product adding less sweetness cured meat sweeteners also assist stabilizing colors meat help fermentation process giving nutrient numerous spices herbs used curing process assist flavor final product sweet spices regularly used include cinnamon allspice nutmeg mace cardamom flavoring agents may include dried fresh chilies wine fruit juice fermented sausages created salting chopped ground meat remove moisture allowing beneficial bacteria break sugars flavorful molecules bacteria including lactobacillus species leuconostoc species break sugars produce lactic acid affects flavor sausage also lowers ph preventing growth bacteria could spoil sausage effects magnified drying process salt acidity concentrated
