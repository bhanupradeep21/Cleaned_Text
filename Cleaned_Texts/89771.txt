acral myxoinflammatory fibroblastic sarcoma amsf also termed myxoinflammatory fibroblastic sarcoma msf rare lowgrade soft tissue tumor world health organization classified category rarely metastasizing fibroblastic myofibroblastic locally aggressive neoplasm often recurs site surgical removal however usually grows slowly cases spreads distant amsf tumors commonly develop subcutaneous tissues arms legs adults equal incidence per million males tumors composed prominent inflammatory cell infiltrate admixed cells highly variable microscopic including particular distinctively large neoplastic epithelioid cells ie cells resembling epithelial lipoblastlike fibroblastic cells containing multiple variable microscopic appearances amsf tumors made difficult correctly diagnose many amsf lesions treated surgical resection goal remove tumor tissue order reduce local recurrences repeated local recurrences treated repeated surgical resections extreme cases combination radiation therapy surgical resection amputation involved appendage used treat tumors chemotherapy localized recurrent andor metastatic disease yet shown useful treatment strategy amsf tumors typically occur adults average age reported individuals aged individuals commonly present less commonly tumor located acral ie distal dorsal ie posterior side limb twothirds cases occur finger hand wrist foot minority cases tumors developed upper arm thigh shoulder inguinal area ie groin lower lateral upper back neck temple area head one case individuals commonly present painless slowly growing mass one size tumors ranged although one amsf tumor spanned supraclavicular infraclavicular fossa areas maximum diameter another amsf tumor thigh maximum diameter individuals often represent recurrence tumor site previous surgical removal rare cases present metastatic examined gross pathology amsf tumors typically lobulated gelatinous fleshy firm areas vary color texture often localized subcutaneous adipose tissue may infiltrate nearby histopathologic microscopic examinations hematoxylin eosin stained tumors characteristically show spindleshaped cells admixed prominent inflammationlike areas containing mixture neutrophils lymphocytes plasma cells areas lesions contain spindle cells often also occupied distinctively large variablyshaped epithelioid cells vesicleladen nuclei acidophilic readily stained acid dyes nucleoli cells termed reedsternberg celllike virocytelike ie cells similar viruses sticklike protrusions ganglion celllike tumors may also contain large vacuolated pseudolipoblasts ie cells resemble lipoblasts various cell types embedded myxoid ie blue purple compared normal connective tissue excessive uptake hematoxylin stain collagen fiberladen tissue addition cited cell types tumors may contain degenerated dying dead cells large histiocytelike cells engulfed cells usually neutrophils cellengulfing phenomenon termed one large study emperipolesis white blood cells appeared helpful indicator proportions numbers types cells varies greatly among cases thereby may present diagnostic challenges example amsf tumors dense inflammatory infiltrates obscure cell types thereby suggest lesion purely inflammatory recent immunohistochemical immunostaining small study amsf tumor tissue detected cells expressed vimentin protein almost cases expressed also termed ema pdpn proteins variable number cases express mlana also termed melana desmin gfap earlier studies reported cells express vimentin periodic acidschiff proteins many cases cytokeratin desmin expression profiles proteins sometimes differed different studies helpful identifying tumor several abnormalities chromosomes genes variably reported neoplastic cells minority amsf cases abnormalities include loses chromosome chromosome translocation gene located band short p arm chromosome gene located band long q arm chromosome presence ring chromosome associated overexpression protein also overexpressed various highgrade sarcomas well overexpression incompletely defined fusions braf gene located band q arm chromosome molecular findings yet shown involved development helpful diagnosing since immunostaining abnormal gene abnormal chromosome profiles amsf tissues nonspecific diagnosis tumors rests mostly patient presentation tumor histopathologic grounds amsf may confused myxoidrich

vessels lack inflammatory vrslike cells myxlps tumors consist monotonous cell population arranged discrete myxoidcellular clusters conspicuous thin branching capillaries chickenwire emc rumors contain epithelioidrounded cell population arranged single cells clusters linear cords lack vrslike cells neoplastic cells express diagnostic fusion genes involving gene fused either gene nodular fasciitis proliferative fasciitis lesions may myxoid areas unlike amsf tumors rapidly growing contain ganglionlike cells rare inflammatory may regress without lesions frequently present acral areas extremities

order remove neoplastic tissue treatment curative particularly tumor removed recurrences developed sites surgical removals repeated recurrences site commonly treated repeated surgical resections patients treated several resections amputations extremity may considered wide resection fails preserve functional lower extremity multiple resections consistently followed preoperative postoperative radiation therapy may role treating tumors especially cases surgical removal leaves tumor tissue behind minority cases ie amsf tumors metastasize distant radiation chemotherapy either alone
