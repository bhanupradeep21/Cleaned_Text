pointing gesture specifying direction persons body usually indicating location person event thing idea typically formed extending arm hand index finger although may functionally similar hand gestures types pointing may subdivided according intention person well linguistic function serves pointing typically develops within first two years life humans plays important role language development reading children central use sign language large number signs variation pointing nature pointing may differ children autism deaf may also vary gender typically observed children blind birth pointing may vary substantially across cultures many distinct types pointing regard physical gestures employed interpretation pointing especially people may considered inappropriate rude certain contexts many

vice considerable disagreement nature pointing behaviors nonhuman animals miklósi soproni described pointing species specific human communicative gesture regularly used species primates living kita concluded similarly evidence date humans use pointing gesture declarative share attention kovács colleagues state pointing referential communicative act seems unique human however claims pointing

pointing wild primates years recently possible examples source researchers claimed observe imperative pointing gestures produced bonobos attempting initiate genital well chimpanzees reaching towards objects although even researchers admitted rarity chimpanzee pointing wild chimpanzees bonobos shown seemingly signal gesture direct attention acts like directed scratching thus clear primates use gestures direct attention still uncertain whether done overtly humans source although question whether primates point wild still debate pointing captivity widely established primates leavens hopkins note pointing behavior observed captivity range species apes majority behavior spontaneous meaning without explicit training occurs rarely others present may accompanied visual monitoring person interacted audience gesture rather attentive object pointed moreover seems nonhuman great apes also take perspective communicative partner order produce clear unambiguous studies found apes point dual goal directing attention requesting food additionally sensitive looking behavior response pointing remain questions whether constitutes true whether nonhumans social cognitive abilities understand intentional communicative nature questions arise especially due nature primate pointing gestures produced humans apes often use full hand instead typical extended index finger humans however may countered observations apes trained use sign language point index recently studies also indicated chimpanzees captivity use pointing flexible signal raising arms order point objects thus apes certainly point difficult ascertain whether point naturally however debate may result fact procedural differences nonhuman primates tested making difficult ascertain nonhuman primates experimenter must safe result testing nonhuman primates thus barrier introduced participant experimenter dogs infants precaution however udell colleagues tested dogs without fence using object choice task similar manner barrier authors reported barrier produced decrease terms success canines also shown pointing well barriers present dogs showed lower success rates highlighting debate may partially result systematic procedural differences contrast production pointing nonhuman animal species appropriately respond pointing gestures preferring object direction previously indicated gesture follow pointing gesture human chance dogs rely different types human performance comparable toddlers similar however seems default function pointing different dogs humans pointing actions refer particular locations directions imperative manner gestures usually indicate specific objects humans ask new information comment considerable debate whether apes able comprehend pointing gestures well even argued dogs better able understand pointing apes hypothesize pointing comprehension prevalent species stronger tendency cooperate would explain negative results apes due mainly competitive relationship present species apes however wolves fare poorly pointing comprehension tests well highly cooperative species countering recent studies refuted claim apes poor comprehending pointing provide evidence tests used evaluate pointing comprehension often inaccurate especially thus conflicting evidence debate whether apes fully comprehend pointing gestures httpsenwikipediaorgwikipointing
