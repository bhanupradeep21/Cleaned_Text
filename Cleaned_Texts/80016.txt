rajasaurus meaning king lizard genus carnivorous abelisaurid theropod dinosaur late cretaceous india containing one species rajasaurus narmadensis bones excavated lameta formation gujarat state western india probably inhabiting narmada river valley formally described palaeontologist jeffrey wilson colleagues based partial skeleton comprising braincase spine hip bone legs first indian theropod dinosaur likely measured metres ft single horn forehead probably used display headbutting like abelisaurids rajasaurus probably ambush predator india time island due breakup supercontinent gondwana though possible animals still able migrate nearby continents creation subfamily majungasaurinae inclusion abelisaurids india madagascar reiterates lameta formation yielded several dinosaur species including abelisaurids titanosaurian sauropods similar gondwanan landmasses area cretaceous probably forested served nesting grounds several creatures lameta formation first discovered

rajasaurus formally described geologist jeffrey wilson holotype specimen rajasaurus comprises partial skeleton gsi type includes maxillae premaxillae braincase quadrate bone skull spine hip bone legs tail postcranial remains first indian theropod preserved postcranial remains possible rajasaurus lametasaurus indosaurus synonymous though confirmed due fragmentary remains lametasaurus specimen generic name rajasaurus derives sanskrit rƒÅja meaning king sovereign chief best kind ancient greek sauros meaning lizard specific name narmadensis refers narmada river central india near palaeontologist gregory paul estimated body length rajasaurus metres ft weight metric tons short length estimated metres ft though weight estimate taken like madagascan counterpart probably weight kg rajasaurus closely resembled madagascan abelisaurid rajasaurus typically four fingers short arms compensate heavilyconstructed head primary tool hunting however skull short probably modest jaw musculature teeth rajasaurus probably bite force similar allosaurus around newtons braincase left sides parietal frontal bones preserved braincase thick frontals achieving maximum thickness centimetres eye socket frontals near midline path olfactory tract part smelling rims supratemporal fossae depressions either side top skull form low sagittal crest along middle top skull front rims fossae unusually steep abelisaurids typically elongated fenestrae holes skull quadrate bone near bottom skull rajasaurus elongated supratemporal fenestrae near top skull unlike theropods similar majungasaurus crista prootica typically ridge along otic capsule bone ear juts outward rajasaurus low horn forehead primarily made nasal bone frontal unlike horn majungasaurus horn life probably size fossilized horn unlike carnotaurus life horn extended thickened layer skin though rajasaurus thickened layer skin probably add overall length troughlike groove bordered raised wall present frontal meets nasal decreasing height width towards midline serving support horn one neck middle preserved proportionally shorter ceratosaurs broader tall spoolshaped like ceratosaurs back face vertebra connects another vertebra concave however unlike ceratosaurs front face also concave like ceratosaurs neck vertebra two air pockets though unusually close head eleven partial spoolshaped dorsal vertebrae found likely fourth thoracic well preserved faces concave deeper broad contrast neck vertebra opposite vertebrae contain many air pockets bottomside six sacral vertebrae preserved elongated decreasing width towards ends arching three partial tail vertebrae found likely middlesection tail also concave faces cylindrical part hip juts attach ischium ischial peduncle projects farther pubic peduncle causes hipjoint farther backunderside hip iliac crests side hip ischium pubic bone thin compared hipjoint area centimetres respectively thickness fibula outside portion lower leg knee decreases width top bottom slightly concave similar ceratosaurus second metatarsal bone connects ankle bone second toe robust ovalshaped slightly concave joint ankle width decrease gets nearer toes fourth metatarsal bone similar proportions second metatarsal second metatarsals preserved left fourth metatarsal wilson assigned rajasaurus subfamily carnotaurinae closely related abelisaurids like majungasaurus south american carnotaurus african africa believed separated gondwana first south america india madagascar connected via basis several similarities presence sagittal crest neck vertebrae two air pockets configuration nasal bones fleshy growth excrescence frontal bone thick skull however case african abelisaurids would display endemism palaeontologist matthew carrano created subfamily brachyrostra south american abelisaurids sister taxon carnotaurinae abelisaurids migrating gondwanan continents via small land connections broke apart completely separated middle subfamily majungasaurinae erected palaeontologist thierry tortosa separate newly discovered european arcovenator majungasaurus indosaurus rahiolisaurus rajasaurus south american abelisaurids based physical characteristics elongated antorbital fenestrae front eye sockets sagittal crest widens triangular surface towards front head despite large oceanic barriers suggested migration abelisaurids took place late cretaceous africa europe madagascar india ultimately isolated south american abelisaurids possible migration occurred europe india across africa given proximity volcanic draskohistan island arc may allowed island hopping indirect path asia though still questionable following cladogram recovered tortosa ceratosaurus noasauridae carnotaurus abelisaurus rajasaurus majungasaurus indosaurus rahiolisaurus arcovenator rajasaurus distinguished genera single forehead horn though majungasaurus also one elongated supratemporal fenestrae holes upper rear skull ilia bones hip feature ridge separating brevis shelf hip horn rajasaurus could used display headbutting rajasaurus headbutting inferred lack shockabsorbing cancellous bone skull could either lowmotion shoving matches like modern day marine iguanas amblyrhynchus cristatus focused neck flank like giraffes giraffa spp neck muscles though abelisaurids adapted withstanding high stress horn could used defending territory mating abelisaurids may ambush predators using biteandhold tactic hunt large prey leg bones majungasaurus comparatively short similarlysized theropods suggesting dinosaur comparatively condition seen
