regenerative medicine deals process replacing engineering regenerating human animal cells tissues organs restore establish normal field holds promise engineering damaged tissues organs stimulating bodys repair mechanisms functionally heal previously irreparable tissues regenerative medicine also includes possibility growing tissues organs laboratory implanting body heal cell source regenerated organ derived patients tissue challenge organ transplant rejection via immunological mismatch approach could alleviate problem shortage organs available donation biomedical approaches within field regenerative medicine may involve use stem examples include injection stem cells progenitor cells obtained directed differentiation cell therapies induction regeneration biologically active molecules administered alone secretion infused cells immunomodulation therapy transplantation vitro grown organs tissues tissue ancient greeks postulated whether parts body could regenerated skin grafting invented late century thought earliest major attempt recreate bodily tissue restore structure advances transplanting body parts century pushed theory body parts could regenerate grow new cells
