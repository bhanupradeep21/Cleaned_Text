idiosyncratic hallmark nlsd enabling distinguished myopathies arising alternative muscular nlsd often diagnosed presence lipid inclusions within leukocytes jordans detected using histology electron classically nlsd associated myopathy cases linked ichthyosis therefore symptoms diagnosis likely patient could would diagnosed although lipid accumulation prominent myocytes hepatocytes granulocytes

decrease fat catabolism low fat diets recommended slowing progression disease including onset type diabetes hypothyroidism addition diets containing triglycerides composed short chain fatty acids beneficial tgas containing long chain fatty acids ketone bodies rapidly transported catabolized used many tissues including brain mediumchain fatty acids individuals diet rapidly used body limiting storage therefore alleviating lipid droplet accumulation foods mediumchain fatty acids include dairy fat coconut oil supplements also taken increase uptake fatty acids triaheptanoin triglyceride
