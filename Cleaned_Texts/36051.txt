thrifty phenotype hales barker sometimes called barkers hypothesis professor david j p barker researching university southampton published theory thrifty phenotype hypothesis says earlylife metabolic adaptations help survival organism selecting appropriate trajectory growth response environmental cues example type diabetes review barker hales discuss evidence beta cells abnormally develop due malnutrition fetal development causing insulin abnormalities later life review also notes low birth weight alone necessarily mean manifestation thrifty phenotype since low birth weight exclusively caused maternal malnutrition meaning factors could influence low birth term thrifty phenotype coined barker noted phenomenon cardiovascular disease lecture paper discusses role malnutrition fetal
