subtle american dad creators revealed working significantly advance newly broadcast episodes many unaired episodes typically ready finishing touches barker explained key system making sure writing timeless opposed topical contemporary added material within script deals contemporary issues creators hope theyre also contemporary issues two years line asked whether method ever brought difficulties barker answered affirmative explained discussing creation american dad animated sitcoms general macfarlane stated conversely barker stated smith family housemates reside cherry street fictional suburb langley falls large twostory residence basement attic addition smith house apparently enhanced numerous secret rooms facilities large habitats unorthodox attachments usually seen apiece ie episodes ice men bush comes dinner missing kink full cognitive redaction avery bullock coward stan smith greg terry gay couple live across street smiths within neighborhood portrayed running neater tidier home smiths greg terry also local news anchor wangtv also area high school attended steve pearl bailey high voice actors assembled group performing lines characters rather voice actors perform lines privately voice actors stated personalities tendency goof together group would never get anything completed performed lines american dad commonly made use farces predicaments befall main characters escalated extremes point getting outrageously example episode home wrecker stan francines marital harmony breaks difference opinion remodeling house gets point divide house two decorating half house desired fashion still satisfied attempt drive home eventually erect colossal block wall dividing two halves house rest family members forced spend one holiday next alternating frans stans place sides house treated distinct homes another example episode stans food restaurant stan asks rogers help starting restaurant things progress roger makes heavy changes layout eventually kicking stan project stan retaliates opening another restaurant next door becomes smashing success roger responds blowing stans restaurant destroying process stan threatens kill roger backs roger pulls gun tells american dad plots generally teeming surrealism nonsensical many occurrences circumstances behaviors unrestrainedly preposterous senseless examples surrealism american episode hurricane ferocious bear pauses attack lowers eyelids halfway repeatedly shakes head horizontally shaming stan missing harpoon shot instead spearing francine wall episode cant friends hallways smith house transform dark dangerous alleyways every time roger pays jeff ambushes disguise steal money back even tries forcibly rape episode missing kink steve family fish klaus shown competing oneonone basketball game score nearly tied also missing kink episode smith house shown consist neverbeforeseen underworld various friends acquaintances smiths party frolic episode full cognitive redaction avery bullock coward stan smith stan neverbeforeseen secret control room hidden underground beside house control room doors exterior side camouflaged grass surrounding room filled highly advanced stateoftheart equipment access control room achieved handprint reading device extends ground stan extends armhand among many forms surreal humor nonsense elements used american dad non sequiturstory within story technique arises shows focus becomes sidetracked entirely unknown unrelated characters circumstances irrelevant episodes main plot typically happens show maintained focus main characters much episode following scenes randomly lose focus become deeply wrapped lives neverbeforeseen characters noncentral plot prime example episode homeland insecurity opposed scenes focusing main characters attention redirected deep lives unknown characters gain possession rogers gemencrusted golden feces storyline dramas resulting golden turd continues later episodes another example episode missing kink shows focus sporadically sidetracked brief scenes revolving around life drug abusing bird francines inexplicable ability understand communicate birds series abounded random unexpected occurrences surprise plot twists result characters makeup example episode full cognitive redaction avery bullock coward stan smith steve refers roger help dealing school bully luiz steve able correctly predict rogers original game plan handling situation alter ego roger throws curveball hires stelio kontos episode bully steve stans bully handle matter hires bully steve steves original bully luiz wont want another bullys sloppy seconds luiz encouraged steve goes beat guy beat yet learns stelio kontos two bullies team along roger target steve stelio kontoss song sounds revamped roger adding luiz another example episode vacation goo francine becomes frustrated get family together sunday night dinner family time stan suggests vacation smiths great time maui family roger shuts mechanism francine kids attached believe vacation francine kids learn stan programming pseudovacation every year contraption dubbed goo chambers learning francine demands go real vacation twice appear first skiing italy ultimately revealed goo chambers along steve hayley programmed vacations respectively episode spelling bee baby steve deliberately misspells words spelling bee express love akiko also competing instead spelling random tyler perrymadea another technique used american dad story arc several occasions circumstance expands progresses across collection example one hayleys temporary breakups jeff expanded across string episodes instead temporarily dated black man koala body reginald urban mannerisms behaviors another example since season episode naked limit one time jeff fischer absent smith house planet earth altogether episode jeff blindsided roger hurls spaceship spacecraft belongs rogers race aliens intended return back birth planet roger remains behind casting jeff spaceship spaceship immediately takes jeff seen several episodes later episode lost space episodes aired two aforementioned episodes allusions ongoing plot line made example episode spelling bee baby hayley shown holding hope jeffs return episode roger stan attempt rush hayley grieving process willing tennis episode longest distance relationship jeff gets touch hayley via radio ultimately tells wait move life story arc finally resolved episode holy shit jeffs back jeff supposedly returns earth turns alien called zebleer masquerading jeff real jeff dissected jeffs brain transplanted zebleers body allowing real jeff live stan hayleys memories wiped leaving unaware jeff longer entirely human plot point continued end bahama mama roger mentions jeff get hayley pregnant alien body agrees rebirth jeff rogers baby end episode jeff human hayley earth another example usage story arcs christmas specials starting season episode sleigh bell tolls santa claus became main antagonist arc vowing get revenge smiths nearly killed steve aforementioned storyline expands season episode minstrel krampus episode concludes small change status quo stans father jack fuses krampus soul becomes new krampus death season santa returns season episode ninety north zero west santa kidnaps steve take world unleashing ancient god north pole seemingly killed falling cliff breaking storyline continues following season episode santa schmanta albeit directly related story arc explain santas death reveals revived end discussing cartoons distinguishing story arc element cocreator mike barker explained much wit used american dad come form black comedy many predicaments circumstances made fun characters lifethreatening disastrous terrifying traumatic example episode ward show contains scenes suicide murder roger became steves legal guardian responded getting picked school rigging teachers cars explosives killing later episode principal lewis driving vehicle steve passenger informed steve drive grand canyon murdersuicide culminated roger saving day love supernaturally allowing car fly principal lewis drove canyon another vehicle random white man black boy opposite principal lewis black man steve white boy also coincidentally enough driven opposite side grand canyon murdersuicide attempt resulted midair collision car principal lewis steve car white man black boy another example episode da flippity flop roger
