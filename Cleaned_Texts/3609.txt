scientists conducting investigations exact mechanisms changes help create treatments since osteoradionecrosis orn first described regaud several competing theories emerged years resultant changes

severe trismus develops dentures prescribed denture trauma may cause patient wishes must also taken teeth required extracted ideally completed soon possible maximise healing prior radiotherapy one study recommended minimum days prior however commencement radiotherapy delayed little difference frequency orn pre postradiotherapy recommended trauma kept minimum important ensure tooth brushing technique habit kept high standard patients undergoing head neck radiotherapy may experience sore mouth therefore soft bristle toothbrush may preferred chlorhexidine mouthwash also used conjunction tooth brushing sore mucosa diluted equal amounts fluoride regime also encouraged either high fluoride toothpaste duraphat wearing splints fluoride gel applied minutesday alcohol free fluoride patient oral condition needs taken consideration tailored accordingly trismus may present would allow back mouth accessed fluoride splints trays may also experience difficulty tolerating toothpastes mouthwashes due altered taste mucosal ulceration also important patient maintains high level motivation taking care oral hygiene attending dental appointments dental practitioner able monitor radiotherapy oral preparations prescribed aid sore dry mouth fully understood patients avoid preparations cause damage teeth saliva substitutes given ph patients still susceptible radiation caries periodontal disease present dry mouth access difficulty tooth brushing restorative periodontal procedures commenced indicated endodontic treatments take priority extractions although difficulty mouth
