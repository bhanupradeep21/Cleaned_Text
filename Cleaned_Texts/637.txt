female fertility affected age major fertility factor women womans fertility generally good quality late teens early thirties although declines gradually time around fertility noted decline rapid rate many sources suggest dramatic drop around unclear since studies conducted since one study european women found fertility groups fourpercent age woman starting try conceive live birth percent menopause cessation menstrual periods generally occurs marks cessation fertility although agerelated infertility occur relationship age female fertility sometimes referred womans biological average age girls first period menarche years united postmenarchal girls cycles anovulatory first year menarche third sixth womans fertility peaks early starts decline however exact estimates chances woman conceive certain age clear subject according national institute health clinical excellence nice every women aged regular unprotected sexual intercourse get pregnant within year trying second year percentage rises study henri leridon phd epidemiologist french institute health medical research women trying get pregnant without using fertility drugs vitro fertilization following results rates conception age according study done sample healthy european couples ages fertility starts declining age drops somewhat greater rate age statistical analysis showed women age group significantly less chance average becoming pregnant pregnancy rates change notably age group age group dropped significantly age age male partner significant impact female fertility among women reached among younger women however experts said new study small many variables difficult sort clear conclusion drawn experts suggested main change fertility older women fact took longer conceive necessarily significantly unlikely eventually succeed david dunson biostatistician us national institute environmental health sciences said although noted decline female fertility late found decrease probability becoming pregnant per

young ages researchers tend agree older ages discrepancy terms ovarian reserve typical woman reserve age age variation ovarian reserve due age making age important factor female infertility common methods checking status ovarian reserve perform blood test day menstrual cycle measure serum folliclestimulating hormone fsh level alternatively blood test measure serum antimüllerian hormone amh level give similar information transvaginal ultrasound also used count number follicles procedure called antral follicle count american college obstetricians gynecologists recommends ovarian reserve testing performed women older years conceived months attempting pregnancy women higher risk diminished ovarian reserve history cancer treated gonadotoxic therapy pelvic irradiation medical conditions treated gonadotoxic therapies ovarian surgery important recognize poor result ovarian reserve testing signify absolute inability conceive sole criterion considered limit deny access infertility study population french women shows married age children average remained childless women married age years mean children remained childless women married years mean children remained average age last birth natural fertility populations studied around study done large population american hutterites never used birth control investigators measured relationship age female partner fertility infertility rates today believed higher general population population study study found inverse correlation age female fertility later reproductive life argued motivate family planning well reached years mapping womans ovarian reserve follicular dynamics associated biomarkers give individual prognosis future chances pregnancy facilitating informed choice notably higher level antimüllerian hormone tested women general population found positive correlation natural fertility women aged aiming conceive spontaneously even adjusting thus amh measurement helpful determine women may need conceive earlier age women potentially recommended women infertility evaluation age age achieved pregnancy trying many cases infertility treated many reproductive technologies success declines age issues age discussed qualified fertility specialist reproductive endocrinologist vitro fertilization ivf assisted reproductive technology used treat infertility help families offspring many women advanced age may opt ivf treatment order children patients higher maternal age years old found worse ivf outcomes higher miscarriage rate compared year ivf centers attempt ivf using patients eggs age clinically reproductive endocrinologists tend pursue ivf aggressively women oocyte cryopreservation egg freezing procedure done preserve eggs oocytes eggs thawed fertilized transferred uterus via ivf procedure gives women ability delay pregnancy avoid many infertility problems arise germ cell deterioration studies shown risk acquiring congenital abnormalities increased infants born frozen thawed ivf thawed eggs successful implantation rate compared ivf performed fresh chromosomal abnormalities avoided egg freezing pregnancy older age increases risk gestational diabetes preeclampsia preterm labor cesarean

reverse process reproductive ageing women limited despite recent reports potential existence stem cells may used restore ovarian women become pregnant age increased risk complications affect mother fetus comes mother several research studies shown pregnant women years age increased risk hypertension pregnancy eclampsia hypertension pregnancy seizures gestational women become pregnant age also risk delivery complications include stillbirth miscarriage complications leading delivery via caesarean fetal complications pregnant women age also high one wellknown risk increased risk baby syndrome according academy obstetrics gynecology research shown risk syndrome increases proportionally increasing maternal probability conceiving child syndrome according maternal age addition syndrome pregnant women also increased risk birth defects study conducted gill et al found association advanced maternal age birth defects cardiac issues esophageal atresia hypospadias lastly studies reported pregnant women also increased risk premature birth babies low birth substantial evidence indicates capability repair dna double strand breaks repair pathway involving breast cancer type susceptibility
