several ways pharmaceuticals treating multiple sclerosis ms reach market novel pharmaceuticals enter us market without fda approval typically requires evidence safety efficacy human trials large fees submitted fda found adequate pharmaceuticals already market vitamin may never financial incentives relatively insignificant thus lack approval drugs implies neither efficacy lack efficacy general novel pharmaceuticals enter market without government approval standards political influences vary typical path approval century may include basic research leading understanding mechanisms disease progression prevention chemical pathways candidate medications aid interfere pathways may tested vitro animal model later three typically sequential phases testing humans common promising results regarding safety efficacy side effects generally needed major phase development usually regulatory agencies approve multiple sclerosis medication specific clinical course treatments rrms

nspmsnonactive spms hams highly active rpms rapidly progressive phase iii programs consist studies large patient groups aimed definitive assessment effective safe test drug last stage drug development followed submission appropriate regulatory agencies eg european medicines agency ema european union food drug administration fda united states therapeutic goods administration tga australia etc obtain

continue earlier safety assessments obtained healthy volunteers treatment ms phase ii studies months usually shorter phase iii studies phase medicaments used animal models would make huge list special interest listed side effects dangers medications classified first second line first line includes safest less effective compounds ie interferons glatimer second line includes rest compounds usually stronger medication ms organizations separate medications three compounds regulatory eg fda approval shown safe effective another purpose however approved specifically ms may lack funding go approval
