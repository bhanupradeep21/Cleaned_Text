dmard monotherapy methotrexate preferred moderate severe disease activity recommended combine conventional dmards add tnfα inhibitors nontnf biologic gout another common type inflammatory arthritis typically affects one joint time pharmacological treatment gout typically relies management flareups flareups treated use nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids like ibuprofen steroids andor antiinflammatory medication juvenile rheumatoid arthritis common type childhood age arthritis cause permanent physical damage pharmacological interventions include nsaids naproxen ibuprofen indomethacin intraarticular corticosteroid iac injections like triamcinolone hexacetonide th conventional dmards methotrexate tnf inhibitors antiarthritic drugs used treat prevent joint pain joint diseases medications also provide symptomatic relief common arthritic joint symptoms including swelling tenderness pain stiffness decreased range symptoms may persist occur periodically symptoms managed major complications may develop including permanent joint changes chronic pain functional ultimately antiarthritic treatments aim achieve disease remission low disease activity remission achieved thereby improving quality pharmacological effects antiarthritic medications typically exerted reduction inflammation suppression immune system andor aid easing pain diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs dmards often used decrease inflammation site injury ra dmards also act relieve pain decrease progression worsening ra mainly functions slowing stopping immune system attacking conventional dmards known firstline treatment rheumatoid treatment monotherapy combination antiarthritic medications common dmards include oral methotrexate leflunomide sulfasalazine conventional dmards slow onset action take months exhibit shortterm bridging treatment corticosteroid often considered introducing treatment new conventional dmard use shortterm corticosteroids help rapid symptomatic relief waiting dmard exert effect methotrexate considered preferred conventional dmard treat route administration includes oral tablets liquids well intravenous subcutaneous injections methotrexate dmards acts competitive inhibitor enzyme dihydrofolate reductase hinders formation tetrahydrofolate essential synthesis purine pyrimidine consequently controls formation dna rna responsible immune response preventing formation tetrahydrofolate subsequent proteins dmards suppresses immune response reduces arthritis inflammation methotrexate commonly associated doserelated toxic effects involving bone marrow gastrointestinal folic acid may given weekly help diminish frequency methotrexate also associated acute chronic liver damage adverse effects folic acid vitamin may given medical practitioners drug therapy using methotrexate folic acid acts provide protection healthy cells human help reduce side effects contraindications methotrexate addition methotrexate teratogenic associated fetal consequence avoided pregnancy biologic response modifiers biological therapies drugs classified special type dmards typically administered conventional dmards genetically engineered target various proteins involved immune response route administration available intravenous subcutaneous biologic response modifiers commonly used monotherapy combination nonbiologics methotrexate combination biologics advised due limited additional benefit accompanied substantial increase biologic response modifiers divided classes based protein molecules inhibits tumor necrosis factor tnf white blood cells like b cells biologic response modifiers act altering immune response human body mechanism action either interfering effect cytokines inhibiting costimulation cell activation inhibiting b cytokines proinflammatory responsible regulating human immune tnfα inhibitors commonly prescribed medication among biologic response modifiers used treat arthritis patients rheumatic conditions may higher levels tnf systemic result increased levels tnf would inflammation persistent symptoms certolizumab tnfα inhibitor administered particularly involved proinflammatory cytokines contributing arthritic inhibition cytokines effective reducing inflammation consequently reducing severity selective costimulation modulator cells type biologic targets inhibition cell activation well selective blocking interaction receptors prevent interaction receptors drugs modulate binding receptors antigen presenting cells result type biologic inhibits cell proliferation b cell immunological abatacept available antiarthritic medication moderate severe ra biologic also used treat patients juvenile rheumatoid b cells b lymphocytes type white blood cells contribute pathogenesis b cells variety functions including efficient apc contribute cell activation produce cytokines promote permeation leukocytes joints therapeutic effect b cells inhibitor dependent disruption diverse functions adverse reactions biologic response modifier therapies associated mechanism action disrupts immune homeostasis human inhibitory biologics cause suppression immune response resulting increase risk susceptibility common infections may also cause mild side effects headache janus kinase jak inhibitors used treat ra similar biologic response modifiers drugs act reduce immune however medications available tablet formulations unlike jak inhibitors act inhibiting janus kinases consequently affect cascade enzymes responsible signaling variety cytokine haematopoietic growth factor consequence inhibiting enzymes leads control suppression immune pathways common side effect using jak inhibitors increased susceptibility infections analgesics painkillers defined medications help manage reduce pain often used treatments arthritis provide relief site injury acetaminophen opioids counterirritants common analgesics used therapy arthritis however drugs control acetaminophenparacetamol common overthecounter option manage pain commonly used relieve mild moderate severity various routes administration including oral rectal acetaminophen often recommended treating osteoarthritic patients despite mechanism action acetaminophen completely understood appears act cox pathway reduces cox activity inhibiting synthesis prostaglandins central nervous reduction cox activity contributes analgesic hepatotoxicity often associated overdose acetaminophen causing acute liver failure maximum recommended daily dosage adult severe cases arthritic pain opioids may prescribed general practitioner example tramadol oxycodone hydrocodone opioids function central nervous system provide pain relief long term use opioids associated mental physical side effects including drug common side effects opioids counterirritant drug belongs analgesic class typically agents topical formulations ointments creams contain menthol capsaicin provides modest pain relief effective managing severe counterirritants act exciting subsequently desensitizing epidermal nociceptive sensory applied site injury produces heating sensation consequently surface irritation skin sensation interferes transmission pain signals joints brain thereby distracting brain topical therapies minimize systemic exposure reduce risks patients developing adverse events common orally administered pain management medications however counterirritants associated undesirable reactions site application typical side effects include dryness erythema burning nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids belongs drug class analgesic antiinflammatory nsaids often found overthecounter including ibuprofen naproxen may exceptions nsaids available prescription oral nsaids may cause discomfort stomach may also increase risk heart attack stroke formulation types also available creams gels applied directly joints nsaids exhibit pharmacological effects inhibition cyclooxygenase cox enzyme cox necessary protein facilitates conversion arachidonic acid thromboxanes prostaglandins prostacyclins cox activity inhibited synthesis subsequent eicosanoids reduced result nsaids produce analgesic antiinflammatory similar corticosteroids nsaids used short periods time due risk side effects common side effects nsaids include rarer side effects consist complications affecting liver kidneys heart circulation potentiating cause heart failure heart attacks corticosteroid class drugs features reduction inflammation suppression immune common medication includes prednisone cortisone corticosteroids taken orally injected directly painful joints due extensive risk side effects associated use corticosteroids generally recommended short term therapy example flareup episode arthritic symptoms shortterm corticosteroids administered rapidly decrease inflammation joints corticosteroids mediates multiple steps inflammatory pathway exert effect steroid compound binds glucocorticoid receptors
