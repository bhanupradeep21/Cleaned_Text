message design logic communication theory makes claim individuals possess implicit theories communication within called message design referred theory theories message design logic offers three different fundamental premises reasoning author barbara keefe describes message design logic kind communicationconstituting belief system message producer relies reasoning goals sought message design used three premises expressive logic conventional logic rhetorical logic belief systems communicators might utilize designing messages message design logics therefore represent internally consistent developmentally ordered stages acquisition working knowledge systematic properties verbal messages keefe describes premise associated constellation related beliefs communicationconstituting concept conception functional possibilities communication unit formation procedures principles coherence underlying idea behind keefes work communication necessarily uniform process three components message design logic based individuals levels cognitive complexity expressed messages vary organization content whether components represent different levels communication effectiveness labeled debatable communication seen simplest form message production fundamental premise expressive design logic language medium expressing thoughts feelings premise simplest three logics explains someone says feel long feeling conveyed message message deemed successful keefe gives two reasons individuals operate design logic literal comes impression message design interpretation first fail appreciate communication process expression made serve goals second interpret messages independent units rather threads interaction fabric individuals communicate expressively recognize idea messages might designed induce particular reactions receiver believe messages taken straightforwardly receiver thoughts feelings reactions communicated back sender idea two possible relationships held speakers intentions messages fully honestly express speakers current mental state convey distorted version speakers mental state though editing lying due extreme straightforwardness expressive messages may contain multiple facets viewed negative discussing communicative effectiveness pointless content excessive knowledge speaker feels wants redundancies due thought recycled noncontingent threats insults simple announcements punishments inoffensive inappropriate comments complimentary personal remarks inappropriately ultimately individuals using expressive design logic believe element unites speakers messages simply speakers mind whether items information one encounter items complex chain associations fundamental premise conventional design logic communication game played cooperatively according socially conventional rules procedures opposed expressive design logic communicator using conventional design logic distinguishes thought design logic language viewed means expressing propositions specified social effect one wants achieve practice conventional design logic consider various contexts fixed parameters therefore design messages based upon appropriate message designing done format cooperation speaker hearer using logic particularly valuable achieve particular goals communication means goals achieved example someone constructing conventional message would relate message context particular situation hand order achieve certain goals seen elaborate way constructing messages fundamental premise rhetorical design logic communication creation negotiation social selves situations communicators using logic messages designed portray speaker wants reality belief system keefe explains meaning treated matter dramaturgical enactment social negotiation opposed conventional design logic says design messages relevant given context rhetorical design logic seeks create context using designed messages creating context accomplished using coordination negotiation coordination rhetorical design seeks repeatedly solve coordination problems order create social negotiation communication operates presumption strategically exploit meaning rhetorical message producers always seek achieve consensus social legitimation reality speak thus possibility negotiation always messages proactive rather reactive designed towards effects rather response actions rhetorical messages also normally contain elaborating contextualizing clauses phrases provide explicit definitions context lastly keefe summarizes internal coherence rhetorical designed messages deriving elements related intersubjectively available goaloriented schemes many scholars verified used keefes work research example peterson albrecht uses message design logic posit relationship superiors subordinates message design logic likewise another study done explored relationships among individuals message design logics levels social dr gwen hullman used message design logic help study perceptions communication competence conclusion research relation message design speakers rhetorical regulative messages perceived effective appropriate rated competent findings reflect ideas keefe stated original work rhetorical speakers better align goals partners keefes message design logic also used study done carmen cortes chad larson dale hample study designed see difference interpersonal construct differentiation reflected sophistication designed addition dr hullmans study article resulted keefe predicted study keefe said people differentiated also tend employ sophisticated logics challenging cortes larson hample found differentiation reflects sophistication person perceives others message design logic knowledge structure regarding communication critics theory hard find joy hart louisville university reviews examines keefes work including full critique assumptions believes made hart claims keefe assumes developmental continuum communication skill examines assumption individuals may progress rhetorical message design logic highest level development critiques assumption seen cultural intercultural differences specific assumption hart criticizes proposition person surrounded social environment culture negotiation possible person proceed quickly rhetorical message design httpsenwikipediaorgwikimessagedesignlogic
