pseudomyxoma peritonei pmp clinical condition caused cancerous cells mucinous adenocarcinoma produce abundant mucin gelatinous tumors cause fibrosis tissues impede digestion organ function left untreated tumors mucin produce fill abdominal cavity result compression organs destroy function colon small intestine stomach organs prognosis treatment many cases disease lethal untreated death occurring via cachexia bowel obstruction types complications disease commonly caused appendiceal primary cancer cancer appendix mucinous tumors ovary also implicated although cases ovarian involvement favored metastasis appendiceal gastrointestinal source disease typically classified low highgrade signet ring cells disease presents lowgrade histologic features cancer rarely spreads lymphatic system bloodstream signs symptoms pseudomyxoma peritonei may include abdominal pelvic pain andor bloating distension digestive disorders weight changes increased girth infertilitycitation needed primary tumor appears arise expressing goblet cells commonly cells appendix kras genes may involved oncogenesis may diagnosed range conditions majority cases associated appendiceal conditions may also found including disseminated peritoneal adenomucinosis dpam peritoneal carcinomas several mucinous tumors mucinous adenocarcinoma mucinous cystadenoma mucinous cystadenocarcinoma well disease primary sites reported include colon rectum stomach gallbladder bile ducts small intestine urinary bladder lung breast fallopian tubes pancreas disease often discovered surgery conditions eg hernia repair following experienced pathologist confirm diagnosis advanced stages may present tumors palpable abdomen distention belly jelly belly sometimes used slang term condition due rarity disease important obtain accurate diagnosis appropriate treatment may obtained gastro intestinal cancer surgeon diagnostic tests may include ct scans examination tissue samples obtained laparoscopy evaluation tumor markers cases colonoscopy unsuitable diagnostic tool cases appendix cancer invades abdominal cavity colon however spread inside colon occasionally reported pet scans may used evaluate highgrade mucinous adenocarcinoma test reliable detecting lowgrade tumors take dye shows scans new mri procedures developed disease monitoring standard mris typically used diagnostic tool diagnosis confirmed pathologycitation needed substantial debate regarding histopathologic classification pseudomyxoma ronnett et proposed separating pseudomyxoma peritonei cases two diagnostic categories adenoma disseminated peritoneal adenomucinosis dpam carcinoma peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis pmca third category reserved cases intermediate features classification system cases dpam characterized peritoneal lesions composed abundant extracellular mucin containing scant simple focally proliferative mucinous epithelium little cytologic atypia mitotic activity words cells looked fairly normal evidence mitosis would indicate cells rapidly dividing without associated appendiceal mucinous adenoma cases pmca characterized peritoneal lesions composed abundant mucinous epithelium architectural cytologic features carcinoma irregular cells evidence cells rapidly dividing criteria without associated primary mucinous adenocarcinoma bradley et al argued continued use nonmalignant terms ie adenoma frequent cases lowgrade features dpam misleading pseudomyxoma peritonei disease state results invasion abdominal cavity cells uncontrolled growth bradley states adenoma definition tumor confined appendiceal mucosa absolutely evidence invasion beyond muscularis mucosae term mucinous adenocarcinoma used different contexts depending reference material used pathologist disease classification example neoplasms characterized highgrade features invasive glands signet ring cells termed adenocarcinoma pathology however pathologists eg odze goldblum surgical pathology gi tract liver biliary tract pancreas ed also use term mucinous adenocarcinoma referring lowgrade welldifferentiated tumors lacking highgrade features lowgrade mucinous adenocarcinoma used american joint committee cancer world health organization nearly completely synonymous dpam lowgrade mucinous adenocarcinoma disease may designated benign tumors invade deeply tissue rarely metastasize parenchyma organs designation may misleading confusing layperson pseudomyxoma peritonei harmless condition fatal untreated highgrade poorly differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma generally poorer prognosis though surgical treatment heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy hipec yielding promising outcomes see surgical treatment immunohistochemical features treatment variable due rarity frequently slowgrowing nature treatment ranges watchful waiting debulking hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy hipec also called intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemotherapy iphc cytoreductive standard care mucinous adenocarcinoma clinical condition involves cytoreductive surgery crs hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy hipec performed surgical oncologists specialize treating pmp surgeons also apply early postoperative intraperitonial chemotherapy epic adjunct surgical cytoreduction hipec situations surgery required immediately patients monitored via ct scans tumor marker laboratory tests physical symptoms determine surgery warranted although surgical procedures may rather extensive patients recover surgery majority patients live productive debulking surgeon attempts remove much tumor possible crs cytoreductive surgery involves surgical removal peritoneum adjacent organs appear tumor seeding since mucus tends pool bottom abdominal cavity common remove ovaries fallopian tubes uterus parts large intestine depending upon spread tumor organs might removed including limited gallbladder spleen portions small intestine andor stomach organs removed safely like liver surgeon strips tumor chemotherapy typically utilising chemotherapeutic agent mitomycin c may infused directly abdominal cavity cytoreductive surgery surgery removing visible disease kill remaining microscopic cancerous tumors free floating cells heated chemotherapy hipec perfused throughout abdominal cavity hour two last step surgery ports installed allow circulation andor drainage chemicals one five days surgery known early postoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy epic epic may given multiple cycles several months systemic chemotherapy may administered additional adjuvant treatment due increased availability new chemotherapies developed colorectal cancer patients patients experienced stability tumor growth systemic chemotherapy systemic chemotherapy generally reserved patients advanced disease recurrent disease disease spread lymph nodes distant sitescitation needed disease may recur following surgery chemotherapy periodic post operative ct scans tumor marker laboratory tests used monitor patients disease progression overall incidence previously estimated cases per people per recent research europe indicates previous estimate persons per million may underestimating actual rate
