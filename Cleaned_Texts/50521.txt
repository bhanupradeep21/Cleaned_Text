mothers high consumption caffeine pregnancycitation needed caffeine younger children found shorten sleep duration increase daytime sleepiness one study looked children ages six ten years age found consistently consumed caffeine lost minutes sleep cases younger children drinking high amounts caffeine parents usually buy children soft drinks iced tea energy drinks without realizing amount caffeine drinks contain implications adolescent adults survey found consume caffeine individuals higher caffeine consumption tended feel increase wakefulness sleep onset shorter sleep durations longer daytime sleep consumed high amounts caffeine daily found times likely difficulty sleeping times likely feel sleepy morning compared consume almost caffeine individuals higher caffeine consumption felt increase wakefulness sleep onset shorter sleep durations longer daytime sleep higher consumption time adolescent adults tends weekends lowest consumption midweek assumed greater social opportunities among caffeine adenosine receptor antagonist means caffeine mainly works occupying adenosine receptors brain specifically receptors influence sleep arousal body caffeine persist several hours takes six hours one half caffeine consumed eliminated caffeine reaches brain increases secretion norepinephrine related fight flight response rise norepinephrine levels increases activity neurons areas brain symptoms resemble panic halflife caffeine roughly hours healthy adults however dependent variety variables age liver function medications level enzymes short halflife found help daytime

associated cognitive control functions include reduced alertness attention vigilance speed motor though caffeine shown decrease quality sleep evidence caffeine affects people way fact people report sleep problems despite regularly consuming caffeine regular intake caffeine may normal person understandable may still get satisfactory sleep finding shows caffeine interferes modulatory mechanism
