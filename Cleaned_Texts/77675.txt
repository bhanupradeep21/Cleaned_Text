accounts socalled unicorned sheep nepal fascinated manner created process adopted branding redhot iron male lambs two three months old horns begin sprout wounds treated mixture oil soot heal instead growing usual places spreading come middle skull although recently scientific scrutiny began arise accounts trying disprove majority naturalists inclined say mere fact searing budding horns would result appendages sprouting summit skull instead still sprouting sides natural horns however true horns young animal might induced grow together binding together would still put unnatural strain make grow bony unnatural would arise smooth straight middle skull stated previous research march operation performed dayold male ayrshire calf two horns cut placed closely together frontal stitches intersection lines drawn original horn spouts horn buds trimmed flat frontal periosteum expected two horns would fuse together one large horn solidly attached skull located eyes experiment successful age two years two buds formed together one large horn molded forehead support makes unicorn different ones horn unlike unicorns horn spike grew skull instead upon single united sheath covers horn spike horn curves slightly upward toward tip gracefully extends curve back neck animal stands attention like mythical unicorn described ctesias fresnel horn sheath white grayishwhite base tipped black unicorn female horn would tipped red since color appears sexlimited factor particular breed ayrshire bull whose scottish ancestors flourished king james vi james england put unicorn englands coat arms true unicorn although animal hereditary potentiality two horns recognizes power single horn uses prow pass fences barriers unibull one w franklin doves well known experiments experiment theorized horns didnt grow skull grew skull time horn budscitation needed order test hypothesis conducted experiments many animals like sheep cows goats well famous unibull w franklin dove acknowledged horns dont actually grow skull instead actually unattached bits tissue eventually root way skull also indepth research horns learned people creating unicorn animals example sheep made single horned sheep branding two threemonthold lambs horn buds treating mixture oil soot healing horns grew middle dove reasoned positioning horns quite open natural artificial variation would mean unicorns total contradiction laws nature test theory took day old calf surgically removed horn buds cut would fit together implanted center calfs head circular horn buds trimmed flat point contact provide larger fusion surface expected two horn buds would fuse together form one large horn solidly attached skull located somewhat eyes mimic horn unicorn experiment proven successful bull grew horn buds fused together started form single straight horn foot length horn functioned well bull perhaps even better normal horns bulls bull eventually became leader herd rarely challenged interesting side effect horn bulls abnormally docile also created unicorns goats well cows besides making unicorns also made trihorned animals one doves published research articles developing food acceptance research

punishment taking privileging food urging encouragement eat food health advantages resistance refusing partake foods presented areas consideration food acceptance included physical attributes like odor texture flavor volume food presented quality soil food grown manner food stored well quality storage agriculture time formed dove states awareness food acceptance brought forth change commercial farming best product comes quantity homegrown foods replaced standardized products requirement processed foods increased armies wwii began grow dove says missing link studied food acceptability consumer food also states many specialized areas need studied regard food acceptability including grading food quality quality control chemists study treated foods biologists study relativity food gathering hunger ultimate conclusion doves research attitudes related food acceptance due habits choosing food made birth adulthood factors including climate socioeconomics religious characteristics
