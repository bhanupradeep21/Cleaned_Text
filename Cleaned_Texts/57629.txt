bioremediation process decontaminating polluted sites usage either endogenous external situ term utilized within variety fields meaning site refers location within context bioremediation situ indicates location bioremediation occurred site contamination without translocation polluted materials bioremediation used neutralize pollutants including hydrocarbons chlorinated compounds nitrates toxic metals pollutants variety chemical microorganism used process bioremediation either implanted cultivated within site application fertilizers nutrients common polluted sites targeted
