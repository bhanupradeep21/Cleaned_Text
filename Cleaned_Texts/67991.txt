sucrose intolerance genetic sucraseisomaltase deficiency gsid condition sucraseisomaltase enzyme needed proper metabolism sucrose sugar starch eg grains produced enzyme produced either partially functional nonfunctional small intestine gsid patients lack fully functional sucrase isomaltase activity vary minimal functionality almost normal activity presence residual isomaltase activity may explain gsid patients better able tolerate starch diet others gsid sucrose intolerance caused genetic mutations parents must contain gene child carry disease socalled primary sucrose intolerance sucrose intolerance also caused irritable bowel syndrome aging small intestine disease secondary sucrose intolerance specific tests used help determine person sucrose intolerance accurate test enzyme activity determination done biopsying small intestine test diagnostic gsid tests aid diagnosis gsid truly diagnostic disease sucrose breath test genetic test tests absence certain genes thought responsible sucrose also called saccharose disaccharide twosugar chain composed glucose fructose bonded together familiar name table beet cane sugar believed cases sucrose intolerance due autosomal recessive genetic metabolic disease based new data patients heterozygous compound heterozygous genotypes symptom presentation well gsid involves deficiency enzyme sucraseisomaltase breaks bond glucose fructose molecules disaccharides consumed must broken monosaccharides enzymes intestines absorbed monosaccharides single sugar units absorbed directly deficiency sucrase may result malabsorption sugar lead potentially serious symptoms since sucraseisomaltase involved digestion starches gsid patients may able absorb starches well important sucrose intolerance minimize sucrose consumption much possible dietary supplements medications may taken substitute missing enzyme introduce healthy bacteria immune system chronic gastrointestinal symptoms fairly common difficult diagnose may caused congenital sucraseisomaltase deficiency csid csid inherited condition characterized dysfunctional digestive purpose digestive enzyme sucraseisomaltase break compound sugars sucrose table sugar starch sugars small enough absorbed gastrointestinal addition csid primary gastrointestinal disorder gastrointestinal infection celiac disease crohn disease transiently suppress digestive function sucraseisomaltase causing acquired form sucraseisomaltase deficiency sid underlying disorder treated resolved symptoms sid usually go deficiency absence sucraseisomaltase function likely cause chronic gastrointestinal symptoms whenever person eats food containing sucrose starch sugars common carbohydrates fact sucraseisomaltase enzyme responsible digestion foods containing sucrose approximately foods containing starch sucrose starch sugars absorbed gastrointestinal tract travel large intestine colon two things timing gastrointestinal symptoms associated csid distinctive csid symptoms frequent daily events lifelong postprandial occurring eating food symptoms range mild severe include chronic watery acidic diarrhea intestinal gas bloating nausea abdominal infants may show symptoms csid begin eat sucrose starchcontaining foods juices solid foods medications sweetened sucrose chronic watery diarrhea failure thrive common symptoms infants toddlers symptoms include abdominal distention gassiness colic irritability excoriated buttocks severe diaper rash due acidic diarrhea indigestion adults csid usually lean low bodymass index aversion eating carbohydrates sweets csid inherited condition patients csid often close relatives also experience chronic diarrhea determining cause chronic gastrointestinal symptoms may take long time symptoms common many gastrointestinal conditions one diagnostic method considered gold standard diagnosing csid measures level activity four intestinal enzymes digest compound sugars also called disaccharides four disaccharides digested small intestine lactose sucrose maltose diagnostic method called disaccharidase assay conducted tissue samples taken small intestine endoscopic procedure also called upper gi gastrointestinal examination level sucrase activity level considered necessary normal sucrase function patient diagnosed noninvasive diagnostic methods include two breath tests useful screening tools specific enough confirmed diagnosis first hydrogenmethane breath test measures amount hydrogen methane gases person exhales consuming sugary water exhaled breath collected sealed test tubes intervals threehour period drinking sugary water person csid little working sucraseisomaltase enzymes intestines greater normal levels hydrogen andor methane generated exhaled breath however may reasons person exhaling excess hydrogen andor methane gas overgrowth bacteria small intestine called small intestinal bacterial overgrowth second breath test called breath test stable isotope carbon occurs naturally sucrose making possible track person ability digest absorb sucrose measuring amount exhaled drinking sugarwater solution breath test exhaled breath collected sealed test tubes intervals period drinking sugarwater solution cumulative amount exhaled normal level occurs sucrose digested sucrase person may csid person undergo examination findings test believed definitive csid hydrogenmethane breath test although neither test validated provide diagnosis breath tests consumption sugar may cause severe gastrointestinal symptoms csid reason breath tests conducted supervision healthcare professional relatively new noninvasive test shows promise genetic test gene si codes enzyme test requires swab tissue inside cheek far aberrant variations si gene found patients diagnosed positive genetic test one si gene variations known cause csid help confirm diagnosis csid however negative genetic test rule diagnosis csid different variations si gene many variations yet investigated ability cause therefore negative genetic test means person carry one si gene variations known associated csid may si gene variation yet identified one cause csid breath tests genetic test validated diagnostic csid may become important tests help identifying patients csid diagnoses diagnosis csid depends combining doctor clinical findings results objective tests physical examination medical history secondary tests stool ph test acidic stool aid diagnosis clinically inappropriate difficult perform biopsy csid diagnosis doubt physician may suggest twoweek therapeutic trial enzyme replacement patient shows reduction symptoms considered diagnostic two ways manage gastrointestinal symptoms associated csid level ability digest sucrose starch sugars unique person living csid depends many factors including reasons restriction diet needs specific patient csid making changes diet important patient speak healthcare provider especially patient underweight gaining weight would expected also advised patient work registered dietitian nutritionist help identify foods tolerated tolerated registered dietitian nutritionist also help patient plan diet meet nutritional needs normal growth development vitamins
