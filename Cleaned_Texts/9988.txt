protective autoimmunity condition cells adaptive immune system contribute maintenance functional integrity tissue facilitate repair following insult term protective autoimmunity coined prof michal schwartz weizmann institute science israel whose pioneering studies first demonstrate autoimmune lymphocytes beneficial role repair following injury central nervous system cns studies phenomenon protective autoimmunity conducted experimental settings various cns pathologies thus reside within scientific discipline neuroimmunology adaptive immune system primarily consists b lymphocytes respond specific antigens subsequently acquire immunological memory activity adaptive immunity critically important host defense pathogens cells adaptive immunity respond selfantigens termed autoimmune cells autoimmunity activity autoimmune cells generally considered context autoimmune pathological condition induced overwhelming activity autoimmune cells one hallmarks immunity ability transfer substantial
