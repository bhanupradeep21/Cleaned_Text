performance response inhibition three primary experimental paradigms used study reward behavior adolescents passive receipt reward reward conditional task performance decisionmaking selecting different types reward options passive exposure tasks generally involve exposing participant pleasant stimuli eg monetary reward attractive faces paradigms also involve exposure negative stimuli

used reward motivational passive exposure tasks found activate striatum orbitofrontal cortex striatal activation greater adolescents response rewarding stimuli orbitofrontal activation greater adults response negative reward tied task performance typically involves participants asked complete task order obtain reward sometimes avoid losing reward task performance necessarily directly related reward examples type task pirates monetary incentive delay mid iowa gambling balloon analogue risk task columbia card among others differences activation anticipation reward versus preparation try achieve reward reported performance related reward reward decisionmaking tasks involve participants asked choose among different options reward sometimes rewards differ probability magnitude type
