cortisol steroid hormone glucocorticoid class hormones stress hormone used medication known hydrocortisone produced many animals mainly zona fasciculata adrenal cortex adrenal produced tissues lower released diurnal cycle release increased response stress low bloodglucose functions increase blood sugar gluconeogenesis suppress immune system aid metabolism fat protein also decreases bone many functions carried cortisol binding glucocorticoid mineralocorticoid receptors inside cell bind dna impact gene cortisol plays crucial role regulating glucose metabolism promotes gluconeogenesis glucose synthesis glycogenesis glycogen synthesis liver glycogenolysis breakdown glycogen skeletal also increases blood glucose levels reducing glucose uptake muscle adipose tissue decreasing protein
