chemotherapy often abbreviated chemo sometimes ctx ctx type cancer treatment uses one anticancer drugs chemotherapeutic agents alkylating agents part standardized chemotherapy regimen chemotherapy may given curative intent almost always involves combinations drugs may aim prolong life reduce symptoms palliative chemotherapy chemotherapy one major categories medical discipline specifically devoted pharmacotherapy cancer called medical term chemotherapy come connote nonspecific usage intracellular poisons inhibit mitosis cell division induce dna damage inhibition dna repair augment connotation word chemotherapy excludes selective agents block extracellular signals signal transduction development therapies specific molecular genetic targets inhibit growthpromoting signals classic endocrine hormones primarily estrogens breast cancer androgens prostate cancer called hormonal therapies contrast inhibitions growthsignals like associated receptor tyrosine kinases referred targeted therapy importantly use drugs whether chemotherapy hormonal therapy targeted therapy constitutes systemic therapy cancer introduced blood stream therefore principle able address cancer anatomic location body systemic therapy often used conjunction modalities constitute local therapy ie treatments whose efficacy confined anatomic area applied cancer radiation therapy surgery hyperthermia therapy traditional chemotherapeutic agents cytotoxic means interfering cell division mitosis cancer cells vary widely susceptibility agents large extent chemotherapy thought way damage stress cells may lead cell death apoptosis initiated many side effects chemotherapy traced damage normal cells divide rapidly thus sensitive antimitotic drugs cells bone marrow digestive tract hair follicles results common sideeffects chemotherapy myelosuppression decreased production blood cells hence also immunosuppression mucositis inflammation lining digestive tract alopecia hair loss effect immune cells especially lymphocytes chemotherapy drugs often find use host diseases result harmful overactivity immune system self socalled autoimmunity include rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus multiple sclerosis vasculitis many others number strategies administration chemotherapeutic drugs used today chemotherapy may given curative intent may aim prolong life palliate symptoms chemotherapy regimens require recipient capable undergoing treatment performance status often used measure determine whether person receive chemotherapy whether dose reduction required fraction cells tumor die treatment fractional kill repeated doses must administered continue reduce size current chemotherapy regimens apply drug treatment cycles frequency duration treatments limited effectiveness chemotherapy depends type cancer stage overall effectiveness ranges curative cancers ineffective brain needless others like nonmelanoma skin dosage chemotherapy difficult dose low ineffective tumor whereas excessive doses toxicity sideeffects intolerable person receiving standard method determining chemotherapy dosage based calculated body surface area bsa bsa usually calculated mathematical formula nomogram using recipients weight height rather direct measurement body area formula originally derived study attempted translate medicinal doses established laboratory animals equivalent doses study included nine human chemotherapy introduced bsa formula adopted official standard chemotherapy dosing lack better validity method calculating uniform doses questioned formula takes account individuals weight height drug absorption clearance influenced multiple factors including age sex metabolism disease state organ function drugtodrug interactions genetics obesity major impacts actual concentration drug persons result high variability systemic chemotherapy drug concentration people dosed bsa variability demonstrated tenfold many words two people receive dose given drug based bsa concentration drug bloodstream one person may times higher lower compared variability typical many chemotherapy drugs dosed bsa shown demonstrated study common chemotherapy result pharmacokinetic variability among people many people receive right dose achieve optimal treatment effectiveness minimized toxic side effects people overdosed others example randomized clinical trial investigators found metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated receive optimal therapeutic dose dosed bsa underdosed controversy use bsa calculate chemotherapy doses people higher bsa clinicians often arbitrarily reduce dose prescribed bsa formula fear many cases result suboptimal several clinical studies demonstrated chemotherapy dosing individualized achieve optimal systemic drug exposure treatment outcomes improved toxic side effects clinical study cited people whose dose adjusted achieve predetermined target exposure realized improvement treatment response rate sixmonth improvement overall survival os compared dosed study investigators compared incidence common grade toxicities doseadjusted people people dosed per incidence debilitating grades diarrhea reduced bsadosed group doseadjusted group serious

important factor achieving better treatment outcomes similar results found study involving people colorectal cancer treated popular folfox incidence serious diarrhea reduced bsadosed group patients doseadjusted group incidence severe mucositis reduced folfox study also demonstrated improvement treatment positive response increased bsadosed group doseadjusted group median progression free survival pfs overall survival os improved six months dose adjusted one approach help clinicians individualize chemotherapy dosing measure drug levels blood plasma time adjust dose according formula algorithm achieve optimal exposure established target exposure optimized treatment effectiveness minimized toxicities dosing personalized achieve target exposure optimal results person algorithm used clinical trials cited resulted significantly improved treatment oncologists already individualizing dosing cancer drugs based exposure dosing rely upon results blood tests calculate optimal dose person simple blood tests also available dose optimization paclitaxel serum albumin level immediately prior chemotherapy administration independent prognostic predictor survival various cancer alkylating agents oldest group chemotherapeutics use today originally derived mustard gas used world war many types alkylating agents named ability alkylate many molecules including proteins rna dna
