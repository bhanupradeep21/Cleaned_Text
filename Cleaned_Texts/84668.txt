side effects radiotherapy fertility growing concern patients undergoing radiotherapy cancer treatments radiotherapy essential certain cancer treatments often first point call radiation divided two categories ionising radiation ir nonionising radiation nir ir dangerous nir source radiation xrays used medical procedures example ir varying impacts depend many factors including age irradiation field treatment dose duration radiotherapy directed important ir pelvis affect ovary uterus testis whereas cranial irradiation disrupt hypothalamicpituitarygonadal axis hpga causing subsequent disruption hormone females ir longterm effects fertility specifically ovarian insufficiency pubertal arrest subsequent males use radiotherapy disrupt endocrine system leading altered spermatogenesis consequently decrease sperm count sperm motility sperm morphology sperm rapid evolution radiotherapy technologies benefit effective accurate treatments less side radiation therapy significant impact female fertility damage induced varies greatly determined factors age patient along dose duration treatment estimates suggest less radiation could destroy half female immature oocytes female ovaries estimated store primordial follicles birth decrease number quality increasing age via processes radiation therapy greatly accelerates decline permanent damage occurs follicular atrophy reduced follicle consequently changes lead uterine dysfunction due changes ovarian hormone production result early menopause risk hormonal disruption includes female patients experiencing decrease lh luteinising hormone secretion attenuated lh surges leading increased risk ovarian failure lh plays important role proper sexual development potential endocrinopathies include hypogonadism studies suggest stage follicular development may determine much damage radiation therapy seen also direct impact uterus leading changes vascular supply volume elasticity necrosis atrophy fibrosis also observed endometrium myometrium changes significant consequences regard pregnancy outcomes studies suggest cancer patients receiving radiation higher chance experiencing miscarriages low birth weight premature likelihood perinatal infant mortality low birth weight significantly related radiation male fertility greatly impacted radiotherapy reproductive system spermatogenesis process male sperm cells process take days complete cells involved process damaged use radiotherapy cells called spermatogonia heavily impacted cells go divide produce spermatozoa commonly known sperm cells spermatogonia impacted radiotherapy radiosensitive types cells means whole spermatogenic process impacted radiotherapy addition damage spermatogonia cells produce hormone called testosterone also impaired testosterone main male hormone cells called leydig cells found testes however leydig cells far resistant radiation cells testes become damaged high levels cells sensitive radiotherapy takes place childhood damaged leydig cells reduce levels testosterone body turn increases levels another hormone called clinically monitoring two hormones indicative leydig cell function combination two processes lead male fertility compromised sometimes result infertility number childhood cancer survivors increasing due technological diagnostic however result increasing concern longterm effects cancer treatments radiotherapy treatment significant issue associated childhood radiotherapy includes prepubescent males experience radiotherapy testes result reduced damage germ cells sertoli cells andor leydig dosage timing treatment determine extent disruption spermatogenesis prepubescent males low doses cause shortterm oligospermia azoospermia higher doses gy cause permanent moreover testicular radiation central nervous system cns radiation prepubertal males affect testosterone levels cause hypoandrogenism testicular radiation damages androgenproducing leydig cells cns radiation impairs hypothalamicpituitarygonadal hpg axis reducing gonadotropin prepubescent females high radiation dose pelvic region also adverse side effects fertility longterm effects include early onset menopause ovarian failure inability complete pregnancy occurs individuals high risks associated health offspring due pregnancy complications include low birth weight miscarriage premature modern medicine multiple options limit effect cancer treatment fertility one preventative measures females transposition gonadal organs local therapeutic agents success rate another less invasive method used many years lead shielding gonadal region males females protective measure prepubescent males novel techniques testicular tissue extraction cryopreservation well vitro maturation spermatogonia transferred native tissue treatment heavily common solution cryopreservation sperms post pubertal males cryopreservation oocytes embryos females smaller age constrain compared males utilise multiple
