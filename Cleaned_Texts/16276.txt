fundus photography involves photographing rear eye also known fundus specialized fundus cameras consisting intricate microscope attached flash enabled camera used fundus photography main structures visualized fundus photo central peripheral retina optic disc macula fundus photography performed colored filters specialized dyes including fluorescein indocyanine models technology fundus photography

presented colour photography method early henry noyes abner mulholland rosebrugh assembled fundus cameras tried fundus photography animals early fundus photos limited insufficient light long exposures eye movement prominent corneal reflexes reduced clarity detail would several decades problems could controversy regarding firstever successful human fundus photo accounts credit william thomas jackman jd webster since published technique along reproduction fundus image two photography periodicals three names played prominent role early fundus photography according historical accounts elmer starr lucien howe may first photograph human retina lucien howe wellknown name ophthalmology assistant elmer starr collaborated fundus photography project howe described results first recognizable fundus photograph apparently nod jackman webster first publish fundus photograph based written accounts howe starrs image recognizable efforts clearly photograph fundus ongoing years hundreds specialists worked overcome problem finally achieved early century friedrich dimmer published photographs dimmers fundus camera developed complicated sophisticated research tool stockholms johan nordenson zeiss camera company able market commercial device use practitioners first modern fundus since features fundus cameras improved drastically include nonmydriatic imaging electronic illumination control automated eye alignment highresolution digital image capture improvements helped make modern fundus photography standard ophthalmic practice documenting retinal following development fundus photography david alvis harold novotny performed first fluorescein angiography ffa using zeiss fundus camera electronic flash development huge feat world several countries began largescale teleophthalmology programs using digital fundus photography around optical design fundus cameras based principle monocular indirect fundus camera provides upright magnified view fundus typical camera views retinal area magnification allows modification relationship zoom auxiliary lenses provides magnification wide angle lens minifies image optics fundus camera similar indirect ophthalmoscope observation illumination systems follow dissimilar paths observation light focused via series lenses doughnutshaped aperture passes central aperture form annulus passing camera objective lens cornea onto light reflected retina passes unilluminated hole doughnut formed illumination system light paths two systems independent minimal reflections light source captured formed image image forming rays continue towards low powered telescopic eyepiece button pressed take picture mirror interrupts path illumination system allow light flash bulb pass eye simultaneously mirror falls front observation telescope redirects light onto capturing medium whether film digital ccd eyes tendency accommodate looking telescope imperative exiting vergence parallel order infocus image formed capturing medium practical instruments fundus photography perform following modes examination fundus photographs ocular documentation record appearance patients retina optometrists ophthalmologists orthoptists trained medical professionals use fundus photography monitoring progression certain eye conditiondiseases fundus photographs also used document abnormalities disease process affecting eye andor follow progress eye conditiondisease diabetes agemacular degeneration amd glaucoma multiple sclerosis neoplasm choroid cranial nerves retinal eyeball patients diabetes mellitus regular fundus screening examinations every six months one year important screen diabetic retinopathy visual loss due diabetes prevented retinal laser treatment retinopathy spotted early besides prevalent ocular conditiondiseases fundus photography also used monitor individuals antimalarial therapy noting changes fundus standard screening fundus photography also used emergency cases including patients constant headaches diastolic pressure greater equal patients sudden visual loss patients headaches finding swollen optic discs papilloedema fundus photography key sign indicates raised intracranial pressure icp could due hydrocephalus benign intracranial hypertension aka pseudotumour cerebri brain tumor amongst conditions cupped optic discs seen glaucoma arterial hypertension hypertensive changes retina closely mimic brain may predict cerebrovascular accidents strokes certain cases fundus photography also used research medical necessity fundus photography must recorded comprehensively clinician able compare photographs patient different timelines documents patients medical record must consist recent relevant history progress notes fundus photographs depicting supporting relevant diagnosis photographs need labelled appropriately eye date patient details patients records ought contain documented outcomes fundus photography well depiction variations previous photographs contain interpretation results relevant changes could treatment plan fundus photographs without interpretation seen obsolete records legible contain suitable patient information clinician details interpretation fundus photographs glaucomatous must contain description vertical horizontal cup disc ratio vessel pattern diffuse focal pallor asymmetry development factors retinal nerve fibre layer also studied commented retina consists ten semitransparent layers serve specific functions process visual perception fundus photography provides birdseye view top layer inner limiting membrane well underlying layers retinal abnormalities often begin particular layer retina encroaching layers formation cotton wool spots nerve fiber layer important able appreciate depth examining fundus order provide accurate diagnosis however despite recent advancements technology development stereo fundus cameras able provide three dimensional images superimposing two fundus cameras circulation able provide two dimensional images fundus limitation currently prevents technology superseding current gold standard indirect binocular ophthalmoscopy following advantages disadvantages fundus
