ultimately behavior determines survival timberlake lucas conservation behavior interdisciplinary field animal behavior assist conservation encompasses proximate ultimate causes behavior incorporates disciplines including genetics physiology behavioral ecology conservation behavior aimed applying understanding animal behavior solve problems field conservation biology problems may arise conservation efforts captive breeding species reintroduction reserve connectivity wildlife management using patterns animal behavior biologists successful conservation efforts done understanding proximate ultimate causes problems arise example understanding proximate processes affect survival help biologist train captivereared animals recognize predators postrelease ultimate causes also clear benefit conservation example understanding social relationships lead fitness biology help biologists manage wildlife exhibit infanticide conservation projects may better chance successful biologists search deeper understanding animals make adaptive animal behavior conservation biology conceptually intertwined idea using animal behavior conservation management first used explicitly since conservation behavior slowly gained prominence surge publications field since animal behavior society even forming committee support conservation number studies shown animal behavior important consideration conservation importantly ignorance animal behavior conservation projects may lead recent calls stronger integration behavior physiology advance conservation science emphasize growing recognition studying animals nature impossible decouple behavior understanding animal behavior help limit impact humans environment wildlife conservation concerned protecting species habitats impact human development wildlife management concerned manipulating exploiting wild species achieve desired end ensuring persistence availability management often component conservation strategies incorporating knowledge animal behavior wildlife management potential improving outcomes conservation understanding animal behavior help managers design better wildlife nature reserves reduce conflict understand manage species responses humaninduced environmental stress manage introduced wildlife managers commonly try create wildlife reserves conserve habitat species concern behavior target animals pivotal designing size shape location habitat reserves example many bird reserves central south america located high mountains one instance local birds left protected area understanding behaviors including recruitment settling spawning foraging territoriality daily movements seasonal patterns migration important conservation minimizing conflict persistent challenge wildlife management conservation behavioral manipulation help mitigate conflicts livestock depredation agricultural destruction repelling animals strobe lights sounds aversive conditioning taste aversion humans frequently coming conflict animals humans also induce environmental stress animals humans begin mitigate stresses understanding behaviors effect tourists wildlife reserves animals survival reproductive success relies behavior knowledge behavior essential actively reversing decline imperiled wild knowledge behavior used reduce bycatch fish species reestablish breeding populations boost understanding behavior fish helped reduce bycatch improving selectivity fishing gear species separated initial response trawl mouth position within net responses visual rheotactic sensory use behavioral characteristics help reduce tremendous waste often occurs industrial fishing help manage sustainable fisheries state declining species sometimes reversed augmenting reproduction behavior manipulating auditory olfactory visual cues animals biologists attract animals breeding grounds increase number breeding individuals method applied successfully bird example acoustic playbacks attracted seabirds historic new breeding similarly adding eggs nests male fish species may promote increased spawning females prefer spawn males already possessing knowing species richness abundance given area important part ecology since creation censusing monitoring methods use animal behavior assess track status species concern many times involves using communication signals conspicuous behaviors locate count species example knowledge behavior used locate birds mating calls count mammals active mating season track whale vocalizations dolphin echolocation population viability analysis pva provide important information assessing status species help evaluate conservation priorities pva process help determine probability species go extinct within given number years along survival reproduction behavior factored population viability models behaviors influence population demographics immigration emigration dispersal inbreeding captive breeding reintroductions endangered species becoming common necessary conservation rearing wild animals captive setting requires behavioral understanding factors mate choice social structure environmental influences many captive breeding reintroductions failed due behavioral deficiencies released animals many times captive animals lack natural parental care environmental influences critical learning animals need learn variety behaviors may difficult replicate captive settings including forage catch prey safe sleep avoid predators intraspecies relationships captive breeding programs often inadvertently alter behaviors animals including interfering normal patterns mate selection creating inappropriate social conditions antipredator behavior conditioning humans loss altercation behaviors devastating effects released animals concern field conservation behavior lack official cohesion behavior conservation biology potentially avoidable mistakes made even argued theoretical advances behavior made little practical contributions conservation theorydriven behavior may yet become fully integrated conservation importance clear application necessary httpsenwikipediaorgwikiconservationbehavior
