heptapod languages two constructed fictional languages used ted chiangs short story story life well later film adaptation arrival inuniverse used heptapods alien race makes contact humanity languages classified two separate names heptapod heptapod b species uses two separate languages former spoken language latter semasiography two languages together encapsulate two different concepts time heptapod b presents time synchronous presents time sequential causality two languages grammatically unrelated written form heptapod b developed arrival production designer patrice vermette wife martine bertrand based descriptions story life development film arrival director denis villeneuve sound designer sylvain bellemare wanted deviate typical electronic sounds used many science fiction films instead wanted sound heptapod sound design heptapod initially began dave whitehead sound designer previously worked several peter jackson films whitehead used animal sound recordings whale songs cat purrs along altered recordings voice create sounds heptapod worked alongside mcgill professor morgan sonderegger served linguistics consultant assisted splicing sounds development martine bertrand patrice vermette given credit creation heptapod b arrival language collaborative effort crew conceptualization began screenwriter film eric heisserer decided base heptapod bs circular script etchings one ring lord rings due heisserers circular illustrations heptapod b initially bore strong resemblance jrr tolkiens tengwar afterwards patrice vermette production designer arrival worked alongside crew members develop heptapod b despite consulting linguists graphic designers vermette crew continued struggle developing appearance characters researched languages arabic ancient asian languages dialects north africa gain inspiration found would cause heptapod b resemble human language closely alien several attempts create design heptapod b vermettes wife artist martine bertrand offered sketch conceptual designs language bertrand approached vermette designs heptapod b deviated mathematical hieroglyphic conceptualizations crew come instead appeared inky smoky designs approved director denis villeneuve gave bertrand task developing similar designs heptapod b design heptapod b developed patrice vermette team oversaw semantics behind characters several characters definitions developed stephen wolfram computer scientist founder wolfram mathematica son christopher asked analyze utilising wolfram language section character different parts order found certain patterns repeated heptapod b characters also sent jessica coon associate professor linguistics mcgill university asked annotate characters analyzing real vermette team gained insight semantics behind heptapod b developed dictionary roughly heptapod b logograms used research heptapod b vermette christopher wolfram stated resources available build larger vocabulary heptapod b process would require extensive amount story life heptapod vocal communication heptapods described sounding vaguely like wet dog shaking water although heptapod contains grammar structures similar human language language often breaks linguistic universals found human language designed provide flexibility within confines sequential heptapod uses case markers indicate whether noun subject object sentence language free word order extends conditional unlike majority natural languages fixed word order antecedent always preceding consequent construction linguistic heptapod also utilizes center embedding involves embedding clause middle another clause although center embedding common practice human languages heptapod permits unlimited amount center embedding sentences would severely complicate meaning human jessica coon illustrates increasingly complicated nature center embedding sentence b cat dog chased fell c cat dog mouse scared chased fell cat dog mouse bird saw scared chased lack large scale recursive center embedding claimed issue human short term due difficulty remembering large numbers pairs subjects predicates depth center embedding part zero spoken language rarely exceeding three written presence unlimited center embedding heptapod b implies heptapods easily handle cognitive load required understand multiple center story life heptapod b written language heptapods described looking like fanciful praying mantids drawn cursive style clinging form escheresque lattice slightly different script consists series semagrams heptapod b semasiographic language spoken form presents large difference heptapod languages human language human writing systems based spoken language heptapod b contain worddividor punctuation altogether written linear fashion rows spirals instead sentences formed combining individual semagrams words fit together however heptapods write heptapod b write single semagram alter afterward form sentence instead semagrams begin single continuous line participate several clauses semagram becomes complex means one must know layout entire sentence writing first stroke structure also means individual graphemes become inseparable holistic due semasiographic nature heptapod b contains entirely separate grammar system spoken language heptapod visual inflections used show noun declension including heptapod b contain punctuation represent spoken language instead syntax sentence determined way semagrams combined sentences created combining two semagrams together indication paragraph page writing size script demarcates subject object sentence orientating noun semagram relative verb subjects shown positioning strokes noun verb parallel one another objects run heptapod b functions lagrangian mechanics form classical mechanics based least action principles describes motion objects terms energy ie kinetic potential differs newtonian mechanics describes motion objects terms forces rather lagrangian mechanics individual knows stored energy potential energy moving energy kinetic energy object knowledge start end point objects path therefore able predict entire path object begins departing point point b chiang uses teleological interpretation leastaction principles suggest heptapods view time holistically therefore see present future heptapod b perception time largely present freeword order especially heptapods conditional clauses reliant stating cause event consequence event also argued heptapods holistic perception time also impact writing method used heptapod b entire sentence must known writing first strokecitation needed chiang stated
