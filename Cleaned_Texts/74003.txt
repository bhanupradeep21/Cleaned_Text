individual species flowering plants heterosporous every individual plant produces two types spores microspores produced meiosis inside anthers megaspores produced inside ovules within ovary anthers typically consist four microsporangia ovule integumented megasporangium types spores develop gametophytes inside sporangia heterosporous plants gametophytes also develop inside spores e endosporic since flowers reproductive organs plant mediate joining sperm contained within pollen ovules contained pollination movement pollen anthers normally pollen moved one plant another known crosspollination many plants able selfpollinate crosspollination preferred allows genetic variation contributes survival many flowers depend external factors pollination wind water animals especially

species tiny pollen grains carried sometimes many thousands wind flowers common examples include grasses birch trees along many species order ragweeds many sedges need attract pollinators therefore tend grow large showy colorful flowers nectaries noticeable scent plants typically many thousands tiny flowers comparatively large feathery stigmas increase chance pollen whereas pollen entomophilous flowers usually large sticky rich protein act reward pollinators anemophilous flower pollen typically smallgrained light smooth little nutritional value order wind effectively pick transport pollen flowers typically anthers loosely attached end long thin filaments pollen forms around catkin moves wind rarer forms involve individual flowers moveable wind pendulous even less commonly anthers exploding release pollen pollination water hydrophily much rarer method occurring around abiotically pollinated common examples include calitriche autumnalis vallisneria spiralis seagrasses one

hyphydrogamy common hyphydrogamy pollination occurs surface water pollen grains typically negatively buoyant marine plants exhibit method stigmas usually stiff freshwater species small feathery

pollen sometimes forms larger masses female flowers form depressions water method transport flowers pollinated two mechanisms crosspollination selfpollination mechanism indisputably better advantages disadvantages plants use one mechanisms depending habitat ecological crosspollination pollination carpel pollen different plant species genetic makeup sperm contained within pollen plant different combination result new genetically distinct plant process sexual reproduction since new plant genetically distinct different plants show variation physiological structural adaptations population whole better prepared adverse occurrence environment crosspollination therefore increases survival species usually preferred flowers selfpollination pollination carpel flower pollen either flower another flower leading creation genetic clone asexual reproduction increases reliability producing seeds rate produced lowers amount energy importantly limits genetic variation addition selfpollination causes inbreeding depression due largely expression recessive deleterious extreme case selffertilization ovule fertilized pollen flower plant occurs flowers always selffertilize many flowers selfpollinated flowers never open selfpollinated flowers open flowers called cleistogamous many species genus viola exhibit conversely many species plants ways preventing selfpollination hence selffertilization

birch trees oak trees ragweeds allergens pollen proteins thought necessary process fertilization also called synagmy occurs following pollination movement pollen stamen carpel encompasses plasmogamy fusion protoplasts karyogamy fusion nuclei pollen lands stigma flower begins creating pollen tube runs style ovary penetrating centremost part ovary enters egg apparatus one synergid point end pollen tube bursts releases two sperm cells one makes way egg also losing cell membrane much protoplasm sperms nucleus fuses eggs nucleus resulting formation zygote diploid two copies chromosome whereas fertilization plasmogamy fusion whole sex cells results angiosperms flowering plants process known double fertilization involves karyogamy plasmogamy occurs double fertilization second sperm cell subsequently also enters synergid fuses two polar nuclei central cell since three nuclei haploid result large endosperm nucleus following formation zygote begins grow nuclear cellular divisions called mitosis eventually becoming small group cells one section becomes embryo becomes suspensor structure forces embryo endosperm later undetectable two small primordia also form time later become cotyledon used energy store plants grow one primordia called monocotyledons grow two dicotyledons next stage called torpedo stage involves growth several key structures including radicle embryotic root epicotyl embryotic stem hypocotyl rootshoot junction final step vascular tissue develops around ovary inside seed forming ovule grows fruit main floral parts die development including style stigma sepals stamens petals fruit contains three structures exocarp outer layer mesocarp fleshy part endocarp innermost layer fruit wall called pericarp size shape toughness thickness varies among
