transverse processes become smooth tail vertebra transverse processes tail vertebra also accessory ridge accompanied depression depression also becomes smooth tail vertebra bottom vertebra pair

much larger forwardprojecting anterior process seen ornithomimosaurs top end tibia sereno noted unusual elliptical attachment scar bearing series roughened ridges located expanded lateral condyle outer surface bone ornithomimosaurs lack scar present abelisauroids masiakasaurus ekrixinatosaurus skorpiovenator carnotaurus well lesser extent velocisaurus ceratosaurus front scar fibular crest shorter narrower sinornithomimus gallimimus also becomes deeper bottom end crest stretches top bone typical abelisauroids unusual ornithomimosaurs tetanuran theropods separated notch like two ornithomimosaurs however bottom edge lateral condyle clearly demarcated shaft shaft tibia compressed front rear bows outwards unlike relatively straight shafts ornithomimosaurs sinornithomimus gallimimus beishanlong noasaurid elaphrosaurus like noasaurids masiakasaurus velocisaurus bottom end tibia expands outwards form lateral malleolus onethird width bottom end partially fused astragalus

astragalus tibia much smaller lower accordingly afromimus small subrectangular ascending process astragalus like abelisauroids unlike sinornithomimus gallimimus harpymimus calcaneum another tarsal bone also exposed unlike sinornithomimus gallimimus fibular crest tibia join iliofibular tubercle anterior trochanter attachment iliofibularis muscle front fibula anterior tubercle situated towards rear cm tubercle roughened better developed ornithomimosaurs although welldeveloped tubercle typical ceratosaurus various abelisauroids inner side fibula deep fossa extends smoothly onto shaft form trough running front anterior tubercle fossa covered partially flared tibial crest also demarcated crest angled upwards rear also roughened attachment surface tibial crest considered sereno autapomorphy characteristics similar ceratosaurus masiakasaurus skorpiovenator arcovenator deltadromeus tetanurans like tyrannosaurus neovenator beishanlong also deep fossa lack surrounding crests nevertheless cerroni colleagues noted tibial crest covers fibial fossa much greater extent masiakasaurus autapomorphy bottom end fibula afromimus relatively expanded ornithomimosaur resembles masiakasaurus skorpiovenator xenotarsosaurus foot claws afromimus show characteristics shared abelisauroids ornithomimosaurs bottom surfaces claws relatively flat case ornithomimosaurs except beishanlong deinocheirus noasaurids two grooves attachment keratin sheath side claw one near top one near bottom common noasaurids however many ornithomimosaurs groove bottom bottom claw vshaped platform attachment sheath deep pit sereno inferred sheath would subtriangular hoof life inner edge platform sharp ridge outer edge rounded noasaurids similar platform attachment flexor muscle rear claw also recessed seen despite various characteristics shared abelisauroids sereno assigned afromimus ornithomimosauria support position stated peanutshaped centra rimmed depressions prezygapophyses tail vertebrae reported sinornithomimus gallimimus ornithomimosaurs deinocheirus also broad centra although lacks prezygapophyseal depressions shape centra contrasts subcircular centra majungasaurus masiakasaurus alvarezsauroids also drew attention characteristics foot claws namely flat bottom face vshaped platform recessed flexor attachment shared ornithomimosaurs noted first two traits shared abelisauroids well additional sheath attachment groove near top claw noted latter condition consistent among abelisauroids grooves abelisauroids usually reach tip claw dissipate beforehand afromimus unnamed noasaurid also elrhaz formation sereno also noted expansion fibulas bottom end resembles masiakasaurus unnamed within ornithomimosauria sereno provide concrete position afromimus noting basal

concluded affinities afromimus likely tested effectively discovery new paper cerroni colleagues systematically analyzed traits sereno noted shared afromimus ornithomimosaurs concluded many traits also found among abelisauroids see discussion analysis particular afromimus shares rigorously test affinities afromimus added three phylogenetic datasets two generally encompassing theropods carrano et al choiniere et al one focusing specifically ceratosauria brissón egli et al parsimonious phylogenetic trees first two analyses found afromimus member ceratosauria grouping masiakasaurus majungasaurus former masiakasaurus latter forcing afromimus ornithomimosaur resulted less parsimonious tree latter analysis finally adding afromimus ceratosaurcentric matrix resulted found part noasauridae polytomy unresolved group analysis inclusion afromimus ceratosauria supported prominent iliofibular tubercle inclusion noasauridae supported flattened bottom end tibia fusion astragalar ascending process
