fedbatch culture broadest sense defined operational technique biotechnological processes one nutrients substrates fed supplied bioreactor cultivation products remain bioreactor end alternative description method culture base medium supports initial cell culture feed medium added prevent nutrient also type semibatch culture cases nutrients fed bioreactor advantage fedbatch culture one control concentration fedsubstrate culture liquid arbitrarily desired levels many cases low levels generally speaking fedbatch culture superior conventional batch culture controlling concentrations nutrient nutrients affects yield productivity desired metabolite types bioprocesses fedbatch culture effective summarized follows substrate nutrients methanol ethanol acetic acid aromatic compounds inhibit growth microorganisms even relatively low concentrations adding substrates properly lagtime shortened inhibition cell growth markedly reduced high cell density high cell batch culture achieve high cell concentrations eg g dry cellsl high initial concentrations nutrients medium needed high concentrations nutrients become inhibitory even though effect normal concentrations used batch

ethanol main cause low cell yield aerobic ethanol formation presence glucose concentration known glucose effect crabtree effect reduce effect fedbatch process generally employed bakers yeast production aerobic cultures escherichia coli bacillus subtilis organic acids acetic acid lesser amounts lactic acid formic acid produced byproducts sugar concentration high acids inhibit cell growth well show deteriorating effect metabolic activities formation acids called bacterial crabtree effects catabolite microorganism provided rapidly metabolizable carbonenergy source glucose resulting increase intracellular concentration atp leads repression enzymes biosynthesis thus causing slower metabolization energy source phenomenon known catabolite repression many enzymes especially involved catabolic pathways subject repressive regulation powerful method overcoming catabolite repression enzyme biosynthesis fedbatch culture glucose concentration culture liquid kept low growth restricted enzyme biosynthesis derepressed slow feeding glucose penicillin fermentation penicillium chrysogenum classical example category auxotrophic microbial process employing auxotrophic mutant nutritionally requiring mutant excess supply required nutrient results abundant cell growth little accumulation desired metabolite due feedback inhibition endproduct repression starvation required nutrient however lowers cell growth well overall production desired metabolite production rate usually proportional cell concentration bioprocess accumulation desired metabolite maximized growing mutant limited amount
