bone resorption resorption bone tissue process osteoclasts break tissue release minerals resulting transfer calcium bone tissue osteoclasts multinucleated cells contain numerous mitochondria lysosomes cells responsible resorption bone osteoblasts generally present outer layer bone beneath periosteum attachment osteoclast osteon begins process osteoclast induces infolding cell membrane secretes collagenase enzymes important resorption process high levels calcium magnesium phosphate products collagen released extracellular fluid osteoclasts tunnel mineralized bone osteoclasts prominent tissue destruction found psoriatic arthritis rheumatological human body constant state bone bone remodeling process maintains bone strength ion homeostasis replacing discrete parts old bone newly synthesized packets proteinaceous bone resorbed osteoclasts deposited osteoblasts process called osteocyte activity plays key role process conditions result decrease bone mass either caused increase resorption decrease ossification childhood bone formation exceeds resorption aging process occurs resorption exceeds bone resorption rates much higher postmenopausal older women due estrogen deficiency related common treatments include drugs increase bone mineral density bisphosphonates rankl inhibitors oestrogen receptor modulators hormone replacement therapy calcitonin common light weight bearing exercise tends eliminate negative effects bone bone resorption highly stimulated inhibited signals parts body depending demand calcium calciumsensing membrane receptors parathyroid gland monitor calcium levels extracellular fluid low levels calcium stimulates release parathyroid hormone pth chief cells parathyroid addition effects kidney intestine pth increases number activity osteoclasts increase activity already existing osteoclasts initial effect pth begins minutes increases continued elevation pth levels increases abundance osteoclasts leads greater resorption calcium phosphate high levels calcium blood hand leads decreased pth release parathyroid gland decreasing number activity osteoclasts resulting less bone resorption vitamin increases absorption calcium phosphate intestinal tract leading elevated levels plasma thus lower bone resorption calcitriol active form vitamin numerous functions involved blood calcium levels recent research indicates calcitriol leads reduction osteoclast formation bone follows increase vitamin intake lead decrease bone resorption shown oral administration vitamin linearly correlate increased serum levels precursor calcitriol calcitonin hormone secreted thyroid humans calcitonin decreases osteoclast activity decreases formation new osteoclasts resulting decreased calcitonin greater effect young children adults plays smaller role bone remodeling cases bone resorption outpaces ossification bone broken much faster renewed bone becomes porous fragile exposing people risk fractures depending body bone resorption occurs additional problems like tooth loss arise caused conditions hyperparathyroidism hypovitaminosis even decreased hormonal production elderly diseases symptoms decreased bone density osteoporosis rickets people experience increased bone resorption decreased bone formation astronauts due condition zerogravity environment astronauts need work musculoskeletal system hard earth ossification decreases due lack stress resorption increases leading net decrease bone effects alcohol bone mineral density bmd wellknown wellstudied animal human populations direct indirect pathways prolonged ethanol exposure increases fracture risk decreasing bone mineral density promoting osteoporosis indirect effects excessive alcohol use occur via growth hormone sex steroids oxidative stress growth hormone important regulator bone growth remodeling adults acts via insulinlike growth factor stimulate osteoblastic chronic alcoholism decreases levels suppresses ability gh increase bone mineral increasing alcohol consumption linked decreasing testosterone serum estradiol levels turn lead activation rank tnf receptor protein promote osteoclast oxidative stress results ethanol induces nox expression resulting ros production osteoblasts ultimately result cell direct effects chronic alcoholism apparent osteoblasts osteoclasts osteocytes ethanol suppresses activity differentiation osteoblasts time direct effect osteoclast activity results increased bone resorption rate decreased bone mineral density due increased pit numbers pit areas research shown viable osteocytes another type bone cell may prevent osteoclastogenesis whereas apoptotic osteocytes tend induce osteoclast stimulation stimulation osteocyte apoptosis alcohol exposure may explain decreased bone mineral density chronic bone resorption
