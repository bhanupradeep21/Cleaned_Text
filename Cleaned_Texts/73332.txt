microbiota sum symbiotic microorganisms mutualistic commensal pathogenic living organism fruit fly drosophila melanogaster model organism known one investigated organisms worldwide microbiota flies less complex found humans still influence fitness affects different lifehistory characteristics lifespan life expectancy resistance pathogens immunity metabolic processes digestion considering comprehensive toolkit available research drosophila analysis microbiome could enhance understanding similar processes types hostmicrobiota interactions including involving humans microbiota plays key roles intestinal immune metabolic responses via fermentation product short chain fatty acid drosophila melanogaster possesses comparatively simple gut microbiota consisting bacterial species mainly two bacterial taxonomic groups bacillota common species belong families lactobacillaceae abundance approx members bacillota acetobacteraceae approx members proteobacteria less common bacterial species families leuconostocaceae enterococceae enterobacteriaceae abundance common species include lactobacillus plantarum lactobacillus brevis acetobacter pomorum enterococcus faecalis species acetobacter aceti acetobacter tropicalis acetobacter pasteurianus also often particular species host fly central influence composition quality gut microbiota even flies raised similar nevertheless hosts diet nutritional environment also shape exact composition microbiota instance exact ph food kill certain bacterial general type food used fly affects microbiota mushroom feeder species like drosophila falleni microdrosophila harbour many lactobacillales generally maintain high bacterial diversity guts microbiota flower feeders drosophila elegans drosophila flavohirta shows higher abundance enterobacteriaceae lesser extent acidophilic bacteria acetobacteraceae lactobacillaceae compared fruiteating species drosophila hydei drosophila immigrans drosophila sulfurigaster drosophila melanogaster drosophila sechellia drosophila microbial load bacterial composition also vary age host feeding key determinant microbiota composition diet influences presence abundance bacteria inside gut bacteria also need taken continuously environment prevail members intestinal feeding feces seems play central role establishment drosophila microbiota allows flies recycle bacteria within fly population particular time point also across generations flies seed embryonic eggshell feces upon hatching young larvae eat eggshells thereby pick bacteria microbiota subsequently establishes inside gut developing larvae similar larvaes may promoted particular life history flies young adult flies harbor fewer bacteria old flies proliferate environment shaped feces preceding fly generation thus allowing take additional gut drosophila melanogaster composition action microbiome appears tightly regulated within compartments different sections intestines indicated differential expression genes especially regulatory function epithelium different parts gut detail gut compartmentalized three parts foregut midgut hindgut foregut hindgut lined cuticle formed ectodermal epithelium midgut endodermal adult flies midgut divided five smaller immune response varies among gut regions immune deficiency imd pathway responds bacterial infections activated certain receptors eg peptidoglycan receptor protein pgrplc receptors also components drosophila immune system toll receptor dduox pathway molecules control immune responses ectodermal tissue anterior gut moreover anterior midgut enriched certain antimicrobial peptides amps suggests immune defence area particularly responsive possibly regions represents first contact region newly taken food microbiota andor intestinal pathogens middle posterior midgut genes receptor pgrplb downregulates imd immune response expressed possibly order minimize expression immune defence microbiota addition microbiota seems control expression several drosophila metabolic genes within midgut possibly facilitate digestion recently imd pathway anterior midgut region proposed play multipronged roles modulate key metabolic mechanic functions taken together appears interaction host microbiota precisely regulated across different regions within drosophila microbiota implicated mating success influencing assortative mating phenomenon detected studies microbiota seem affect lifespan drosophila melanogaster date mechanisms effect remain elusive fruit flies raised axenic conditions ie without bacteria environment cured microbiota antibiotics shorter lifespan flies raised normal conditions microbiota influence longevity seems particularly strong early date however exact mechanisms underlying effects remain elusive possible microbiotainduced proliferation intestinal stem cells associated metabolic homeostasis important contrast microbiota seems negative effect lifespan older drosophila melanogaster removal ageing flies increases longevity old flies reduced ability fight infections may also relate bacterial members aged animals immune responses may overshoot possibly harming host favoring colonization pathogens eg gluconobacter almost current approaches characterization drosophila microbiota rely destructive approaches flies killed gut extracted bacteria isolated andor analyzed assessment microbiota dynamics across lifespan individual fly across development fly population nondestructive approach would favorable approach recently developed focusing microbial characterization fly feces fly feces indeed informative composition gut microbiota since diversity gut bacteria feces bacteria bacteria whole fly drosophila melanogaster strongly correlated new approach could used demonstrate
