technologies mitigate fugitive dust released arid semiarid areas well improve commercial face masks used filtering methyl cellulose also used cell culture study viral replication dissolved nutrientcontaining medium cells normally grown single layer cells grown flat surface infected virus short time strength viral sample used determine many cells get infected time thick methyl cellulose medium added top cells place normal liquid medium viruses replicate infected cells able spread cells whose membranes touch trapped enter methyl cellulose cells closely neighboring infected cell become infected die leaves small regions dead cells called plaques larger background living uninfected cells number plaques formed determined strength original samplecitation needed aqueous methyl cellulose

solution sodium hydroxide treating methyl chloride substitution reaction follows hydroxyl residues oh functional groups replaced methoxide groupscitation needed different kinds methyl cellulose prepared depending number hydroxyl groups substituted cellulose polymer consisting numerous linked glucose molecules exposes three hydroxyl groups degree substitution ds given form methyl cellulose defined average number substituted hydroxyl groups per glucose theoretical maximum thus ds however typical values needed different methyl cellulose preparations also differ average length polymer backbonescitation needed methyl cellulose lower critical solution temperature lcst needed temperatures lcst readily soluble water lcst soluble paradoxical effect heating saturated solution methyl cellulose turn solid methyl cellulose precipitate temperature occurs depends dsvalue higher dsvalues giving lower solubility lower precipitation temperatures polar hydroxyl groups maskedcitation needed preparing solution methyl cellulose cold water difficult however powder comes contact water gel layer forms around dramatically slowing diffusion water powder hence inside remains dry better way first mix powder hot water methyl cellulose particles well dispersed much higher effective surface area water cool dispersion stirring leading much rapid dissolution particlescitation needed
