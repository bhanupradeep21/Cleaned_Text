context human evolution human vestigiality involves traits occurring humans lost original function evolution although structures called vestigial often appear functionless vestigial structure may retain lesser functions develop minor new ones cases structures identified vestigial simply unrecognized function vestigial organs sometimes called rudimentary many human characteristics also vestigial primates related animals charles darwin listed number putative human vestigial features termed rudimentary descent man included muscles ear wisdom teeth appendix tail bone body hair semilunar fold corner eye darwin also commented sporadic nature many vestigial features particularly musculature making reference work anatomist william turner darwin highlighted number sporadic muscles identified vestigial remnants panniculus carnosus particularly sternalis robert wiedersheim published structure man book human anatomy relevance mans evolutionary history book contained list human organs considered vestigial wiedersheim explained organs become wholly part functionless appearing embryo alone others present life constantly inconstantly greater part organs may rightly termed list supposedly vestigial organs included many examples page well others mistakenly believed purely vestigial pineal gland thymus gland pituitary gland organs lost obvious original functions later turned retained functions gone unrecognized discovery hormones many functions tissues immune examples included historically trend dismiss appendix uselessly vestigial anatomical hazard liability dangerous inflammation late century many reputable authorities conceded beneficial view supported perhaps inspired darwin edition book descent man selection relation sex organs patent liability appendicitis poorly understood role left appendix open blame number possibly unrelated conditions example surgeon claimed removal appendix cured several cases trifacial neuralgia nerve pain head face even though stated evidence appendicitis patients discovery hormones hormonal principles notably bayliss starling argued views early twentieth century remained great deal fundamental research done functions large parts digestive tract author found necessary argue idea colon important function ultimate disappearance appendix coordinate action necessarily associated frequent inflammations witnessing long history doubt dismissive views around prominent surgeon kenelm hutchinson digby documented previous observations going back thirty years suggested lymphatic tissues tonsils appendix may substantial immunological functions modern humans appendix sometimes believed vestige redundant organ ancestral species digestive functions much still extant species intestinal flora hydrolyze cellulose similar indigestible plant view changed past research suggesting appendix may serve important purpose particular may serve reservoir beneficial gut bacteria herbivorous animals rabbits terminal vermiform appendix cecum apparently bear patches tissue immune functions may also important maintaining composition intestinal flora however seem much digestive function present herbivores even large shown accompanying pictures however human appendix typically comparable rabbits size though caecum reduced single bulge ileum empties carnivorous animals may appendices seldom vestigial line possibility vestigial organs developing new functions research suggests appendix may guard loss symbiotic bacteria aid digestion though unlikely novel function given presence vermiform appendices many intestinal bacterial populations entrenched appendix may support quick reestablishment flora large intestine illness poisoning antibiotic treatment depletes otherwise causes harmful changes bacterial population study however refutes idea inverse relationship cecum size appendix size presence widely present euarchontoglires superorder mammals includes rodents lagomorphs primates also evolved independently diprotodont marsupials monotremes highly diverse size shape could suggest vestigial researchers deduce appendix ability protect good bacteria gut way gut affected bout diarrhea

abnormality tail approximately twelve centimeters long tails though deleterious effect almost always surgically wisdom teeth vestigial third molars human ancestors used help grinding plant tissue common postulation skulls human ancestors larger jaws teeth possibly used help chew foliage compensate lack ability efficiently digest cellulose makes plant cell wall human diets changed smaller jaws naturally selected yet third molars wisdom teeth still commonly develop human agenesis failure develop wisdom teeth human populations ranges zero tasmanian aboriginals nearly indigenous difference

simply missed structure older fetuses found evidence vno cadavers living patients given findings scientists argued vno adult human however investigators sought identify opening vomeronasal organ humans rather identify tubular epithelial structure thus argued studies employing macroscopic observational methods sometimes missed even misidentified vomeronasal among studies use microanatomical

dorsoepitrochlearis muscle found plantaris muscle composed thin muscle belly long thin tendon muscle belly approximately centimetres inches long absent human population weak functionality moving knee

vestigiality occurs tongue specifically chondroglossus muscle morphological study japanese cadavers found fibers identified solid bundled appropriate way facilitate speech mastication fibers short thin sparse nearly useless thus concluded vestigial extra nipples breasts sometimes appear along mammary lines humans appearing remnant mammalian ancestors possessed two nipples one report demonstrated healthy young men women participated anatomic study front surface body exhibited pairs focal fat mounds running along embryological mammary ridges axillae upper inner thighs always located relative anatomic sites analogous loci breasts placental mammals often nipplelike moles extra hairs located atop mounds therefore focal fatty prominences fronts human torsos likely represent chains vestigial breasts composed primordial breast humans also bear vestigial behaviors formation goose bumps humans stress vestigial reflex possible function distant evolutionary ancestors humanity raise bodys hair making ancestor appear larger scaring raising hair also used trap extra layer air keeping animal due diminished amount hair humans reflex formation goose bumps cold also palmar grasp reflex thought vestigial behavior human infants placing finger object palm infant securely grasp grasp found rather according able support weight although way cling mother grasp also evident feet baby
