dinosaur teeth studied since mary ann mantell husband dr gideon algernon mantell discovered iguanodon tooth sussex england unlike mammal teeth individual dinosaur teeth generally considered paleontologists diagnostic genus species level unknown taxa due morphological convergence variability many historically named tooth taxa like paronychodon richardoestesia today considered nomina dubia used form taxa refer isolated teeth localities displaced considerably time space type specimens however possible refer isolated teeth known taxa provided tooth morphology known teeth originate similar time place important anatomical information dinosaur teeth collected polished microscopically thin sections histology including types dental tissues present tooth wear tooth replacement patterns teeth attached frequency replacement actual material comprising dinosaur tooth different teeth modern animals significant differences teeth fit together continually regrew examples shedding old teeth others reabsorbing old teeth would grind chewing throughout dinosaurs life use histology paleontology traditionally focused examining long bones femur humeruscitation needed previous work long bone histology revealed differences growth patterns polar identified case dwarfism reconstructed life history dysalotosaurus examining multiple specimens different ontogenetic suggested psittacosaurus underwent postural change quadruped biped contrast dental histology looked great detail dinosaurs recently increase interest particular subfieldcitation needed histology studies traditionally rely upon destructive process creating examining thin sections microscopy often restricting studies taxa plentiful specimens isolated teeth damaged specimens nondestructive means analysis sometimes possible use scanning electron microscopy sem micro computed tomography much anatomical information difficult obtain without creating thin histological study microscopic examination essential revealing important aspects dinosaur dental anatomy different specimens suitable looking particular anatomical features example specimens teeth intact within jaws necessary study tooth attachment information lost isolated hand isolated teeth would sufficient goal examine wear tooth surface thin sections prepared first embedding suitable specimen epoxy resin embedded specimen mounted cut precision resulting slice attached slide ground polished thin enough suitable surface examined thin sections typically examined petrographic microscope using plain light crosspolarized light structures easily visible distinct using one type light due differences mineral properties specimens also examined various major groups dinosaurs examined histology include carnivorous theropods herbivorous groups sauropods hadrosaurs listed dental anatomy identified histology interpretations significance generally tissue types present dinosaurs found identical closest living nonavian relatives one significant findings despite differences appearance dinosaur teeth essentially composed dental tissues found modern mammals crocodilians amniotes suggesting tissues first evolved common ancestor retained ever examples viewed cross section growth lines observed dentine dinosaur teeth known lines von ebner represent daily deposition counting lines provides age tooth comparing age mature tooth replacement tooth socket provides estimate tooth replacement difference age oldest teeth youngest teeth used determine rate tooth many dinosaur teeth found replacement pattern similar reptiles replacement tooth grows dental lamina inside jaw migrating outwards resorbing part growing functional tooth ready erupt replace tooth attachment mode dinosaurs referred condition tooth deeply implanted tooth socket periodontal ligament present case crocodilians mammals thecodonty associated dental occlusion crocodilians proposed means reduce stresses bite coelophysis possessed neither dental occlusion strong bite raising questions possesses one complex dentition found dinosaurs dental batteries present hadrosaurs whose members dominant species across planet neoceratopsia example triceratops batteries formed hundreds teeth stacked rows upon rows formed grinding surface process plant histological study batteries found cemented together previously thought tooth battery separately moving supported ligamenture whole structure comparable shark teeth dental batteries exhibited polyphyodonty growing new teeth inside migrated time replace outer teeth unlike sharks however lose old teeth teeth rapidly growing dental battery would wear completely reabsorbed renewing structure around batteries formed teeth growing fast maturing early point pulp cavity individual filled cells connective totally filled dentine even erupted lack pulp tooth posteruption means tooth essentially dead able completely worn away use replaced without risk exposing normally sensitive dental pulp infection pain dinosaurs ceratopsians sauropods also possessed dental batteries evolved independently differ form function hadrosaurs shows dinosaurs evolved extremely sophisticated chewing httpsenwikipediaorgwikidinosaurtooth
