dhara mustard otherwise known dmh genetically modified hybrid variety mustard species brassica juncea developed professor deepak pental university delhi aim reducing indias demand edible oil imports dmh created transgenic technology primarily involving bar barnase barstar gene system barnase gene confers male sterility barstar gene restores dmh ability produce fertile seeds insertion third gene bar enables dmh produce phosphinothricinn acetyltransferase enzyme responsible glufosinate resistance hybrid mustard variety come intense public scrutiny mainly due concerns regarding dmh potential adversely affect environment well consumer health dmh found pose food allergy risks demonstrated increased yields existing mustard varieties conflicting details results regarding field trials safety evaluations conducted dmh delayed approval commercial cropping mustard oil seed crop currently occupies million ha million acres agricultural land predominantly northwestern dry land regions mustard among three highest produced oil seed crops however yields experienced significant increase several years remained million dmh mustard variety developed reduce indias dependence foreign oil imports human annual basis india approximately spends rs crore billion million tonnes edible oil domestic edible oil demands met supplies increasing domestic yields mustard oil would significantly reduce indias dependency oil imports associated costs transgenic mustard variety dmh developed dr deepak pental colleagues centre genetic manipulation crop plants university delhi south took years approximately rs million successfully create dmh approved dmh first genetically modified food crop commercially cultivated india project develop dmh received funding national dairy development board india well department biotechnology dbt transgenic mustard dmh developed using genetic material isolated nonpathogenic soil techniques transgenic systems pollination control primarily involved barnasebarstar three genes bar barnase barstar extracted bacillus amyloliquefaciens produce hybrid main reason introducing barnasebarstar gene system transgenic mustard line heterosis breeding prevent insertion barnase gene induces genetic male sterility preventing production male gametophytes pollen grains mustard meanwhile barstar gene acts restore ability plant produce fertile hybrid seeds mustard selfpollinating plant thus making difficult perform crosspollination another desired male parental line without occurrence selfpollination barnase gene induced male sterility dmh simplifying process cross pollination derive new hybrid varieties two parental strains used develop dmh early hira mutant eh developed anil khalatkar nagpur varuna bn seed weight reported around grams dmh glufosinate resistance due enzyme expressed bar bialaphos resistance gene derived streptomyces hygroscopicus cloned bar gene encodes synthesis phosphinothricinn acetyltransferase pat enzyme responsible detoxifying active ingredient herbicide glufosinate phosphinothricins mechanism action involves inhibition glutamine synthetase prevents detoxification ammonia subsequently causes toxic buildup within plant cells inhibition glutamine synthetase also leads overall reduction glutamine levels plants glutamine acts signalling molecule major amino acid donor nucleotide pat enzymes

institute honorable supreme court india appointed technical expert committee tec report recommended total ban herbicidetolerant transgenic one reasons tec cited possibility ensuing negative health effects result farmers generously applying herbicide major reason dmh commercialised potential formation super weeds dmh glufosinate tolerant therefore thought encourage farmers liberally spray herbicide upon commercialisation causes artificial selection pressure weeds could result emergence glufosinateresistant weed biggest concern however regards dmh commercially cultivated potential genetic pollution rich biodiversity genus brassica via cross pollination wild mustard plants undergo wind insect mediated pollination due susceptibility outcrossing possibility indias rich mustard germplasm consisting wild varieties domesticated landraces irreversibly contaminated chairman task force agricultural biotechnology advised commercialisation herbicideresistant crops eliminate need
