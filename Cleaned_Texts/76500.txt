pain often inferred basis likely presence phenomenal consciousness deduced comparative brain physiology well physical behavioural amphibians particularly anurans fulfill several physiological behavioural criteria proposed indicating nonhuman animals may experience pain fulfilled criteria include suitable nervous system sensory receptors opioid receptors reduced responses noxious stimuli

belief amphibians feel pain however remains somewhat controversial due differences brain structure nervous system compared vertebrates possibility amphibians nonhuman animals may experience pain long history initially pain nonhuman animals based around theoretical philosophical argument recently turned scientific investigation idea nonhuman animals might feel pain goes back french philosopher rené

often quoted words question reason talk peter singer bioethicist author animal liberation published suggested consciousness necessarily key issue animals smaller brains less conscious mean capable feeling pain bernard rollin principal author two us federal laws regulating pain relief animals writes researchers remained unsure whether animals experience interactions scientists veterinarians rollin regularly asked prove animals conscious provide scientifically acceptable grounds claiming feel continuing discussions developed roles philosophy science understanding animal cognition subsequent years argued strong support suggestion animals likely amniotes least simple conscious thoughts view animals feel pain differently higher primates minority absence neocortex appear preclude

experience pain basis concludes vertebrates including amphibians probably experience pain invertebrates apart cephalopods probably experience although numerous definitions pain almost involve two key components first nociception ability detect noxious stimuli evoke reflex response rapidly moves entire animal affected part body away source stimulus concept nociception imply adverse subjective feeling reflex action example would rapid withdrawal finger touched something hot withdrawal occurs sensation pain actually experienced second component experience pain suffering internal emotional interpretation nociceptive experience withdrawn finger begins hurt moments withdrawal pain therefore private emotional experience pain directly measured animals responses putatively painful stimuli
