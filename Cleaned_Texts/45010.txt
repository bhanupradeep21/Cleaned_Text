rozyckatran et al found individuals countries lower gross domestic product showed stronger zerosum beliefs average suggesting belief zerosum game seems arise countries lower income resources scarce p similarly rozyckatran et al found individuals lower socioeconomic status displayed stronger zerosum beliefs related experiences resourcescarce environments belief resource scarce finite example lump labour fallacy refers belief economy fixed amount work done thus allocation jobs although belief resource scarce might develop experiences resource scarcity necessarily case example individuals might
