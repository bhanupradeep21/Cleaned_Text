porencephaly extremely rare cephalic disorder involving neurological disorder central nervous system characterized cysts cavities within cerebral porencephaly termed heschl describe cavity human derived greek roots word porencephaly means holes cysts cavities cystic brain lesions likely result destructive encephaloclastic cause also abnormal development malformative direct damage inflammation cysts cavities cause wide range physiological physical neurological depending patient disorder may cause minor neurological problems without disruption intelligence others may severely disabled die second decade lives however disorder far common within infants porencephaly occur patients diagnosed porencephaly display variety symptoms mild severe effects patient patients severe cases porencephaly epileptic seizures developmental delays whereas patients mild case porencephaly display little seizures typical neurodevelopment infants extensive defects show symptoms disorder shortly birth diagnosis usually made age following text lists common signs symptoms porencephaly affected individuals along short description certain porencephaly rare disorder exact prevalence porencephaly known however reported patients cerebral palsy patients epilepsy congenital vascular hemiparesis porencephaly number different often unknown causes including absence brain development destruction brain tissue limited research commonly regarded cause porencephaly disturbances blood circulation ultimately leading brain however number different multiple factors abnormal brain development damage brain tissue also affect development following text lists potential risk factors developing porencephaly porencephalic cysts cavities along brief description certain cysts cavities occur anywhere within brain locations cysts depend highly patient cysts develop frontal lobe parietal lobe forebrain hindbrain temporal lobe virtually anywhere cerebral recent studies de novo inherited mutations gene suggesting genetic predisposition within family encodes type iv collagen chain shown associated present patients porencephaly mutation causes variety phenotypes including porencephaly infantile hemiplegia cerebral small vessel diseases involving stroke abnormal gene expression contribute development porencephaly gene expresses type iv collagen basement protein present tissue blood vessels extremely important structural stability vascular basement membranes protein provides strong layer around blood mutation weaken blood vessels within brain elevating probability hemorrhage eventually promoting internal bleeding leading porencephaly neurodevelopment infantile therefore formation cavities result hemorrhages promote cerebral mouse model mouse mutations displayed cerebral hemorrhage porencephaly abnormal development vascular basement membranes uneven edges inconsistent shapes highly variable purposely causing mutation gene caused several mouse develop cerebral hemorrhage porencephalylike diseases though direct correlation mutations gene appears influential effect development another genetic mutation factor v mutation reported show possible association development porencephaly mutation factor v increases risk thrombosis blood clots neonates infants therefore porencephalic healthy infants investigated factor v mutation along different prothrombotic risk factors results indicated higher prevalence factor v mutation porencephalic patient group prediction childhood porencephaly caused hypercoagulable state condition one higher chance developing blood clots supported significance factor v mutation also pregnant women hypercoagulable state cause fetus risks therefore possibly causing fetal loss brain damage lesions infections lead porencephaly however different prothrombotic risk factors individually reach statistical significance link development porencephaly combination multiple prothrombotic risk factors porencephaly group significant overall factor v mutation linked development porencephaly however one mutation cause porencephaly whether prothrombiotic risk factors associated porencephaly still remains utero exposure cocaine street drugs lead presence porencephalic cysts cavities detected using transillumination skull infant patients porencephaly usually diagnosed clinically using patients families history clinical observations based presence certain characteristic neurological physiological features porencephaly advanced medical imaging computed tomography ct magnetic resonance imaging mri ultrasonography used method exclude possible neurological disorders diagnosis made antenatally ultrasound assessments include memory speech intellect testing help determine exact diagnose currently cure porencephaly limited resources knowledge neurological disorder however several treatment options available treatment may include physical therapy rehabilitation medication seizures epilepsy shunt medical neurosurgery removal according location extent lesion size cavities severity disorder combinations treatment methods imposed porencephaly patients patients achieved good seizure control appropriate drug therapy including valproate carbamazepine also antiepileptic drugs served another positive method severity symptoms associated porencephaly varies significantly across population affected depending location cyst damage brain patients porencephaly minor neurological problems may develop patients live normal lives therefore based level severity selfcare possible serious cases lifelong care severe disability early diagnosis medication participation rehabilitation related finemotor control skills communication therapies significantly improve symptoms ability patient porencephaly live normal life infants porencephaly survive proper treatment display proper communication skills movement live normal lifecitation needed united states federal government national institute neurological disorders stroke national institute health involved conducting supporting research related normal abnormal brain nervous system development information gained research used develop understanding mechanism porencephaly
