cardiac tamponade also known pericardial tamponade compression heart due pericardial effusion buildup pericardial fluid sac around onset may rapid symptoms typically include obstructive shock including shortness breath weakness lightheadedness symptoms may relate underlying common causes cardiac tamponade include cancer kidney failure chest trauma myocardial infarction causes include connective tissues diseases hypothyroidism aortic rupture autoimmune disease complications cardiac africa tuberculosis relatively common diagnosis may suspected based low blood pressure jugular venous distension quiet heart sounds together known becks pericardial rub may present cases due diagnosis may supported specific electrocardiogram ecg changes chest xray ultrasound fluid increases slowly pericardial sac expand contain liters however increase rapid little ml result tamponade medical results symptoms drainage done pericardiocentesis surgery create pericardial window drainage may also necessary rule infection treatments may include use dobutamine low blood volume intravenous symptoms worrisome features often closely frequency tamponade one estimate united states places per per onset may rapid acute gradual signs cardiac tamponade typically include cardiogenic shock including shortness breath weakness lightheadedness becks triad eg jugular vein distention quiet heart sounds hypotension symptoms may relate underlying general signs shock fast heart rate shortness breath decreasing level consciousness may also occur however signs may present certain cases fast heart rate although expected may absent people uremia according reddy coauthors cardiac tamponade progression described different phase required filling pressure increases due high stiffness ventricles accumulation pericardial fluid pericardial cavity phase ii pericardial pressure exceeds ventricular filling pressure caused accumulation pericardial fluid results decrease cardiac input output decrease cardiac input output typical phase iii progression cardiac tamponade caused equilibration left ventricular filling pericardial pressure leading severe deterioration endorgan perfusion symptoms consequence include abdominal pain due liver engorgement cardiac tamponade caused large uncontrolled pericardial effusion ie buildup fluid inside commonly occurs result chest trauma blunt also caused myocardial infarction myocardial rupture cancer often hodgkin lymphoma uremia pericarditis cardiac rarely occurs retrograde aortic person taking anticoagulant effusion occur rapidly case trauma myocardial rupture gradual period time cancer fluid involved often blood pus also found one common settings cardiac tamponade first days heart heart surgery chest tubes placed drain blood chest tubes however prone clot formation chest tube becomes occluded clogged blood drained accumulate around heart leading pericardium doublewalled sac surrounding heart consists fibrous pericardium layer outside doublelayered serous pericardium two layers serous pericardium pericardial space filled lubricating serous fluid prevents friction heart outer layer heart made fibrous easily stretch excess fluid begins enter pericardial space pressure starts consequently heart becomes compressed due inability fully fluid continues accumulate successive diastolic period leads less blood entering ventricles eventually increasing pressure heart forces septum bend towards left ventricle leading decrease stroke causes development obstructive shock left untreated may lead cardiac arrest often presenting pulseless electrical decrease stroke volume also ultimately lead decrease cardiac output could signaled tachycardia three classic signs known becks triad low blood pressure jugularvenous distension muffled heart signs may include pulsus paradoxus drop least mmhg arterial blood pressure st segment changes may also show low voltage qrs tamponade often diagnosed radiographically echocardiography diagnostic test choice often demonstrates enlarged pericardium collapsed ventricles large cardiac tamponade show enlarged globularshaped heart chest xray inspiration negative pressure thoracic cavity cause increased pressure right ventricle increased pressure right ventricle cause interventricular septum bulge towards left ventricle leading decreased filling left ventricle time right ventricle volume markedly diminished sometimes apical ultrasound image heart person cardiac tamponade note right atrial collapses ultrasound image inferior vena cava ivc person cardiac tamponade note ivc large changes minimally initial diagnosis cardiac tamponade challenging broad differential differential includes possible diagnoses based symptoms time course mechanism injury patient history rapid onset cardiac tamponade may also appear similar pleural effusions shock pulmonary embolism tension symptoms appeared gradually differential diagnosis includes acute heart person trauma presenting pulseless electrical activity absence hypovolemia tension pneumothorax likely diagnosis cardiac addition diagnostic complications afforded wideranging differential diagnosis chest pain diagnosis additionally complicated fact people often weak faint presentation instance fast rate breathing difficulty breathing exertion progresses air hunger rest key diagnostic symptom may possible obtain information people unconscious convulsions initial treatment given usually supportive nature example administration oxygen monitoring little care provided prehospital general treatment shock teams performed emergency thoracotomy release clotting pericardium caused penetrating chest injurycitation needed prompt diagnosis treatment key survival tamponade prehospital providers facilities provide pericardiocentesis lifesaving person already suffered cardiac arrest pericardiocentesis alone ensure survival rapid evacuation hospital usually appropriate course actioncitation needed initial management hospital involves insertion needle skin pericardium aspirating fluid ultrasound guidance preferably done laterally intercostal spaces usually fifth subxiphoid left parasternal approach begins cm left sternum avoid left internal mammary artery intercostal often cannula left place resuscitation following initial drainage procedure performed need arises facilities available emergency pericardial window may performed pericardium cut open allow fluid drain following stabilization person surgery provided seal source bleed mend pericardiumcitation needed following heart surgery amount chest tube drainage monitored drainage volume drops blood pressure goes suggest tamponade due chest tube clogging case person taken back operating room emergency reoperationcitation needed aggressive treatment offered immediately complications arise shock ami arrhythmia heart failure aneurysm carditis embolism rupture dealt quickly fully contained adequate survival still distinct
