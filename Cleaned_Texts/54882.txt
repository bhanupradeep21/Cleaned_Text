canadian province alberta us state montana paleontologists recognize type species g libratus although species erroneously referred genus like known tyrannosaurids gorgosaurus large bipedal predator measuring metres ft length metric tons short tons body mass dozens large sharp teeth lined jaws twofingered forelimbs comparatively small gorgosaurus closely related albertosaurus distantly related larger tyrannosaurus gorgosaurus albertosaurus extremely similar distinguished mainly subtle differences teeth skull bones experts consider g libratus species albertosaurus would make gorgosaurus junior synonym genus gorgosaurus lived lush floodplain environment along edge inland sea apex predator preying upon abundant ceratopsids hadrosaurs areas gorgosaurus coexisted another tyrannosaurid daspletosaurus torosus although animals roughly size evidence niche differentiation two gorgosaurus bestrepresented tyrannosaurid fossil record known dozens specimens plentiful remains allowed
