diabetes chronic disease cats whereby either insufficient insulin response insulin resistance leads persistently high blood glucose concentrations diabetes affects may becoming increasingly common diabetes less common cats dogs condition treatable treated properly cat experience normal life expectancy cats type diabetes prompt effective treatment may lead diabetic remission cat longer needs injected insulin untreated condition leads increasingly weak legs cats eventually malnutrition ketoacidosis andor dehydration death diabetes cats classified following cats generally show gradual onset disease weeks months may escape notice even first outward symptoms sudden weight loss occasionally gain accompanied excessive drinking urination example cats appear develop obsession water lurk around faucets water bowls appetite suddenly either ravenous three times normal absent neuropathy hind legs may cause cat develop plantigrade stance walking hocks rather toes front legs may develop corresponding palmigrade stance cat standing palms rather toes symptoms arise bodys inability use glucose energy source fasting glucose blood test normally suggestive diabetes point home blood test monitors used humans also used cats usually obtaining blood ear edges paw pads disease progresses ketone bodies present urine detected urine strips used testing human urine final stages cat starts wasting body breaking fat muscle survive lethargylimpness acetonesmelling breath acute symptoms ketoacidosis andor dehydration constitute medical emergency untreated diabetes leads coma death little insulin time cause tissue starvation glucose reach brain body combination dehydration fasting infection body stresses condition may progress diabetic ketoacidosis medical emergency high fatality rate treated home symptoms include lethargy fruitlike smell breath urine shortness breath increase thirst emergency care includes fluid therapy insulin management presenting symptoms hospitalization back legs may become weak gait may become stilted wobbly owing diabetic neuropathy caused damage myelin sheath peripheral nerves due glucose toxicity cell starvation turn caused chronic common cats back legs become weaker cat displays plantigrade stance standing hocks instead toes normal cat may also trouble walking jumping may need sit steps neuropathy sometimes heals within weeks blood sugar regulated signs diabetes caused persistently high blood glucose concentration may caused either insufficient insulin lack response cats type diabetes similar human type diabetes Î²cell dysfunction insulin factors contribute insulin resistance include obesity endocrine diseases acromegaly affects diabetic cats diagnosed measuring concentration insulinlike growth quite frequently cat stress transported car brought veterinarian experience artificial temporary spike blood glucose levels called stress hyperglycemia subside hours spike however affect cats blood fructosamine levels therefore often better measure overall blood diabetes condition treated invariably lethal ignored early diagnosis treatment qualified veterinarian help preventing nerve damage rare cases may even lead diabetic cats best longlasting twicedaily injections insulin glargine available worldwide synthetic generic drug combined low carbohydrate diet diabetes disease carbohydrate metabolism move primarily protein fat diet reduces occurrence recurrence hyperglycemia diet critical component treatment cases effective following treatment insulin example recent showed many diabetic cats stopped needing insulin changing low carbohydrate diet rationale lowcarbohydrate diet reduces amount insulin needed keeps variation blood sugar low easier predict also fats proteins metabolized slower carbohydrates reducing dangerous blood sugar peaks right meals recent recommended diets trending towards lowcarbohydrate diet rather formerly recommended highfiber diet carbohydrate levels highest dry cat foods made grains even expensive prescription types cats better canned diet protein fat focused prescription canned foods made diabetic cats regular brand foods effective owners aim supply daily energy requirement cats carbohydrates oral medications like glipizide stimulate pancreas promoting insulin release cases reduce glucose production less less used drugs may completely ineffective pancreas working drugs also shown damage pancreas cause liver damage owners reluctant switch pills insulin injections fear unjustified difference cost convenience minor cats easier inject pill injections effective treating disease bexagliflozin bexacat approved medical use united states december first sodiumglucose cotransporter inhibitor new animal drug approved us food drug administration fda animal method usually employed dose slowacting insulin twice daily keep blood sugar within recommended range entire day method important cat avoid large meals highcarbohydrate food meals may also timed coincide peak insulin activity oncedaily doses since insulin usually metabolizes faster cats humans example insulin brand lasts hours people may effective cats may treated animal insulin bovinebased insulin similar cat insulin human synthetic insulin best choice insulin brand type varies animal animal may require trial error human synthetic insulin humulin n novolin n nph usually poor choice since cats

weeks achieve successful documented method tight regulation lantus typical obstacles regulation include absolute numbers vary pets meter calibrations glucometers made humans generally accurate using feline blood except reading lower ranges blood glucose mmoll point size difference human animal red blood cells create inaccurate much insulin may result contradictory increase blood glucose somogyi effect often noted cat owners monitor cats blood glucose home time blood glucose level drops far hypoglycemia body may defensively dump glucose converted glycogen liver well hormones epinephrine cortisol bloodstream glycogen raises blood glucose hormones may make cat insulinresistant time body glycogen reserves rebound effect cat rebound hyperglycemia occurs rarely cats treated glargine protocol aiming tight control blood glucose acute hypoglycemic episode low blood sugar happen even careful pet owners since cats insulin requirements sometimes change without warning symptoms include depressionlethargy confusiondizziness loss excretorybladder control vomiting loss consciousness andor seizures immediate treatment includes administering honey corn syrup rubbing gums cat even unconscious seizures symptomatic hypoglycemia cats medical emergency cat require professional medical attention honeycorn syrup continue administered way vet every minute without blood sugar causes brain damage cat hypoglycemia according humancalibrated blood glucose meter mmoll mgdl symptoms fed soon possible hypoglycemic cats refuse eat forcefed honey corn syrup stabilize though may done animal unconscious seizure liquid likely enter animals lungs cause choking asphyxiation mild hypoglycemic episodes go unnoticed leave evidence urine pools outside litter box cases blood sugar probably appear paradoxically high upon next test hours later since cats body react low blood sugar stimulating liver release stored glycogen remission occurs cat longer requires treatment diabetes normal blood glucose concentrations least approximately one four cats type diabetes achieves remission studies reported higher remission rate may part due intensive monitoring impractical outside research environment research studies implicated variety factors successful remission general following factors increase likelihood cats may present type insulinresistant diabetes least first hyperglycemia amyloidosis left untreated damage pancreas time progress insulindependent diabetescitation needed glipizide similar oral diabetic medicines designed type diabetic humans shown increase amyloid production amyloidosis therefore may reduce likelihood approximately onethird cats achieve remission later diabetes rare cats younger five years typically affected cats burmese cats europe australia
