apollo lunar surface operations conducted july august apollo commander david scott apollo lunar module pilot james irwin used first lunar roving vehicle make three exploratory trips away landing site base apennine mountains near hadley rille collected total kg lb lunar surface material hours outside lunar module falcon hours minutes seconds get descent engine falcon ignited burning first seconds guidance computer could gimbal engine direct thrust center gravity lm thrust irwin confirmed abort guidance system ags agreed primary guidance navigation system pgns height rate descent three minutes computer rolled spacecraft back windows facing away lunar surface landing radar could acquire surface scott announced altitude velocity lights indicating computer getting acceptable data radar six minutes burn feet surface mission control flight director learned tracking data indicated going land feet south targeted landing site although first decided tell crew ed mitchell capcom convinced otherwise time scott trying see ground window thought going land long could see mount hadley delta unable see rille something possible simulators nine minutes ten seconds burn program started computer lm pitched forward crew could see ground using scribe marks window angles read irwin scott found computer predicting landing site used hand controller move predicted location times landing moving target site total meters feet uprange meters feet north scotts main problem little detail surface best images site ft resolution photoanalysers overenhanced images main problem overestimating depth craters make shadows higher sun angles fortunately able see four craters matthew mark luke index reason called index john due madalyn murray ohair outspoken atheist sued nasa reading genesis apollo although lost case nasa remained squeamish overtly religious announcements later flights irwin began reading altitude rate descent projected landing site ft computer switched program designed landing phase scott flying manually irwin stopped reading projected landing site passing ft scott said picking dust time got ft view outside would completely obscured dust irwin announced contact light illuminated indicating one landing probes lms feet contacted ground immediately scott cut engine extended engine bell fear could touch ground cause exhaust travel back engine estimated travelling fts ms hit twice fast previous missions seconds later scott informed ground okay houston falcon plain hadley falcon tilted nearly degrees back left maximum acceptable angle set rim crater engine bell damaged one legs crater meters north meters west targeted landing site little concern though thanks capabilities rover ventured outside first time scott irwin would sleep realized order best sevenhour extravehicular activity would need rested scott also learned need get overview new survey site venturing outside convinced mission planners let conduct standup eva first sleep period also gave stable platform use mm telephoto lens carried mission first time lens struggle get board spacecraft weight savings measured pounds two hours landing depressurized lm removed top hatch docking mechanism scott stood top ascent engine cover put head outside looking around scott familiar territory spent months studying maps area could easily recognize mons hadley mons hadley delta swan range silver spur bennett hill hill north complex scotts first task take stereo panorama area using mm lens photographed targets interest telephoto lens color panorama area mm lens able put bed concerns use rover radar observations earth given impression area covered large boulders would make impossible traverse rover scott saw nothing bigger inches cm near described features could see around basically give general setting area make sure great surprises thirty minutes opening hatch scott reentered hatch closed falcon repressurized throughout astronauts sleep period mission control watched concern pressure inside descent stage oxygen tanks lm slowly dropped conserve power night lm run lowdatarate telemetry stream mission control could tell exact cause unwilling wake crew decided wait woken end flight director peter frank chose wake crewmen hour early got turn back highdatarate telemetry saw valve urine transfer device open even though receptacle capped total pounds kg oxygen lost half total amount reserve scott irwin would state postflight technical debrief mission control awakened soon leak detected awake decided start preparations first lunar eva mission everything apollo involved procedure prepare falcon space suits apollo first crew got sleep long johns rather stay space suits would four hours waking mission control gave go depressurize lm scott became seventh man step onto lunar surface said stand wonders unknown hadley sort realize theres fundamental truth nature man must explore exploration greatest inspecting lm scott began unpack modularised equipment stowage assembly mesa attached side lm carried apollo tv camera sample bags batteries scrubbers space suits equipment needed astronauts outside spacecraft seven minutes scott stepped outside irwin surface irwins first task collect contingency sample lunar rock collected case emergency ie suddenly leave lunar surface within first minutes event contingency sample meant crew would return earth emptyhanded however contingency sample much value ground surrounding landing site disturbed lm descent engine scott positioned tv camera tripod mission control could see deployment lunar rover irwin began process pulling two lanyards released rover let swing hinges began unfold experienced problems first due angle lm sitting within minutes ground almost ready go scott honor first test drive taking around lm rover front back steering scott found rearwheel steering working mysteriously front steering would working start second eva difficulties came space suits bend much sat training earth body weight forced suits moon ended reclining seats also bouncing seats traverses result rough terrain resulted adding seat belts lrvs apollos apart steering problems crew set loading rover first geological traverse lunar surface operations commander scott always drove rover lunar module pilot irwin passenger assisted navigation division responsibilities two crew positions used consistently throughout apollos j astronauts could travel farther distance could walk remaining oxygen portable life support systems plss earlier set farther could travel would travel farthest point traverse work way back would travel base hadley delta via rille first target station crater dubbed elbow crater socalled sat bend rille first eva also served important task working exactly landed rover carried navigation system could calculate distance direction known starting point travelling known point could calibrated scott set kmh mph slow terrestrial standards due lowness chassis rover roughness surface astronauts would say seemed quite quick throughout journey astronauts trouble identifying due knowing exactly landing site overenhanced maps little familiar route chosen first drive picked mind driving along side rille would hard miss target arriving elbow irwins first task take panorama site time scott aligned sband antenna rover earth allowed mission control operate tv camera ed fendell charge controlling camera took pan geologists backroom could see site backroom kept track everything astronauts geology sample collected would note number location description card scott irwin took radial sample crater taking samples increasing distances straight line rim crater placing photocalibration gnomon west sample photographed collected placed numbered bag within ten minutes gathered four rock samples time move onto station st george five hundred meters south elbow km wide st george crater crater main objective planned spend minutes flight plan called use crater way investigating interior hadley delta collecting ejecta approached found ejecta decided bother visiting rim st george instead travelled boulder sitting open crater rock stopped feet across larger rock likely formed area instead thrown impact firstly took soil sample base rock another small depression hill bit scott announced would roll rock sample soil underneath couple futile attempts managed chip pieces man moon andrew chaikin writes dale jackson usgs dinner astronauts night houston happily proclaimed everything fuck rock samples area made using specially designed rake tines spaced cm apart collect small pebbles regolith last task station take core sample done using tube driven ground hammer mission control announced decided cancel planned stop crater named flow due time constraints thus astronauts boarded rover drove back past elbow way lm meters crater named rhysling scott spied large piece vesicular basalt sitting wanting leave stopped rover stop unplanned told mission control seatbelt come loose quickly got rover ran rock using collection tongs calibration photos took sample got back rover time irwin distracted mission control describing surrounding craters sample boxes returned earth stop discovered vesicular basalt sample sometimes called seatbelt basalt back falcon scott irwin set deploying apollo lunar surface experiments package alsep scott would drill holes heatflow experiment put probes irwin would set rest equipment alsep consisted passive seismic experiment lunar surface magnetometer solar wind spectrometer suprathermal ion detector cold cathode gauge experiment lunar dust detector heatflow experiment included alsep deployed irwin well lunar laser ranging experiment lrrr solar wind composition experiment alsep equipment attached via cables central station powered radioisotope thermoelectric generator scott major trouble drilling first cm easy became difficult half planned could get mission control told emplace probes start next hole extreme torque locked chuck meaning freed wrench delaying could get meter ground second hole mission control called day told return lm outside hours returning lm gave crew muchneeded rest irwin dehydrated water bag worked gone seven hours without liquids target second eva mount hadley delta crew drove via direct route site east travelled previous day travelling mph kmh made good time across plain first stop day station cancelled give time finish drilling holes heat flow experiment dune crater western edge south cluster astronauts would however briefly visit dune return trip lm making navigation stop started travel mi km along base delta towards dandelion frost craters frost location station scott found little variation surroundings decided frost going offer little difference decided stop site mi km st george ft delta interesting work slope degrees reaching frost cancelled station placing instead station first sampled freshlooking crater part rim older crater samples made area parked rover breccias find one porphyritic basalt scott decided move ft crater largest one nearby went inside sample found rocks large mission control called said would like crew dig trench study soil mechanics take core sample irwin dug trench scott photographed core sample taken inside crater returning rover drove ft large boulder station even walking short distances slope time consuming easier crew use rover get boulder ft across necessary one crewmember stay rover holding make sure slide hill slope time running stop scott able confirm irwin seen earlier rock greenish tinge color found come magnesium oxide back rover traveled onward spur crater station ft across ft deep reaching craters rim found small fragments including one white vein first irwin thought kicked green soil scott found caused visors helmets coated gold saw would become famous lunar sample collected entire apollo program sample dubbed media genesis rock looked first like partially crystalline rock closer looked realized almost pure plagioclase meaning anorthosite originally thought found piece moons primordial crust later analysis would show rock billion years old younger moon formed moons crust solidified still extremely old sample preimbrian era scott quickly went large boulder northwest rim crater took photos many angles collected sample next assumed broken boulder determined large impact melt breccia joined irwin preparing collect rake sample closer rover time running walkback constraint approaching geology backroom decided wanted astronauts collect many small fragments could area irwin wanted sample large breccia spending much time little time left site also took rake samples netting fragments regolith three minutes move irwin hit large rock scoop breaking along one fracture lines chip collected would secondlargest rock collected mission returned falcon along essentially path came passing south cluster dune scott decided stop collect samples joe allen capcom warned ten minutes spend irwins camera jammed acquiring panorama area forcing scott take remaining documentation photography working quickly collected samples including several large basalt boulder rim dune returning lm scott began another attempt drilling holes heatflow experiment irwin took manual core samples around alsep site like previous day drill continued get stuck refusing go scott able advance centimeters pulling drill clear flutes drill bit letting drill advance using weight process however would cause drill bit sections come apart meaning scott really creating new obstruction surface without realizing tried emplace probes went ft postflight analysis would find drill design flawed flutes close together joint joining sections stem soil mechanics experiment undertaken digging trench using penetrometer measure strength regolith scott began drilling another hole time deep core sample meters scott decided far enough well depth heatflow probes main reason taking core sample wanting lose time next day returning remove core started pull managed get cm refused move last task day set flag united states outside falcon hours minutes overnight mission control decided cancel traverse north complex time saved going would spent pulling deep core sample although annoyed scott understood although command mission part team mission scientists decided core sample important sampling north complex setting alsep site crew took customary publicity shots flag back core sample drill scott irwin grabbed hold drill tried pull slowly surely managed work ground getting drill tries completely ground came break stem apart found vice built rover purpose installed backwards scott time becoming annoyed amount time spent sample said many hours want spend drill joe analysis core samples found pebble concentration density varied dramatically along ft length sample distinct layers varying thickness inches cm particular interest deepest portions core samples deep cosmic rays penetrate meaning affected recent cosmic ray activity rover tv camera problems attempt tilt would cause flop leaving pointing uselessly ground requiring astronaut repoint making mm film rover driving engineers earth set main target last eva hadley rille way stopped photograph rock suspected formed crater nearby time stop sample arrived ft crater near original target crater scarp scott decided stop met original objective scarp collect debris near rille taking panorama site scott took samples finding extremely soft thought area around youngest ever walked astronaut moving traveled rille one objectives apollo sample exposed bedrock point origin previous missions basalt collected thrown impacts irwin took site panorama scott used mm telephoto lens image far side rille mi km across looking layering wall rille could help geologists find lava flows filled palus putredinis came one go time irwin started radial sample found rectangular rock large return earth due slope surrounding area able see bedrock rim rille appeared along walked ft crater sampled metersized rocks thrown meant time move geology backroom decided loss another sampling station offset chance sampling true bedrock given time moving edge rille sampled ft rock back rover took another rake sample core sample scott decided sample vuggy coarsely grained basalt decided take whole footballshaped rock dubbed great scott lb kg sample would biggest returned apollo sample moved last station mission station little time left could photograph site ft crater scott one thing returned lunar module well left hand feather right hand hammer guess one reasons got today gentleman named galileo long time ago made rather significant discovery falling objects gravity fields thought would better place confirm findings moon thought wed try feather happens appropriately
