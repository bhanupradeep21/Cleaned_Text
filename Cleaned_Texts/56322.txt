uremia term high levels urea blood urea one primary components urine defined excess blood amino acid protein metabolism end products urea creatinine would normally excreted urine uremic syndrome defined terminal clinical manifestation kidney failure also called renal signs symptoms results laboratory tests result inadequate excretory regulatory endocrine function uremia uremic syndrome used interchangeably denote high plasma urea concentration result renal former denotation used rest article azotemia similar less severe condition high levels urea abnormality measured chemically yet severe produce symptoms uremia describes pathological symptomatic manifestations severe specific time onset uremia people progressive loss kidney function people kidney function ie glomerular filtration rate gfr mlmin years age may uremia degree means estimated million people united states gfr less mlmin uremic symptoms fatigue vague making diagnosis impaired kidney function difficult treatment dialysis kidney transplant though patients choose pursue symptom control conservative care classical signs uremia progressive weakness easy fatigue loss appetite due nausea vomiting muscle atrophy tremors abnormal mental function frequent shallow respiration metabolic acidosis without intervention via dialysis kidney transplant uremia due renal failure progress cause stupor coma uremia mostly consequence kidney failure signs symptoms often occur concomitantly signs symptoms kidney failurecitation needed glomerular filtration rate gfr measures amount plasma millilitres filtered
