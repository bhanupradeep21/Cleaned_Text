participatory surveillance communitybased monitoring term applied digital media studies ecological field realm media studies refers users surveil using internet either use social media search engines webbased methods tracking individual power find information freely non freely given individual searched issues privacy emerge within sphere participatory surveillance predominantly focused much information available web individual consent disease outbreak researchers study socialmedia based patterns decrease time takes detect outbreak emerging field study called within realm ecological fieldwork participatory surveillance used overarching term method indigenous rural communities used gain greater accessibility causes disease outbreak using communities disease outbreak spotted earlier traditional means healthcare towards beginning development web increase online socializing interaction emerged largely function social media social media platforms originally emerged within context online information highway users control information available users platform users digitally attach people locations without physically within location concept coined added awareness locations users aspect greater socialization interconnectivity emerges within digital tangible world since online information highway collects stores information permanently physical world many interactions amongst online users last much longer physical ones since users control information locations associate part surveil others extent participatory surveillance within webbased addition participatory surveillance begun referred tool ecological field research currently extremely difficult detect disease outbreaks enough time prepare people outcomes often hard reach areas arctic researchers gain intensive look subject disease outbreak closely enough gain accurate results indigenous peoples know ecology land better reach overlooked locations research researchers use people rural surveyors capturing instances disease outbreak much quicker easier researchers countersurveillance refers surveillancebased challenges power imbalances individuals although state industry mass surveillance received substantial public attention wake disclosures like made edward snowden national security agency interest activistdeployed peer surveillance whereas average person may fully understand surveillance programs larger collectivities people drawing upon surveillance tools interpersonal relationships attempts bring institutional researchers assert using technologies surveillance ones used companies track consumer tendencies public essentially feeding practices personal one argument towards social media based participatory surveillance participatory surveillance within social digital media schemas work emphasize power comes monitoring surveilled context others rather constituted invasion privacy within visual discourse reality television artistic narrative associated presenting lives creates fake reality people contextualize therefore keeping reality aspects individual collectives lives still privatized thinking transposed socially constructed media technologies contrast ambient awareness associated cell phones since rarely turned poses greater security risk surveillance webcams focus aspects real users want show digital audience privatized respect users control allow others see causing feel emerging term within social media based participatory surveillance infodemiology refers use digital based applications surveys better track disease information people search related health well public says digitalbased platforms makes fabric field study coming infodemiology measures common social media platforms disease illness related websites search engine information online userrelated health crowdsourcing based healthrelated sites also gaining traction infodemiology include flu near influenzanet guardians health afyadata flutracking vigilante sa√∫de na sites usually gather information mapping similar symptoms users sites influenzanet provide incentives users continue tracking symptoms encourage friends start tracking twitter usergenerated platform social media effectively help track users thoughts opinions diseases well help track disease greater example virus swine flu outbreak analyzed twitter reactions responses order investigate areas thought analyzing comparing tweets different severities outbreak researchers posited tweets reliable estimate understanding disease speed social media reveals public thought trends two weeks faster standardized disease surveillance proper healthrelated institutions example social media reactions related virus include increased lack discussion around antiviral drugs approximately time virus became less however due nature social media usergenerated unregulated deciphering relevant versus irrelevant material blur generalizations facts along people wavering unreliable post social media social media unstable variable order become standardized would require great expense create measures would become feasible make valid generalizations elaborate using example twitter information sickness change meaning connotative sense example user tweets popular pop artist justin bieber saying bieber fever apparently real sickness faux sickness based popularity artist creates issues organizing information requiring complex algorithms analyze contours social nonetheless recent study noted studies focusing use youtube detect outbreaks twenty thirty percent range error leading researchers continue looking prospect social media force change disease chikungunya virus associated moderate severe skin rashes joint pain spread italy beginning outbreak caused great social concern therefore causing plethora social media reactions emerge using infodemiological approach sites outbreak recorded specifically pubmed twitter google trends news wikipedia views edits provided information disease received concerns associated outbreak popular opinion disease interestingly twitter posts related chikungunya highly guided search engine queries rather empirical investigations leading nonusable data using mediation technology wikipedia proved ineffective determining whether site helpful understanding outbreak moreover users gained opinions outbreak news sources similar wikipedia edits reactions similarly pubmed responses consistent wikipedia twitter responses overall significant amount information gathered sources deeming sites useful documenting disease public hard access regions arctic rural canada researching ecological processes disease spread difficult without constant monitoring indigenous populations become key aspect understanding spread disease due proximity connection example inuit populations observations outbreak avian cholera helped identify specific zones infection arctic canada specifically common eider species sea duck tracked understand increase mortality disease inuit first report increase deaths due reliance common eider meat feathers eggs support cape dorset iqaluit aupaluk kangirsuk kangiqsujuaq ivujivik inuit communities researchers able detect outbreak avian cholera thirteen locations inuit peoples able keep closer eye death rates common eider due daily routines subsistence digital technology advances many dangers associated privacy individuals attempting accountable meeting others background check websites search engine sources reveal many people attempt find information another person whatever many researchers altogether ignore idea privacy analyzing methods participatory surveillance social media perspective researchers claim openly sharing information others deemed breach however researchers topic mention breaches privacy within spheres digital media studies infodemiologycitation needed infodemiology relies users information analyze health patterns public health however legality behind using peoples information without consent cause serious ethical privacy violations however limitations individual privacy concerns unreliable information cause participatory digital information sometimes inaccurate hard differentiate doxing form cyberbullying using internet post private information individual organization means attack common information leaked anything past discretion home address even social security number information could freely available internet attacker access publicize differentiates types information leaks since information simply brought forefront publics viewing words public information leaked could found freely parties even exposed public light term doxing comes origins document first used infamous hacker collective called todays current laws legislation pertaining cyber threats attacks rooted internet developing due information stored online doxing adhere standard rights privacy constitutionally individuals right disclose disclose information time able make decisions first amendment protects right free speech doxing uniquely uses information available public leading doxers claim simply exercising first amendment rightscitation needed exception first amendment rights came cohen v california established true threat exception established breach free speech rights whenever content speech maliciously invades privacy interests
