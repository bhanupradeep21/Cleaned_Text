hypselosaurus meaning highest lizard greek ὑψηλός meaning high lofty σαυρος meaning lizard dubious genus titanosaurian sauropod lived southern france late cretaceous approximately million years ago early maastrichtian hypselosaurus first described formally named phillip matheron named binomial hypselosaurus priscus holotype specimen includes partial hindlimb pair caudal vertebrae two eggshell fragments found alongside bones proximity eggshells fossil remains many later authors including matheron paul gervais assigned several eggs region france hypselosaurus although variation differences eggs suggest belong taxon hypselosaurus found formation dromaeosaurids variraptor pyroraptor ornithopod rhabdodon ankylosaurian rhodanosaurus well indeterminate bones groups pierre philippe émile matheron french geologist paleontologist described several large bones provence spring matheron formally described remains including partial femur fibula possible tibia pair associated caudal vertebrae holotype specimen new taxon hypselosaurus among bones portions femur shaft preserved along majority tibia fibula vertebrae entirely layer fossils came likely late late cretaceous specifically million years since original description several specimens referred hypselosaurus one originally described albert de lapparent includes caudal vertebra well another vertebra described review european sauropods stated hypselosaurus nomen dubium holotype could verifiably distinguished sauropods many regions based material referred hypselosaurus several authors would considered

several decades eggs unusually large measuring around length age determination studies performed fossilized remains inconclusive results ranging decades several hundred eggs abnormally thin shells attributed hypselosaurus priscus experts speculated cause species extinction vegetation changes climatic change overcrowding original impetus shell thinning however alternative explanations thin eggshell dependent pathology later researchers found evidence eggs question successfully hatched researchers postulated thinner hypselosaurus priscus eggshells came different taxa thicker eggshells subsequent researchers come support idea another potential explanation variation eggshell thickness thinner eggs laid younger individuals thicker shell eggs laid older individuals consequence natural
