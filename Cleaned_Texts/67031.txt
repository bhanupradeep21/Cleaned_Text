translocates testicle developing scrotum ultimately passageway closes behind testicle failure process causes indirect inguinal hernia germ cells migrate near allantois colonize primordial gonads female germ cells colonise cortex become oogonia male germ cells colonise seminiferous cords medulla becoming spermatogonia first appearance gonad essentially two sexes consists thickening mesothelial layer peritoneum thick plate epithelium extends deeply pushing mesoderm forming distinct projection termed gonadal ridge gonadal ridge turn develops gonad testis male ovary female first mesonephros gonadal ridge continuous embryo grows gonadal ridge gradually becomes pinched mesonephros however cells mesonephric origin join gonadal ridge furthermore gonadal ridge still remains connected remnant body fold peritoneum namely mesorchium mesovarium seventh week distinction sex gonadal ridge begins perceptible ovary thus formed mainly genital ridge partly mesonephros later mass differentiated central part medulla ovary covered surface layer germinal epithelium cells germinal epithelium number larger cells immature ova found immature ova turn carried stroma beneath budlike ingrowths genital cords germinal epithelium surface germinal epithelium ultimately forms permanent epithelial covering organ furthermore soon loses connection central mass instead tunica albuginea ovaries develops early embryonic development cells dorsal endoderm yolk sac migrate along hindgut gonadal ridge primordial germ cells pgcs multiply mitosis reached gonadal ridge called oogonia diploid stem cells ovary oogonia enter area attempt associate somatic cells derived peritoneum mesonephros development proceeds oogonia become fully surrounded layer connective tissue cells pregranulosa cells irregular manner way rudiments ovarian follicles formed embryological origin granulosa cells remains controversial evidence emerged first cells make contact oogonia mesonephric origin suggested mesonephric cells already closely associated oogonia proliferated throughout development form granulosa cell recently hypothesis challenged thorough histology sawyer et al hypothesized sheep granulosa cells develop cells mesothelium ie epithelial cells presumptive surface epithelium male gubernaculum female effects considerable change position ovary gubernaculum female lies contact fundus uterus adheres organ thus ovary descend far level part gubernaculum ovary uterus ultimately becomes proper ovarian ligament part uterus labium majus forms round ligament uterus pouch peritoneum analogous vaginal process male accompanies along inguinal canal called canal nuck rare cases gubernaculum may fail contract adhesions uterus ovary descends inguinal canal labium majus circumstances position resembles testis testicle developed much way ovary originating mesothelium well mesonephros like ovary earliest stages consists central mass covered surface epithelium central mass series cords appear periphery mass converted tunica albuginea thus excluding surface epithelium part formation tissue testis cords central mass run together toward future hilum form network ultimately becomes rete testis hand seminiferous tubules developed cords distal hilum connectivetissue septa extend via rete testis seminiferous tubules become connected outgrowths mesonephros form efferent ducts testicle descent testicles consists opening connection testis final location anterior abdominal wall followed development gubernaculum subsequently pulls translocates testicle developing scrotum ultimately passageway closes behind testis descent ancestral placential mammals derived condition nondescent testes remaining near kidneys occurring afrotheria early period fetal life testicles placed back part abdominal cavity behind peritoneum attached peritoneal fold mesorchium mesonephros front mesonephros fold peritoneum termed inguinal fold grows forward meet fuse peritoneal fold inguinal crest grows backward anterolateral abdominal wall testis thus acquires indirect connection anterior abdominal wall time portion peritoneal cavity lateral fused folds marked future vaginal process also inguinal crest structure gubernaculum testis makes appearance first slender band extending part skin groin afterward forms scrotum inguinal canal body epididymis testicle contains upper part gubernaculum ultimately also internal spermatic vessels one plica gubernatrix contains lower part gubernaculum gubernaculum grows thick cord ends abdominal inguinal ring tube peritoneum vaginal process protrudes inguinal canal fifth month lower part gubernaculum still thick cord upper part disappeared lower part consists central core smooth muscle fibers surrounded firm layer striated muscle elements connected behind peritoneum abdominal wall testicles develop main portion lower end gubernaculum carried following skin attached bottom pouch bands carried medial side thigh perineum tube peritoneum constituting vaginal process projects downward inguinal canal emerges external inguinal ring pushing part obliquus internus aponeurosis obliquus externus form respectively cremaster muscle external spermatic fascia vaginal process forms gradually elongating pouch eventually reaches bottom scrotum behind pouch testicle drawn growth body fetus gubernaculum grow proportionately growth parts therefore testicle attached gubernaculum bottom scrotum prevented rising body grows instead drawn first inguinal canal eventually scrotum seems certain also gubernacular cord becomes shortened development proceeds assists causing testis reach bottom scrotum end eighth month testicle reached scrotum preceded vaginal process communicates upper extremity peritoneal cavity birth upper part vaginal process internal inguinal ring usually becomes closed obliteration extends gradually downward within short distance testicle process peritoneum surrounding testis entirely cut general peritoneal cavity constitutes tunica vaginalis internal inguinal ring close properly risk contents abdominal cavity protrudes passageway cause indirect inguinal hernia httpsenwikipediaorgwikidevelopmentofthegonads
