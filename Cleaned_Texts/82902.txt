benzoctamine drug possesses sedative anxiolytic properties marketed tacitin cibageigy different sedative drugs clinical trials produce respiratory depression actually stimulates respiratory system result compared sedative anxiolytic drugs benzodiazepines like diazepam safer form tranquilizing however coadministered drugs cause respiratory depression like morphine cause increased respiratory depression medically benzoctamine used treatment anxious outpatients control aggressioncitation needed enuresiscitation needed fearcitation needed minor social maladjustmentclarification needed childrencitation needed relatively new antianxiety drugclarification needed popularity increasing result able comparable anxiolytic sedative effects medications without potentially fatal respiratory depressive side effectscitation needed anxiolytic effects similar diazepam another anxiolytic unlike diazepam benzoctamine antagonistic effects epinephrine norepinephrine appears reduce serotonin turnovercitation needed little understood carries effects studies point reduced serotonin epinephrine norepinephrine partial causes pharmacologic behavioral animal studies shown sedative hypnotic drugs tend show dependency animals benzoctamine shown addictive animal studies also point drug possible mechanism reduce blood pressure adrenergic system chemically benzoctamine belongs class compounds called dibenzobicyclooctodienes tetracyclic compound consisting four rings three dimensional configuration closely related structurally tetracyclic antidepressant teca maprotiline differing length side chain benzoctamines main clinical use treatment anxiety evidence points effective clinical anxiety drugs particular treatment symptoms mild anxiety due psychoneurosis daily dosage mg benzoctamine shown effective mg another study one group patients given mg benzoctamine three times day another group given mg diazepam treatments studies point higher doses benzoctamine needed exert pharmacological effects drug still popular ability act anxiolytic without producing common respiratory depression associated sedative drugs studies even shown stimulates respiratory study used compare benzoctamine sodium amylobarbitone sleep promoter found administration drugs patients reported sleep less restless drowsiness study showed sodium amylobarbitone caused withdrawal rebound symptoms benzoctamine also found benzoctamine reduced plasma corticosteroid hormone relationship anxiety adrenocorticosteroid activity raised levels commonly reported indication study showed benzoctamine drug reported reduce anxiety also able reduce hormones potentially cause points phenomenon often seen within pharmacology drugs intended uses often farreaching rarely considered effects benzoctamine found efficacy chlordiazepoxide treating anxiety benzoctamine made alternative benzodiazepine line anxiolytic drugs uses drug discovered due benzoctamines ability tranquilize without causing respiratory depression scientists moving forward studies test sedative effects patients respiratory failure one study used benzoctamine clinical setting researchers showed use benzoctamine sedation result changes forced expiratory volume one second carbon dioxide partial pressure confirmed previous statements claimed drug cause respiratory failure main goal clinical study confirm findings another study showed benzoctamine reduce responsiveness instead increased ventilatory response usually many risks associated using sedatives patients suffering respiratory failure made difficult administer tranquillizing medications situations desirable known drug safe benzodiazepine cousins possible explanation phenomenon might come similarity structure tricyclic antidepressants also shown cause respiratory experimentation necessary study points benzoctamines possible consideration sedation respiratory failure patients possible treatment hypertension blocking peripheral vascular seretonergic neurons alphaadrenergic neurons postsynaptic cell one study showed benzoctamine serotonin alphaadrenergic antagonist reduce blood pressure seretonin mechanism reduce blood pressure antagonizing alphaadrenergic receptors rats given mg benzoctamine drops blood pressure approximately mm researchers confirmed serotonin antagonism sufficient reduce blood pressure using highly selective serotonin antagonist able decrease blood pressure studies yet repeated humans drowsiness dry mouth headache dizziness studies shown benzoctamine decreases rate turnover scientists confirmed results proposed method action inhibition serotonin uptake since drug also blocked serotonin depleting action extraneuronal monoamine transporters would lead increased stimulation serotonin receptors negative feed back mechanism eventually decreasing serotonin put however study points studies shown drugs combined emt cause lowering body temperature fact results decrease means body temperature effects ruled much understood benzoctamine produces antianxiety effects rat studies shown possible mechanism action way increased turnover addition serotonin also shown decrease epinephrine dopamine norepinephrine turnover antagonizing given intravenously doses mg significant differences oral doses exceeding mg three times daily increase effects assuming serotonin postsynaptic antagonism main mechanism benzoctamine carries effects studies shown half maximal inhibitory value mm serotonin benzoctamine injected directly blood given tablets given tablets given doses mg three times given intravenously
