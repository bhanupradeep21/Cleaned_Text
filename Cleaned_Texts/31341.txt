horses compete cows forage multifaceted ruminates cattle sheep multichambered stomachs extract energy feed thus require less high quality forage leaves forbs horses evolutionarily adapted survive ecological niche dominated fibrous herbage ie low quality grass forage due hindgut fermenters meaning digest nutrients means thus horses adapted inhabit ecological niche characterized poor quality means extract less energy given amount forage also means digest food faster make difference efficiency increasing consumption rate obtaining adequate nutrition lower quality forage consumption rate blm rates horses animal unit aum eat amount forage cowcalf pair studies horse grazing patterns indicate horses probably consume forage rate closer horses however cover vast distances find water high fibrous grasses thrive may range nine times far water sources cattle traveling much kilometres kilometres mi water means reach grazing land cattle unlike cows horse incisors allow graze plants much closer ground increasing recovery time modern rangeland management also recommends removing livestockp growing season maximize recovery forage allowing livestock including horses graze yearround degrades range negatively impacts wildlife shares another concern feral horses compete water wildlife species often dominant pronghorn drought conditions causes stress impacts
