hyperacusis increased sensitivity sound low tolerance environmental noise definitions hyperacusis vary significantly often categorized four subtypes loudness pain annoyance highly debilitating hearing variety causes risk factors common exposure loud often coincident proposed mechanisms literature involve dysfunction brain inner ear middle little known prevalence hyperacusis part due degree variation terms reported prevalence estimates literature vary widely research needed obtain strong epidemiological exact numbers several people died suicide due severe consequences hyperacusis symptoms include increased perception loudness sounds loudness hyperacusis pain noxacusispain hyperacusissoundinduced otalgia annoyance andor fear response sounds people unaffected may affect one

researchers narrowly define hyperacusis include loudness hyperacusis pain hyperacusis also accompanied tinnitus latter important differences involved hyperacusis result anxiety stress avoidant behavior often response prevent effects hyperacusis include avoiding social loudness hyperacusis characterized increased perception loudness often associated certain volumes andor frequencies occur either shortterm duration weeks less year recovery less commonly longterm spanning years cases becoming permanent sensitivity often different instances hyperacusis accompanied pain known noxacusis characterized pain resulting sounds often initiated certain volumes pain immediate delayed sometimes persists extended period time following pain acute chronic often described stabbing burning throbbing aching healthy listeners pain sound typically experienced volume exceeds approximately individuals experiencing noxacusis report less improvement time fewer benefits sound therapy compared
