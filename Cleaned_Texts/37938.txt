suckling decreases ten days forty days days young tigers almost fully tigress quickly lose interest unmoving cubs considered stillborn force cubs tigresss milk rich lipids protein ensures rapid tiger multiplies weight hundred first twenty growth continuing slowly two years tigress hesitate move cubs frequently one den another protect potential predators cubs begin play one month litter usually dominant youngster usually male although always protect cubs female brings prey den eat keeping eye offspring however den kept clean meat enter den defecation urination done outside den cubs constantly licked keep clean also improves blood flow functioning cubs female alone responsible raising cubs male almost never involved although sometimes shares prey tigress tigress allow offspring touch meat forty days encourages lick chew completely weaned time eight months three months old starts leaving alone several days den hunts takes carcass animal killed unlike young lions young tigers eat mothers full tigress begins eat experiments wild captive tigers shown even hungry tigress let litter eat first tigress also protective eliminate avoid danger male tigers including father men cubs stay mothers learn hunt eighteen twentyeight months young tigers learn hunt watching mothers enjoy tracking killing dangerous prey buffalo six eight months age cubs explore terrain stalk small animals usually birds sometimes attack small deer groups age never stray meters felines notably female cheetah capture live prey young age offer offspring realtime hunting practice type behaviour much less common around one year age cubs able hunt permanent dentition tigers appears months allows become efficient conflicts prey increase around months age males first leave family circle union disturbed tigress goes estrus leaves rest reproductive strategy tiger defined rtype ie reactive strategy based birth many cubs often immature parental investment low cubs grow rapidly individuals quickly reach sexual maturity population likely vary greatly depending various factors environment quantity food etc type strategy typical rodents small tiger rtype species large animal takes two years grow adult size learning hunt also requires lot support mother offspring survive strategy allows tiger quickly recover populations even large losses one indication ability periods tiger hunting allowed records remain example fortyseven tigers shot chitawan district yet fiftynine killed area population quickly sustained casualties one longterm study tiger population growth exists conducted russia since region devoid tigers shows first tiger arrived population grew twenty individuals space twentyeight years average annual growth rate wild tigers reach sexual maturity three six years age males around three years femalescitation needed first reproduction occurs around three four years females four eight years males breeding season occur time year peak varies according geographical area late november early april india december february manchuria february april study captive tigers showed semen production quality vary estrus lasts nine days average cycle resumes every days wild compared days captivity litter lost next estrus occurs earlier average two weeks captive although possible false estrus reported ranthambore national parknote behaviour valid female estrus also known heat heat domestic cat signals presence repeated moaning roaring accompanied frequent scent marking usual tigress vocalisations frequent roars every fifteen female meets unfamiliar male first distant growling ready attack pair gradually move closer together touch moustaches courtship contact frequent tigers bite others mouths kiss rub female ready adopts typical feline position lying position called lordosis front legs extended front back legs halfbent tiger mounts halfcrouched position crush partner male penetrates female makes metallic sounding grabs folds skin back neck ejaculation possible neck grip allows partners correct position ejaculation however position dangerous sometimes leads death female couple finally tigress disengages frequently turning male attempting strike entering resting felines penis covered barbs sorts thorns trigger ovulation penetration thorns could painful female would explain violent behaviour end couple copulates several times night day mating brief fifteen thirty repeated fifty times daycitation needed interval mating varies five twenty minutes rhythm copulations becomes frequent fifth onwards reached peak third nightfall pair hunt together another male appears confrontation may involve least posturing intimidating facial expressions weaker tiger withdraws cases homosexuality male mate receptive female tiger even related mating period

captivity leads zoos use contraception regulate populations sometimes alternatively breeding centers remove cubs tigresses go back estrus produce three litters conservatory breeding helps maintain living population tigers regardless happens wild population support situ conservation programmes conduct research behaviour biology panthera tigris amoyensis south china tiger subspecies functionally extinct captive population descended six wild ancestors subject inbreeding depression resulting high juvenile mortality low order keep species alive long term zoos organising maintain genetic variability captive specimens setting breeding programmes example siberian tiger subject european breeding programme american programme threatened species siberian tiger species captivity highest risk aggression males females artificial insemination possible way breeding captive tigers main advantage easy crossbreed different individuals without force meeting two tigers another advantage would ability collect sperm wild specimen big felines semen collection usually done electroejaculation semen stored room temperature frozen ovulation must induced veterinarian example injection however artificial inseminations rarely successful possibly due poor quality feline semen percentage normal spermatozoa close sumatran tigers siberian tigersnote births obtained fresh semen intravaginanote l intrauterine inseminations latter method european sperm bank sumatran siberian tigers initiated zoological society london studies conducted hyderabad centre cellular molecular biology ccmb show motility parameters frozen sperm poorer sperm slower trajectories less flat fertility semen chance force tigers captivity sometimes reproduce felines would never encounter wild due geographical distance differences behaviour thus cases hybridisation subspecies crosses siberian tigers bengal tigers example lions confirmed hybrid felines called tigons crosses tiger lioness ligers crosses lion tigress generally sterile rare cases reproduction female hybrids tiger lion dogla legendary indian feline often cited early century result natural hybridisation tiger tigresses heavily guarded zoos surveillance cameras installed den give birth even accept presence humans medical problem detected example unborn tiger may misplaced block passage wild would mean death tigress cubs captivity possible perform caesarean section tigress tinka servion zoo saved however caesarean section makes udders painful forces zoo bottlefeed rate abandonment captivity certain breeding conditions eg
