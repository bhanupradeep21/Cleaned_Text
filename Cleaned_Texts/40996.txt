skull front shell broadened ribs proganochelys show metaplastic ossification enlarged ribs suggest endochondral rib ossifications joined second ossification instead expanded stemturtle odontochelys partially formed odontochelys believed possess underside element shell known plastron difference distinguish odontochelys proganochelys tell us evolution shell occurred relatively quickly proganochelys possess carapace upper formation shell plastron lower shell believed used protection enhanced feature survival proganochelys fits well order turtle shell proganochelys agreement
