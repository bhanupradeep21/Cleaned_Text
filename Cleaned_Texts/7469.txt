ham july january chimpanzee also known ham chimp ham astrochimp first great ape launched space january ham flew suborbital flight mercuryredstone mission part us space programs project hams name acronym laboratory prepared historic holloman aerospace medical center located holloman air force base new mexico southwest alamogordo name also honor commander holloman aeromedical laboratory lieutenant colonel hamilton ham ham born july french cameroon captured animal trappers sent rare bird farm miami florida purchased united states air force brought holloman air force base july originally chimpanzee flight candidates holloman evaluation number candidates reduced six including officially ham known renamed ham upon successful return earth reportedly officials want bad press would come death named chimpanzee mission among handlers known chop chop beginning july twoyearold chimpanzee trained direction neuroscientist joseph v brady holloman air force base aeromedical field laboratory simple timed tasks response electric lights preflight training ham taught push lever within five seconds seeing flashing blue light failure resulted application light electric shock soles feet correct response earned banana ham first great ape first animal go space many types animals left earths atmosphere however none animals could provide significant insight ham could provide one reasons chimpanzee chosen mission many similarities humans similarities include similar organ placement inside body response time stimulus similar humans couple deciseconds slower observations ham scientists would gain better understanding possibility sending humans january ham secured project mercury mission designated launched cape canaveral florida suborbital time flight ham three half year old chimpanzee fairly young prepared mission eighteen months rigorous training even something go hams vital signs tasks monitored sensors computers flight go one hundred percent planned parameters altitude speed mission supposed precise miles kilometers launch speeds topping miles per hour kmh reality spacecraft carrying ham reached altitude miles kilometers speeds topping miles per hour kmh couple mishaps led even problems ham capsule return earth ham ended landing miles predicted land extracted water helicopter could capsule suffered partial loss pressure flight hams space suit prevented suffering hams leverpushing performance space fraction second slower earth demonstrating tasks could performed hams capsule splashed atlantic ocean recovered uss donner later physical injury bruised ham however seem troubled injury appeared enthusiastic back home become slightly agitated press pictures people time understand hard missions like mind flight minutes seconds flight ham even experienced weightlessness around six half minutes able fight extreme pressure weightlessness g force speed challenges ham still ability perform tasks correctly even similar standard set earth extremely promising news scientists observing ham mission purpose mission see humans would able perform tasks needed done space end mission showed humans perform tasks nearly well space earth also good chance making back home alive able see even mishaps occurred ham flight still able come home relatively safe however still needed research longterm effects caused time space results test flight led directly alan shepards may suborbital flight aboard freedom ham retired national aeronautics space administration nasa april ham transferred national zoo washington dc lived joining small group chimps north carolina zoo september ham suffered chronic heart liver january age ham death hams body given armed forces institute pathology necropsy following necropsy plan stuffed placed display smithsonian institution following soviet precedent pioneering space dogs belka strelka however plan abandoned negative public hams skeleton held collection national museum health medicine silver spring rest hams remains buried international space hall fame alamogordo new mexico colonel john stapp gave eulogy memorial hams backup minnie female chimpanzee trained mercury program role mercury program ended minnie became part air force chimpanzee breeding program producing nine offspring helping raise offspring several members chimpanzee last surviving astrochimpanzee died age march research involving primates comprises nonhuman research chimpanzees comprise chimpanzees closely related humans often used research settings typically chimpanzees used biomedical research includes research infectious diseases cognition behavior chimpanzees social animals relocating research facilities distressing crucial chimpanzees allowed social interaction chimpanzees well forms enrichment without social interaction early stages life chimpanzees experience issues sexual maternal behavior social interactions chimpanzees raised captivity although chimpanzees excellent subjects research pose issues unlike highly used animals research like rodents pigs dogs incredible strength intellect larger typical research subjects easily restrained researchers worked getting chimpanzees cooperate terms researchers implement three typical processes using chimpanzees research habituation desensitization positive habituation used decrease fears chimpanzees example chimpanzee must transported carrier may left enclosure would allow chimpanzee acclimate new object comfortable transported apply tools used research like cotton swabs syringes however left habitats due safety reasons habituation reduce chimpanzees fearful reaction desensitization would used primarily used phobias instead introduced object chimpanzee must elicit desired response object perceived threatening main goal desensitization changing negative response neutral positive reaction positive reinforcement done help solidify actions responses chimpanzee gives processes help chimpanzees become comfortable around general research equipment personnel primates well known high cognitive emotional function one reason believe scientific testing primates unethical primates shown similar mental skills humans like problemsolving math memory similarly experience emotions like happiness sadness anxiety chimpanzees even shown signs posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd due scientific one main concerns regarding ethics sourcing primates stolen wild sold shipped various locations transportation process stressful animal small crates lack easy access food water studies shown take months animals physiological systems return normal research undergo stresses countries banned chimpanzees scientific research europe continuing pressure end use case ham seen space hero however ham faced many unethical situations ham sold united states air force ham assessed trained space flight one test ham faced decompression chambers simulated pressure changes corresponding altitude changes strapped seat locked place metal loop around neck daily flight ham electrodes placed skin rectal thermometer due valve malfunction redstone rocket delivered thrust higher anomaly triggered emergency escape rocket subjected ham jettison spent escape rocket also caused retro rocket pack prematurely lack retro rocket caused capsule reenter atmosphere excessive ham subjected gs capsule damaged splashdown settled deeper water ham experienced vast number issues flight chosen fly agreeable nature ham flight would become agitated press approached panic handler would try situate famous images show smiling capsule would appear though happy yet chimpanzees smile fear happinesscitation needed
