immune response physiological reaction occurs within organism context inflammation purpose defending exogenous factors include wide variety different toxins viruses intra extracellular bacteria protozoa helminths fungi could cause serious problems health host organism cleared addition forms immune response example harmless exogenous factors pollen food components trigger allergy latex metals also known allergens transplanted tissue example blood organ cause graftversushost disease type immune reactivity known rh disease observed pregnant women special forms immune response classified hypersensitivity another special form immune response antitumor immunity general two branches immune response innate adaptive work together protect pathogens branches engage humoral cellular components innate bodys first reaction known nonspecific quick response sort pathogen components innate immune response include physical barriers like skin mucous membranes immune cells neutrophils macrophages monocytes soluble factors including cytokines hand adaptive branch bodys immune response catered specific antigens thus takes longer activate components involved adaptive branch include cells dendritic cells cell b cells well known directly interact antigen important component strong response first contact organism particular antigen result production effector b cells activated cells defend pathogen production effector cells result firsttime exposure called primary immune response memory memory b cells also produced case pathogen enters organism organism happen become reexposed pathogen secondary immune response kick immune system able respond fast strong manner memory cells first vaccines introduce weakened killed fragmented microorganism order evoke primary immune response case exposure real pathogen occurs body rely secondary immune response quickly defend innate immune response organisms first response foreign invaders immune response evolutionarily conserved across many different species multicellular organisms sort variation innate innate immune system consists physical barriers skin mucous membranes various cell types like neutrophils macrophages monocytes soluble factors including cytokines contrast adaptive immune response innate response specific one foreign invader result works quickly rid body pathogenscitation needed pathogens recognized detected via pattern recognition receptors prr receptors structures surface macrophages capable binding foreign invaders thus initiating cell signaling within immune cell specifically prrs identify pathogenassociated molecular patterns pamps integral structural components pathogens examples pamps include peptidoglycan cell wall lipopolysaccharides lps essential components bacteria therefore evolutionarily conserved across many different bacterial foreign pathogen bypasses physical barriers enters organism prrs macrophages recognize bind specific pamps binding results activation signaling pathway allows transcription factor nfκb enter nucleus macrophage initiate transcription eventual secretion various cytokines release cytokines necessary entry neutrophils blood vessels infected tissue neutrophils enter tissue like macrophages able phagocytize kill pathogens microbescitation needed complement another component innate immune system consists three pathways activated distinct ways classical pathway triggered igg igm bound target antigen either pathogen cell membrane antigenbound antibody alternative pathway activated foreign surfaces viruses fungi bacteria parasites etc capable autoactivation due tickover lectin pathway triggered mannosebinding lectin mbl ficolin aka specific pattern recognition receptors bind pathogenassociated molecular patterns surface invading microorganisms yeast bacteria parasites three pathways ensures complement still functional one pathway ceases work foreign invader able evade one pathways defense depth though pathways activated differently overall role complement system opsonize pathogens induce series inflammatory responses help combat infectioncitation needed adaptive immune response bodys second line defense cells adaptive immune system extremely specific early developmental stages b cells develop antigen receptors specific certain antigens extremely important b cell activation b cells extremely dangerous cells able attack without undergoing rigorous process activation faulty b cell begin exterminating hosts healthy activation naïve helper cells occurs antigenpresenting cells apcs present foreign antigen via mhc class ii molecules cell surface apcs include dendritic cells b cells macrophages specially equipped mhc class ii also costimulatory ligands recognized costimulatory receptors helper cells without costimulatory molecules adaptive immune response would inefficient cells would become anergic several cell subgroups activated specific apcs cell specially equipped deal unique microbial pathogen type cell activated type response generated depends part context apc first encountered helper cells activated able activate naïve b cells lymph node however b cell activation twostep process firstly b cell receptors immunoglobulin igm immunoglobulin igd antibodies specific particular b cell must bind antigen results internal processing presented mhc class ii molecules b cell happens helper cell able identify antigen bound mhc interacts costimulatory molecule activates b cell result b cell becomes plasma cell secretes antibodies act opsonin invaderscitation needed specificity adaptive branch due fact every b cell different thus diverse community cells ready recognize attack full range tradeoff however adaptive immune response much slower bodys innate response cells extremely specific activation required able actually act addition specificity adaptive immune response also known immunological memory encountering antigen immune system produces memory b cells allow speedier robust immune response case organism ever encounters antigen depending exogenous demands several types immune response ir distinguished paradigm immune system innate adaptive nonimmune system cellular
