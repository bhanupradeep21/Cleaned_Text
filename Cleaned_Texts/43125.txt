extended female sexuality female species mates despite species female engages copulation fertile however extended sexuality documented old world primates pair bonded birds carrion extended sexuality prominent human females exhibit change copulation rate across ovarian although behaviour incurs costs females energy many researchers proposed reasons existence hypotheses include male assistance hypothesis proposes females gain nongenetic benefits food shelter exchange sexual subhypothesis hrdys proposing extended female sexuality adaptive process aiming creating paternity confusion alternative hypotheses classified maledriven claim extended female sexuality occurs due male adaptations resulting inability detect fertility status females dampen immune responses finally spuhlers hypothesis suggests behaviour may arisen incidental effect larger adrenal glands although found organisms researchers identified sexual intercourse patterns certain animals reflect extended female sexuality old world primates birds extensive research focused analysing musk shrews rate sexual period associated drop female receptivity copulation mid late pregnancy yet even time occasional mating reported therefore researchers concluded animal similar sexual receptivity across infertile fertile within primates research consistently found evidence extended female sexuality rhesus monkey chimpanzees primates mate stages ovarian cycle slight increases sexual receptivity fertile stages decreases human females considered exhibit greatest degree extended female sexuality receptivity sexual intercourse remaining constant across fertile infertile phases reproductive cycle including pregnancy lactation adolescence study women countries frequency copulation reportedly across stages ovarian cycle notable drop sexual behaviour occurred menstruation therefore women largely showed level sexual behaviour nonfertile phases ovarian cycles fertile researchers investigated effect hormonal contraceptive use women frequency sexual many contraceptives mimic pregnancy state females altering hormone levels therefore women use contraceptives experience fertile phases cycles systematic review appeared frequency sexual intercourse unaffected contraceptive use majority women although artificially created adds literature documenting existence copulation humans nonfertile order encourage mating nonconceptive periods encourage males maintain proximity males must possess imperfect knowledge females fertility status achieved concealed ovulation animals exhibit extended female review studies revealed humans females exhibit subtle changes estrus making difficult males assess fertility kung tribe instance females lack overt signals fertility continuously receptive sexual intercourse encouraging males remain provide mating outside fertile window ovarian cycle may incur considerable costs females time energy usage counteract costs male assistance hypothesis argues females exhibit extended sexuality obtain resources resources vary species include food social alliance protection female example trobriand tribe men give women gifts exchange sexual hypothesis three predictions firstly species demonstrate extended female sexuality evidence males provide nongenetic resources females prediction supported variety reviews revealing male assistance food protection provided certain mammals communally breeding birds exchange mating outside conceptive example female blackbirds solicit mating outside fertile period increased mate guarding pairbonded partner increases protection sexually coercive males ensures provision material review investigating primates exhibit extended female sexuality noted females engaging extended sexuality benefited increased offspring protection paternal care secondly order outweigh aforementioned costs mating infertile phases increase females reproductive success increasing number offspring produced current research investigated factor indirectly predominantly investigated insects example male insects deliver material benefits exchange sexual access reproductive success females increases number important note mating behaviour assessed limited extended female sexuality hence provides indirect support second prediction final prediction maleassistance hypothesis extensively investigated predicts females exhibit differing mate preferences fertile nonfertile periods specifically fertile females sensitive indicators high genetic quality increase genetic quality conversely outside fertile period females show preference males provide resources offspring species males higher genetic quality offer fewer nongenetic resources shelter food lower quality females likely choose different males evidence prediction found many different species hens near peak fertility show preference socially dominant roosters large combs larger combs reliably associated health offspring survival reliably indicate genetic quality nonfertile phases hens mate indiscriminately less regard larger comb size similar pattern emerges humans review relevant studies female preferences across ovarian cycle reveals women show greater preference masculine traits fertile phases especially short term mating intention finding occurs across variety traits masculine voices body facial features scent behavioural level masculinity acts indicator genetic quality association high similarly women show preference higher levels symmetry thought indicate underlying developmental however infertile phases women prefer males lower masculinity symmetry tend willing offer material addition impacting mating preferences females found exhibit differing mating behaviour different cycle stages analysis studies female birds showed mate outside pair bond higher rate fertile especially primary partner possesses indicators low quality genes infertile phases birds showed reductions behaviour suggesting function extended female sexuality increase genetic quality humans females show increased motivation mating males midcycle without accompanying increase copulation longterm partner especially partner less physically hrdys hypothesis extension male assistance hypothesis hypotheses argue women evolved adaptation gain tangible benefit males according hrdys extended female sexuality adaptive process aim creating paternity confusion male paternity confusion refers male unsure whether offspring genetically female mates different males points ovarian cycle whilst concealing fertility males inevitably paternity confusion paternity confusion proposed adaptive function preventing thus female successfully create paternity confusion males less likely kill offspring lack paternity certainty means run risk killing genetic offspring additionally males turn likely protect females offspring infanticide may committed adults within species uncertain paternity aim protect infants genetically researchers analysed behaviour chimpanzees particular reference copulation copulation calling type vocalisation used attract mates calls vocalised either sexual intercourse copulation calling line hrdys hypothesis may one way ensure female mate many different males possible causing paternity confusion indeed authors found probability copulatory calling female chimpanzees modulated ovarian phase female caller thereby aiding paternity confusion paternity confusion ultimately ensures woman access resources number different males resources utilised well offspring criticism hrdys hypothesis emerges evidence suggests male primates discriminate offspring offspring one study researchers analysed dna juvenile baboons conclude fathered found males selectively cared offspring particularly offspring became involved aggressive confrontations posed possibility injuries threat social standing evidently males discriminate offspring offspring others purpose female attempting create paternity confusion pregnancy stage would counterintuitive offspring born males know whether offspring future research need conducted vein investigate whether males species show ability discriminate offspring offspring others coming decisive conclusions research fairly consistent finding species concealed estrus mate stages ovarian cycle instance mating activity assamese macaques macaca assamensis researchers analysed levels progesterone monkeys order establish ovarian stage female progesterone peaks following fertile window found females concealed estrus sexually receptive entire mating season concealed estrus sexual receptivity times ovarian cycle aids paternity confusion males unsure mated female fertile period know identity father hrdys hypothesis criticised however basis female primates show extended female sexuality sexual terms hrdys hypothesis two concepts incompatible sexual swellings appear fertile phase females ovarian cycle purpose advertising fertility sharp contrast according hrdy extended sexuality adapted conceal fertility ensure mating across stages ovarian cycle aid paternity confusion one alternative explanations extended female sexuality maledriven hypothesis theoretically based male uncertainty regarding fertility status although physiological changes occur fertile period may act reliable indicators eg concentration oestrogen change female scent species evolved signals advertising fertility eg sexual therefore males unable detect fertility precision result extended female sexuality proposed male sexually selected trait males pursue sexual access throughout entirety ovarian cycle increase chances impregnating female according hypothesis females lack benefit activity due inability conceive yet coerced males engage sexual another hypothesis claiming extended female sexuality evolved benefit males interests training hypothesis shown womens immune systems attack foreign antigens found may reduce likelihood conception reduce reproductive success males however prior exposure sperm antigens dampen immune response increase chances successful conception therefore males may evolved train condition womens immune copulating females infertile periods order reduce likelihood immune system reacting sperms antigens lack exposure indeed research identified findings consistent couples used condoms trying conceive likely suffer complications preeclampsia pregnancy result womans immune system prior exposure antigens sperm nonhumans increased frequency copulation crickets shown reduce females immune response hypothesis received much criticismcitation needed example mammals experience immune system responses sperm antigens hypothesis predicts mammals exhibit extended female sexuality however species mammals exhibit sexual behaviour outside conceptive hand eclampsia virtually unique humans thus training hypothesis may relevant extended female sexuality spuhlers hypothesis standalone hypothesis extended female sexuality spuhler suggests extended female sexuality evolved byproduct adaptation females increases levels adrenal proposed secretion higher levels adrenal hormones initially selected women order increase endurance walking running hypothesis suggests larger adrenal glands may contributed development extended female sexuality also main source libido hormones increase females sexual thus extended sexuality little sexual behavior evolutionary advantage rather byproduct however hypothesis account extended female sexuality invertebrates lack adrenal additionally spuhler highlighted existence larger thyroid adrenal glands humans compared primates however empirical evidence established link hormones endurance walking adaptation extended female sexuality natural incidental effect costs extended sexuality argued selection would
