artificial womb artificial uterus device would allow extracorporeal growing fetus outside body organism would normally carry fetus term artificial uterus replacement organ would many applications could used assist male female couples development potentially performed switch natural uterus artificial uterus thereby moving threshold fetal viability much earlier stage sense regarded neonatal incubator extended functions could also used initiation fetal artificial uterus could also help make fetal surgery procedures early stage option instead postpone term scientists published two studies regarding human embryos developing thirteen days within ectouterine currently rule prevents human embryos kept artificial wombs longer days rule codified law twelve according washington post international society stem cell research relaxed historical rule said researchers could grow natural embryos days laboratory allowing researchers seek approval longer studies human embryo models banned implanted fetal researchers childrens hospital philadelphia published study showing grown premature lamb fetuses four weeks extrauterine life support artificial uterus sometimes referred would provide nutrients oxygen nurture fetus well dispose waste material scope artificial uterus artificial uterus system emphasize broader scope may also include interface serving function otherwise provided placenta amniotic tank functioning amniotic sac well umbilical cord woman may still supply nutrients dispose waste products artificial uterus connected may also provide immune protection diseases passing igg antibodies embryo artificial supply disposal potential advantage allowing fetus develop environment influenced presence disease environmental pollutants alcohol drugs human may circulatory risk immune reaction towards embryo fetus could otherwise arise insufficient gestational immune individual functions artificial supplier disposer include theoretically animal suppliers disposers may used involving animals uterus technique may rather scope interspecific pregnancyoriginal research normal uterus myometrium uterine wall functions expel fetus end pregnancy endometrium plays role forming placenta artificial uterus may include components equivalent function methods considered connect artificial placenta inner components directly external interface supplier embryo fetus may entirely artificial eg using one semipermeable membranes used extracorporeal membrane oxygenation also potential grow placenta using human endometrial cells announced tissue samples cultured endometrial cells removed human donor successfully tissue sample engineered form shape natural uterus human embryos implanted tissue embryos correctly implanted artificial uterus lining started grow however experiments halted six days stay within permitted legal limits vitro fertilisation ivf legislation united human placenta may theoretically transplanted inside artificial uterus passage nutrients across artificial uterus remains unsolved main function amniotic tank would fill function amniotic sac physically protecting embryo fetus optimally allowing move freely also able maintain

using fourteen goat fetuses placed artificial amniotic fluid conditions mother kuwabara team succeeded keeping goat fetuses system three system however ran several problems ready human kuwabara remained hopeful system would improved would later used human researchers childrens hospital philadelphia able develop extrauterine system study uses fetal lambs placed plastic bag filled artificial

fetal heart combined low resistance oxygenator closely mimic normal fetalplacental circulation closed sterile fluid environment important ensure sterility scientists developed technique umbilical cord vessel cannulation maintains length native umbilical cord cm cannula tips abdominal wall minimize decannulation events risk mechanical umbilical cord lambs attached machine outside bag designed act like placenta provide oxygen nutrients also remove researchers kept machine dark warm room researchers play sounds mothers heart lamb system succeeded helping premature lamb fetuses develop normally indeed scientists run lambs maintenance stable levels circuit flow equivalent normal flow placenta specifically run fetuses days gestation days fetuses days gestation days longest runs terminated days due animal protocol limitations rather instability suggesting support early gestational animals could maintained beyond alan flake fetal surgeon childrens hospital philadelphia hopes move testing

raises bioethical legal considerations also important implications reproductive rights abortion debate artificial uteri may expand range fetal viability raising questions role fetal viability plays
