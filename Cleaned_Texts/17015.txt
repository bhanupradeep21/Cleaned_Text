amastia refers rare clinical anomaly internal breast tissue visible nipple absent one sides affects men women amastia either isolated medical condition comorbid syndromes ectodermal dysplasia syndactyly polands syndrome lipoatrophic abnormality classified various types could result different amastia differs amazia athelia amazia absence one mammary glands nipples remain present athelia absence one nipples mammary gland amastia presumably due failure embryologic birth mammary ridge development incomplete involution people amastia often suffer ectodermal defects include various syndromes cleft palate isolated pectoral muscle abnormal formation treatment female amastia particularly includes psychological guidance breast breast tissue breastfeeding possible amastia appears one side possible breastfeed side often people amastia decide treatment amastia either iatrogenic congenital amastia divided syndromic type nonsyndromic type respectively definition suggests syndromic amastia often associated obvious symptoms common case hypoplasia ectodermal tissue hair skin defects hand nonsyndromic amastia shows defects body parts breast type amastia classified unilateral bilateral amastia unilateral amastia defined amastia involving one side breast bilateral type refers amastia sides unilateral amastia less common bilateral amastia almost nonsyndromic amastia patients typically amastia patients nipple areola missing nipple may absent one sides breasts abnormalities often associated breasts however symptoms hypertelorism saddle nose cleft palate urologic disorders dysfunction muscle upper lower limb observed sometimes several members family diagnosed amastia simultaneously carriers mutations gene mutation could cause various abnormalities amastia also deformation limb cases unilateral amastia uncommon often associated hypoplasia pectoral major muscle andor thorax bilateral amastia common often associated different syndromes therefore symptoms bilateral amastia easier various associated syndromes listed amastia particularly bilateral often related various syndromes including ectodermal dysplasia polands syndrome characterised anomalies

offspring enlarged modified sweat glands embryological development mammary glands firstly appear six weeks pregnancy form ectodermal ridges ectodermal ridge grows thicker compresses form mesoderm

previous contents causes may include intrauterine exposure teratogenic drugs dehydroepiandrosterone methimazole carbimazole treatment first bilateral amastia cause well understood far may related gene mutation since often patients bilateral amastia diagnosed autosomal dominant recessive inheritance decreasing blood flow subclavian artery may also cause amastia also caused injuries injuries may happen patients receive surgery thoracotomy chest tube placement treated radiotherapy improper biopsy severe burns breast tissue may also result congenital amastia associated autosomal dominant recessive inheritance however clinical research autosomal recessive heritage amastia mutation genes may disrupt normal process results abnormity breast protein tyrosine receptor type f gene ptprf particularly important nippleareola region development ptprf encodes protein phosphatase localize adherent junction phosphatase may also regulate epithelial cell enable cell cell interaction ptprf also responsible growth factor signalling wnt pathway homozygous frameshift mutation ptprf may cause amastia suggests causative relationship ptprf defect syndromic since bilateral unilateral amastia may attributed different pathologies appropriate managements adopted accordingly bilateral amastia occur isolation associated disorders case less understood difficult treat hand polands syndrome common cause unilateral amastia managements musclebreast reconstruction nipple areola relocation provided surgical treatment breast defects mastectomy also applicable treat patients amastia tissue expansion common technique done using either autologous prosthetic tissue autologous reconstruction different tissues may chosen according patients physical condition preferences prosthetic reconstruction may follow flap reconstruction another method rebuild breast surgically various kinds flaps choose depending different amastia often associated polands syndrome requires appropriate reconstructive procedure stabilize chest wall transfer dynamic muscle reposition nipple areola region treatment nipple areola relocation provides space secondary breast enlargement treatment tissue
