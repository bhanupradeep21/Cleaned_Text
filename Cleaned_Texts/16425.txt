reproduction procreation breeding biological process new individual organisms offspring produced parent parents reproduction fundamental feature known life individual organism exists result reproduction two forms reproduction asexual sexual asexual reproduction organism reproduce without involvement another organism asexual reproduction limited singlecelled organisms cloning organism form asexual reproduction asexual reproduction organism creates genetically similar identical copy evolution sexual reproduction major puzzle biologists twofold cost sexual reproduction organisms organisms pass sexual reproduction typically requires sexual interaction two specialized reproductive cells called gametes contain half number chromosomes normal cells created meiosis typically male fertilizing female species create fertilized zygote produces offspring organisms whose genetic characteristics derived two parental organisms asexual reproduction process organisms create genetically similar identical copies without contribution genetic material another organism bacteria divide asexually via binary fission viruses take control host cells produce viruses hydras invertebrates order hydroidea yeasts able reproduce budding organisms often possess different sexes capable splitting two copies plants ability reproduce asexually ant species mycocepurus smithii thought reproduce entirely asexual means species capable reproducing asexually like hydra yeast see mating yeasts jellyfish may also reproduce sexually instance plants capable vegetative reproduction reproduction without seeds spores also reproduce sexually likewise bacteria may exchange genetic information conjugation ways asexual reproduction include parthenogenesis fragmentation spore formation involves mitosis parthenogenesis growth development embryo seed without fertilization parthenogenesis occurs naturally species including lower plants called apomixis invertebrates eg water fleas aphids bees parasitic wasps vertebrates eg rarely domestic sexual reproduction biological process creates new organism combining genetic material two organisms process starts meiosis specialized type cell division two parent organisms contributes half offsprings genetic makeup creating haploid organisms form two different types gametes anisogamous species two sexes referred male producing sperm microspores female producing ova isogamous species gametes similar identical form isogametes may separable properties may given different names see gametes look alike generally classified male female example green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii socalled plus minus gametes types organisms many fungi ciliate paramecium two sexes called mating types animals including humans plants reproduce sexually sexually reproducing organisms different sets genes every trait called alleles offspring inherit one allele trait parent thus offspring combination parents genes believed masking deleterious alleles favors evolution dominant diploid phase organisms alternate haploid diploid phases recombination occurs bryophytes reproduce sexually larger commonlyseen organisms haploid produce gametes gametes fuse form zygote develops sporangium turn produces haploid spores diploid stage relatively small shortlived compared haploid stage ie haploid dominance advantage diploidy heterosis exists diploid life generation bryophytes retain sexual reproduction despite fact haploid stage benefit heterosis may indication sexual reproduction advantages heterosis genetic recombination members species allowing expression wider range traits thus making population able survive environmental allogamy fertilization flowers crosspollination occurs flowers ovum fertilized spermatozoa pollen different plants pollen may transferred pollen vectors abiotic carriers wind fertilization begins pollen brought female gamete pollen tube allogamy also known cross fertilization contrast autogamy geitonogamy methods selffertilization selffertilization also known autogamy occurs hermaphroditic organisms two gametes fused fertilization come individual eg many vascular plants foraminiferans term autogamy sometimes substituted autogamous pollination necessarily leading successful fertilization describes selfpollination within flower distinguished geitonogamous pollination transfer pollen different flower flowering within single monoecious gymnosperm plant mitosis meiosis types cell division mitosis occurs somatic cells meiosis occurs gametes mitosis resultant number cells mitosis twice number original cells number chromosomes offspring cells parent cell meiosis resultant number cells four times number original cells results cells half number chromosomes present parent cell diploid cell duplicates undergoes two divisions tetraploid diploid haploid process forming four haploid cells process occurs two phases meiosis meiosis ii scientific research currently investigating possibility samesex procreation would produce offspring equal genetic contributions either two females two obvious approaches subject growing amount activity female sperm male eggs altering function genes involved imprinting japanese scientists combined two mouse eggs produce daughter chinese scientists created female mice two female mice mothers unable produce viable offspring two father mice researches noted little chance techniques would applied humans near wide range reproductive strategies employed different species animals human northern gannet reach sexual maturity many years birth even produce offspring others reproduce quickly normal circumstances offspring survive adulthood example rabbit mature months produce offspring per year fruit fly mature days produce offspring per year two main strategies known kselection offspring rselection many offspring strategy favoured evolution depends variety circumstances animals offspring devote resources nurturing protection individual offspring thus reducing need many offspring hand animals many offspring may devote fewer resources individual offspring types animals common many offspring die soon birth enough individuals typically survive maintain population organisms honey bees fruit flies retain sperm process called sperm storage thereby increasing duration fertility organisms reproduce asexual reproduction tend grow number exponentially however rely mutation variations dna members species similar vulnerabilities organisms reproduce sexually yield smaller number offspring large amount variation genes makes less susceptible disease many organisms reproduce sexually well asexually aphids slime molds sea anemones species starfish fragmentation many plants examples environmental factors favorable asexual reproduction employed exploit suitable conditions survival abundant food supply adequate shelter favorable climate disease optimum ph proper mix lifestyle requirements populations organisms increase exponentially via asexual reproductive strategies take full advantage rich supply food sources depleted climate becomes hostile individual survival jeopardized adverse change living conditions organisms switch sexual forms reproduction sexual reproduction ensures mixing gene pool species variations found offspring sexual reproduction allow individuals better suited survival provide mechanism selective adaptation occur meiosis stage sexual cycle also allows especially effective repair dna damages see addition sexual reproduction usually results formation life stage able endure conditions threaten offspring asexual parent thus seeds spores eggs pupae cysts overwintering stages sexual reproduction ensure survival unfavorable times organism wait adverse situations swing back suitability occurs existence life without reproduction subject speculation biological study origin life produced reproducing organisms nonreproducing elements called abiogenesis whether several independent abiogenetic events biologists believe last universal ancestor present life earth lived billion years ago scientists speculated possibility creating life nonreproductively laboratory several scientists succeeded producing simple viruses entirely nonliving however viruses often regarded alive nothing bit rna dna protein capsule metabolism replicate assistance hijacked cells metabolic machinery production truly living organism eg simple bacterium ancestors would much complex task may well possible degree according current biological knowledge synthetic genome transferred existing bacterium replaced native dna resulting artificial production new mycoides debate within scientific community whether cell considered completely grounds chemically synthesized genome almost copy naturally occurring genome recipient cell naturally occurring bacterium craig venter institute maintains term synthetic bacterial cell also clarify consider creating life scratch rather creating new life already existing life using synthetic venter plans patent experimental cells stating pretty clearly human creators suggests building synthetic life would allow researchers learn life building rather tearing apart also propose stretch boundaries life machines two overlap yield truly programmable researchers involved stated creation true synthetic biochemical life relatively close reach current technology cheap compared effort needed place man sexual reproduction many drawbacks since requires far energy asexual reproduction diverts organisms pursuits argument many species use george c williams used lottery tickets analogy one explanation widespread use sexual argued asexual reproduction produces little genetic variety offspring like buying many tickets number limiting chance winning producing surviving offspring sexual reproduction argued like purchasing fewer tickets greater variety numbers therefore greater chance success point analogy since asexual reproduction produce genetic variations little ability quickly adapt changing environment lottery principle less accepted days evidence asexual reproduction prevalent unstable environments opposite
