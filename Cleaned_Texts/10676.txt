operant conditioning punishment change human animals surroundings occurring given behavior response reduces likelihood behavior occurring future reinforcement behavior humananimal punished whether change punishing determined effect rate behavior occurs called motivating operations alter effectiveness stimulus mo categorized abolishing operations decrease effectiveness stimuli establishing increase effectiveness stimuli example painful stimulus would act punisher people may actually reinforce behaviors masochistic individuals two types punishment positive negative positive punishment involves introduction stimulus decrease behavior negative punishment involves removal stimulus decrease behavior similar reinforcement punishments goal decrease behaviors reinforcements goal increase behaviors different kinds stimuli exist well rewarding stimuli considered pleasant aversive stimuli considered unpleasant also two types punishers primary punishers directly affect individual pain natural response secondary punishers things learned negative like buzzing sound getting answer wrong game show conflicting findings found effectiveness use found punishment useful tool suppressing behavior found weak effect suppressing behavior punishment also lead lasting negative unintended side effects punishment found effective countries wealthy high trust cooperation punishment used lot different applications punishment used applied behavioral analysis specifically situations try punish dangerous behaviors like head banging punishment also used psychologically manipulate individuals gain control victims also used scenarios abuser may try punishment order traumatically bond victim stuttering therapy also seen use punishment effective results certain punishment techniques effective children disabilities autism intellectual disabilities two basic types punishment operant conditioning punishment mirror effect reinforcement experiments laboratory animals studies children punishment decreases likelihood previously reinforced response temporarily produce emotional behavior wingflapping pigeons example physiological changes increased heart rate example clear equivalents reinforcementcitation needed punishment considered behavioral psychologists primary process completely independent phenomenon learning distinct reinforcement others see category negative reinforcement creating situation punishmentavoiding behavior even standing still reinforced positive punishment occurs response produces stimulus response decreases probability future similar circumstances negative punishment occurs response produces removal stimulus response decreases probability future similar circumstances simply put reinforcers serve increase behaviors whereas punishers serve decrease behaviors thus positive reinforcers stimuli subject work attain negative reinforcers stimuli subject work rid table illustrates adding subtracting stimuli pleasant aversive relation reinforcement vs punishment rewarding stimuli stimulus considered pleasant example child may allowed tv time everyday punishment often involves removal rewarding stimuli undesired action done child misbehave rewarding stimulus tv time would removed would result negative punishment aversive stimuli punisher punishing stimulus somewhat synonymous punishment may used mean things considered aversive become reinforcing addition things aversive may punishing accompanying changes reinforcing classic example would misbehavior punished teacher actually increases time due reinforcing effects attention student pain loud noises foul tastes bright lights exclusion things would pass caveman test aversive stimulus therefore primary punishers primary punishers also loss money receiving negative feedback sound someone booing wronganswer buzzer game show ticket car windshield things society learned think negative considered secondary punishers contrary suggestions skinner others punishment typically weak impermanent large body research shown powerful lasting effect suppressing punished furthermore severe punishments effective severe ones may even produce complete however may also powerful lasting side effects example aversive stimulus used punish particular behavior may also elicit strong emotional response may suppress unpunished behavior become associated situational stimuli classical side effects suggest caution restraint use punishment modify behavior spanking particular found lasting side effects parents often use spanking try make child act better minimal evidence suggesting spanking effective lasting side effects spanking include lower cognitive ability lower selfesteem mental health problems child side effects reach adulthood well antisocial behavior support punishment involves physical force punishment effective increasing cooperation hightrust societies lowtrust punishment also effective countries stronger norms cooperation high wealth countries highdemocratic rather one variable affecting punishment contingency defined dependency events behavior may dependent stimulus dependent response purpose punishment reduce behavior degree punishment effective reducing targeted behavior dependent relationship behavior punishment example rat receives aversive stimulus shock time presses lever clear contingency occurs lever pressing shock case punisher shock contingent upon appearance behavior lever pressing punishment effective contingency present behavior punisher second variable affecting punishment contiguity closeness events time andor space contiguity important reducing behavior longer time interval unwanted behavior punishing effect less effective punishment one major problem time delay behavior punishment behaviors may present time delay subject may associate punishment given unintended behaviors thus suppressing behaviors instead targeted behavior therefore immediate punishment effective reducing targeted behavior delayed punishment would however may ways improve effectiveness delayed punishment providing verbal explanation reenacting behavior increasing punishment intensity punishment sometimes used applied behavior analysis extreme cases reduce dangerous behaviors head banging biting exhibited commonly children people special needs punishment considered one ethical challenges autism treatment led significant controversy one major points professionalizing behavior analysis professionalizing behavior analysis licensure would create board ensure consumers families place air disputes would ensure training use tactics properly see professional practice behavior analysis controversy regarding aba persists autism community study found people autism spectrum undergoing aba appeared meet criteria posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd rate higher rate undergone aba according researcher rate apparent ptsd increased exposure aba regardless age however quality study disputed braiker identified following ways manipulators control traumatic bonding occurs result ongoing cycles abuse intermittent reinforcement reward punishment creates powerful emotional bonds resistant early studies late early shown punishment via timeout form negative punishment reduce severity stuttering patients since punishment studies timeout resulted removal permission speak speaking seen reinforcing thus made timeout effective form research also shown timeout considered punishing rather fact removal permission speak seen punishing interrupted individuals studies found effective punishment techniques concerning children disabilities autism intellectual targeted behaviors selfinjurious behaviors head banging motor stereotypy aggression emesis breaking techniques used timeout overcorrection contingent aversive response blocking response interruption redirection punishment techniques used alone combined punishment techniques however use punishment techniques alone less effective reducing targeted timeout used even though less effective reducing targeted behaviors however contingent aversive used least even though effective reducing targeted using punishment techniques combination reinforcementbased interventions effective punishment technique alone using multiple punishment
