gingivostomatitis combination gingivitis stomatitis inflammation oral mucosa herpetic gingivostomatitis often initial presentation first primary herpes simplex infection greater severity herpes labialis cold sores often subsequent presentations primary herpetic gingivostomatitis common viral infection primary herpetic gingivostomatitis phgs represents clinically apparent pattern primary herpes simplex virus hsv infection since vast majority primary infections symptomless phgs caused predominantly affects mainly children prodromal symptoms fever anorexia irritability malaise headache may occur advance disease disease presents numerous pinhead vesicles rupture rapidly form painful irregular ulcerations covered membranes submandibular lymphadenitis halitosis refusal drink usual concomitant symptoms mild severe may include herpetic gingivostomatitis infection caused herpes simplex virus hsv hsv doublestranded dna virus categorised two types predominantly responsible oral facial ocular infections whereas responsible genital cutaneous lower herpetic lesions cause herpetic although source infection around herpetic gingivostomatitis infections present acute recurrent acute infection refers first invasion virus recurrent reactivation latent virus acute herpetic gingivostomatitis primarily occurs children particularly age six years external surfaces virus short lived however extremely contagious people acquire virus via direct contact enter body disrupting integrity skin mucous membranes enter via infected secretions saliva virus replicates penetrated epithelial cell travels corresponding nerve ganglion ie trigeminal ganglion via sensory nerves endings nerve ganglion virus enters latent phase remains dormant reactivated reactivation spontaneous stimulated number factors reinfection direct effect stimuli immunosuppression ultraviolet light febrile illnesses age primary herpetic gingivostomatitis common children months years old virus also common young adults aged around immune system prevalence severity disease dependent hosts immune response virulence virus environment virus contagious potential spread quickly enclosed environments eg nurseries epidemiology living developing countries higher risk infection reported around children living developing countries positive years old population infected age adolescence developed countries children infected age significant increase disease prevalence years old percentage infected individuals ranges socioeconomic status lower income higher risk infection younger race studies demonstrated usa african americans age presented disease whereas white americans herpetic gingivostomatitis originates primary infection series events take place infection include replication herpes simplex virus cell lysis finally destruction mucosal easily enter replicate within epidermal dermal cells skin mucosal surfaces results numerous small vesicles blisters oral mucosa erosions lips eventual hemorrhagic crusting even ulceration covered yellowishgrey pseudomembrane surrounded erythematous virus continues replicate incolulate great amounts enter autonomic sensory ganglia travels within axons reach ganglionic nerve bodies commonly infects trigeminal ganglia remains latent reactivated presents herpes labialis also known cold histological appearance herpetic infection mucosa includes degeneration stratified squamous epithelial cells loss intercellular connections inflammatory infiltrate around capillaries dermis intact herpetic vesicle presents intraepithelial blister histologically vesicle caused rupture distension virally epithelial cells intracellular oedema coalescence disrupted cellscitation needed rupturing infected cells cause great number viral particles released rendering ability affect adjacent epithelial cells even sensory axons trigeminal nerve histologically infected cells eosinophilic cytoplasm large pale vesicular nuclei appearing swollen microscope cytoplasms infected cells fuse collectively forming giant cells many nuclei balloon cells multinucleated giant cells often identified smears taken intact vesicle one recently lamina propria shows variable inflammatory infiltrate density depends stage severity disease inflammatory cells also extend cowdry type bodies intranuclear inclusion bodies visible light microscopy show electron dense glycoproteins viral cowdry type bodies found varicella zoster herpetic gingivostomatitis making impossible distinguish eosinophilic bodies one way distinguish herpes virus hence herpetic gingivostomatitis varicella virus direct immunohistochemistry using fluorescent diagnosis hg much clinically based therefore imperative rule diseases present similarly bearing mind past medical history patient differential diagnoses bear mind considering herpetic gingivostomatitis aim treatment mostly supportive pain control duration symptoms viral shedding cases preventing outbreak antibiotics rarely prescribed treat bacterial superinfection oral antiviral drugs used treat herpetic gingivostomatitis aciclovir valaciclovir resistance cases foscarnet used treatment prevent individuals immunocompetent fully recover recurrent herpes labialis days however treatment antipyretics oral anaesthetics analgesics often needed severe cases herpetic gingivostomatitis mouth rinses useful relieving oral discomfort contain topical anaesthetic agents lidocaine diphenhydramine well coating agents magnesiumcontaining antacids order prevent dehydration oral fluid intake treatment options include good oral hygiene gentle debridement mouth number precautions taken reduce risk infection hsv including httpsenwikipediaorgwikiherpeticgingivostomatitis
