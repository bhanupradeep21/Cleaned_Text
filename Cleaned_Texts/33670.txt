plague infectious disease caused bacterium yersinia symptoms include fever weakness usually begins one seven days three forms plague affecting different part body causing associated symptoms pneumonic plague infects lungs causing shortness breath coughing chest pain bubonic plague affects lymph nodes making swell septicemic plague infects blood cause tissues turn black bubonic septicemic forms generally spread flea bites handling infected whereas pneumonic plague generally spread people air via infectious diagnosis typically finding bacterium fluid lymph node blood high risk may exposed case pneumonic plague may treated preventive infected treatment antibiotics supportive typically antibiotics include combination gentamicin risk death treatment without globally cases reported countries cases include democratic republic congo madagascar united states infections occasionally occur rural areas bacteria believed circulate among historically occurred large outbreaks best known black death century resulted million deaths several different clinical manifestations plague common form bubonic plague followed septicemic pneumonic clinical manifestations include plague meningitis plague pharyngitis ocular general symptoms plague include fever chills headaches many people experience swelling lymph nodes bubonic pneumonic plague symptoms may may include cough pain chest flea bites human contaminates wound regurgitated blood plaguecausing bacteria passed tissue pestis reproduce inside cells even phagocytosed still survive body bacteria enter lymphatic system drains interstitial fluid plague bacteria secrete several toxins one known cause betaadrenergic pestis spreads lymphatic vessels infected human reaches lymph node causes acute swollen lymph nodes form characteristic buboes associated autopsies buboes revealed mostly hemorrhagic lymph node overwhelmed infection pass bloodstream causing secondary septicemic plague lungs seeded cause secondary pneumonic lymphatics ultimately drain bloodstream plague bacteria may enter blood travel almost part body septicemic plague bacterial endotoxins cause disseminated intravascular coagulation dic causing tiny clots throughout body possibly ischemic necrosis tissue death due lack circulationperfusion tissue clots dic results depletion bodys clotting resources longer control bleeding consequently bleeding skin organs cause red andor black patchy rash hemoptysishematemesis coughing vomiting blood bumps skin look somewhat like insect bites usually red sometimes white centre untreated septicemic plague usually fatal early treatment antibiotics reduces mortality rate per pneumonic form plague arises infection lungs causes coughing thereby produces airborne droplets contain bacterial cells likely infect anyone inhaling incubation period pneumonic plague short usually two four days sometimes hours initial signs indistinguishable several respiratory illnesses include headache weakness spitting vomiting blood course disease rapid unless diagnosed treated soon enough typically within hours death may follow one six days untreated cases mortality nearly transmission pestis uninfected individual possible following yersinia pestis circulates animal reservoirs particularly rodents natural foci infection found continents except australia natural foci plague situated broad belt tropical subtropical latitudes warmer parts temperate latitudes around globe parallels n contrary popular belief rats directly start spread bubonic plague mainly disease fleas xenopsylla cheopis infested rats making rats first victims plague rodentborne infection human occurs person bitten flea infected biting rodent infected bite flea carrying disease bacteria multiply inside flea sticking together form plug blocks stomach causes starve flea bites host continues feed even though quell hunger consequently flea vomits blood tainted bacteria back bite wound bubonic plague bacterium infects new person flea eventually dies starvation serious outbreaks plague usually started disease outbreaks rodents rise rodent study outbreak plague village eyam englands derbyshire dales

nonspecific definitively diagnose plague laboratory testing pestis identified microscope culturing sample used reference standard confirm person case sample obtained blood mucus sputum aspirate extracted inflamed lymph nodes person administered antibiotics sample taken delay transporting persons sample laboratory andor poorly stored sample possibility false negative polymerase chain reaction pcr may also used diagnose plague detecting presence bacterial genes pla gene plasmogen activator gene capsule pcr testing requires small sample effective alive dead reason person receives antibiotics sample collected laboratory testing may false negative culture positive pcr blood tests detect antibodies pestis also used diagnose plague however requires taking blood samples different periods detect differences acute convalescent phases antibody study rapid diagnostic tests detect capsule antigen sampling sputum bubo aspirate results show rapid diagnostic test used people suspected pneumonic bubonic plague used asymptomatic people may useful providing fast result prompt treatment fast public health response studies suggest highly sensitive pneumonic bubonic plague however using rapid test positive negative results need confirmed establish reject diagnosis confirmed case plague test result needs interpreted within epidemiological context study findings indicate although people plague population correctly diagnosed people diagnosed falsely bacteriologist waldemar haffkine developed first plague vaccine conducted massive inoculation program british india estimated million doses haffkines antiplague vaccine sent bombay reducing plague mortality since human plague rare parts world routine vaccination needed particularly high risk exposure people living areas enzootic plague meaning occurs regular predictable rates populations specific areas western united states even indicated travellers countries known recent reported cases particularly travel limited urban areas modern hotels united states cdc thus recommends vaccination laboratory field personnel working pestis organisms resistant antimicrobials people engaged aerosol experiments pestis people
