health organizations advocate preventive prophylactic measures regular oral hygiene dietary modifications avoid dental dental caries completely eliminated using twin line flossers weeks oral hygiene practice keeping mouth clean means preventing dental caries gingivitis periodontal disease bad breath dental disorders consists professional personal care regular cleanings usually done dentists dental hygienists remove tartar mineralized plaque may develop even careful brushing flossing professional cleaning includes tooth scaling using various instruments devices loosen remove deposits teeth purpose cleaning teeth remove plaque consists mostly healthcare professionals recommend regular brushing twice day morning evening meals order prevent formation plaque toothbrush able remove plaque except areas teeth result flossing also considered necessity maintain oral hygiene used correctly dental floss removes plaque teeth gum line periodontal disease often begins could develop

oral hygiene important advantage electric toothbrushes ability aid people dexterity difficulties associated rheumatoid arthritis fluoride therapy often recommended protect dental caries water fluoridation fluoride supplements decrease incidence dental caries fluoride helps prevent dental decay binding hydroxyapatite crystals incorporated fluoride makes enamel resistant demineralization thus resistant topical fluoride fluoride toothpaste mouthwash also recommended protect teeth surfaces many dentists include application topical fluoride solutions part routine cleanings dental sealants another preventive therapy often used provide barrier bacteria decay surface teeth sealants last ten years primarily used biting surfaces molars children young adults especially may
