neurapraxia disorder peripheral nervous system temporary loss motor sensory function due blockage nerve conduction usually lasting average six eight weeks full recovery neurapraxia derived word apraxia meaning loss impairment ability execute complex coordinated movements without muscular sensory impairment condition typically caused blunt neural injury due external blows shocklike injuries muscle fibers skeletal nerve fibers leads repeated prolonged pressure buildup nerve result pressure ischemia occurs neural lesion results human body naturally responds edema extending directions source pressure lesion causes complete partial action potential conduction block segment nerve fiber thus reduction loss function parts neural connection downstream lesion leading muscle weakness neurapraxia results temporary damage myelin sheath leaves nerve intact impermanent condition thus wallerian degeneration occur neurapraxia order condition considered neurapraxia according seddon classification system peripheral nerve injury must complete relatively rapid recovery motor sensory function nerve conduction restored otherwise injury would classified axonotmesis neurotmesis thus neurapraxia mildest classification peripheral nerve injury neurapraxia common professional athletes especially american football players condition treated physician variety nerve types subjected neurapraxia therefore symptoms injury range degree intensity common symptoms neurapraxia disturbances sensation weakness muscle vasomotor sudomotor paralysis region affected nerve nerves abnormal sensitivity nerve point observed subjective sensory symptoms include numbness tingling burning sensations site injury objective sensory symptoms generally minimal regards touch pain heat cases motor neuron neurapraxia symptoms consist flaccid paralysis muscles innervated injured nerve symptoms often transient last short period time immediately following injury however severe cases neurapraxia symptoms persist weeks months cause neurapraxia neural lesion causes temporary block nerve conduction without transection axon conduction block classified reduction action potential amplitude short distance nerve reduction longer distance neurapraxia stimulation injured nerve results greater reduction action potential amplitude proximal site injury opposed distal neurapraxia occurs peripheral nervous system typically ulnar median radial nerves upper body sciatic peroneal nerves lower peripheral nerves myelinated relatively large spatially complex cells whose size connectivity typically make susceptible damage compromise capacity selfrepair although case microscopic evidence shown damage myelin sheath axon therefore distal nerve fibers degenerate myelin damage repaired order pathology within first hours injury follows general pattern nerve injury first physical manifestation injury focal swelling adjacent site cellular dimension fragmentation neurotubules neurofilaments occurs result pressure exerted axons swell sites compressed others leading beaded several mechanisms nerve injury including mechanical lesions ischemia immunologic attack metabolic disorder toxic agents exposure common mechanism injury nerve compression external pressure causes decreased blood flow nerve deformation nerve repeated prolonged compression nerve results ischemia ultimately edema source pressure thinning myelin sheaths focal demyelination main consequences injury lead conduction three distinct classifications degrees nerve injury two different forms mechanical nerve injury involving neurapraxia underlying causes transient nerve injury typically include brief ischemic episode form persistent forms nerve injury involve demyelination axonal certain circumstances diagnosing neurapraxia uncomfortable presence severe neuropathic pain neuropathic pain indication lesion nerve still diagnosis neurapraxia almost always followed quick complete recovery period entire nerve involved response traumatic outcome nerve repair dependent degree nerve injury circumstances site since neurapraxia least serious form peripheral nerve injury recovery treatment extensive cause neurapraxia eliminated recovery lesions nerve occurs within short time neurapraxia often treated cured nonoperative means primary goals treatment maintain proper nutrition paralyzed muscles prevent contraction antagonists paralyzed muscles consistently keep joints splint often used cases neurapraxia able maintain relaxed position paralyzed muscle splint prevents paralyzed muscle overstretched either force gravity nonparalyzed antagonists recovery period neurapraxia essential joints constantly undergo passive movement order preserve proper mobility joints kept mobile limb best possible chance benefit return nervous nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications also help reduce swelling injury site addition nonoperative remedies suggested muscles affected neurapraxia kept warm times circulation limb stimulated use heat voluntary movement returned muscle recovery treatment continues participation active exercises physical therapy occupational therapy common sources treatment early stages restoration active almost cases neurapraxia completely treated nonoperative means according medical professionals cleveland clinic athlete suffers episode cervical spinal cord neurapraxia team physician athletic trainer first stabilize head neck followed thorough neurologic inspection injury deemed severe injured parties taken hospital evaluation athletes suffer severe episodes neurapraxia urged consult orthopaedic spinal medical specialists mild cases neurapraxia athlete able remove field play however athlete still advised seek medical cases neurapraxia function nerves temporarily impaired however prognosis recovery neurapraxia efficient quick recovery begins within two three weeks injury occurs complete within six eight weeks instances function completely restored four months instance recovery period neurapraxia entirely ordered process recovery always complete fast neurapraxia commonly observed athletes involved collision sports american football athletes participating collision sports often suffer cervical cord neurapraxia also known transient neurapraxia cervical cord neurapraxia result severe collision blow crown athletes head forcefully extends compresses neck numbness stinging andor weakness arms legs distinguish cervical cord typical episodes transient neurapraxia last seconds symptoms dissipate though severity injury range transient neurapraxia lead permanent paralysis affected muscles subsequent spinal cord injury episode cervical cord neurapraxia observed however athletes experience episode transient cervical neurapraxia face approximately
