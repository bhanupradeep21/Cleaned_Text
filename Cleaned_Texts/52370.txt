cardiac fibrosis commonly refers excess deposition extracellular matrix cardiac muscle term may also refer abnormal thickening heart valves due inappropriate proliferation cardiac fibrotic cardiac muscle stiffer less compliant seen progression heart failure description focuses specific mechanism valvular pathology causes valve pathology fibrosis cardiac muscle fibrocyte cells normally secrete collagen function provide structural support heart overactivated process causes thickening fibrosis valve white tissue building primarily tricuspid valve also occurring pulmonary valve thickening loss flexibility eventually may lead valvular dysfunction rightsided heart failure following types myocardial fibrosis micrograph healthy myocardium versus interstitial fibrosis dilated cardiomyopathy alcian blue stain fibrosis either evenly distributed myocytes follows anatomic structures blood vessels interstitial fibrosis chronic ischemic heart disease stain associated relatively well organized myocardial bundles subepicardial fibrosis epicardium top replacement fibrosis myocardial infarction typically boundless dense conforming types certain diseases neuroendocrine tumor small intestine also known obsolete term carcinoid sometimes release large amounts commonly known serotonin blood may produce characteristic pattern mostly rightsided cardiac fibrosis identified echocardiography

consistent daily use extended period tends strongly predictive development drugs classically associated condition weight loss drugs fenfluramine chlorphentermine antiparkinson drugs pergolide

serotonin receptors vasoconstrictive agents long known associated pulmonary hypertension raynauds phenomenon vasoconstrictive effects well retroperitoneal fibrosis fibrotic cellfibrocyte proliferation effect thought similar cardiac valve fibrosiscitation needed drugs include ergotamine methysergide drugs also cause cardiac certain antiparkinson drugs although targeted dopaminergic receptors crossreact serotoninergic receptors well reported cause cardiac fibrosis drugs include pergolide cabergolinecitation needed guanfacine may agonist based results theoretical modeling highthroughput pergolide antiparkinson medications decreasing use since reported associated cardiac march pergolide withdrawn us market due serious valvular damage shown two independent like pergolide cabergoline linked cardiac damage among similar antiparkinsonian drugs cabergoline exhibits type serotonin receptor binding although lisuride related drug also binds receptor acts antagonist rather january cabergoline dostinex reported also associated valvular proliferation heart several serotonergic recreational drugs including empathogens mda mdma hallucinogens shown act agonists vitro significant may

valve changes suggestive early cardiac fibrosis present nonmdma using suggesting mdma use certainly potential cause kind heart damageoriginal research hand yet statistical evidence establish negate significant increases rates cardiac valvopathies current former mdma users absent studies point may speculated agonists development heart valve damage may dependent frequency duration use total cumulative exposure time case heaviest users likely face greatest risk heart damagecitation needed ssri antidepressants raise blood serotonin levelscitation needed thus may capable risks though thought risk substantially lower drugs amino acid ltryptophan also raises blood serotonin may present risk well though risk considered lowcitation needed however tryptophan derivative used treatment depression raises blood serotonin level considerablycitation needed yet reported associated valve disease fibrosis previous theoretical reasons suggested possible dangercitation needed used medicine generally administered along prevents peripheral decarboxylation serotonin ensures brain serotonin levels increased without producing peripheral side effects however also sold without carbidopa dietary supplement may increased risks taken without carbidopacitation needed cardiac fibrosis common nonhuman great apes human care term idiopathic myocardial fibrosis coined emphasize disease likely different described forms cardiac fibrosis humans etiology known though vitamin deficiency potential suspected cause least obvious treatment cardiac valve fibrosis fibrosis locations consists stopping stimulatory drug production serotonin case functional neuroendocrine tumor somatostatin analogs octreotide used reduce production serotonin tumor cells often highly express inhibitory somatostatin
