imitation latin imitatio copying behavior whereby individual observes replicates anothers behavior imitation also form leads development traditions ultimately culture allows transfer information behaviors customs etc individuals generations without need genetic word imitation applied many contexts ranging animal training term generally refers conscious behavior subconscious imitation termed anthropology theories hold cultures imitate ideas one original cultures several cultures whose influence overlaps geographically evolutionary diffusion theory holds cultures influence one another similar ideas developed isolation well popular argued role imitation humans unique among animals however claim recently challenged scientific research observed social learning imitative abilities animals psychologist kenneth kaye ability infants match sounds gestures adult depends interactive process turntaking many successive trials adults instinctive behavior plays great role infant writers assume evolution would selected imitative abilities fit good wider arsenal learned behavior disposal including toolmaking language however research also suggests imitative behaviors social learning processes selected outnumbered accompanied asocial learning processes oversaturation imitation imitating individuals leads humans collectively copy inefficient strategies evolutionarily maladaptive behaviors thereby reducing flexibility new environmental contexts require research suggests imitative social learning hinders acquisition knowledge novel environments situations asocial learning faster century social scientists began study people imitate ideas everett rogers pioneered innovation diffusion studies identifying factors adoption profiles adopters imitation mechanisms play central role analytical empirical models collective human humans capable imitating movements actions skills behaviors gestures pantomimes mimics vocalizations sounds speech etc particular imitation systems

mirror neuron system also allows people comprehend understand intentions emotions problems mirror neuron system may correlated social inadequacies autism many studies done showing children autism compared typicallydeveloping children demonstrate reduced activity frontal mirror neuron system area observing imitating facial emotional expressions course higher severity disease lower activity mirror neuron system scientists debate whether animals consciously imitate unconscious incitement sentinel animals whether imitation uniquely human whether humans complex version animals current controversy partly definitional thorndike uses learning act seeing two major shortcomings first using seeing restricts imitation visual domain excludes eg vocal imitation second would also include mechanisms priming contagious behavior social scientist distinguish separate forms observational learning thorpe suggested defining imitation copying novel otherwise improbable act utterance act clearly instinctive definition favored many scholars though questions raised strictly term novel interpreted exactly performed act match demonstration count copy hayes hayes used doasido procedure demonstrate imitative abilities trained chimpanzee study repeatedly criticized subjective interpretations subjects responses replications found much lower matching degrees subjects models however imitation research focusing copying fidelity got new momentum study voelkl analyzed motion trajectories model observer monkeys found high matching degree movement patterns paralleling studies comparative psychologists provided tools apparatuses could handled different ways coworkers reported evidence imitation rats pushed lever direction models though later withdrew claims due methodological problems original trying design testing paradigm less arbitrary pushing lever left right custance introduced artificial fruit paradigm small object could opened different ways retrieve food placed unlike hardshelled fruit using paradigm scientists reported evidence imitation remains problem tool apparatus use studies animals might learn studies need actual behavior patterns ie actions observed instead might learn effects environment ie tool moves apparatus type observational learning focuses results actions dubbed emulation see emulation observational learning article

chimpanzees brain functioned like human brain replicated experiment using children following procedure children saw done followed exact imitation animals study field social learning learning behavior observed animals specifically animals learn adapt imitation ethologists classify imitation animals learning certain behaviors specifically behaviors usually unique species complex nature benefit individuals scientists believe true imitation produced humans arguing simple learning though sight enough sustain truly thorpe defines true imitation copying novel otherwise improbable act utterance act clearly instinctive tendency highly debated portrayal imitation mindless repeating true imitation produced behavioral visual vocal imitation achieved simple reproduction exclusive imitation simple reproduction one sees rather incorporates intention animal imitation range survival purpose imitating function surviving adapting unknown possible curiosity vary different animals produce different results depending measured intelligence considerable evidence support true imitation experiments performed apes birds specifically japanese quail provided positive results imitating behavior demonstrating imitation opaque however problem lies discrepancies considered true imitation birds demonstrated visual imitation animal simply studies apes however proven advanced results imitation able remember learn studies demonstrated far positive results behavioral imitation primates birds type imitation nonprimate mammals animals proven difficult conclude solid positive results poses difficult question scientists two types theories imitation transformational associative transformational theories suggest information required display certain behavior created internally cognitive processes observing behaviors provides incentive duplicate meaning already codes recreate behavior observing results replication albert banduras social cognitive theory one example transformational associative sometimes referred theories suggest information required display certain behaviors come within solely surroundings theories yet provided testable predictions field social learning animals yet conclude strong three major developments field animal imitation first behavioral ecologists experimental psychologists found adaptive patterns behaviors different vertebrate species biologically important second primatologists comparative psychologists found imperative evidence suggest true learning imitation third population biologists behavioral ecologists created experiments demand animals depend social learning certain manipulated developmental psychologist jean piaget noted children developmental phase called sensorimotor stage period lasts first two years child begin imitate observed important stage development child child beginning think symbolically associating behaviors actions thus setting child development symbolic thinking imitative learning also plays crucial role development cognitive social communication behaviors language play joint attention imitation serves learning social function new skills knowledge acquired communication skills improved interacting social emotional exchanges shown however children autism exhibit significant deficits imitation associated impairments social communication help children autism reciprocal imitation training rit used naturalistic imitation intervention helps teach social benefits imitation play increasing child responsiveness increasing imitative reinforcement learning positive negative punishment used people children imitate either promote discontinue behavior child imitates certain type behavior action consequences rewarding child likely continue performing behavior action behavior reinforced ie source however imitation accepted approved others behavior weakened naturally children surrounded many different types people influence actions behaviors including parents family members teachers peers even characters television programs different types individuals observed called models according saul mcleod models provide examples masculine feminine behavior observe children imitate behavior observed others regardless gender person whether behavior gender appropriate however proven children reproduce behavior society deems appropriate infants ability reveal understanding certain outcomes occur therefore sense somewhat imitate perceived andrew n meltzoff ran series tasks involving infants imitate actions perceived adults gathering concluded infants trying reproduce actions wish imitate somehow revealed understanding intended goal even though failed replicate result wished imitated task implicated infants knew goal gergely bekkering király figured infants understand intended goal also intentions person trying imitate engaging rational imitation described tomasello carpenter others long claimed newborn humans imitate bodily gestures facial expressions soon first days example study conducted mailman centre child development university miami medical school newborn babies mean age hours tested see able imitate smile frown pout wideopen mouth eyes observer stood behind experimenter heshe couldnt see facial expressions made experimenter watched babies facial expressions recording results looking babies faces observer often able correctly guess facial expression presented child results calculated researchers concluded thatbabies innate ability compare expression see sense muscular feedback making movements match however idea imitation inborn ability recently challenged research group university queensland australia carried largestever longitudinal study neonatal imitation humans one hundred nine newborns shown variety gestures including tongue protrusion mouth opening happy sad facial expressions four time points one week weeks age results failed reveal compelling evidence newborns imitate infants likely produce matching nonmatching gestures response around eight months infants start copy child care providers movements playing patacake peekaboo well imitating familiar gestures clapping hands together patting dolls back around months infants begin imitate simple actions observe adults taking toy phone purse saying hello pretending sweep childsized broom well imitating using toy hammercitation needed around months toddlers start imitate parents pretending get ready work school saying last words adult said example toddlers may say bowl bowl hear someone say thats bowl may also imitate way family members communicate using gestures words example toddler say mommy byebye father says mommy went toddlers love imitate parents help imitation helps toddlers learn experiences lasting impressions made learn watching often recommended good role model caretaker showing simple tasks like putting socks holding duke developmental psychologist carol eckerman study toddlers imitating toddlers found age children involve imitation play communicate one another seen within culture across different cultures common imitative patterns eckerman found reciprocal imitation followtheleader kenneth kayes apprenticeship theory imitation rejected assumptions authors made development research showed one simple imitation skill course development changes type behavior important agenda infancy progressive imitation higher levels use signs ultimate achievement symbols principal role played parents process provision salient models within facilitating frames channel infants attention organize imitative efforts imitation imitative behaviors manifest ubiquitously evenly human individuals individuals rely imitated information although imitation useful comes cognitive learning toddlers research shown gender age differences comes imitation research done judge imitation toddlers years old shows faced certain conditions displayed motor imitation displayed verbalreality imitation boys displayed motor imitation research controversial pertaining gender differences toddler imitation renowned psychologist banduras bobo doll goal experiment see happens toddlers exposed aggressive nonaggressive adults would toddlers imitate behavior adults gender likely imitate aggressive adult beginning experiment bandura several predictions actually came true children exposed violent adults imitate actions adult adult present boys observed adult opposite sex act aggressively less likely act violently witnessed male adult act violently fact boys observed adult male behaving violently influenced observed female model behavior aggressively one fascinating observation boys likely imitate physical acts violence girls likely imitate verbal acts violence imitation plays major role toddler interprets world much childs understanding derived imitation due lack verbal skill imitation toddlers communicationcitation needed connects communicating world continue grow begin learn may mean crucial parents cautious act behave around toddlers imitation toddlers way confirming disconforming socially acceptable actions society actions like washing dishes cleaning house chores actions want toddlers imitate imitating negative things something never beyond young toddlers exposed cursing violence going child views norm world since imitation mental activity helps formulate conceptions world important parents careful say front childrencitation needed children autism exhibit significant impairment imitation imitation deficits reported variety tasks including symbolic nonsymbolic body movements symbolic functional object use vocalizations facial contrast typicallydeveloping children copy broad range novel well familiar rules early problems imitation discriminate children autism developmental disorders early age continue children autism exhibit significant deficits imitation associated impairments social communication skills unclear whether imitation mediating relationships directly whether due developmental variable also reflected measurement imitation contrary research early century suggests people affected forms highfunctioning autism easily interact one another using analyticallycentered communication approach rather imitative cuebased suggesting reduced imitative capabilities affect abilities expressive social behavior understanding said social behavior social communication negatively affected said communication involves less imitation children autism may significant problems understanding typical social communication inherent social deficits differences communication style affect reciprocal autistic individuals also shown possess increased analytical cognitive visual suggesting true impairments observing actions others may decide imitate analytically understand study shown involuntary spontaneous facial mimicry supposedly depends mirror neuron system intact individuals autism contrasting previous studies suggesting mirror neuron system inherently broken autistic automatic imitation comes fast stimulus given replicate imitation match commands visual stimulus compatible match commands visual stimulus incompatible example simon says game played children told follow commands given adult game adult gives commands shows actions commands given either match action done match action children imitate adult given command correct action stay game children imitate command wrong action go game childs automatic imitation comes play psychologically visual stimulus looked upon child imitated faster imitation command addition response times faster compatible scenarios incompatible children surrounded many different people day day parents make big impact usually children seen parent article found child simply watching mother sweep floor right soon picks starts imitate mother sweeping floor children imitating really teaching things without instruction parent guardian toddlers love play game house picked game house television school home play game see kids imitate parents anybody family article says easy pick things see everyday basiscitation needed overimitation tendency young children copy adult models actions even components irrelevant task according human crosscultural phenomenon child strong tendency automatically encode deliberate action adult causally meaningful even child observes evidence proves performance unnecessary suggested overimitation may critical transmission human culture experiments done lyons et al shown obvious pedagogical cues children tend imitate step step including many unnecessary steps without pedagogical cues children simply skip useless however another study suggests children blindly follow crowd since also discriminating adults choosing whether unnecessary action copied may imitate additional unnecessary steps novel process adult demonstrations however cases one four adults showed better technique actually copied extra step described evans carpenter children imitation selective also known selective imitation studies shown children tend imitate older competitive trustworthy piaget coined term deferred imitation suggested arises childs increasing ability form mental representations behavior performed deferred imitation also ability reproduce previously witnessed action sequence actions absence current perceptual support instead copying currently occurring individuals repeat action behavior later appears infants show improving ability deferred imitation get older especially months months infants able imitate action sequences delay three months meaning theyre able generalize knowledge gained one test environment another one test object childs deferred imitation ability form mental representations actions occurring everyday life knowledge communicative gestures
