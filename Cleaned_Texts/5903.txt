diazinon iupac name oodiethyl phosphorothioate inn dimpylate colorless dark brown liquid thiophosphoric acid ester developed cibageigy swiss chemical company later novartis syngenta nonsystemic organophosphate insecticide formerly used control cockroaches silverfish ants fleas residential nonfood buildings diazinon heavily used early generalpurpose gardening use indoor pest control bait form used control scavenger wasps western us diazinon used flea collars domestic pets australia new zealand residential uses diazinon outlawed us human health still approved agricultural uses emergency antidote diazinon developed swiss company cibageigy novartis replace formerly dominant insecticide ddt chemist paul hermann müller thenindependent geigy company discovered ddt effective malariabearing insects capability made use ddt important enough müller even received nobel prize medicinecitation needed however decades following award passed ddt found environmental danger developed countries eventually worldlevel organizations banned insecticide purposes except combating diseasevector insects leading cibageigy research alternativescitation needed diazinon became available mass use ddt production tapered diazinon issues contaminants solution alternative purification methods used reduce residual unwanted materialscitation needed processing improvement diazinon became allpurpose indoorandoutdoor commercial pest control product us outlawed residential use diazinon epa determined ability damage nervous system posed risk human health especially health chemical still used industrial agricultural purposes according german patent bureau industrial synthesis diazinon follows diazinon functions acetylcholinesterase ache inhibitor enzyme breaks neurotransmitter acetylcholine ach choline acetate inhibition ache causes abnormal accumulation ach synaptic cleftcitation needed diazinon enters body oxidatively decomposed diazoxon organophosphate compound much poisonous diazinon mainly causes inhibition conversion diazinon diazoxon reaction performed liver microsomal enzyme system requires nadph diazinon also decomposed via oxidation liver reaction reactions possible likely catalyzed nonspecifically mixed function oxidase diazoxon broken hydrolases microsomal subcellular functions within liver reaction mammals metabolize diazoxon halflife weeks insects lack hydrolysis step allows toxic substance accumulate rapidly detoxification diazoxon processed microsomal mixed function oxidase system although fully understood believed cause selectivity diazinon insects hydrolysis oxidation diazinon broken reaction needed date several methods electrochemistry adsorption enzymatic biodegradation photocatalysis tested elimination diazinon aqueous solutions removal organophosphates ope water adsorption techniques regarded one competitive methods simple operation low cost development new adsorbents high adsorption capacities important removal ope pollutants diazinon considered relatively high toxicity vertebrates common method administering diazinon absorption although inhalation possible well observed toxification symptoms conform

even longercitation needed diazinon contact insecticide kills insects altering normal neurotransmission within nervous system insect mentioned diazinon inhibits enzyme acetylcholinesterase ache

mechanism toxicity organophosphate insecticides chlorpyrifos malathion parathion effective organophosphateresistant insect populationscitation needed symptoms acute diazinon exposure develop minutes hours following exposure depending exposure pathway initial symptoms humans nausea dizziness salivation headache sweating lacrimation rhinorrhea symptoms progress vomiting abdominal cramps diarrhea muscle twitching weakness tremor lack coordination miosis furthermore studies even reported psychiatric side effects including memory loss confusion depressioncitation needed diazinon fat soluble potential delayed toxicity significant amounts diazinon stored fatty tissues intermediate syndrome generally occurs within hours exposure intermediate syndrome humans characterized difficulty breathing muscular weakness often face neck proximal limb muscles cranial nerve palsies depressed tendon reflexes also reportedcitation needed studies suggested exposure organophosphate pesticides

human poisoned show increased levels serum amylase glucose well elevated urinary diastase levels accompanied symptoms considered indicative acute pancreatitiscitation needed study found typically
