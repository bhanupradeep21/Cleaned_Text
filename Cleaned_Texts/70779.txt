fearpotentiated startle fps reflexive physiological reaction presented stimulus indicator fear reaction organism fps response elicited face threatening stimulus eg object person situation would cause someone experience feelings fear also elicited neutral stimulus result fear conditioning process occurs benign stimulus comes evoke fear anxiety upon paired traumatic fearprovoking event stimulus question usually auditory eg loud noise visual eg bright light nature startle response measures include eyeblink rates pulseheart negative impact heightened fps face neutral stimuli treated pharmacologically using psychotropic medications typically used reduce anxiety recent literature moreover implicated increased fps responses correlate posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd anxiety central brain structure fearassociated responses mediated determined amygdala located brains temporal lobe central nucleus amygdala stimulated popularly referred fightorflight response activated organism question reacts passively rendered frozen tracks becomes hypervigilantly attentive etc displays physiological reaction geared toward facilitating aggressive reaction eg increased heartratepulse rapid breathing fearinduced reactions result communication amygdala variety brain regions brain stem hypothalamus resulting variety physiological responses organism instance communication activated amygdala lateral hypothalamus results increased blood pressure dilation pupils initiation central grey via communication amygdala results organisms becoming frozen tracks

pontis caudalis insult eg traumatic brain injury brain areas inhibits display fps response humans addition distinction made concerning neural activity reflexive fps response occurs face exposure fearinducing stimulus long period time abuse combat place situation literature suggests situations fps caused activation bed nucleus stria insult brain region inhibiting fps response face longitudinally conditioned situationlocationrelated threatening stimuli extinction heightened fps response stimuli previously conditioned threatening linked activity medial prefrontal common physiological response measured gauge fps response humans eyeblink reflexive act blinking currently widely acceptedused means measure eyeblink reflex using technology called electromyographic recording emg emg provides eyeblink rate data measuring recording activity eyelid muscles using two electrodes order obtain optimal reading persons skin must cleaned dried covered thin layer electrode gel spots measures taken one electrode placed center persons forehead nose two recording electrodes placed directly underneath eye approximately two centimeters apart participant looking forward

response studies fear highly practical experimental baseline measures individuals startle response partitioned variance startle turn attributed fear lack thereof case extinction fear variable interest allowing illusory correlates variables also appear cause effect variable interest ruled several experimental climates used examine fps response eyeblink fps response typically gauged presenting participants pleasant unpleasant well neutral emotionally evocative stimuli paired loud noise flash bright lights presented stimuli replaced participants imagine emotionally evocative stimuli pleasant unpleasant neutral natures fps response typically exaggerated response emotionally unpleasant stimuli followed pleasant neutral stimuli members general addition fps response research concerning fear conditioning extinction conditioned aversion previously neutral stimulus also commonly examined studies present noise light startle probes unpleasant stimuli condition fps occur presence stimuli

naturally occurring conditioned fps resulting data studies used examine fps response light conditioned fear individuals ability break conditioned fear reactions extinction heightened abnormally overactive startle response face benign stimulisettings often seen individuals suffering posttraumatic stress disorder psychological ailment characterized maladaptive inappropriate affective physiological reactions stimuli associated previously experienced instance combat veterans often experience psychological physiological panic anxiety dissociative flashbacks traumatic experience triggered ptsd pathology reaction unexpected loud noises stimulus remind individual gunshots bombs exploding grenades individuals ptsd shown increased fps data also suggested response becomes exaggerated individuals experience people diagnosed ptsd display similar fps response threatening neutral stimuli indicating unlike suffering ptsd individuals difficulty distinguishing stimulus posing threat additionally data displayed significantly reduced ability extinction conditioned fear responses combat veterans severe chronic ptsd reduced ability fear extinction longer periods time combat veterans result pathology associated ptsd also heightened fps response also implicated following disorders falling current dsmivtr classification anxiety disorders phobia social specific obsessivecompulsive disorder converse mood disorders depression shown cause weakened fps responses diagnosed exaggerated fps responses lend pathology associated ptsd disorders anxiety disorder classification decreasing startle response humans may benefit treatment psychological disorders several forms medication acting different neurotransmitters eg gaba dopamine brain shown cause
