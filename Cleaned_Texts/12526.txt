peptide sequence tag piece information peptide obtained tandem mass spectrometry used identify peptide protein general peptides identified fragmenting mass spectrometer example collisioninduced dissociation peptides collide gas within mass spectrometer break pieces peptide bonds resulting fragment ions called bions yions mass differences corresponding residue masses respective amino acids thus tandem mass spectrum contains partial information amino acid sequence peptide peptide sequence tag approach developed matthias wilm matthias mann uses information identify peptide database briefly couple masses extracted spectrum order obtain peptide sequence tag peptide sequence tag unique identifier specific peptide used find database containing possible peptide sequences notation developed indicating peptide fragments arise tandem mass peptide fragment ions indicated b c charge retained nterminus x z charge maintained cterminus subscript indicates number amino acid residues fragment prime symbols indicate number protons hydrogens added fragment form observed ion example denotes singly charged ion analogous protonated peptide doubly charged ion analogous doubly protonated httpsenwikipediaorgwikipeptidesequencetag
