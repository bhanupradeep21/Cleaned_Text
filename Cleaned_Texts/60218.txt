irritate skin eyes mouth longterm exposure low levels occur workplace cause damage liver kidneys blood nervous finally exposure pcp also associated carcinogenic renal neurological effects us environmental protection agency toxicity class classifies pcp group probable human carcinogen pentachlorophenol may measured plasma urine index excessive exposure usually performed gas chromatography electroncapture massspectrometric detection since urine contains predominantly conjugated pcp chronic exposure situations prior hydrolysis specimens recommended current acgih biological exposure
