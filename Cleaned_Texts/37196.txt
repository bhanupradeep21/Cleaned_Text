postpolio syndrome pps poliomyelitis sequelae group latent symptoms poliomyelitis polio occurring rate latest data greater symptoms caused damaging effects viral infection nervous system symptoms typically occur years initial acute paralytic attack symptoms include decreasing muscular function acute weakness pain fatigue symptoms may also occur years nonparalytic polio npp infection precise mechanism causes pps unknown shares many features chronic fatigue syndrome unlike disorder tends progressive cause loss muscle strength treatment primarily limited adequate rest conservation available energy supportive measures leg braces energysaving devices powered wheelchairs analgesia pain relief sleep aids period prolonged stability individuals infected recovered polio begin experience new signs symptoms characterised muscular atrophy decreased muscle mass weakness pain fatigue limbs originally affected limbs seem affected time initial polio pps slowly progressing condition marked periods stability followed new declines ability carry usual daily patients become aware decreased capacity carry daily routines due significant changes mobility decreasing upper limb function lung capability fatigue often disabling symptom even slight exertion often produces disabling fatigue also intensify problems breathing swallowing sleeprelated breathing disorders sleep apnea decreased tolerance cold temperatures notable increased activity healthy years original infection onset pps amplify symptoms thus contracting polio young age result particularly disabling pps possible early occurring longlasting sign slight jitter exhibited handwritingcitation needed numerous theories proposed explain postpolio syndrome despite absolutely defined causes pps known widely accepted theory mechanism behind disorder neural fatigue motor unit nerve cell neuron muscle fibers activates poliovirus attacks specific neurons brainstem anterior horn cells spinal cord generally resulting death substantial fraction motor neurons controlling skeletal muscles effort compensate loss neurons surviving motor neurons sprout new nerve terminals orphaned muscle fibers result recovery movement development enlarged motor neural fatigue theory proposes enlargement motor neuron fibers places added metabolic stress nerve cell body nourish additional fibers years use stress may neuron handle leading gradual deterioration sprouted fibers eventually neuron causes muscle weakness paralysis restoration nerve function may occur fibers second time eventually nerve terminals malfunction permanent weakness neurons longer carry sprouting fatigue occurs due increasing metabolic demand nervous normal aging process also may play role denervation reinnervation going reinnervation process upper limit reinnervation compensate ongoing denervation loss motor units takes disturbs denervationreinnervation equilibrium causes peripheral denervation though still unclear age people experience decrease number spinal motor neurons polio survivors already lost considerable number motor neurons agerelated loss neurons may contribute substantially new muscle weakness overuse underuse muscles also may contribute muscle another theory people recovered polio lose remaining healthy neurons faster rate normal however little evidence exists support finally initial polio infection thought cause autoimmune reaction bodys immune system attacks normal cells foreign substances compared neural fatigue evidence supporting theory quite diagnosis pps difficult since symptoms hard separate complications due original polio infection normal infirmities aging laboratory test postpolio syndrome known specific diagnostic criteria three important criteria recognized including previous diagnosis polio long interval recovery gradual onset general pps diagnosis exclusion whereby possible causes symptoms neurological examination aided laboratory studies help determine component neuromuscular deficit occurred polio components new exclude possible diagnoses objective assessment muscle strength pps patients may easy changes muscle strength determined specific muscle groups using various muscle scales quantify strength medical research council mrc scale magnetic resonance imaging neuroimaging electrophysiological studies muscle biopsies spinal fluid analysis may also useful establishing pps pps treatment concerns comfort relieving pain via analgesics rest via use mechanisms make life easier powered wheelchair generally palliative care reversive therapies known fatigue usually disabling symptom energy conservation significantly reduce fatigue episodes achieved lifestyle changes additional daytime sleep reducing workload weight loss obesity require lowerlimb orthotics reduce energy usagecitation needed medications fatigue amantadine pyridostigmine ineffective management muscle strength endurance training important managing symptoms pps ability perform enduring aerobic activity management focus treatments hydrotherapy developing routines encourage strength affect fatigue recent trend toward use intravenous immunoglobulin yielded promising albeit modest proves insufficient recommend pps increasingly stresses musculoskeletal system progressive muscular atrophy review pps patients reported pain muscles joints joint instability cause appreciable pain adequately treated painkillers directed activity decreasing mechanical stress braces adaptive equipment pps fatigue facial muscles well cause dysphagia difficulty swallowing dysarthria difficulty speaking aphonia inability produce speech persons may become malnourished difficulty eating compensatory routines help relieve symptoms eating smaller portions time sitting whilst pps respiratory involvement requires exceptional therapy management breathing exercises chest percussion expel secretions clearing lungs periodic basis monitored via stethoscope failure properly assess pps respiratory involvement increase risk overlooking aspiration pneumonia lifethreatening infection lower respiratory tract especially caught early severe cases may require permanent ventilation tracheostomy sleep apnoea may also occur management strategies show improvement include smoking cessation treatment respiratory diseases vaccination respiratory infections general pps lifethreatening major exception patients left severe residual respiratory difficulties may experience new severe respiratory impairment compared control populations pps patients lack elevation antibodies poliovirus poliovirus excreted feces considered recurrence original polio evidence shown poliovirus cause persistent infection humans pps confused amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als progressively weakens muscles pps patients elevated risk sufficient longitudinal studies conducted prognosis pps speculations made several physicians based experience fatigue mobility usually return normal long period time prognosis also differs depending upon different causes factors affecting overall mortality rate exists due possible respiratory paralysis persons pps otherwise usually prognosis abruptly changed worse use anesthesia old data show pps occurs roughly people survive polio however newer data countries contacted polio survivors shown polio survivors symptoms post polio typically occurs years afterwards delays years disease occurs sooner persons severe initial factors increase risk pps include increasing length time since acute poliovirus infection presence permanent residual impairment recovery
