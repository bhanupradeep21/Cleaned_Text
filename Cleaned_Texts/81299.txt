coexistence theory framework understand competitor traits maintain species diversity staveoff competitive exclusion even among similar species living ecologically similar environments coexistence theory explains stable coexistence species interaction two opposing forces fitness differences species drive bestadapted species exclude others within particular ecological niche stabilizing mechanisms maintains diversity via niche differentiation many species stabilized community population growth must negative densitydependent ie participating species tendency increase density populations decline communities species becomes rare experience positive growth pushing population recover making local extinction unlikely population one species declines individuals species tend compete predominantly individuals species thus tendency population recover declines density reflects reduced intraspecific competition withinspecies relative interspecific competition betweenspecies signature niche differentiation see lotkavolterra competition two qualitatively different processes help species coexist reduction average fitness differences species increase niche differentiation species two factors termed equalizing stabilizing mechanisms species coexist fitness differences reduced equalizing mechanisms must overcome stabilizing mechanisms equalizing mechanisms reduce fitness differences species name implies processes act way push competitive abilities multiple species closer together equalizing mechanisms affect interspecific competition competition individuals different species example multiple species compete resource competitive ability determined minimum level resources species needs maintain known r equilibrium resource thus species lowest r best competitor excludes species absence niche differentiation factor reduces rs species like increased harvest dominant competitor classified equalizing mechanism environmental variation focus intermediate disturbance hypothesis considered equalizing mechanism since fitness given species intrinsically tied specific environment environment disturbed eg storms fires volcanic eruptions etc species may lose components competitive advantage useful previous version environment stabilizing mechanisms promote coexistence concentrating intraspecific competition relative interspecific competition words mechanisms encourage individual compete individuals species rather individuals species resource partitioning type niche differentiation stabilizing mechanism interspecific competition reduced different species primarily compete different resources similarly species differently affected environmental variation eg soil type rainfall timing etc create stabilizing mechanism see storage effect

approaches tested coexistence theory identified three main ways separate contributions stabilizing equalizing mechanisms within community argued invasion analysis used critical test coexistence invasion analysis one species termed invader removed community reintroduced low density invader shows positive population growth excluded community every species positive growth rate invader species stably coexist invasion analysis could performed using experimental manipulation parameterizing mathematical model authors argued absence fullscale invasion analysis studies could show evidence coexistence showing tradeoff produced negative densitydependence population level authors reviewed papers may claimed met criteria performing invasion analysis showing negativedensity dependence however important caveat invasion analysis may always sufficient identifying stable coexistence example priority effects allee effects may prevent species successfully invading community low density even could persist stably higher density conversely high order interactions communities many species lead complex dynamics following initially successful invasion potentially preventing invader persisting stably long example invader persist particular resident species present high density could alter community structure following invasion resident species density declines goes locally
