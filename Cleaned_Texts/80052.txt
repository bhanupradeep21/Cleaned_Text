hypercomplex cell currently called endstopped cell type visual processing neuron mammalian cerebral cortex initially discovered david hubel torsten wiesel hypercomplex cells defined property endstopping decrease firing strength increasingly larger stimuli sensitivity stimulus length accompanied selectivity specific orientation motion direction stimuli example hypercomplex cell may respond line travels upward elongating line would result proportionately weaker response ultimately hypercomplex cells provide means brain visually perceive corners curves environment identifying ends given stimulus hypercomplex cells originally characterized superordinate class visual processing cells complex simple cells whereas complex cells sensitive moving stimuli specific orientations travel specific direction simple cells responded properly oriented linear stimuli neither simple complex cells believed display endstopping likewise endstopping believed restricted higher order visual areas brodmann area brodmann area later discovered also exist primary visual cortex brodmann area geoffrey henry bogdan dreher discovered simple complex cells endstopping properties subsequently hypercomplex cells longer recognized distinct class rather subtype simple complex cells currently simple endstopped complex endstopped cells terms choice describe neurons endstopping knowledge cortical function relatively limited however towards end decade platform understanding cortex laid investigations localization function well advent singlecell recordings neurons fostered greater insights processing information sensation perception reference vision stephen kuffler discovered areas retina termed receptive fields upon stimulation would influence firing ganglion fields comprised

excitatory surround similar receptive fields discovered lateral geniculate nucleus two doctoral students kuffler lab johns hopkins university david hubel torsten wiesel tasked extending work retinal ganglion cells visual cortex hubel wiesel began recording cells cortex presenting spots light stimuli start two failed produce promising recordings cells would respond given stimuli however inserting glass slide projector strong signal immediately elicited serendipitously hubel wiesel discovered cell responding spots edges namely slide shadow placed hubel wiesel would later call cell complex cell incorporating hierarchy subsequently discovered visual processing cells included centresurround simple complex hypercomplex cells distinguishable receptive fields following initial finding hubel wiesel discovered presence variety visual processing cells unique receptive field properties lowest simplest level hierarchy aforementioned centresurround cells retinal ganglion lgn next within visual cortex simple simple cells exist within primary visual cortex brodmann area cells found specifically layer iv outgoing projections lgn receptive fields simple cells nonconcentric linear excitatory inhibitory regions exist adjacent one another thus response elicited stationary linear stimuli furthermore regions exhibit mutual cancellation antagonism produce stronger responses stimuli fill space spatial summation discerning feature simple cells responses display orientation positional selectivity means simple cell fires optimal orientation elicited responses get progressively weaker stimuluss orientation shifts suboptimally ceases fire optimal orientation positional selectivity simply refers cells receptiveness position stimulus within part excitatoryinhibitory regions accordingly simple cell receptive fields exist variety different geometries sizes possible orientation positions visual field presumed multiple concentric lgn receptive fields converge line develop single simple receptive beyond simple cells complex cells common type primary visual cortex also found brodmann area akin simple cells complex cell receptive fields orientation selective however unlike simple cells complex cells respond stationary stimuli produce sustained response stimulus must moving across receptive field motion selectivity complex cells means response elicited vast range stimulus positions substantial number complex cells also display directional selectivity movement one direction produces optimal response cortical architecture complex cells consists converging adjacent simple cells receptive fields display orientation selectivity account motion selectivity complex cells hubel wiesel postulated system simple cells elicits brief response stationary stimuli ie response adapts accordingly successive stimulations proceed across complex receptive field required elicit sustained response thereby producing motion although definitions established hubel wiesel widely accepted contemporaries initially distinguished classes along different criteria sum hubel wiesel identified simple cells discernibly separate excitatory inhibitory regions responded stationary stimuli contrastingly peter bishop used criteria included moving stimuli within definition simple addition hubel wiesels wiring schemes multiple alternative complementary architectures put forth explain receptive fields simple complex cells next cell type hubel wiesel hierarchy visual processing hypercomplex cell found within brodmann areas upon discovery hypercomplex cells defined cells exceed complex cells intricacy behavior hypercomplex cells displayed selectivity akin complex cells responding moving stimulus specific orientation specific direction furthermore much like subordinate processing cells increasing illumination particular region elicited stronger responses ie spatial summation however summation confined stimuli limited size extending beyond specific length response would become progressively weaker phenomenon termed endstopping defining property hypercomplex cells hubel wiesel characterize receptive fields containing activating antagonistic regions similar excitatoryinhibitory regions example left half receptive field activating region antagonistic region lies right accordingly hypercomplex cell respond spatial summation stimuli left side within activating region insofar extend right side antagonistic region receptive field would described stopped one end ie right similarly hypercomplex receptive fields stopped ends case stimulus extends far either direction eg far left far right begin stimulate antagonistic region reduce strength cell note hypercomplex cells also selective orientation motion direction fact activating region orientation selectivity antagonistic region thus line extends antagonistic region decrease response strength rather another differently oriented line one possible scheme wiring hypercomplex cells could comprise excitatory input complex cell within activating region inhibitory input complex cells outlying antagonistic shortly hubel wiesel included hypercomplexity version visual processing hierarchy notion class hypercomplex cells contended geoffrey henry bogdan dreher discovered simple complex cells brodmann area exhibited endstopping rather characterizing endstopping exclusive superordinate class
