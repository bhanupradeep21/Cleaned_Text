precedence effect law first wavefront binaural psychoacoustical effect concerning sound reflection perception echoes two versions sound presented separated sufficiently short time delay listeners echo threshold listeners perceive single auditory event perceived spatial location dominated location firstarriving sound first wave front lagging sound also affect perceived location however effect mostly suppressed firstarriving sound haas effect described helmut haas phd term haas effect often loosely taken include precedence effect underlies joseph henry published limit perceptibility direct reflected sound law first wavefront described named lothar precedence effect described named wallach et showed two identical sounds presented close succession heard single fused sound experiments fusion occurred lag two sounds range ms clicks ms complex sounds speech piano music lag longer second sound heard echo additionally wallach et al demonstrated successive sounds coming sources different locations heard fused apparent location perceived sound dominated location sound reached ears first ie firstarriving wavefront secondarriving sound small albeit measurable effect perceived location fused sound designated phenomenon precedence effect noted explains sound localization possible typical situation sounds reverberate walls furniture like thus providing multiple successive stimuli also noted precedence effect important factor perception stereophonic sound wallach et al systematically vary intensities two sounds although cited research langmuir et suggested secondarriving sound least db louder first precedence effect breaks haas effect derives paper helmut haas examined perception speech affected presence single coherent sound create anechoic conditions experiment carried rooftop freestanding building another test carried room reverberation time test signal recorded speech emitted two similar loudspeakers locations left right distance listener haas found humans localize sound sources direction first arriving sound despite presence single reflection different direction cases single auditory event perceived reflection arriving later ms direct sound increases perceived level spaciousness precisely perceived width sound source single reflection arriving delay ms db louder direct sound without perceived secondary auditory event ie sound like echo time span varies reflection level direct sound coming direction listener facing reflections direction significant effect results reflections higher frequencies attenuated echo suppression continues occur even delay sounds somewhat longer increased room reverberation time also expands time span available echo precedence effect occurs subsequent wave fronts arrive ms ms later first wave front range signal dependent speech precedence effect disappears delays ms music precedence effect still occur delays approaching twoclick experiments localization effects include aspects summing localization localization dominance lag discrimination suppression last two generally considered aspects precedence time delays ms speech ms music delayed sound perceived echo firstarriving sound sound direction localized separately correctly time delay perceiving echoes depends signal characteristics signals impulse characteristics echoes perceived delays ms signals nearly constant amplitude threshold perceiving echo enhanced time differences seconds special appearance precedence effect haas effect haas showed precedence effect appears even level delayed sound db higher level first wave front case precedence effect works delays ms precedence effect important hearing enclosed spaces help effect remains possible determine direction sound source eg direction speaker even presence wall reflections haass findings applied sound reinforcement systems public address systems signal loudspeakers placed distant locations stage may delayed electronically amount equal time sound takes travel air stage distant location plus milliseconds played level db louder sound reaching location directly stage first arrival sound source stage determines perceived localization whereas slightly later sound delayed loudspeakers simply increases perceived sound level without negatively affecting localization configuration listener localize sound direction direct sound benefit higher sound level enhanced precedence effect employed increase perception ambience playback stereo two speakers placed left right listener addition two main speakers fed program material delayed milliseconds randomphase ambience components sound become sufficiently decorrelated localized effectively extracts recordings existing ambience leaving foreground direct sounds still appearing come effect taken
