abbreviated etbr also abbreviation bromoethane avoid confusion laboratories used abbreviation ethbr salt exposed ultraviolet light fluoresce orange colour intensifying almost binding dna name homidium commonly used since veterinary medicine treat trypanosomiasis high incidence antimicrobial resistance makes treatment impractical areas related isometamidium chloride used instead despite reputation mutagen tests shown low mutagenicity without metabolic fluorescent compounds ethidium bromide aromatic core heterocyclic moiety generically known phenanthridine isomer fluorescent dye acridine absorption maxima etbr aqueous solution nm nm correspond ultraviolet light result excitation etbr emits orange light wavelength ethidium bromides intense fluorescence binding dna probably due rigid

efficient fluorescence quencher removal water molecules allows ethidium fluorescecitation needed ethidium bromide commonly used detect nucleic acids molecular biology laboratories case dna usually doublestranded dna pcrs restriction digests etc singlestranded rna also detected since usually folds back onto thus provides local base pairing dye intercalate detection typically involves gel containing nucleic acids placed ultraviolet lamp since ultraviolet light harmful eyes skin gels stained ethidium bromide usually viewed indirectly using enclosed camera fluorescent images recorded photographs direct viewing needed viewers eyes exposed skin protected laboratory intercalating properties long used minimize chromosomal condensation culture exposed mitotic arresting agents harvest resulting slide preparations permit higher degree resolution thus confidence determining structural integrity chromosomes upon microscopic analysiscitation needed ethidium bromide also used dna
