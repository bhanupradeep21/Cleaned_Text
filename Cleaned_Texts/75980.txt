deinosuchus ˌdaɪnəˈsjuːkəs extinct genus alligatoroid crocodilian related modern alligators caimans lived million years ago late cretaceous period name translates terrible crocodile derived greek deinos δεινός terrible soukhos σοῦχος crocodile first remains discovered north carolina united states genus named described additional fragments discovered later incorporated influential though inaccurate skull reconstruction american museum natural history knowledge deinosuchus remains incomplete better cranial material found recent years expanded scientific understanding massive predator although deinosuchus far larger modern crocodile alligator largest adults measuring meters ft total length overall appearance fairly similar smaller relatives large robust teeth built crushing back covered thick hemispherical osteoderms one study indicated deinosuchus may lived years growing rate similar modern crocodilians maintaining growth much longer time deinosuchus fossils described us states including texas montana many along east coast fossils also found northern mexico lived sides western interior seaway opportunistic apex predator coastal regions eastern north america deinosuchus reached largest size western habitat eastern populations far abundant opinion remains divided whether two populations represent separate species deinosuchus probably capable killing eating large dinosaurs may also fed upon sea turtles fish aquatic terrestrial prey despite large size overall appearance deinosuchus considerably different modern crocodilians deinosuchus alligatorlike broad snout slightly bulbous premaxilla contained four teeth pair nearest tip snout significantly smaller maxilla main toothbearing bone upper jaw contained tooth count dentary toothbearing bone lower jaw

deinosuchus could probably walked land much like modernday large size deinosuchus generally recognized despite fragmentary nature fossils assigned however estimates large really varied considerably

preferred estuarine aguja formation texas largest specimens deinosuchus found massive predators probably inhabited brackishwater although specimens also found marine deposits clear whether deinosuchus ventured ocean like modernday saltwater crocodiles remains might displaced animals deinosuchus described conspicuous component purportedly distinct biome occupying southern half late cretaceous north edwin h colbert roland bird speculated deinosuchus may well hunted devoured dinosaurs colbert restated hypothesis confidently certainly crocodile must predator dinosaurs otherwise would overwhelmingly gigantic hunted water giant theropods could david r schwimmer proposed several hadrosaurid tail vertebrae found near big bend national park show evidence deinosuchus tooth marks strengthening hypothesis deinosuchus fed dinosaurs least christopher brochu agreed deinosuchus probably dined ornithopods time deinosuchus generally thought employed hunting tactics similar modern crocodilians ambushing dinosaurs terrestrial animals waters edge submerging study suggested would able perform death roll like modern schwimmer g dent williams proposed deinosuchus may preyed marine deinosuchus would probably used robust flat teeth near back jaws crush turtle sidenecked sea turtle bothremys especially common eastern habitat deinosuchus several shells found bite marks likely inflicted giant schwimmer concluded feeding patterns deinosuchus likely varied geographic location smaller deinosuchus specimens eastern north america would opportunistic feeders ecological niche similar modern american alligator would consumed marine turtles large fish smaller bigger less common deinosuchus lived texas montana might specialized hunters capturing eating large schwimmer noted theropod dinosaurs deinosuchuss eastern range approached size indicating massive crocodilian could regions apex study gregory erickson christopher brochu suggested growth rate deinosuchus comparable modern crocodilians maintained far longer time estimates based growth rings dorsal osteoderms various specimens indicated deinosuchus might taken years reach full adult size oldest individuals may lived years completely different growth strategy large dinosaurs reached adult size much quickly shorter lifespans according erickson fullgrown deinosuchus must seen several generations dinosaurs come schwimmer noted erickson brochus assumptions growth rates valid osteodermal rings reflect annual periods modern crocodilians according schwimmer growth ring patterns observed could affected variety factors including migrations prey wetdry seasonal climate variations oceanic circulation nutrient cycles ring cycle biannual rather annual might indicate deinosuchus grew faster modern crocodilians
