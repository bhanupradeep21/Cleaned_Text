choroidal nevus plural nevi type eye neoplasm classified choroidal tumors type benign noncancerous melanocytic choroidal nevus described unambiguous pigmented blue greengray choroidal lesion found front eye around rear end nevi usually darkly pigmented tumors comprise melanocytes dr gass one leading specialists eye diseases speculates choroidal nevus grows small cells resting hyperplastic lesions exhibits growth cases choroidal nevus asymptomatic disease however serious conditions adverse symptoms observed choroidal nevus usually diagnosed ophthalmic eye examination specialized technologies photographic imaging ophthalmoscopy ultrasonography ocular coherence tomography oct choroidal nevi transform choroidal ocular melanoma becoming cancerous therefore crucial differentiate noncancerous choroidal nevus lethal melanoma prevalence choroidal nevus among united states adult population years old terms ethnicity cohort study done united states reported prevalence choroidal nevus found whites chinese blacks hispanics however difference chinese blacks hispanics statistically significant prevalence choroidal nevus vary sex vary age incidence nevi discovered highest people ages lowest people aged hence likely higher prevalence disease people comparatively younger another study prevalence choroidal nevus among female population investigated role obesity reproductive factors development disease among premenopausal women risk developing nevus shown four times higher first child compared first child moreover among postmenopausal females prevalence obese females twice nonobese location nevi plays role determining whether disease associated symptoms unusual circumstances nevus located center retina blurred result choroidal nevus becomes severe cause leakage

statistically proven relatively lower risk transforming melanoma thus predictive factor indicators halo nevus include absence subretinal fluid orange pigment thickness level less mm well tumor margin remote optic giant choroidal nevus described one basal diameter larger variant contributes choroidal due large basal diameter thickness easily mistaken diagnosed choroidal however potential grow

melanomas thus patients giant nevus require close monitoring choroidal nevus drusen considered sign chronicity since drusen take years develop drusen composed lipids actually indicator tumour benign nevus opposed cancerous nevi imaged oct found naturally nevi occur frequently research shows united states transform melanomas patients particularly high risk following observed three melanoma risk factors observed risk choroidal nevus growing melanoma greater pathophysiology choroidal melanoma type uveal melanoma well however several molecular mechanisms cytogenetics may involved process

transformation melanoma considered several general risk factors identified potentially relevant malignant transformation include light iris color generally lower levels melanin light untanned skin

patients becoming stable mid late unless choroidal nevus progressed symptomatic form discovered normal eye nevus identified distinctive appearance thickness approximately color brown slate gray edge nevus blends entirely possible one nevus eye nevi diagnostic testing carried ultrasound fluorescein angiography oct ultrasound fall ophthalmic diagnostic allowing practitioners take direct photographs eye surfaces retinal pigment epithelium rpe captured well using autofluorescence light waves detect bscan ultrasound provides practitioner approximate size tumor addition vertical horizontal ascan determines amount internal hand fluorescein angiography aid recognizing whether tumor developed circulation optomap common diagnostic tool recognizing choroidal nevus takes image nevus melanoma using two different lasers red using green laser view retina nevus would invisible melanoma would hence optomap distinguish nevus melanoma artificial intelligence ai may potential clinical diagnosis choroidal nevus melanoma achieved machine learning whereby large dataset imaging photographs sizes shapes location nevi used would improve detection accuracy well design treatment nevi since typical choroidal nevi adverse effects treatment required additionally safe methods remove nevi eye nonetheless annual evaluations checkups ophthalmologists necessary american academy ophthalmology recommends
