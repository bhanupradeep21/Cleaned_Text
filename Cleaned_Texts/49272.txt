torrent poisoning intentionally sharing corrupt data data misleading file names using bittorrent protocol practice uploading fake torrents sometimes carried antiinfringement organisations attempt prevent peertopeer sharing copyrighted content gather ip addresses decoy insertion content pollution method corrupted versions particular file inserted network deters users finding uncorrupted version also increases distribution corrupted malicious user pollutes file converting another format indistinguishable uncorrupted files eg may similar metadata order entice users download decoys malicious users may make corrupted file available via high bandwidth method consumes large amount computing resources since malicious server must respond large quantity result queries return principally corrupted copies blank file executable files infected known cases company created special version game published file sharing services advertising cracked undocumented hidden functionality making impossible win variant game method targets index found file sharing systems index allows users locate ip addresses desired content thus method attack makes searching difficult network users attacker inserts large amount invalid information index prevent users finding correct invalid information could include random content identifiers fake ip addresses port user attempts download corrupted content server fail establish connection due large volume invalid information users waste time trying establish connection bogus users thus increasing average time takes download index poisoning attack requires less bandwidth server resources decoy insertion furthermore attacker transfer files respond requests reason index poisoning requires less effort methods companies disrupt file sharing behalf content providers create software order launch attacks mediadefender written program directs users nonexistent locations via bogus search results users typically select one top five search results method requires users persevere beyond initial failed attempts locate desired idea many users simply give search frustration method attack prevents distributors serving users thus slows file sharing attackers servers constantly connect desired file floods providers upstream bandwidth prevents users downloading selective content poisoning also known proactive discriminatory content poisoning attempts detect copyright violators allowing legitimate users continue enjoy service provided open network protocol identifies peer endpoint address file index format changed incorporate digital signature peer authentication protocol establish legitimacy peer downloads uploads files using identity based signatures system enables peer identify infringing users without need communication central authority protocol sends poisoned chunks detected users requesting copyright protected file legitimate users simply deny download requests known infringers latter usually accumulate clean chunks colluders paid peers share content others without authorization however method content poisoning forces illegitimate users discard even clean chunks prolonging download voluntary collective licensing open music model theoretical systems users pay subscription fee access filesharing network able legally download distribute copyright selective content poisoning could potentially used limit access legitimate subscribed users providing poisoned content nonsubscribed users attempt illegitimately use eclipse attack also known routingtable poisoning instead poisoning network targets requesting peers directly attack attacker takes peers routing table unable communicate peer except attacker attacker replicates whole network targeted peer manipulate number ways example attacker specify search results returned attacker also modify file comments peers requests also directed back network attacker also modified also checks data randomly errors found attack attacker joins targeted swarm establishes connections many peers however attacker never provides chunks authentic otherwise peers common version attack chatty peer attack attacker establishes connection targeted peers via required handshake message followed message advertising number available chunks attacker never provide chunks also repeatedly resend handshake message attacks prevent downloads essentially peer wastes time dealing attacker instead downloading chunks several reasons content providers copyright holders may choose torrent poisoning method guarding content first injecting decoys content providers normally monitor bittorrent network signs content illegally shared includes watching variations files files compressed formats process expensive timeconsuming result poisoning continued first months following leak second also unlikely torrent poisoning successful disrupting every illegal download instead aim content providers make illegal downloads statistically less likely clean complete hope users discouraged illegally downloading copyright material content providers copyright holders may decide financial outlay worth end result efforts methods attack described particularly effective measure effective countermeasures evolved measures must combined order significant impact illegal peertopeer filesharing using bittorrent protocols torrent files
