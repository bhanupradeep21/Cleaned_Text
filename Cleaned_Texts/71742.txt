neurosteroids also known neuroactive steroids endogenous exogenous steroids rapidly alter neuronal excitability interaction ligandgated ion channels cell surface term neurosteroid coined french physiologist étienneémile baulieu refers steroids synthesized term neuroactive steroid refers steroids synthesized brain synthesized endocrine gland reach brain bloodstream effects brain term neuroactive steroids first coined steven paul robert purdy addition actions neuronal membrane receptors steroids may also exert effects gene expression via nuclear steroid hormone receptors neurosteroids wide range potential clinical applications sedation treatment traumatic brain ganaxolone synthetic analog endogenous neurosteroid allopregnanolone investigation treatment based differences activity structure neurosteroids broadly categorized several different major neurosteroids exert inhibitory actions neurotransmission act positive allosteric modulators gabaa receptor especially δ subunitcontaining isoforms possess particular order antidepressant anxiolytic stressreducing sedative cognitive memoryimpairingcitation needed anesthetic anticonvulsant neuroprotective neurogenic major examples include tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone thdoc androstane cholestane cholesterol pregnanes pregnanolone eltanolone allopregnanolone neurosteroids excitatory effects neurotransmission act potent negative allosteric modulators gabaa receptor weak positive allosteric modulators nmda receptor andor agonists receptor mostly antidepressant anxiogenic cognitive memoryenhancing convulsant neuroprotective neurogenic major examples include pregnanes pregnenolone sulfate ps epipregnanolone isopregnanolone sepranolone androstanes dehydroepiandrosterone dhea prasterone dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate dheas prasterone sulfate cholestane nmda receptorselective pheromones neurosteroids influence brain activity notably hypothalamic function via activation vomeronasal receptor possible human pheromones include androstanes androstadienol androstadienone androstenol androstenone estrane estratetraenol certain endogenous steroids corticosterone also neurosteroids however unlike listed neurosteroids modulate gabaa nmda receptors instead affect various cell surface receptors nongenomic targets also many endogenous steroids including pregnenolone progesterone corticosterone deoxycorticosterone dhea testosterone metabolized neurosteroids effectively functioning socalled proneurosteroids neurosteroids synthesized cholesterol converted pregnenolone endogenous steroids neurosteroids produced brain local synthesis conversion peripherallyderived adrenal steroids gonadal steroids accumulate especially myelinating glial cells cholesterol steroidal precursors imported peripheral type dehydrogenase involved biosynthesis inhibitory neurosteroids dehydrogenase hydroxysteroid sulfotransferases involved excitatory neurosteroid major known biological functions neurosteroids include modulation neural learning memory seizure well responses stress anxiety neurosteroids also appear play important role various sexuallydimorphic behaviors emotional acute stress elevates levels inhibitory neurosteroids like allopregnanolone neurosteroids known counteract many effects similar case endorphins released response stress physical pain counteract negative subjective effects states suggested one biological functions neuromodulators may help maintain emotional chronic stress associated diminished levels allopregnanolone altered

womens conditions including premenstrual syndrome pms premenstrual dysphoric disorder pmdd postpartum depression ppd postpartum psychosis catamenial addition thought changes neurosteroid levels may involved changes mood anxiety sexual desire occur puberty sexes menopause elevated levels inhibitory neurosteroids namely allopregnanolone produce paradoxical effects negative mood anxiety irritability appears neurosteroids like positive allosteric modulators gabaa receptor benzodiazepines barbiturates possess biphasic ushaped actions moderate levels range nml total alloprogesterone approximately equivalent luteal phase levels inhibit activity gabaa receptor lower higher concentrations facilitate activity several synthetic neurosteroids used sedatives purpose general anaesthesia carrying surgical procedures best known alphaxolone alphadolone hydroxydione minaxolone first introduced hydroxydione esterified derivative hydroxydione proved useful anaesthetic drug good safety profile painful irritating injected probably due poor water solubility led development newer neuroactive steroids next drug family marketed mixture alphaxolone alphadolone known althesin withdrawn human use due rare serious toxic reactions still used veterinary medicine next neurosteroid anaesthetic introduced human medicine newer drug minaxolone around three times potent althesin retains favourable safety profile without toxicity problems seen althesin however drug also ultimately withdrawn problems clinical use animal studies suggested potential carcinogenicity since alternative agents available felt possible risk outweighed benefit keeping drug market neurosteroid ganaxolone analog progesterone metabolite allopregnanolone extensively investigated animal models currently clinical trials treatment epilepsy neurosteroids including ganaxolone broad spectrum activity animal may advantages gabaa receptor modulators notably benzodiazepines tolerance appear occur extended randomized placebo controlled phase clinical trial orally administered ganaxolone adults partial onset seizure demonstrated treatment safe well tolerated drug continued demonstrate efficacy open label extension data nonclinical studies suggest ganaxolone may low risk use pregnancy addition use treatment epilepsy drug potential treatment broad range neurological psychiatric conditions proofofconcept studies currently underway posttraumatic stress disorder fragile x syndrome ganaxolone approved medical use united states march researchers suggested use socalled neurosteroid replacement therapy way

use indications treatment brain spinal cord injury depressive certain antidepressant drugs fluoxetine fluvoxamine generally thought affect depression acting selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssris also found normalize levels certain neurosteroids frequently deficient depressed patients doses inactive affecting reuptake serotonin suggests actions involving neurosteroids may also play

similar neurosteroids factors affect ability individual benzodiazepines alter neurosteroid levels may depend upon whether individual benzodiazepine drug interacts tspo benzodiazepines may also inhibit
