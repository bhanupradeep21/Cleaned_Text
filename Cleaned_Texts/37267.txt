chlorocebus genus mediumsized primates family old world monkeys six species currently recognized although people classify single species numerous subspecies either way make entirety genus chlorocebus confusingly terms vervet monkey green monkey sometimes used refer whole genus chlorocebus though also refer precisely species chlorocebus pygerythrus chlorocebus sabaeus respectively neither type
