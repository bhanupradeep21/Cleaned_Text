theodore holmes bullock may december one founding fathers neuroethology career spanning nearly seven decades american academic esteemed pioneering influential neuroscientist examining physiology evolution nervous system across organizational levels champion comparative approach studying species nearly major animal annelids arthropods echinoderms molluscs bullock discovered pit organ pit vipers electroreceptors weakly electric fish well electrosensory animals work jamming avoidance response electric fish work later carried walter heiligenberg excellent example motor programs integrated incoming sensory information generating behavior pattern response stimulus bullock appealed scientific community look beyond established paradigms neuroscience well consider ecology animal endeavoring understand nervous system wrote neuroscience part biology specifically zoology suffers tunnel vision unless continuous ethology ecology evolution quest go beyond descriptive account nervous system bullock studied many different unrelated species believed comparative approach would reveal general principles nervous system offer insights nervous system properties anatomical physiological chemical relevant observed differences speciesspecific traits well specific traits relevant observed differences nervous systems resulting discoveries helped explain various properties nervous systems one influential review wrote comparative neuroscience likely reach insights novel constitute revolutions understanding structure functions ontogeny evolution nervous systems without due consideration neural behavioral correlates differences higher taxa closely related families species sexes stages expect understand nervous systems one colleague described bullock adventurous scientific explorer continually seeking undiscovered phenomena new unifying principles end life age bullock remained active influential presence fields neuroscience neuroethology second four children bullock born may nanking china parents amasa ruth bullock n√©e beckwith presbyterian missionaries arrived china bullock thirteen family returned united states settled southern california bullock life neuroscientist began histological studies brain degeneration performed still high school time also studied marine biology courses pomona college marine biological laboratory received associate arts degree pasadena junior college ba university california berkeley studied zoology bullock married martha runquist remained married end life years later two children christine steve bullocks doctorate work performed uc berkeley supervision f light focused organization nervous system anatomy physiology acorn worms generally considered sister group chordates marked beginning studies simple nervous systems used explore neural mechanisms work together produce output response stimulus physiological behavioral level time importance comparative studies also became apparent believed fully understand brain nervous system work one must search commonalities also differences nervous systems across different taxonomic levels earning phd accepted postdoctoral fellowship later teaching position yale four years yale bullock worked marine biological laboratory mbl woods hole summers taught invertebrate zoology famous physiology course studied nerve nets coelenterates structure physiology giant nerve fibers annelids studies nerve nets lead one first experimentalists understand value importance computational techniques modeling data analysis bullock accepted faculty position university missouri taught medical students anatomy physiology two years later joined faculty university california los angeles ucla remained next twenty years time helped pioneer field comparative integrative neurobiology one series famous experiments cardiac ganglion lobsters bullock demonstrated neurons communicate via action potential chemical synapse nonsynaptic interactions without impulses today know type electrical interaction mediated gap junctions idea electrical synapses couple groups cells functional units lead bullock lifelong interest field potentials generated summated electrical activity millions brain cells bullock respected teacher taught many courses ucla zoology advanced invertebrate biology spent summers woods hole director invertebrate zoology course bullock left ucla join university california san diego ucsd school medicine new department neurosciences also served chairman neurobiology unit scripps institution oceanography la jolla ca one reason move ucsd hoped bridge gap marine biology medicine bullock published vast array papers species previously mentioned also studied nervous systems corals sea urchins spirunculids limulus aplysia starfish rattlesnakes rays sharks porpoises sea lions cuttlefish catfish sloths manatees salamanders frogs turtles hagfish crayfish tuna ratfish bats crabs octopodes snakes rats humans together adrian horridge bullock published
