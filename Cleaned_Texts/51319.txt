common cranial nerve injury associated first aims management identify treat cause condition possible relieve patients symptoms present children rarely appreciate diplopia aim maintain binocular vision thus promote proper visual developmentcitation needed thereafter period observation around months appropriate intervention palsies recover without need surgerycitation needed commonly achieved use fresnel prisms slim flexible plastic prisms attached patients glasses plano glasses patient refractive error serve compensate inward misalignment affected eye unfortunately prism correct fixed degree misalignment affected individuals degree misalignment vary depending upon direction gaze may still experience diplopia looking affected side prisms available different strengths appropriate one selected patient however patients large deviations thickness prism required may reduce vision much binocularity achievable cases may appropriate simply occlude one eye temporarily occlusion would never used infants though risk inducing stimulus deprivation amblyopia experience diplopiacitation needed management options initial stage include use botulinum toxin injected ipsilateral medial rectus botulinum toxin therapy strabismus use bt serves number purposes firstly helps prevent contracture medial rectus might result acting unopposed long period secondly reducing size deviation temporarily might allow prismatic correction used previously possible thirdly removing pull medial rectus may serve reveal whether palsy partial complete allowing residual movement capability lateral rectus operate thus toxin works therapeutically helping reduce symptoms enhancing prospects fuller ocular movements postoperatively diagnostically helping determine type operation appropriate patientcitation needed cochrane review interventions eye movement disorders due acquired brain last updated june identified one study botulinum toxin acute sixth nerve cochrane review authors judged lowcertainty evidence study masked estimate effect imprecise adequate recovery occurred period observation prism management occlusion botulinum toxin may considered surgical treatment often recommendedcitation needed residual esotropia small patient unfit unwilling surgery prisms incorporated glasses provide permanent symptom relief deviation large prismatic correction effective permanent occlusion may option unfit unwilling surgerycitation needed procedure chosen depend upon degree function remains affected lateral rectus complete paralysis preferred option perform vertical muscle transposition procedures jensens hummelheims whole muscle transposition aim using functioning inferior superior recti gain degree alternative approach operate lateral medial recti affected eye aim stabilising midline thus giving single vision straight ahead potentially diplopia far left right gaze procedure often appropriate total paralysis health problems increased risk anterior segment ischaemia associated complex multimuscle transposition procedures function remains affected eye preferred procedure depends upon degree development muscle sequelae sixth nerve palsy one would expect
