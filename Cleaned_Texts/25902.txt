dog intelligence dog cognition process dogs acquiring information conceptual skills storing memory retrieving combining comparing using new studies shown dogs display many behaviors associated intelligence advanced memory skills able read react appropriately human body language gesturing pointing understand human voice commands dogs demonstrate theory mind engaging deception dogs often used studies cognition including research perception awareness memory learning notably research classical operant conditioning course research behavioral scientists uncovered surprising set socialcognitive abilities domestic dog abilities neither possessed dogs closest canine relatives highly intelligent mammals great apes rather skills resemble socialcognitive skills human may example convergent evolution happens distantly related species independently evolve similar solutions problems example fish penguins dolphins separately evolved flippers solution problem moving water dogs humans may see psychological convergence dogs evolved cognitively similar humans closest genetic however questionable whether cognitive evolution humans animals may called independent cognitive capacities dogs inevitably shaped millennia contact result physical social evolution many dogs readily respond social cues common quickly learn meaning show cognitive exhibit emotions seem reflect research suggests domestic dogs may lost original cognitive abilities joined humans example one study showed compelling evidence dingoes canis dingo outperform domestic dogs nonsocial problemsolving experiments another study indicated trained solve simple manipulation task dogs faced unsolvable version problem look nearby human socialized wolves thus modern domestic dogs seem use humans solve problems whole genome study dna differences wolves dogs found dogs show reduced fear response showed greater synaptic plasticity synaptic plasticity widely believed cellular correlate learning memory change may altered learning memory abilities modern research dog cognition focused pet dogs living human homes developed countries small fraction dog population dogs populations may show different cognitive breed differences possibly could impact spatial learning memory first intelligence test dogs developed included measurements shortterm memory agility ability solve problems detouring goal also assessed ability dog adapt new conditions cope emotionally difficult situations test administered dogs standardized breed norms stanley coren used surveys done dog obedience judges rank dog breeds intelligence published results book intelligence dogs perception refers mental processes incoming sensory information organized interpreted order represent understand perception includes processes selection information attention organization sensory information grouping identification events objects dog olfactory information sense smell particularly salient compared humans dogs senses also include vision hearing taste touch proprioception also evidence dogs sense earths magnetic field one researcher proposed dogs perceive passing time dissipation concept object permanence refers ability animal understand objects continue exist even moved outside field view ability present birth developmental psychologist jean piaget described six stages development object permanence human infants similar approach used dogs evidence dogs go similar stages reach advanced fifth stage age weeks stage track successive visible displacement experimenter moves object behind multiple screens leaving behind last one unclear whether dogs reach stage piagets object permanence development study indicated dogs appear recognize dogs regardless breed size shape distinguish study using magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated voiceresponse areas exist brains dogs show response pattern anterior temporal voice areas similar dogs capable learning simple reinforcement eg classical operant conditioning also learn watching humans one study investigated whether dogs engaged partnered play would adjust behavior attentionstate partner experimenters observed play signals sent dog holding attention partner partner distracted dog instead engaged attentiongetting behavior sending play puppies learn behaviors quickly following examples set experienced form intelligence particular tasks dogs bred perform generalized various abstract problems example dachshund puppies set problem pulling cart tugging attached piece ribbon order get reward inside cart puppies watched experienced dog perform task learned task fifteen times faster left solve problem social rank dogs affects performance social learning situations social groups clear hierarchy dominant individuals influential demonstrators knowledge transfer tends unidirectional higher rank lower problemsolving experiment dominant dogs generally performed better subordinates observed human demonstrators actions finding reflects dominance human doghuman groups subordinate dogs learn best dominant dog adjacent dogs show humanlike social cognition various example dogs react appropriately human body language gesturing pointing also understand human voice one study puppies presented box shown handler pressed lever ball would roll box handler allowed puppy play ball making intrinsic reward pups allowed interact box roughly three quarters puppies subsequently touched lever half successfully released ball compared control group watch human manipulate similarly dogs may guided cues indicating direction humans one task reward hidden one two buckets experimenter indicated location reward tapping bucket pointing bucket nodding bucket simply looking bucket dogs followed signals performing better chimpanzees wolves human infants task even puppies limited exposure humans performed dogs follow direction pointing humans new guinea singing dogs halfwild protodog endemic remote alpine regions new guinea follow human pointing australian dingoes demonstrate ability read human gestures arose early domestication without human selection dogs wolves also shown follow complex pointing made body parts human arm hand eg elbow knee dogs tend follow handarm pointed directions combined eye signaling well general dogs seem use human cues indication go overall dogs appear several cognitive skills necessary understand communication information however findings dogs understanding referentiality others mental states controversial clear whether dog communicate informative canines perform well traditional humanguided tasks eg following human point relevant lifetime experiences socialization humans critical phase social opportunities associate human body parts certain outcomes food provided humans human throwing kicking ball etc study water rescue dogs respond words gestures found dogs would respond gesture rather verbal dogs demonstrated episodiclike memory recalling past events included complex actions study correlation shown size dog functions memory selfcontrol larger dogs performing significantly better smaller dogs functions however study brain size predict dogs ability follow human pointing gestures associated inferential physical reasoning study canine cognitive abilities found various animals including pigs pigeons chimpanzees able remember event dogs various studies shown dogs readily learn names objects retrieve item among many others given name example betsy border collie knew words retrieval test also able connect object photographic image object despite seen neither another study dog watched experimenters handed object back forth using objects name sentence dog subsequently retrieved item given humans fast mapping ability form quick rough hypotheses meaning new word single exposure study rico border collie showed able fast map rico initially knew labels items inferred names novel items exclusion knowing novel item one already know rico correctly retrieved novel items immediately four weeks initial exposure rico also able interpret phrases fetch sock component words rather considering utterance single word rico could also give sock specified person performance comparable study documented learning memory capabilities border collie chaser learned names could associate verbal command words time publishing chaser documented capable learning names new objects exclusion capable linking nouns verbs argued central understanding border collies remarkable accomplishments dogs breeding bred herding work uniquely suited intellectual tasks like word association may require dog work distance human companions study credits dogs selective breeding addition rigorous training intellectual research suggested dogs easily make distinction familiar known words nonsensical dissimilar words struggle differentiate known familiar words nonsense words differ single sound measurements dogs brain activity showed difference response known word similar nonsensical word would give dogs word processing capability equivalent average human fmri study found dog brain distinguished without training familiar unfamiliar language study also found older dogs better discriminating one language suggesting effect amount exposition studies suggest dogs feel complex emotions like jealousy however behavioral evidence seemingly human emotions must interpreted care example book good natured ethologist frans de waal discusses experiment guilt reprimands conducted female siberian husky dog habit shredding newspapers owner returned home find shredded papers scold would act guilty however owner shredded papers without dogs knowledge dog acted guilty created mess de waal concludes dog display true guilt humans understand rather simply anticipation one limitation study emotions nonhuman animals verbalize express feelings however dogs emotions studied indirectly cognitive tests called cognitive bias test measure cognitive bias allow make inference mood animal researchers found dogs suffering separation anxiety negative cognitive bias compared dogs without separation hand dogs separation anxiety treated medications behavior therapy cognitive bias becomes less negative also administration oxytocin rather placebo induces positive cognitive bias positive expectation therefore suggested cognitive bias test used monitor positive emotional states therefore welfare evidence dogs discriminate emotional expressions human addition seem respond faces somewhat way humans example humans tend gaze right side persons face may related use right brain hemisphere facial recognition research indicates dogs also fixate right side human face dogs animals dogs nonprimate species known sexspecific dynamics important contributor individual differences cognitive performance pet dogs repeated problemsolving captiveraised dingoes canis dingo outperform domestic dogs nonsocial another study indicated undergoing training solve simple manipulation task dogs faced unsolvable version problem look human whereas socialized wolves modern domestic dogs use humans solve problems dogs shown learn making inferences similar way dogs ability train learn behaviors watching interacting theory mind ability attribute mental intents desires pretending knowledge oneself others understand others beliefs desires intentions perspectives different ones evidence dogs demonstrate theory mind engaging deception example one observer reported dog hid stolen treat sitting rightful owner treat left although could accidental suggests thief understood treats owner would unable find treat study found dogs able discriminate object human partner looking based relevance partner keen indicating object relevant partner compared irrelevant one suggests dogs might rudimentary version
