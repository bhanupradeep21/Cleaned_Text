asked participants experiment judge similarity lines easy task objective standards using accomplices plot also known confederates asch created illusion entire group participants believed something clearly false ie dissimilar lines actually similar situation participants conformed time trials confederates gave blatantly false answers asked make judgments private participants gave right answer time aschs results explained informational social influence case task easy correct answer obvious thus participants necessarily looking others figure right answer informational social influence predicts instead seeking acceptance avoiding disapproval followup interviews participants original asch studies confirmed participants asked conformed many provided reasons need current research schultz found households received normative messages describing frequency amount weekly recycling began direct impact households frequency amount curbside recycling sudden change due fact neighbors recycling habits direct normative effect household change recycling behaviors similar results apparent another study researchers able increase household energy conservation use normative participants conservation study believe normative messages could influence behavior attributed conservation efforts environmental concerns social responsibility needs thus normative social influence powerful yet unconscious motivator behaviorcitation needed lastly different studies illustrated consequences deviation groups influence study schachter participants placed groups asked discuss juvenile delinquent read deviant instructed experimenter take stand strongly opposing rest group hold position midst arguments members conclusion discussions participants chose reject deviant considering least desirable members relegating least important tasks recent work berns et al examined physiological effects deviation using fmri scan participants brains completed object rotation task participants actually confederates researchers interested examining participants brain activity pressure conform incorrect group majority amygdala region associated negative emotions activated participants sought break influence majority providing support point resisting normative social influence often lead negative emotional consequences latanes social impact theory posits three factors influence extent conform group norms personal importance immediacy group becomes important person physically closer himher larger number social impact theory predicts conformity group norms increase however size group affects conformity group expands past members effect levels group unanimous support norm individual feels greater pressure follow however even small break unanimity lead decrease power normative influence aschs study even one confederate dissented majority provided correct answer participant answered incorrectly fewer trials fourth addition participants experienced positive emotions towards dissenters similar reduction conformity even occurred dissenting confederate provided answer false still different majoritycitation needed versions experiment asch dissenting confederates eventually rejoin majority opinion several trials occurred participants experienced greater pressure normative influence conformed never dissenter however conditions altered dissenting confederate left room several trials participants experience similar pressure conform confederate rejoined made fewer mistakes condition confederate rejoined otherscitation needed pressure bend normative influence increases actions performed public whereas pressure decreases actions done another variation asch study researchers allowed participant privately write answer confederates publicly stated answers variation reduced level conformity among addition control condition asch study revealed participants almost perfectly accurate answering independentlycitation needed possible vocal minority stem normative influence larger versions asch study dissenter inserted group see unanimity section presence minority member gave participant confidence exert independence greater however soon dissenter waffled opinions rejoined majority participant conformity increased thus minority must consistently stand beliefs effectivecitation needed addition factors increase power minority majority forced think beliefs perspective minority majority minority similar one another minority exhibits willingness compromise flexible although debate degree consistency compromise often case whereas majority influences public compliance norm minority engender private acceptance new norm result often conversion public private acceptance distinction individualistic eg united states collectivistic eg japan predict collectivistic cultures would exhibit stronger conformity normative social influence necessarily identity group acts potential moderator collectivists emphasize importance ingroup members eg family friends normative pressure ingroups lead higher conformity pressures strangerscitation needed many long wondered whether gender gap conformity normative influence women possibly conforming men metaanalysis eagly carli shows gap small driven public vs private women conform slightly normative influence men public situations opposed private ones eagly carli found male researchers reported higher levels conformity among female participants female researchers authors speculate gender could implicitly biased towards portraying positive light thus leading actions eg setting experimental conditions males females may comfortable might favor one gender othercitation needed fashion choices often impacted normative social influence feel accepted particular crowd men women often dress similarly individuals group fashion conformity promotes social cohesion within group result conscious unconscious motivations similar fashion conformity male female views ideal body image often
