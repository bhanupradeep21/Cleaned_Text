semelparity iteroparity two contrasting reproductive strategies available living organisms species considered semelparous characterized single reproductive episode death iteroparous characterized multiple reproductive cycles course lifetime iteroparity divided continuous iteroparity primates including humans chimpanzees seasonal iteroparity birds dogs etc botanists use parallel terms monocarpy polycarpy see also plietesials truly semelparous species death reproduction part overall strategy includes putting available resources maximizing reproduction expense future life see tradeoffs iteroparous population individuals die first second reproductive episodes unless part syndrome programmed death reproduction would called semelparity distinction also related difference annual perennial plants annual plant completes life cycle single season usually semelparous perennials live one season usually always semelparity iteroparity strictly speaking alternative strategies extremes along continuum possible modes reproduction many organisms considered semelparous certain conditions separate single bout reproduction two word semelparity coined evolutionary biologist lamont comes latin semel single time pario beget differs iteroparity iteroparous species able multiple reproductive cycles therefore mate lifetime semelparity also known big bang reproduction since single reproductive event semelparous organisms usually large well classic example semelparous organism pacific salmon oncorhynchus spp lives many years ocean swimming freshwater stream birth spawning dying semelparous animals include many insects including species butterflies cicadas mayflies many arachnids molluscs species squid octopus semelparity also occurs smelt capelin rare vertebrates bony fish

adult mortality making economical put reproductive effort first therefore final reproductive semelparous species dasyuridae typically small carnivorous exception northern quoll dasyurus hallucatus large species reproductive strategy include members genus antechinus phascogale tapoatafa phascogale culura males three groups exhibit similar characteristics classify semelparous first males species disappear immediately mating season also males captured isolated others live captured males allowed mate die immediately mating season like wild behaviour also changes drastically mating season mating males extremely aggressive fight males placed close together males captured allowed mate remain aggressive winter months mating season allowed mate males become extremely lethargic never regain aggressiveness even survive next mating changes occur postmating include fur degradation testicular degeneration adolescence male fur thick becomes dull thin mating regains original condition individual manages survive past mating season fur scrotum completely falls grow back even male survives months first mating season marsupial ages testicles grow reach peak size weight beginning mating season individual mates weight size testes scrotum decrease remain small produce spermatozoa later life maintained woolley study antechinus spp noticed males able maintained past mating laboratory senile males found wild suggesting males die shortly studies antechinus stuartii reveal male mortality highly correlated stress andrenocortical activity study measured corticosteroid concentration males wild males injected cortisol males injected saline females wild males females exhibit high levels corticosteroid concentration wild proves fatal males due females higher maximum high affinity corticosteroid binding capacity thus free corticosteroid plasma male stuartii rises sharply remains constant females high levels free corticosteroid resulting mating wild males injected cortisol laboratory males resulted stomach ulcers gastrointestinal hemorrhaging liver abscesses increased mortality side effects found males injected strengthening hypothesis high free corticosteroids results higher mortality male dasyurids similar study phascogale calura showed similar endocrine system changes happen p calura supports stressinduced mortality characteristic small dasyurid semelparity dasyurus hallucatus northern quoll large dasyurid exhibits increased male mortality mating season unlike smaller dasyurids male dieoff hallucatus due endocrine system changes spermatogenic failure

gastrointestinal lack elevated cortisol levels mating periods hallucatus means current universal explanation mechanism behind increased male mortality dasyuridae postreproductive senescence also proposed grey slender mouse opossum exhibits semelparous reproductive strategy males females males disappear endemic area reproductive season males found months later lighter body weight molar teeth

monoestrus reproductive cycle like incanus females longer fertile months unlikely females survive past drop female populations would able reproduce second gracilinanus microtarsus brazilian gracile opossum considered partially semelparous male mortality increases significantly mating season males survive mate next reproductive cycle males also exhibit similar physiological degradation demonstrated antechinus semelparous marsupials fur loss increase infection highly elevated cortisol levels mediate postspawning death semelparous oncorhynchus pacific salmon causing tissue degeneration suppressing immune system impairing various homeostatic swimming long distance salmon expend energy reproduction one key factors salmon rapid senescence fish feed reproduction body weight extremely addition physiological degradation pacific salmon become lethargic mating goes makes individuals susceptible predation less energy avoid also increases mortality rates adults postmating traditionally semelparity usually defined within time frame year critics criterion note scale inappropriate discussing patterns insect reproduction many insects breed within one annual period generation times less one year traditional definition insects considered semelparous consequence time scale rather distribution reproductive effort adult life order resolve inconsistency fritz et al define semelparous insects insects lay single clutch eggs lifetime deposit one place clearly semelparous big bang reproducers entire reproductive effort committed one time die shortly semelparous insects found lepidoptera ephemeroptera dermaptera plecoptera strepsiptera trichoptera hemiptera females certain families lepidoptera like spongy moth family erebidae reduced mobility wingless apterous disperse larval stage opposed adult stage iteroparous insects dispersal mainly occurs adult stage semelparous lepidopterans share similar characteristics larvae feed restricted periods year nutritional state host plants result univoltine initial food supply predictably abundant larval host plants abundant death commonly occurs starvation case spongy moth adults possess active digestive system feed drink moisture mating occurs fairly rapidly adults emerge pupal form without way digest food adult moths die evolution semelparity sexes occurred many times plants invertebrates fish rare mammals mammals obligate maternal care due internal fertilization incubation offspring nursing young birth requires high maternal survival rate fertilization offspring weaning also female mammals relatively low reproductive rates compared invertebrates fish invest lot energy maternal care however male reproductive rate much less constrained mammals females bear young male dies one mating season still produce large number offspring invests energy mating many scientists hypothesized natural selection allowed semelparity evolve dasyuridae didelphidae certain ecological constraints female mammals ancestral groups may shortened mating period coincide peak prey abundance window small females species exhibit reproduction pattern estrous females occurs simultaneously selection would favor aggressive males due increased competition males access females since mating period short beneficial males expend energy mating even unlikely survive next mating reproduction costly anadromous salmonids life history requires transition saltwater freshwater streams long migrations physiologically taxing transition cold oceanic water warm freshwater steep elevation changes northern pacific rivers could explain evolution semelparity would extremely difficult return ocean noticeable difference semelparous fish iteroparous salmonids egg size varies two types reproductive strategies studies show egg size also affected migration body size egg number however shows little variation semelparous iteroparous populations resident anadromous populations females body current hypothesis behind reason iteroparous species reduce size eggs order improve mothers chances survival since invests less energy gamete formation semelparous species expect live past one mating season females invest lot energy gamete formation resulting large eggs anadromous salmonids may also evolved semelparity boost nutrition density spawning grounds productive pacific salmon spawning grounds contain carcasses spawned adults dead bodies adult salmon decompose provide nitrogen phosphorus algae grow nutrientpoor water zooplankton feed algae newly hatched salmon feed interesting trait evolved semelparous insects especially evolved parasitic ancestors like subsocial eusocial aculeate hymenoptera larvae morphologically specialized development within hosts innards thus entirely helpless outside environment females would need invest lot energy protecting eggs hatched offspring behaviours egg guarding mothers actively defend offspring example risk injury death beneficial iteroparous species female risks dying reaching full reproductive potential able reproduce reproductive periods lifetime since semelparous insects live one reproductive cycle afford expend energy maternal care offspring
