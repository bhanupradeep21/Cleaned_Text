cortisol increases blood sugar inducing gluconeogenesis glucose production liver lipolysis fat breakdown adipose tissue proteolysis muscle breakdown muscle increasing glucagon secretion decreasing insulin secretion overall actions cause body use fat stores muscle energy deficiency results hypoglycemia associated nausea vomiting fatigue cortisol potentiates effectiveness angiotensin ii catecholamines norepinephrine vasoconstriction thus deficiency contribute hypotension though effect pronounced mineralocorticoid primary adrenal insufficiency lack negative feedback cortisol leads increased production crh acth derived proopiomelanocortin pomc cleaved acth well αmsh regulates production melanin overproduction αmsh leads characteristic hyperpigmentation addisons although production aldosterone occurs within adrenal cortex induced adrenocorticotropic acth instead regulated system renin production juxtaglomerular cells kidney induced decreased arterial blood pressure decreased sodium content distal convoluted tubule increased sympathetic renin initiates downstream sequence cleavage angiotensinogen angiotensin angiotensin ii angiotensin ii stimulates aldosterone
