dnaintercalating anthroquinone antitumor phd characterized dna binding characteristics explore cytotoxic properties potential cancer completed phd training pursued postdoctoral research purdue university indiana united agbandjemckenna studied mentorship michael rossmann within department biological time began developing skills structural virology became assistant scientist completing postdoctoral became expert use xray crystallography cryoelectron microscopy characterize structure agbandjemckenna moved back united kingdom become independent research fellow university warwick led

agbandjemckenna promoted associate professor became full professor well director center structural agbandjemckenna one principal investigators leading macromolecular structure group uf alongside husband robert expertise structural biology used guide lab exploration structural topology adenoassociated viruses using advanced high resolution imaging techniques cryogenic electron microscopy xray crystallography lab able determine structure aav capsids use information understand life cycle explore potential use gene throughout career uf agbandjemckenna made key discoveries structurefunction relationships aav rational capsid design enabled development novel viral capsids improved transduction immune evading capabilities use gene therapies treat various agbandjemckenna actively involved scientific community uf nationally member health science center equity diversity board uf member nih naaidc asgct viral gene transfer vector committee editorial board journal virology member ictv parvoviridae study group well member chess external advisory agbandjemckenna explored parvovirus biology emphasis aavs aav serotypes offer exciting promise biomedical application since cause disease humans single stranded genetic material easily edited create vectors use gene agbandjemckenna performed xray crystallographic investigation human parvovirus first time selfassembled empty viral capsid grown atypical host system baculovirus system officially characterized structure human parvovirus angstrom resolution find striking differences feline canine homologous agbandjemckenna colleagues sought find improved methods aav capsid design gene therapy since current approaches require large amounts vector discovered specific type tyrosine kinase signalling impairs transduction surfaceexposed tyrosine residues viral capsid phosphorylated virus enter cell begin express genetic mutated surface tyrosine residues aavs resulted improved viral able show novel capsid design enables sufficient viral transduction lower agbandjemckenna collaborators salk institute developed novel cryoem method obtain viral structures even higher resolution previously used technique called contrast transfer function ctf well correction ewald sphere curvature able obtain highest resolution structural analysis structural characterization resulted improved models aav capsid development use gene many patients gene therapy feasible due patients immune system producing antibodies viral vector used agbandjemckenna colleagues uf sought find way prevent host mediated attack vectors used gene since antibody binding sites highly conserved across aavs innovated solution problem host immune attack designing structureguided evolution approach identify antigenic epitopes aavs capable evading neutralizing antibodies immune elucidated capsid using method able evade neutralizing antibodies without compromising titer transduction efficacy tissue tropisms evaded antibody binding nonhuman primate samples well human following year agbandjemckenna characterized novel antigenic region capsid atomic resolution using observed capsidantibody interactions using cryoem high resolution able use tool develop novel antigens evade immune discoveries advances generating immuneevading viral capsids aavs prompted agbandjemckenna cofound company stridebio focuses design antibodyevading aav capsids
