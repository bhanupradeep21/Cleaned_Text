gait analysis systematic study animal locomotion specifically study human motion using eye brain observers augmented instrumentation measuring body movements body mechanics activity gait analysis used assess treat individuals conditions affecting ability walk also commonly used sports biomechanics help athletes run efficiently identify posturerelated movementrelated problems people injuries study encompasses quantification introduction analysis measurable parameters gaits well interpretation ie drawing various conclusions animal health age size weight speed etc gait pattern pioneers scientific gait analysis aristotle de motu animalium gait much later giovanni alfonso borelli also called de motu animalium et ii german anatomist christian wilhelm braune otto fischer published series papers biomechanics human gait loaded unloaded development photography cinematography became possible capture image sequences reveal details human animal locomotion noticeable watching movement naked eye
