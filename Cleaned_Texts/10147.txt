irhoud display rabat archaeological museum discovered part another skull designated irhoud following year subsequently uncovered lower mandible child designated irhoud tixiers excavation found recorded objects including skulls humerus designated irhoud hip bone recorded irhoud excavations carried american researchers well team led jeanjacques hublin animal remains found site enabled ancient ecology area reconstructed quite different present probably represented dry open perhaps steppelike environment roamed equids bovids gazelles rhinoceros various initially finds interpreted neanderthal stone tools found believed associated exclusively also archaic phenotypical features believed representative neanderthals rather homo sapiens thought approximately years old thrown doubt faunal evidence suggesting middle pleistocene date approximately years ago fossils reappraised representing archaic form homo sapiens perhaps population homo sapiens interbred consistent concept thenoldestknown remains homo sapiens dated approximately years ago found omo kibish ethiopia indicated eastern african origin humans approximately years ethiopian omo remains recently dated years however dating carried max planck institute evolutionary anthropology leipzig revealed jebel irhoud site far older first fresh excavations carried hublin team revealed new bones remains least five people number stone tools finds included part skull jawbone teeth limb bones come three adults juvenile child aged sevenandahalf years facial bones resembled humans today much larger lower jaws elongated posterior braincases similar features florisbad skull dating years ago found end continent florisbad south africa attributed homo sapiens basis jebel irhoud tools discovered found alongside gazelle bones lumps charcoal indicating presence fire probably cooking cave gazelle bones showed characteristic signs butchery cooking cut marks notches consistent marrow extraction tools burned due fires lit top presumably discarded enabled researchers use thermoluminescence dating ascertain burning occurred proxy age fossil bones found deposit layer burnt tools dated approximately years ago indicating fossils approximately age conclusion confirmed recalculating age irhoud mandible produced age range compatible tools roughly years old hold dates would make remains far earliest known examples homo suggests rather arising east africa approximately years ago modern humans may present across length africa years earlier according study author jeanjacques hublin idea early homo sapiens dispersed around continent elements human modernity appeared different places different parts africa contributed emergence call modern humans early humans may comprised large interbreeding population dispersed across africa approximately years ago thus rise modern humans may taken place continental scale rather confined particular corner hublin team also attempted obtain dna samples fossils attempts unsuccessful genomic analysis would provided necessary evidence supporting conclusion fossils representative main lineage leading modern humanity homo sapiens dispersed developed across africa unclear boundaries different species genus homo lack genomic evidence fossils doubt classification fossils homo sapiens questions remain classification comparing fossils modern humans main difference elongated shape fossil braincase according researchers indicates brain shape possibly brain functions evolved within homo sapiens lineage relatively evolutionary changes brain shape likely associated genetic changes brain organization interconnection may reflect adaptive changes way brain changes may caused human brain become rounder two regions posterior brain become enlarged thousands
