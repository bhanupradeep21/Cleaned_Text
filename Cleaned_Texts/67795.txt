multicellular organism organism consists one cell contrast unicellular species animals land plants fungi multicellular many algae whereas organisms partially uni partially multicellular like slime molds social amoebae genus multicellular organisms arise various ways example cell division aggregation many single colonial organisms result many identical individuals joining together form colony however often hard separate colonial protists true multicellular organisms two concepts distinct colonial protists dubbed pluricellular rather also macroscopic organisms multinucleate though technically unicellular xenophyophorea reach cm multicellularity evolved independently least times also prokaryotes like cyanobacteria myxobacteria actinomycetes magnetoglobus multicellularis however
