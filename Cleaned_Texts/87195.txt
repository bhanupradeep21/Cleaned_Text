research music emotion seeks understand psychological relationship human affect music field branch music psychology covers numerous areas study including nature emotional reactions music characteristics listener may determine emotions felt components musical composition performance may elicit certain reactions research draws upon significant implications areas philosophy musicology music therapy music theory aesthetics well acts musical composition musical performance like concert two influential philosophers aesthetics music stephen davies jerrold davies calls view expressiveness emotions music appearance emotionalism holds music expresses emotion without feeling objects convey emotion structures contain certain characteristics resemble emotional expression says resemblance counts musics expressiveness musics temporally unfolding dynamic structure configurations human behaviour associated expression observer note emotions listeners posture gait gestures attitude associations musical features emotion differ among individuals appearance emotionalism claims many listeners perceiving associations constitutes expressiveness music musical features commonly associated emotions part music psychology davies says expressiveness objective property music subjective sense projected music listener musics expressiveness certainly responsedependent ie realized listeners judgement skilled listeners similarly attribute emotional expressiveness certain piece music thereby indicating according davies expressiveness music somewhat objective music lacked expressiveness expression could projected reaction philosopher jennifer robinson assumes existence mutual dependence cognition elicitation description emotions process music process theory process theory robinson argues process emotional elicitation begins automatic immediate response initiates motor autonomic activity prepares us possible action causing process cognition may enable listeners name felt emotion series events continually exchanges new incoming information robinson argues emotions may transform one another causing blends conflicts ambiguities make impede describing one word emotional state one experiences given moment instead inner feelings better thought products multiple emotional streams robinson argues music series simultaneous processes therefore ideal medium mirroring cognitive aspects emotion musical themes desiring resolution leitmotifs mirrors memory processes simultaneous musical processes reinforce conflict thus also express way one emotion morphs another needed ability perceive emotion music saidweasel words develop early childhood improve significantly throughout capacity perceive emotion music also subject cultural influences similarities differences emotion perception observed crosscultural empirical research looked emotions conveyed well structural factors music help contribute perceived emotional expression two schools thought interpret emotion music cognitivists approach argues music simply displays emotion allow personal experience emotion listener emotivists argue music elicits real emotional responses argued emotion experienced piece music multiplicative function structural features performance features listener features contextual features extramusical features piece shown structural features divided two parts segmental features suprasegmental features segmental features individual sounds tones make music includes acoustic structures duration amplitude pitch suprasegmental features foundational structures piece melody tempo number specific musical features highly associated particular within factors affecting emotional expression music tempo typically regarded important number factors mode loudness melody also influence emotional valence studies find perception basic emotional features cultural universal though people easily perceive emotion perceive nuanced emotion music music without lyrics unlikely elicit social emotions like anger shame jealousy typically elicits basic emotions like happiness music direct connection emotional states present human beings different musical structures found relationship physiological responses research shown suprasegmental structures tonal space specifically dissonance create unpleasant negative emotions participants emotional responses measured physiological assessments skin conductance electromyographic signals emg participants listened musical research psychophysiological measures pertaining music conducted found similar results musical structures rhythmic articulation accentuation tempo found correlate strongly physiological measures measured used included heart rate respiratory monitors correlated selfreport associations innate learned studies young children isolated cultures show innate associations features similar human voice eg low slow sad faster high happy crosscultural studies show associations major mode vs minor mode consonance vs dissonance probably music also affects sociallyrelevant memories specifically memories produced nostalgic musical excerpts eg music significant time period one life like music listened road trips musical structures strongly interpreted certain areas brain music evokes nostalgia interior frontal gyrus substantia nigra cerebellum insula identified stronger correlation nostalgic music brain activity individualized concept many musical excerpts certain effects based individuals past life experiences thus caveat kept mind generalizing findings across individuals performance features refer manner piece music executed performers broken two categories performer skills performer state performer skills compound ability appearance performer including physical appearance reputation technical skills performer state interpretation motivation stage presence listener features refer individual social identity listeners includes personality age knowledge music motivation listen contextual features aspects performance location particular occasion performance ie funeral wedding extramusical features refer extramusical information detached auditory music signals genre style music different factors influence expressed emotion different magnitudes effects compounded one another thus experienced emotion felt stronger degree factors present order factors listed within model denotes much weight equation carry reason bulk research done structural features listener emotion perceived dependent context piece music past research argued opposing emotions like happiness sadness fall bipolar scale felt recent research suggested happiness sadness experienced separately implies felt one study investigated latter possibility participants listen computermanipulated musical excerpts mixed cues tempo examples mixcue music include piece major key slow tempo minorchord piece fast tempo participants rated extent piece conveyed happiness sadness results indicated mixedcue music conveys happiness sadness however remained unclear whether participants perceived happiness sadness simultaneously vacillated two followup study done examine possibilities listening mixed consistent cue music participants pressed one button music conveyed happiness another button conveyed results revealed subjects pressed buttons simultaneously songs conflicting findings indicate listeners perceive happiness sadness concurrently significant implications structural features influence emotion mix structural cues used number emotions may studies indicate ability understand emotional messages music starts early improves throughout child studies investigating music emotion children primarily play musical excerpt children look pictorial expressions faces facial expressions display different emotions children asked select face best matches musics emotional studies shown children able assign specific emotions pieces music however debate regarding age ability infant often exposed mothers speech musical nature possible motherly singing allows mother relay emotional messages infants also tend prefer positive speech neutral speech well happy music negative also posited listening mothers singing may play role identity hypothesis supported study interviewed adults asked describe musical experiences childhood findings showed music good developing knowledge emotions studies shown children age able begin distinguish emotions found musical excerpts ways similar ability distinguish musical emotions seems increase age however children age unable make distinction emotions expressed music matching facial expression type emotion found emotions anger fear also found harder distinguish within studies fouryearolds fiveyearolds asked label musical excerpts affective labels happy sad angry results one study showed fouryearolds perform chance labels sad angry fiveyearolds perform chance label followup study found conflicting results fiveyearolds performed much like adults however ages confused categorizing angry preschool elementaryage children listened twelve short melodies either major minor mode instructed choose four pictures faces happy contented sad children even young three years old performed chance assigning positive faces major mode negative faces minor different people perceive events differently based upon individual characteristics similarly emotions elicited listening different types music seem affected factors personality previous musical people personality type agreeableness found higher emotional responses music general stronger sad feelings also associated people personality types agreeableness neuroticism studies shown musical training correlated music evoked mixed well higher iq test emotional comprehension studies refute claim musical training affects perception emotion also worth noting previous exposure music affect later behavioral choices schoolwork social therefore previous music exposure seem effect personality emotions child later life would subsequently affect ability perceive well express emotions exposure music gender however shown lead difference perception emotions found research factors affect individuals perception emotion music ability individual musicinduced emotions needed along research music conveys emotion listeners also shown music produce emotion view often causes debate emotion produced within listener consequently hard measure spite controversy studies shown observable responses elicited emotions reinforces emotivists view music elicit real emotional structural features music help convey emotional message listener also may create emotion emotions completely new feelings may extension previous emotional events empirical research shown listeners absorb pieces expression emotion well invoke unique response based personal research eliciting emotion participants report personally feeling certain emotion response hearing musical researchers investigated whether structures conveyed particular emotion could elicit well researchers presented excerpts fast tempo major mode music slow tempo minor tone music participants musical structures chosen known convey happiness sadness participants rated emotions elevated levels happiness listening music structures convey happiness elevated sadness music structures convey evidence suggests structures convey emotions music also elicit emotions listener light finding particular controversy music eliciting negative emotions cognitivists argue choosing listen music elicits negative emotions like sadness would paradoxical listeners would willingly strive induce whereas emotivists purport music elicit negative emotions listeners knowingly choose listen order feel sadness impersonal way similar viewers desire watch tragic reasons people sometimes listen sad music feeling sad explored means interviewing people motivations result research found people sometimes listen sad music feeling sad intensify feelings sadness reasons listening sad music feeling sad order retrieve memories feel closer people cognitive reappraisal feel befriended music distract oneself mood researchers also found effect ones familiarity piece music emotions one study suggested familiarity piece music increases emotions experienced listener half participants played twelve random musical excerpts one time rated emotions piece half participants listened twelve random excerpts five times started ratings third repetition findings showed participants listened excerpts five times rated emotions higher intensity participants listened music may elicit new emotions connect listeners emotional music serves powerful cue recall emotional memories back music pervasive part social life present weddings funerals religious ceremonies brings back emotional memories often already associated music also processed lower sensory levels brain making impervious later memory distortions therefore creating strong connection emotion music within memory makes easier recall one prompted music also tap empathy inducing emotions assumed felt performer composer listeners become sad recognize emotions must felt much viewer play empathize actors listeners may also respond emotional music throughout history music composed inspire people specific action march dance sing fight consequently heightening emotions events fact many people report unable sit still certain rhythms played cases even engaging subliminal actions physical manifestations examples seen young childrens spontaneous outbursts motion upon hearing music exuberant expressions shown juslin västfjäll developed model seven ways music elicit emotion called brecvem regards violations expectation music several interesting results found example found listening unconventional music may sometimes cause meaning threat result compensatory behaviour order restore musical expectancy defined process whereby emotion aroused listener specific feature music violates delays confirms listeners expectations continuation music every time listener hears piece music expectations based music heard example sequential progression ef may set expectation music continue g words notes seem imply notes musical implications realized listeners expectations thwarted affective response might juslin created additional aspect brecvem model called aesthetic criteria individual metric musics aesthetic value involve number varying personal preferences message conveyed skill presented novelty style idea bulk evidence listeners identify specific emotions certain types music less concrete evidence music may elicit due fact elicited emotion subjective thus difficult find valid criterion study elicited conveyed emotion music usually understood three types evidence selfreport physiological responses expressive behavior researchers use one combination methods investigate emotional reactions selfreport method verbal report listener regarding experiencing widely used method studying emotion shown people identify emotions personally experience emotions listening research area shown listeners emotional responses highly consistent fact metaanalysis studies music performance found happiness sadness tenderness threat anger identified chance another study compared untrained listeners musically trained groups required categorize musical excerpts conveyed similar emotions findings showed categorizations different trained untrained thus demonstrating untrained listeners highly accurate perceiving difficult find evidence elicited emotion depends solely subjective response listener leaves reporting vulnerable selfreport biases participants responding according social prescriptions responding think experimenter wants result validity selfreport method often questioned consequently researchers reluctant draw definitive conclusions solely emotions known create physiological bodily changes person tested experimentally evidence shows one changes within nervous arousing music related increased heart rate muscle tension calming music connected decreased heart rate muscle tension increased skin research identifies outward physical responses shivering goose bumps caused changes harmony tears lumpinthethroat sensation provoked changes researchers test responses use instruments physiological measurement recording pulse people also known show outward manifestations emotional states listening music studies using facial electromyography emg found people react subliminal facial expressions listening expressive addition music provides stimulus expressive behavior many social contexts concerts dances although expressive behaviors measured experimentally controlled studies observing within comparison elicited conveyed emotions researchers examined relationship two types responses music general research agrees feeling perception ratings highly correlated specifically studies inconclusive whether one response stronger effect ways two responses one study participants heard random selection excerpts displaying six types emotions five times half participants described emotions music conveyed half responded music made feel results found emotions conveyed music intense emotions elicited piece another study investigated specific conditions strong emotions conveyed findings showed ratings conveyed emotions higher happy responses music consistent cues happiness ie fast tempo major mode sad responses music consistent cues sadness ie slow tempo minor mode sad responses studies suggest people recognize emotion displayed music readily feeling personally another study participants listen twelve musical pieces found strength perceived elicited emotions dependent structures piece perceived emotions stronger felt emotions listeners rated arousal positive negative activation hand elicited emotions stronger perceived emotions rating another study analysis revealed emotional responses stronger listeners perceptions study used betweensubjects design listeners judged extent perceived four emotions happy sad peaceful scared separate listeners rated extent experienced emotions findings showed music stimuli elicited specific emotions group participants rating elicited emotion music stimuli occasionally conveyed emotion participants group identifying emotions music based inconsistent findings much research left done order determine conveyed elicited emotions similar different disagreement whether music induces true emotions emotions reported felt studies instead participants stating emotions found music listening music therapy therapeutic tool shown effective treatment various ailments therapeutic techniques involve eliciting emotions listening music composing music lyrics performing music therapy sessions may ability help drug users attempting break drug habit users reporting feeling better able feel emotions without aid drug music therapy may also viable option people experiencing extended stays hospital due illness one study music therapy provided child oncology patients enhanced environmental support elements elicited engaging behaviors treating troubled teenagers study keen revealed music therapy allowed therapists interact teenagers less resistance thus facilitating selfexpression teenagercitation needed music therapy also shown great promise individuals autism serving emotional outlet patients avenues emotional expression understanding may difficult people autism music may provide limited understanding socioemotional cues
