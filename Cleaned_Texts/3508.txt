practices occurring need resist taking first two basic forms argument may take involves different arguments first referred logical version argues acceptance initial act logically entails acceptance b acceptable b undesirable version refined two forms based entails b first argued relevant conceptual difference premises underlie acceptance logically entail acceptance b within euthanasia debate van der burg identifies one richard sherlocks objections duff campbell fitting duff campbell presented argument selective nontreatment newborns suffering serious defects responding duff campbells stance sherlock argued premises employed order justify position would effective justifying nontreatment older children short justification duff campbell propose newborns better justification similar policy

acceptance time lead acceptance process logical necessity one followed process moral enoch describes application form argument thus allow voluntary euthanasia argues may fail make crucial distinction make morally unacceptable outcome allowing involuntary euthanasia perhaps even though may make relevant distinction act accordingly reason perhaps political reason reason weakness reason glover however notes line argument requires good evidence direction followed boundaries thus generally argued employing slippery slope implicit concession starts assumption initial practice acceptable even though lead unacceptable outcomes nevertheless van der burg argues useful concession outcomes intended make clear initial practice justifiable countering first logical version slippery slope argument argued different types euthanasia sufficiently distinct logically inconsistent support one version denying others possible support example voluntary euthanasia denying nonvoluntary euthanasia possible support distinction comes logical inconsistency choice principles focus euthanasia personal choice support voluntary euthanasia nonvoluntary euthanasia focus persons best interests may allow support practical perspective another option faced logical version argument simply accept consequences response duff campbell sherlock rather arguing premises flawed argued sherlock correct criteria could also applied older children thus applied probably caring policy responding arbitrary line version slippery slope argument argued stance relies paradox heap possible draw line acceptable unacceptable
