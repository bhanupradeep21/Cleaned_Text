conservation restoration insect specimens process caring preserving insects part collection conservation concerns begin collection continue preparation storage examination documentation research treatment restoration needed insect collecting done many different ways depending kind insects collected habitats hobbyists professional entomologist found particular ways collect minimal damage specimens following established techniques helps begin conservation insect specimens beginning eliminating much potential damage possible must done delicately ensure neither collector live insect cause harm distinctive features wings legs antennae give purpose collection special collection nets traps techniques must utilized consideration easily breakage happen kill jar often used immediately immobilize insect damage way insect specimen prepared often first step conservation carefully prepared appropriate methods depending size anatomy potentially delicate features ensure break begin role specimen available study research display specimens must prepared using dry method others liquid preserve choice made preserve key features necessary identification represent insects living form closely possible process pinning insect specimens dry method preserve display collections requires special entomological equipment accomplish used primarily hardbodied medium large specimens beneficial easier study color preservation flies butterflies though partially softbodied also best preserved pinning preserved fluid hairs andor scales either clot fall smaller specimens may still pinned use minuten pins much thinner avoid breakage insects pinned foam block specialized pinning blocks provide support limbs drying may moved another specialized protected display case dried completely point brittle pin often driven thorax insect right midline preserve appearance least one side damage occur pinning exception butterflies dragonflies damselflies pinned middle enough pin must left specimen allow labeling carding used pinning would destroy much specimen size quite triangular point cut acid free card ensure best conservation practice comes direct contact specimen pin driven broad side point mounting soluble glue removed solvents necessary used adhere right side thorax specimen point opposite pinned side point sometimes bent allow specimen present position normally pinned specimens wet specimen specimen preserved fluid often alcohol specimens would receive preservation technique usually softbodied caterpillars larva spiders soft abdomens done minimize shriveling allowing identifying characteristics preserved true life possible hardbodied insects may also preserved temporarily alcohol slides small insects also kept part insect collections american institute conservation aic describes code ethics aspects conservation include preventive conservation examination documentation treatment research education areas also apply conservation restoration insect specimens insect collections may suffer multiple types degradation including fading colors light exposure mold growth improper humidity temperature levels infestations pests feed dried much avoidable proper preventive conservation practices followed addition maintaining clean storage environment specimens sometimes necessary clean specimens cleaning incredibly delicate brittle dry insect specimens done carefully methodically conservator chooses appropriate method based kind insect needs cleaning robust cleaning tools vary widely generally clean watercolor brushes used gently dust specimens sometimes stereo microscope small specimens warm water andor alcohol baths used without ultrasonic cleaner lens blowers gently blow away dust dry specimen cleansing common way prevent damage pests intent feed insect specimens dust accumulation collection keep sealed boxes properly sealed also aid preventing damages cause relative humidity rh temperature wet specimens kept separate vials jars secure cabinet tray shelf fluid levels regularly monitored ensure specimens completely immersed fluid though wellsealed jar vial prevent excessive proper handling insect specimens prevents excessive breaking legs antennae body parts could easily lost curved forceps may used allow precision less chance brittle specimen coming contact handler handler picks specimen pin placed enough space specimen handler put pinning block enough space grip without touching integrated pest management ipm specialized modern pest control used ipm systems begin regular sanitation monitoring collections detect castings various pests checking insect traps laid capture identify pests present pests carpet beetles flour beetles feed dried infestation present treatment may necessary freezing commonly used rid insect collections alternatively inert gases may used anoxic fumigation depriving pests oxygen exterminate extreme cases chemical fumigation proven safe collections people may assessing condition insect collection done regularly results recorded accordingly conservator observes specimens high detail remarking areas damage altered states specimen tools used process may include strong light source magnifying glass handling tools allow conservator pick specimen pin without touching observations made examination process result conclusions drawn treatment plan conservator knowledgeable kinds deterioration look specific insect specimens documentation insect specimens carried many different aspects specimens existence documented information begins capture insect collector records information capture method place date capture relevant habitat information field notes information transferred labels collection records documentation path continues every recorded observation treatment specimen receives killing agents preservation agents rehydrating agents fumigants important informs future decisions conservation actions minimum labels contain place date collection identification genus species pinned insects labels likewise pinned space left specimen various ways write information labels ink fade come liquid generally used paper ideally cotton linen rag avoid yellowing embrittlement paper improvements digital photography web resources many natural history museums begun new kind documentation digitization bringing high quality images associated information anyone access internet large databases hold vast amounts information improving research efforts scientific illustration insects older technique used preserve information collected insects visually documents insects unlike photography add intellectual ideas anatomy behavior insect artists renditions scientifically informed observation specimens combined technical aesthetic skill yields highly detailed illustrations necessary documentation species area insect specimen documentation comes close examination specimens conservators conservator records visual information specimen gleaned detailed inspection conclusions drawn inspection potential treatments also documented inform researchers future conservators researching collections insects provides important information develops knowledge ecology human health wellkept records aid researcher identifying whether differences observed specimen damages treatments deterioration research insect collections museums lead new discoveries provide important historical close observation reveals issues present insect collections conservator makes decision actions taken highly preferable treatment applied reversible done little risk specimen example broken limbs may glued back traditionally done white glue advantage white glue removable warm another common problem pest infestation dried insect collections suffered infestation affected specimens frozen sealed inert gases kill pests without harming treatments might include simply refilling wet specimens jars alcohol ensure specimens completely submerged cleaning specimens dust debris repositioning specimens display research case specimen needs repositioned conservator relax specimen jar rehydrating substrate move limbs without breaking technique used vary among conservators use relaxing jar specimen left days substrate choice others may choose use warm water bath drop detergent whatever treatments used diligently documented conservation insect specimens done large part preserve information public display collections museums interpretation offer one avenue accomplishes effort however websites offer unique opportunity disseminate information broad audience layers information give general information provide depth desired websites often also provided museums collections list major educational endeavors interests insect specimens
