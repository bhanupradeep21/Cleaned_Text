nylon bristles attached long handle help facilitate manual action tooth brushing furthermore handle aids reaching far back teeth erupt oral cavity tooth brush arguably persons best tool removing dental plaque teeth thus capable preventing plaquerelated diseases used routinely correctly effectively oral health professionals recommend use tooth brush small head soft bristles effective removing plaque without damaging technique crucial effectiveness tooth brushing disease back forth brushing effective removing plaque gum line tooth brushing employ systematic approach angle bristles angle towards gums make small circular motions action increases effectiveness technique removing plaque gum line electric toothbrushes toothbrushes moving vibrating bristle heads two main types electric toothbrushes sonic type vibrating head oscillatingrotating type bristle head makes constant clockwise anticlockwise movements electric toothbrushes expensive manual toothbrushes damaging sonic ultrasonic toothbrushes vibrate high frequency small amplitude fluid turbulent activity aids plaque rotating type might reduce plaque gingivitis compared manual brushing though currently uncertain whether clinical movements bristles vibrations help break chains bacteria gum oscillatingrotating electric toothbrush hand uses mechanical action produced manual tooth brushing removing plaque via
