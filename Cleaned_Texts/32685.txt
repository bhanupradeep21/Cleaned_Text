ontogeny also ontogenesis origination development organism physical psychological eg moral usually time fertilization egg adult term also used refer study entirety organisms lifespan ontogeny developmental history organism within lifetime distinct phylogeny refers evolutionary history species another way think ontogeny process organism going developmental stages lifetime developmental history includes developmental events occur existence organism beginning changes egg time fertilization events time birth hatching afterward ie growth remolding body shape development secondary sexual characteristics developmental ie ontogenetic processes influence subsequent evolutionary eg phylogenetic see evolutionary developmental biology recapitulation theory individual organisms develop ontogeny species evolve phylogeny ontogeny embryology developmental biology closely related studies terms sometimes used interchangeably aspects ontogeny morphogenesis development form shape organism tissue growth cellular differentiation term ontogeny also used cell biology describe development various cell types within ontogeny useful field study many disciplines including developmental biology cell biology genetics developmental psychology developmental cognitive neuroscience developmental psychobiology ontogeny used anthropology process us embodies history word ontogeny comes greek meaning individual existence suffix geny greek geniea meaning genesis origin mode term ontogeny coined ernst haeckel german zoologist evolutionist haeckel born germany february also strong supporter darwinism haeckel suggested ontogeny briefly sometimes incompletely recapitulated repeated phylogeny book generelle morphologie der organismen general morphology organisms even though book widely read scientific community convinced interested ideas turned producing publications get haeckel others imagined development producing new structures earlier additions developing organism established proposed individual development followed developmental stages previous generations future generations would add something new process causal parallelism animals ontogeny phylogeny addition haeckel suggested biogenetic law ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny based idea successive progressive origin new species based laws successive progressive origin new embryonic structures according haeckel development produced novelties natural selection would eliminate species become outdated obsolete though view development evolution wasnt justifiable future embryologists tweaked collaborated haeckels proposals showed new morphological structures occur hereditary modification embryonic marine biologist walter garstang reversed haeckels relationship ontogeny phylogeny stating ontogeny creates phylogeny recapitulates seminal paper nikolaas tinbergen named ontogeny one four primary questions biology along julian huxleys three others causation survival value tinbergen emphasized change behavioral machinery development distinct change behavior development conclude thrush ie behavioral machinery changed behavior change occurred environment held constantwhen turn description causal analysis ask way observed change behavior machinery brought natural first step try distinguish environmental influences within animalin ontogeny conclusion certain change internally controlled innate reached tinbergen concerned elimination environmental factors difficult establish use word innate often misleading development organism happens fertilization cleavage blastulation gastrulation organogenesis metamorphosis adult species animal slightly different journey stages since stages might shorter longer compared species offspring develops different animal type eg hard egg shell uterus soft egg shell plant leaf humans process fetal development starts sperm fertilizes egg fuse together kickstarting embryonic development fusion egg sperm zygote changes surrounding membrane allow sperm penetrate egg multiple fertilizations prevented fusion zygote also activates egg begin undergoing cell division animal species might specifically sperm egg two gametes contain half species typical genetic material membranes gametes fuse start creating long successful fertilization sperm zygote undergoes many mitotic divisions also nonsexual cell divisions cleavage process cell division starting zygote becomes collection identical cells morula contains cells called cleavage prepares zygote become embryo weeks weeks conception fertilization zygote become embryo continues dividing hollow sphere cells blastula outer cells form single epithelial layer blastoderm essentially encases fluidfilled inside blastocoel figure right shows basic process modified different species blastulation differs slightly different species mammals eightcell stage embryo forms slightly different type blastula called species sea stars frogs chicks mice structures stage yet orientation features differs plus species additional types cells blastulation singlelayered blastula expands reorganizes multiple layers gastrula seen figure right reptiles birds mammals triploblastic organisms meaning gastrula comprises three germ layers endoderm inner layer mesoderm middle layer ectoderm outer seen figure germ layer become multipotent stem cells become specific tissue depending germ layer happens humans differentiation germ layers differs slightly organs tissues organisms corresponding body systems substituted place figure human germ cells able differentiate specific organs tissues become later life germ cells able migrate final locations rearrange organs made two germ layers one outside endoderm cells become internal linings organisms stomach colon small intestine liver pancreas digestive system lungs mesoderm gives rise tissues formed ectoderm heart muscles bones blood dermis skin bone marrow urogenital system germ layer specific species distinguishing layer three identify evolutionarily higher lifeforms eg bilateral organisms like humans lowerlife forms radial symmetry lastly ectoderm outer layer cells become epidermis hair precursor mammary glands central nervous system peripheral nervous figure shows development pig cow rabbit human offspring similar compared one another figure shows germ layers become different organs tissues evolutionarily higher lifeforms species essentially develop similarly additionally shows multiple species develop parallel manner branch develop specific features organism hooves tail ears developing vertebrate offspring neural tube formed either primary secondary neurulation species develop spine nervous system using primary secondary neurulation others use primary secondary human fetal development primary neurulation occurs weeks gestation develop brain spinal cord weeks gestation secondary neurulation forms lower sacral coccygeal diagram right illustrates primary neurulation process cells surrounding neural plate interacting neural plate cells proliferate converge pinch form hollow tube notochord mesoderm process discontinuous start different points along cranialcaudal axis necessary neural crest closes neural crest cells ectoderm cells separate ectoderm becomes epidermis surrounding complex neural crest cells differentiate become components peripheral nervous system animals next notochord degenerates become nucleus pulposus intervertebral discs mesoderm cells differentiate become somites skeletal muscle later also stage neural crest cells become spinal ganglions function brain organisms like earthworms advanced organisms like amphibians birds spinal ganglions consists cluster nerve bodies positioned along spinal cord dorsal ventral roots spinal nerve pair nerves correspond vertebra secondary neurulation caudal sacral regions spine formed primary neurulation finished process initiates primary neurulation finished posterior neuropore closes tail bud proliferate condense create cavity fuse central canal neural tube secondary neurulation occurs small region starting spinal tail bud posterior neuropore open neural folds near tail region dont close primary neurulation canalization progresses next weeks neurons ependymal cells cells create cerebral spinal differentiate become tail end spinal cord next closed neural tube contains neuroepithelial cells immediately divide closure second type cell forms neuroblast neuroblast cells form mantle layer later becomes gray matter gives rise marginal layer becomes white matter spinal secondary neurulation seen neural tube lumbar tail vertebrae frogs chicks instances process like continuation species young organism born hatched sexually mature yet animals young organism looks quite different adult young organism larva intermediate form metamorphosing well known example larval form animal caterpillar butterflies moths caterpillars keep growing feeding order enough energy pupal stage necessary body parts metamorphosis juvenile phase different plants animals plants juvenility early phase plant growth plants cant animals juvenile stage commonly found social mammals wild dogs monkeys apes lions wolves humans puberty marks end stage adolescence follows species begin puberty reproduction juvenile stage female nonhuman larval pupal stages seen figure right process organisms body undergoing structural physical changes birth hatching become suitable adult environment example amphibian tadpoles maturation liver enzymes hemoglobin eye pigments addition nervous digestive reproductive systems species molting juvenile hormones appear regulate figure right shows stages life butterflies metamorphosis transforms caterpillar butterfly adulthood stage physical intellectual maturity achieved differs species humans adulthood thought around years old longest stage life species ends dogs small breeds eg yorkshire terrier chihuahua cocker spaniel etc physically mature faster large breeds eg saint bernard great dane golden retriever etc adulthood reached anywhere months contrast many insect species long larval stages adult stage reproduction silkworm moths dont mouthparts dont feed consume enough food larval stage energy survive senescence cells stop dividing dont die cells build cause problems body cells release substances cause inflammation damage healthy nearby senescence induced unrepaired dna damage eg old age etc cellular also state organisms undergo allometric changes shape grow mature others engage metamorphosis even reptiles nonavian sauropsids eg crocodilians turtles offspring often viewed miniature adults show variety
