polygynandry mating system males females multiple mating partners breeding sexually reproducing diploid animals different mating strategies employed males females cost gamete production lower males different mating tactics employed males females thought outcome stochastic reproductive conflicts ecologically reproductive conflicts animal societies may arise individuals genetically identical different optimal strategies maximizing fitness often found reproductive conflicts generally arise due dominance hierarchy major part reproduction monopolized one individual wasp polistes carolina dominant queen amongst female wasps determined whoever arrives nest first rather largest foundress expected best fighting wasp study bird prunella collaris close proximity sharing ranges mountain tops french pyrenees led polygynandrous mating system two four males would mate range two four females within vicinity polygynandry another way describe multimale multifemale polygamous mating system females multiple mating partners known polyandry males multiple mating partners known polygyny sex potential benefits promiscuous females especially genetically inferior social partners chance increase genetic quality males able fertilize eggs many essentially ideal mating behavior males promiscuous rather monogamous one mating partner leads multiple offspring males monopolize female partners physically preventing copulating hand females benefit polyandry sired oftentimes females mate voluntarily one male mating several males reduces risk females unfertilized eggs one male may enough sperm fertilize darkeyed juncos female mates one male oftentimes social partner lower genetic quality potential sperm females voluntarily mate males besides mate sees potential improve offspring viability sexual females may also mate several males genetic benefits genetic diversity among offspring due variety sperm available song birds extrapair matings occur females able sneak away home territories solicit female song birds seek extramale partners sexually select males colorful plumage elaborate social studies show female song birds less plumage partners actively seek extrapair furthermore males developed longer tails brighter plumage survive better thus female song birds multiple mating partners increasing genetic quality offspring female multiple mating means increase number young female produce oftentimes also means increase number young take care order ensure safety wellbeing offspring females may multiple mating partners order gain resources males darkeyed juncos dunnocks galapagos hawks mating multiple males increases amount care female gain oftentimes multiple mates allow females sired offspring paternity offspring typically falls outside biological different male may look another males males potentially fertilize eggs much faster rate females produce meaning male best increase reproductive success finding fertilizing many different females drosophila melanogaster reproductive success males increased number matings females direct relationship number mates number offspring males multiple mating partners sometimes share parentage offspring reducing genetic value offspring thus reduces relative benefit staying paternity shared multiple males males expected less likely stay order help female care offspring little benefit staying help raise offspring males although males able increase reproductive success faster females able fertilize eggs faster females produce males also disadvantage comes mating sexual selection females usually choose males charming display sexual study longtailed widowbirds males longer tails sexually selected shorter less impressive birds redcollared widowbird males display sexual ornament courtship generally paired faster attract females males display shorter tails males often sexually selected based physical characteristics offer example male peacocks flamboyant colored tails sexually selected dull less elaborate sexual selection males females also leads malemale competition unlike females invest lot prior mating males invest much generating sperm however increases competition amongst males female investment high mating competition also means greater variance male best competitors better success mating fail mate best competitors less likely inclined care offspring upon mating ability produce offspring elsewhere males greatest size strength best developed weapons achieve greatest mating success cases males may higher reproductive success better access resources instance female hanging flies mate male provides large insect eat copulation north american bullfrogs protect ponds small lakes females come lay various mating tactics found broad number taxa amphibians salamandrina perspicillata multiple paternity consequence females mating multiple species suborder salamandroidea shown employ polyandrous mating strategies study population salamandrina perspicillata multiple paternity occurs pervasive reproductive strategy natural conditions seen species males mated two females sired offspring inversely related genetic similarity females species practiced polygynandry order increase genetic variability among offspring choosing mates genetically different unlike studies polygynandry females multiple mating partners order gain resources male study salamandrina perspicillata multiple paternity provide genetic indirect benefit resulted costbenefit mechanism gained benefit multiple mating counterbalanced negative effect number mates offspring females choosing mates genetically different also seen ichthyosaura alpestris lissotriton vulgaris twomale mating system lessrelated males preferred like case salamandrina perspicillata indirect genetic benefits gained multiple mating partners ammothea hilgendorfi sea spider species fertilization occurs female transfers eggs male holds ovigers specialized pair legs fertilizes eggs males glue eggs clusters carries eggs ovigers personal cost males providing prolonged care young seen significant parental investment parental assurance thought substantial postzygotic high level paternity assurance ammothea hilgendorfi suggests reduced foraging ability increased predation risk lower mobility experimental study ammothea hilgendorfi showed although males mate multiple females males mix egg batches different eggs held clusters male hatched close time frame indicating males mated different females within short time multiple mating female pycnogonids possible since recently mated female often retains unused mature eggs one femora allows mate additional partners species external fertilization male parental care females able distribute clutch amongst different males female increases likelihood least offspring receive indirect genetic benefits andor extensive parental care quality reproductive females social bees multiple partners females called queens distinguish nonreprodutive females tend colony mate honey bee queen ideally mates dozen drones males nuptial flight sperm matings stored special reservoir called spermatheca life several years although promiscuity said benefit males females yet sufficient data support fact promiscuity benefits females study darkeyed juncos offspring produced extrapair males neither better worse offspring male social however study darkeyed juncos reveal sired offspring promiscuous females monogamous females study female water striders results showed multiple matings become costly since lot time energy invested producing extra matings costly support genetic benefits multiple mating instead results experiment showed egg production egg hatching success highest number partners kept hand studies shown males higher reproductive success females compared female chimpanzees male chimpanzees better ratio number matings number offspring produced studies show higher reproductive success columbian ground squirrels exhibited significant malebiased sexual size body mass suggesting malemale malemale competition means sexual dimorphism amongst males means females able sexually select males based sexual ornaments display overall studies shown polygynandry benefits males benefits females polygynandry observed different species males often upper males benefit polygynandry females females generally seek multiple mating partners order increase benefits offspring whether gaining physical resources offspring providing offspring healthier genes fit hand cases males generally multiple mating partners order obtain much offspring lifespan able achieve easier females cases males parentally involved caring raising httpsenwikipediaorgwikipolygynandry
