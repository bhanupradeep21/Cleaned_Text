largely neglected strong mechanistic parallels melody phrasing rhythm speech music lexical tone refers pitch speech vehicle semantic meaning importance pitch conveying musical ideas wellknown linguistic importance pitch less obvious tonal languages thai cantonese wherein lexical meaning sound depends heavily pitch relative sounds seen evolutionary artifacts musilanguage nontonal intonation languages depend heavily pitch lexical meaning seen evolutionary latecomers discarded dependence tone intermediate states known pitch accent languages exhibit lexical dependence tone also depend heavily intonation exemplified japanese swedish serbocroatian combinatorial formation refers ability form small phrases different tonal elements phrases must able exhibit melodic rhythmic semantic variation must able combine phrases create global melodic formulas capable conveying emotive meaning examples modern speech would rules arranging letters form words words form sentences music notes different scales combined according unique rules form larger musical ideas expressive phrasing device expressive emphasis added phrases local sense individual units global sense phrases level numerous

confrontational aggressive scavenging theorized humming could played important role early human hominid evolution contact calls many social animals produce seemingly haphazard indistinctive sounds like chicken cluck going everyday business foraging feeding sounds two functions let group members know among kin danger case appearance signs danger suspicious sounds movements forest animal notices

notice phenomenon observed among wild horses jordania suggested humans many social animals silence sign danger thats gentle humming musical sounds relax humans see use gentle music music therapy lullabies scholars agree singing strongly present many different wide dispersal singing behavior among different animal species like birds gibbons whales many others strongly suggests singing appeared independently different species currently species animals known sing least singing species demonstrate ability learn songs improvise even compose new animal species singing group activity see example
