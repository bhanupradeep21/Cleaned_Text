thorax pl thoraces chest part anatomy humans mammals tetrapod animals located neck insects crustaceans extinct trilobites thorax one three main divisions creatures body turn composed multiple segments human thorax includes thoracic cavity thoracic wall contains organs including heart lungs thymus gland well muscles various internal structures many diseases may affect chest one common symptoms chest pain word thorax comes greek θώραξ thorax breastplate cuirass via latin humans hominids thorax chest region body neck abdomen along internal organs contents mostly protected supported rib cage spine shoulder girdle contents thorax include heart lungs thymus gland major minor pectoral muscles trapezius muscles neck muscle internal structures diaphragm esophagus trachea part sternum known xiphoid process arteries veins also contained aorta superior vena cava inferior vena cava pulmonary artery bones shoulder socket containing upper part humerus scapula sternum thoracic portion spine collarbone rib cage floating ribs external structures skin nipples human body region thorax neck diaphragm front body called chest corresponding area animal also referred chest shape chest correspond part thoracic skeleton encloses heart lungs breadth shoulders due shoulder girdle contains axillae heads humeri middle line suprasternal notch seen three fingers breadth transverse ridge felt known sternal angle marks junction manubrium body sternum level line second ribs join sternum found lower ribs often counted lower part sternum seventh last true ribs join ensiform cartilage begins often depression known pit stomach bones thorax called thoracic skeleton component axial skeleton consists ribs sternum ribs thorax numbered ascending order known floating ribs anterior attachment point particular cartilage attached sternum therefore termed floating whereas ribs termed false ribs costal cartilage articulates costal cartilage rib thorax bones also main function protecting heart lungs major blood vessels thorax area aorta anatomy chest also described use anatomical landmarks nipple male situated front fourth rib little vertically lies little external line drawn middle clavicle female constant little lower limit great pectoral muscle seen running upward outward axilla female obscured breast extends second sixth rib vertically edge sternum midaxillary line laterally female nipple surrounded half inch less pigmented disc areola apex normal heart fifth left intercostal space three half inches midline different types diseases conditions affect chest include pleurisy flail chest atelectasis common condition chest pain conditions hereditary caused birth defects trauma condition lowers ability either breathe deeply cough considered chest disease condition injury chest also referred chest trauma thoracic injury thoracic trauma results deaths due trauma united major pathophysiologies encountered blunt chest trauma involve derangements flow air blood combination sepsis due leakage alimentary tract contents esophageal perforations also must considered blunt trauma commonly results chest wall injuries eg rib fractures pain associated injuries make breathing difficult may compromise ventilation direct lung injuries pulmonary contusions see image frequently associated major chest trauma may impair ventilation similar mechanism chest pain result multiple issues including respiratory problems digestive issues musculoskeletal complications pain trigger cardiac issues well pain felt associated heart taken lightly either symptoms different depending cause cardiac issues cause feelings sudden pressure chest crushing pain back neck arms pain felt due noncardiac issues gives burning feeling along digestive tract pain deep breaths attempted different people feel pains differently condition patient truly knows symptoms mild serious chest pain may symptom myocardial infarctions heart attack condition present body discomfort felt chest similar heavy weight placed body sweating shortness breath lightheadedness irregular heartbeat may also experienced heart attack occurs bulk damage caused first six hours getting proper treatment quickly possible important people especially elderly diabetes may typical chest pain may many symptoms heart attack important patients caregivers good understanding heart attack symptoms like heart attack chest pain caused conditions involving heart chest wall pain experienced increase activity persons add exercise daily routine generally feel type pain beginningcitation needed important monitor pain ensure sign something serious pain also experienced persons upper respiratory infection virus also accompanied fever cough shingles another viral infection give symptoms chest rib pain rash develops injuries rib cage sternum also common cause chest pain generally felt deep breaths taken cough another noncardiac cause chest pain atelectasis condition occurs portion lung collapses airless bronchial tubes blocked condition develops causes patients feel shortness breath common cause atelectasis bronchi extends windpipe blocked traps air blockage may caused something inside bronchus plug mucus tumour inhaled foreign object coin piece food possible something outside bronchus cause blockage pneumothorax condition air gas build pleural space occur without known cause result lung disease acute lung size pneumothorax changes air gas builds medical procedure release pressure needle untreated blood flow interrupted cause drop blood pressure known tension pneumothorax possible smaller cases clear symptoms condition often felt one side lung shortness breath mammals thorax region body formed sternum thoracic vertebrae ribs extends neck diaphragm include upper limbs heart lungs reside thoracic cavity well many blood vessels inner organs protected rib cage sternum thoracic vertebrae also distinguished birds reptiles insects crustaceans extinct trilobites thorax one three main divisions creatures body turn composed multiple segments area wings legs attach insects area multiple articulating plates trilobites insects thorax composed three segments prothorax mesothorax metathorax extant insects prothorax never wings though legs always present adults wings present restricted least mesothorax typically also metathorax though wings may reduced modified either segments apocritan hymenoptera first abdominal segment fused metathorax forms structure known propodeum accordingly insects functional thorax composed four segments therefore typically called mesosoma distinguish thorax insects thoracic
