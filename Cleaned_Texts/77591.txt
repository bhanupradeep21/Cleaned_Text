grow become adults normal size intelligence usually without syndromic features childhoodcitation needed children bws develop cancer however children bws much likely times children develop certain childhood cancers particularly wilms tumor nephroblastoma pancreatoblastoma individuals bws appear increased risk cancer childhood especially age four increased risk developing cancer children bws

ganglioneuroma adrenocortical carcinoma acute lymphoid leukemia liver sarcoma thyroid carcinoma melanoma rhabdomyosarcoma mesoblastic wilms tumor hepatoblastoma mesoblastic nephroma usually cured diagnosed early early diagnosis allows physicians treat cancer early stage addition less toxic given importance early diagnosis children bws receive cancer abdominal ultrasound every months least

diastasis recti usually require treatment condition resolves child growscitation needed neonatal hypoglycemia low blood glucose first month life occurs half children hypoglycemic newborns asymptomatic normal blood glucose level within days however untreated persistent hypoglycemia lead permanent brain damage hypoglycemia newborns bws managed according standard protocols treating neonatal hypoglycemia usually hypoglycemia easily treated frequent feedings medical doses glucose rarely children bws continue hypoglycemia neonatal period require intensive children may require tube feedings
