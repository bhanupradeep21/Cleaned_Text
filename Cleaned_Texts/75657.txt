chickenpox chicken pox also known varicella highly contagious vaccinepreventable disease caused initial infection varicella zoster virus vzv member herpesvirus disease results characteristic skin rash forms small itchy blisters eventually scab usually starts chest back spreads rest rash symptoms fever tiredness headaches usually last five seven complications may occasionally include pneumonia inflammation brain bacterial skin disease usually severe adults chickenpox airborne disease easily spreads via humantohuman transmission typically coughs sneezes infected incubation period days characteristic rash may spread one two days rash appears lesions crusted may also spread contact shingles may spread chickenpox immune contact disease usually diagnosed based presenting however unusual cases may confirmed polymerase chain reaction pcr testing blister fluid testing antibodies may done determine person people usually get chickenpox although reinfections virus occur reinfections usually cause since introduction united states varicella vaccine resulted decrease number cases complications protects percent people disease greater benefit severe routine immunization children recommended many immunization within three days exposure may improve outcomes treatment infected may include calamine lotion help itching keeping fingernails short decrease injury scratching

prevented isolating affected individuals contagion exposure respiratory droplets direct contact lesions within period lasting three days onset rash four days onset chickenpox virus susceptible disinfectants notably chlorine bleach ie sodium hypochlorite like enveloped viruses sensitive drying heat chickenpox prevented side effects usually mild pain swelling injection live attenuated varicella vaccine oka strain developed michiaki takahashi colleagues japan early merck co licensed oka strain varicella virus united states maurice hillemans team merck invented varicella vaccine varicella vaccine recommended many countries require varicella vaccination exemption entering elementary school second dose recommended five years initial vaccinated person likely milder case chickenpox become immunization within three days following household contact reduces infection rates severity exposed chickenpox adult example contact infected children may boost immunity shingles therefore thought majority children vaccinated chickenpox adults might lose natural boosting immunity would drop shingles cases would hand current observations suggest exposure children varicella critical factor maintenance immunity multiple subclinical reactivations varicella zoster virus may occur spontaneously despite causing clinical disease may still provide endogenous boost immunity vaccine part routine immunization schedule european countries include part universal vaccinations countries provide uk vaccine recommended people particularly vulnerable chickenpox keep virus circulation thereby exposing population virus early age less harmful reduce occurrence shingles repeated exposure virus later november uk joint committee vaccination immunisation recommended children given vaccine ages months months however yet implemented populations immunized immunity questionable clinician may order enzyme immunoassay immunoassay measures levels antibodies virus give immunity person levels antibodies low low titer questionable reimmunization may treatment mainly consists easing symptoms protective measure people usually required stay home infectious avoid spreading disease others cutting fingernails short wearing gloves may prevent scratching minimize risk secondary although formal clinical studies evaluating effectiveness topical application calamine lotion topical barrier preparation containing zinc oxide one commonly used interventions excellent safety maintaining good hygiene daily cleaning skin warm water help avoid secondary bacterial scratching may increase risk secondary paracetamol acetaminophen aspirin may used reduce fever aspirin use someone chickenpox may cause serious sometimes fatal disease liver brain reye syndrome people risk developing severe complications significant exposure virus may given intramuscular varicella zoster immune globulin vzig preparation containing high titres antibodies varicella zoster virus ward antivirals sometimes aciclovir mouth started within hours rash onset decreases symptoms one day effect complication use aciclovir therefore currently recommended individuals normal immune function children younger years old older one month meant receive antiviral drugs unless another medical condition puts risk developing treatment chickenpox children aimed symptoms immune system deals virus children younger years cutting fingernails keeping clean important part treatment likely scratch blisters deeply aspirin highly contraindicated children younger years related reye infection otherwise healthy adults tends treatment antiviral drugs eg aciclovir valaciclovir generally advised long started within hours rash remedies ease symptoms chickenpox adults basically used children adults often prescribed antiviral medication effective reducing severity condition likelihood developing complications adults advised increase water intake reduce dehydration relieve headaches painkillers paracetamol acetaminophen recommended effective relieving itching symptoms fever pains antihistamines relieve itching may used cases itching prevents sleep also act sedative children antiviral medication considered useful adults prone develop complications include pregnant women people weakened immune duration visible blistering caused varicella zoster virus varies children usually days appearance new blisters begins subside fifth day chickenpox infection milder young children symptomatic treatment sodium bicarbonate baths antihistamine medication may ease itching adults disease though incidence much less common infection adults associated greater morbidity mortality due pneumonia either direct viral pneumonia secondary bacterial bronchitis either viral bronchitis secondary bacterial particular pregnant women chickenpox develop pneumonia severity increases onset later gestation england wales deaths due chickenpox inflammation brain encephalitis occur immunocompromised individuals although risk higher herpes necrotizing fasciitis also rare varicella lethal individuals impaired immunity number people highrisk group increased due hiv epidemic increased use immunosuppressive varicella particular problem hospitals patients immune systems weakened drugs eg highdose steroids secondary bacterial infection skin lesions manifesting impetigo cellulitis erysipelas common complication healthy children disseminated primary varicella infection usually seen immunocompromised may high morbidity ninety percent cases varicella pneumonia occur adult
