united states environmental protection agency us epa addition restrictions within united states use pesticide banned several countries including denmark finland norway gone series tests regulations order evaluate risks hazards environment animals among research main finding vinclozolin shown endocrine disruptor antiandrogenic effectscitation needed vinclozolin manufactured chemical company basf registered use united states since following compilation data indicating national use vinclozolin per crop lbs aiyr apricots cherries green beans lettuce nectarines onions peaches plums raspberries strawberries two applications totaling pounds applied kiwifruit california prevent gray mold soft rot caused botrytis general united states seen overall decline national use vinclozolin total approximately pounds used however number dropped following chemical reactions used make one method combines methyl vinyl ketone sodium cyanide phosgene process involves formation cyanohydrin followed hydrolysis vinclozolin also prepared reaction isocyanate alkyl ester acid ring closure achieved elevated vinclozolin formulated dry flowable extruded granular applied air aerial irrigation systems chemigation ground equipment vinclozolin also applied plants decorative flowers dip treatment plant dipped fungicide solution dried also common spray vinclozolin solution using thermal foggers pesticides sold distributed united states must registered us epa pesticides first registered november reregistered retested using advanced methods vinclozolin released gone preliminary subsequent list history regulations vinclozolin us epa examined dietary food water nondietary occupational exposure vinclozolin metabolites general fungicides shown circulate water air possible end untreated foods application consumers alone easily reduce exposure fungicides removed produce washed tap key example exposure vinclozolin wine grapes considered account total vinclozolin determined people may exposed residues vinclozolin metabolites containing moiety diet thus tolerance limits established although vinclozolin registered use homeowners still possible people come contact fungicide residues example golfers playing treated golf courses families playing sod previously treated may risk occupationally workers exposed vinclozolin activities loading part reregistration process us epa reviewed toxicity studies vinclozolin main effect induced vinclozolin related antiandrogenic activity ability act competitive antagonist androgen receptorcitation needed vinclozolin mimic male hormones like testosterone bind androgen receptors necessarily activating receptors properly evidence vinclozolin binds weakly androgen receptor least two metabolites responsible much antiandrogenic male rats given low dose levels mgkgday vinclozolin effects decreased prostate weight weight reduction sex organs nipple development decreased anogenital distance noted higher dose levels male sex organ weight decreased sex organ malformations seen reduced penis size appearance vaginal pouches rat model shown antiandrogenic effects vinclozolin prominent developmental utero sensitive period fetal development occurs gestation days embryonic exposure vinclozolin influence sexual differentiation gonadal formation reproductive bird models vinclozolin metabolites shown vitro vivo inhibit androgen receptor binding gene expression vinclozolin caused reduced egg laying reduced fertility rate reduction successful androgens also play role puberty shown antiandrogen like vinclozolin delay pubertal antiandrogenic toxins also known alter sexual differentiation reproduction rabbit model male rabbits exposed vinclozolin utero infancy show sexual interest females since androgen receptor widely conserved across species lines antiandrogenic effects would expected vertebrates vinclozolin also acts neuroendocrine disruptor affecting behaviors tied locomotion cognition rats vinclozolin shown affect steroid hormone receptors progesterone estrogen androgens timing exposure vinclozolin determines magnitude effects related hormones study rats vitro research showed ability two vinclozolin metabolites bind progesterone receptor however study vivo using adult male rats showed mice experienced vinclozolin exposure utero male offspring exhibited upregulated estrogen receptor upregulated progesterone receptor females vinclozolin downregulated expression estrogen receptors upregulated progesterone receptor expression result causes virilization feminization males masculinization rats vinclozolin demonstrated trangenerational effects meaning initial animal affected effects also seen subsequent generations one study demonstrated vinclozolin impaired male fertility first generation exposed utero males born three generations furthermore affected males mated normal females offspring sterile reduced fertility three generations male offspring continued show low sperm count prostate disease high rates testicular cell studies conducted experiments rat embryos exposed vinclozolin sex determination first generation vinclozolin treated males bred vinclozolin treated females pattern continued three generations initial mother subject directly exposed doses vinclozolin generation males showed increase prevalence tumors prostate disease kidney disease test abnormalities immune failures compared control group females also showed increased incidence tumors kidney furthermore transgenerationally transmitted changes mate preference anxiety behavior also observed rats following exposure reported transgenerational reports correlate epigenetic changes specifically alteration dna methylation male germ however transgenerational changes successfully reproduced basf scientists manufacturer vinclozolin us epa classified vinclozolin possible human carcinogen vinclozolin induces increase leydig cell tumors rats metabolite thought possess mode tumor induction based similarity laboratory test indicate vinclozolin easily breaks dissipates environment help microbes several metabolites resists terrestrial field dissipation studies conducted various states vinclozolin dissipated halflife days halflives including residues reach days residues may accumulate available future crop since phaseout vinclozolin farmers faced fewer options control gray white mold new york
