fail time requiring second surgery make repairs one surgical procedure used called nissen fundoplication fundoplication gastric fundus upper part stomach wrapped plicated around inferior part esophagus preventing herniation stomach hiatus diaphragm reflux gastric acid procedure commonly performed laparoscopically proper patient selection laparoscopic fundoplication studies century
