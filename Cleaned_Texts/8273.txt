pelvic girdle pain abbreviated pgp described pregnancy discomfort women severe disability others pgp cause pain instability limitation mobility functioning three pelvic joints pgp long history recognition mentioned later described medical literature affection appears consist relaxation pelvic articulations becoming apparent suddenly parturition gradually pregnancy permitting degree mobility pelvic bones effectively hinders locomotion gives rise peculiar alarming sensations prior century specialists pregnancyrelated pgp used varying terminologies referred pregnancy related pelvic girdle pain may incorporate following conditions classification hormonal mechanical pelvic girdle instability longer used treatment andor prognosis makes difference whether complaints started pregnancy childbirth mens combination postural changes position weight baby unstable pelvic joints influence pregnancy hormones changes centre gravity add varying degrees pain discomfort cases come suddenly following fall sudden abduction thighs opening wide quickly action strained joint pgp begin early first trimester pregnancy pain usually felt low symphyseal joint area may extremely tender touch pain may also felt hips groin lower abdomen radiate inner thighs women pgp may begin waddle shuffle may aware audible clicking sound coming pelvis pgp develop slowly pregnancy gradually gaining severity pregnancy progresses pregnancy postpartum symphyseal gap felt moving straining walking climbing stairs turning bed activities difficult even impossible pain may remain static eg one place front pelvis producing feeling kicked cases may start one area move areas also possible woman may experience combination symptoms weight bearing activity potential aggravating already unstable pelvis producing symptoms may limit ability woman carry many daily activities may experience pain involving movements dressing getting bath rolling bed climbing stairs sexual activity pain may also present lifting carrying pushing pulling symptoms severity experienced women pgp vary include severity instability pelvis measured three level scale pelvic type pelvic ligaments support pelvis sufficiently even muscles used incorrectly complaints occur performing everyday activities common situation persons never pregnant never accident hypermobile pelvic type ligaments alone support joint sufficiently coordinated use muscles around joint compensate ligament weakness case muscles around joint function patient experience pain weakness performing everyday activities type often occurs giving birth child weighing grams cases hypermobility sometimes accident involving pelvis type common form pelvic instability treatment based learning use muscles around pelvis efficiently pelvic type ligaments support joint sufficiently serious situation whereby muscles around joint unable compensate ligament weakness type pelvic instability usually occurs accident occasionally small accident combination giving birth sometimes small accident occurring long giving birth forgotten pelvic instability attributed childbirth although difference type often difficult establish case doubt exercise program may help patient however pelvic type diagnosed invasive treatment option case parts pelvis screwed together mens pgp pregnancy seriously interferes participation society activities daily life average sick leave due posterior pelvic pain pregnancy cases women pgp may also experience emotional problems anxiety cause pain resentment anger lack selfesteem frustration depression three times likely develop postpartum depressive psychosocial risk factors associated woman experiencing pgp include higher level stress low job satisfaction poorer relationship sometimes obvious explanation cause pgp usually combination factors pregnancy related pelvic girdle pain pgp either specific trauma injury pelvic joints genetical ie connective tissue disease nonspecific pgp disorder complex multifactorial likely

bony part skeleton contains three joints pubic symphysis two sacroiliac joints highly durable network ligaments surrounds joints giving tremendous strength pubic symphysis fibrocartilage joint may contain fluid filled cavity avascular supported superior arcuate ligaments sacroiliac joints synovial movement restricted throughout life progressively obliterated adhesions nature bony pelvic ring

relaxin hormone produced mainly corpus luteum ovary breast pregnant nonpregnant females pregnancy also produced placenta chorion decidua body produces relaxin menstruation rises peak within approximately days ovulation declines pregnant cycles rather subsiding relaxin secretion continues rise first trimester final weeks pregnancy relaxin diverse range effects including production remodelling collagen thus increasing elasticity muscles tendons ligaments tissues birth canal view delivery although relaxins main cellular action pregnancy remodel collagen biosynthesis thus facilitating changes connective tissue seem generate musculoskeletal problems european research determined relaxin levels predictor pgp pregnant woman different pattern gait step lengthens pregnancy progresses due weight gain changes posture length height footstep shortens pgp sometimes foot turn inwards due rotation hips pelvic joints unstable average womans foot grow half size pregnancy pregnancy hormones released adapt bodily changes also remodel ligaments foot addition increased body weight pregnancy fluid retention weight gain lowers arches adding foots length width increase load lateral side foot hind foot changes may also responsible musculoskeletal complaints lower limb pain pregnant women motion walking upward movement pelvis one side required let leg follow faster longer step pelvis adjusts accordingly flexibility within knees ankles hips stabilized pelvis normal gait tends minimize displacement centre gravity whereas abnormal gait pelvic instability tends amplify displacement pregnancy may increased demand placed hip abductor hip extensor ankle plantar flexor muscles walking avoid pain weight bearing structures short stance phase limp occurs injured sides called antalgic gait number treatments evidence benefits include exercise paracetamol acetaminophen found effective nsaids sometimes effective used weeks tentative evidence pelvic joint trauma respond conservative type treatments orthopedic surgery might become option stabilize joints women pgp resolves weeks delivery last years resulting reduced tolerance weight bearing activities pgp take weeks months even years postpartum however research supports average time complete recovery years severe case longer recovery overall pregnant women women postpartum pregnancy serious pain occurs severe disability patients pregnancy problems serious correlation age culture nationality numbers pregnancies determine higher incidence woman experiences pgp one pregnancy likely experience subsequent
