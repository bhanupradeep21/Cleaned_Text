material germ became official ideological doctrine stalins ussr incorporated darwinian evolutionary theory integral part providing scientific background state atheism initially lamarckian principle inheritance acquired traits considered legitimate part evolutionary theory even darwin recognized although lamarckian hypothesis essentially abandoned west still part soviet ideological doctrine besides fervent old style darwinism marx engels included elements lamarckian theory two factors prevented abandonment lamarckian doctrine ussr first ivan pavlov discovered conditional reflex initially announced conditional reflex mice subsequent withdrawal claim light new evidences didnt lead abandonment lamarckian doctrine soviet second ivan michurins work plant breeding interpreted proof inheritance acquired traits bolstered antimendelian theoretical soviet agriculture around crisis due forced collectivisation farms extermination kulak farmers resulting soviet famine provoked government search solution critical lack lysenkos attack bourgeois pseudoscience modern genetics proposal plants rapidly adjust changed environment suited ideological battle agriculture soviet state media published enthusiastic articles siberia transformed land orchards gardens soviet people change nature anyone opposing lysenko presented defender mysticism obscurantism wave number pseudoscientific academics emerged promote new marxist sciences olga lepeshinskaya pravda reported perpetual motion engine constructed one saratov factory confirms engels claim energy dissipated one place must concentrate another place rejecting natural selection mendelian genetics trofim lysenko claimed developed agricultural techniques could radically increase crop yields included vernalization species transformation inheritance acquired characteristics vegetative claimed particular vernalization exposing wheat seeds humidity low temperature could greatly increase crop yield claimed could transform one species triticum durum durum wheat spring wheat another triticum vulgare common wheat autumn wheat years autumn planting since durum tetraploid chromosomes sets vulgare hexaploid chromosomes sets western geneticists time already knew lysenko claimed concept gene bourgeois invention denied presence immortal substance heredity clearly defined species claimed belong metaphysics rather strictly materialist marxist science instead proposed marxist genetics postulating unlimited ability transformation living organisms mere environmental changes complied marxian laws dialectics everything changes suited party postulate new soviet man created unlimited ability transfer nature benefit lysenko refused idea random mutations stating science enemy lysenko claimed lamarckian inheritance acquired characteristics occurred plants eyes potato tubers though genetic differences plant parts already known somatic also claimed tree grafted scion permanently changes heritable characteristics stock method vegetative hybridization theoretically possible horizontal gene transfer however lysenko rejected idea genes vector process isaak izrailevich prezent brought lysenko public attention using soviet propaganda portray genius developed new revolutionary agricultural technique lysenkos resulting popularity gave platform denounce theoretical genetics promote agricultural practices turn supported soviet propaganda machine overstated successes cited faked experimental results omitted mention lysenkos political success mostly due appeal communist party soviet ideology following disastrous collectivization efforts late lysenkos new methods seen soviet officials paving way agricultural revolution lysenko peasant family enthusiastic advocate partycontrolled newspapers applauded lysenkos practical efforts questioned motives lysenkos revolution agriculture powerful propaganda advantage academics urged patience observation required lysenko admitted hierarchy communist party put charge agricultural affairs used position denounce biologists flylovers people decry wreckers biology claimed trying disable soviet economy cause fail furthermore denied distinction theoretical applied biology concepts control groups statistics biologists take slightest interest mathematical calculations confirm useless statistical formulae mendelists want submit blind chance maintain biological regularities resemble mathematical laws lysenko presented follower ivan vladimirovich michurin wellknown wellliked soviet horticulturist unlike michurin advocated form lamarckism insisting using hybridization grafting nongenetic support joseph stalin increased lysenkos momentum popularity lysenko compared opponents biology peasants still resisted soviet governments collectivization strategy saying opposing theories traditional geneticists setting marxism stalin audience speech made first one stand applaud calling bravo comrade lysenko joseph stalin personally edited speech lysenko way reflected support despite skepticism toward lysenkos assertion science classoriented official support emboldened lysenko gave prezent free rein

flies criticized bourgeois capitalist imperialist promoter fascism left ussr returning america via republican genetics officially declared bourgeois biologists imprisoned executed attempting oppose lysenkoism genetics research effectively destroyed death stalin due lysenkoism crop yields ussr actually end situation started change newspapers published articles criticizing lysenkoism however return regular genetics slowed nikita khrushchevs time lysenko showed supposed successes experimental agricultural complex forbidden criticize lysenkoism though possible express different views geneticists imprisoned stalin released rehabilitated posthumously ban finally waived west meanwhile lysenkoism increasingly became seen century lysenkoism discussed russia including newspapers like
