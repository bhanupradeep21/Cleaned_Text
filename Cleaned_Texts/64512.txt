sixth extinction unnatural history nonfiction book written elizabeth kolbert published henry holt company book argues earth midst modern manmade sixth extinction book kolbert chronicles previous mass extinction events compares accelerated widespread extinctions present time also describes specific species extinguished humans well ecologies surrounding prehistoric nearpresent extinction events author received pulitzer prize general nonfiction book target audience general reader scientific descriptions rendered understandable prose writing blends explanations treks remote areas interviews scientists researchers guides without advocating position pursuit objectivity hence sixth mass extinction theme applied flora fauna existing diverse habitats panamanian rainforest great barrier reef andes bikini atoll city zoos authors backyard book also applies theme number habitats organisms throughout world researching current mainstream view relevant peerreviewed science kolbert estimates flora fauna loss end century percent living species kolbert equates current general unawareness issue previous widespread disbelief centuries preceding late time believed prehistoric mass extinctions never occurred also believed natural forces powerful enough extinguish species en masse likewise time possible finality presented issue results denialism scientific studies shown human behavior disrupts earths balanced interconnected systems putting survival danger consequently earth systems currently affected global atmosphere water cycle oceans heat absorption ocean acidity effect coral reefs soil moisture drought conditions plant destruction pestsnonindigenous fauna heat stress heat regulation earths ice human species contributes disruption even without intending innate capabilities alter planet stage cultural evolution instance ability harness energy beneath earths surface homo sapiens also ability adapt relatively quickly almost environment planets surface species however hard time relocating new suitable habitats unable migrate ahead current rapid ecological changes hampered artificial barriers roadways cityscapes suburban sprawl increase discontinuity viable habitats throughout elizabeth kolbert science writer new yorker magazine author field notes catastrophe well several books writing focuses effects humans civilization planets ecosystem much writing involves experiences various locations noted previously reporter new york kolbert resides williamstown massachusetts husband children writes home office across mount greylock pertaining book kolbert interviewed national news media kolberts decision write book influenced proceedings national academy sciences paper titled midst sixth mass extinction view world amphibians subsequently kolbert wrote article new yorker titled similarly eventual book sixth researching article involved amphibianhunting panama realized hadnt scratched surface book ancestors frogs crawled water around million years ago million years ago frogs earliest representation would become modern amphibian orders amphibians earth longer mammals birds even dinosaurs recently reported extinction rate frogs increasing based observed extinction rates far beyond expected background extinction rates predict event catastrophic nature headed decade ago panamanian golden frogs plentiful numbers easy find around panama however within past couple years frogs started disappear kolbert states studies national zoological park washington dc mycologist university maine identified reason increased mortality panamanian frogs type chytrid however chytrid fungi naturally found panama left puzzling question fungus get panama evidence indicates humans instrumental fungus traveled kolbert uses frogfungus relationship symbol humans introducing invasive species various environments native species would normally proper distribution alleles environment kolbert explains fossils american mastodon mammut americanum shaped georges cuviers views catastrophism according cuvier reason mastodon died mastodon large enough avoid predation large enough teeth consume abrasive diet phenotypes increased chances survival cuvier concluded must sudden violent natural catastrophes caused mass extinctions viable kolbert uses mastodon symbol idea catastrophe important mechanism extinction great auk large flightless bird lived northern hemisphere large intricately grooved beak first settlers arrived iceland auk population probably millions however settlers found auks good nourishing meat also used oily bodies fuel fish bait feathers stuffing despite attempts protecting species last auks killed kolbert uses great auk symbol human overexploitation resources another important mechanism extinction kolbert explains main cause extinction event impact asteroid dust created impact debris impact incinerated anything states impossible estimate full extent various species died due catastrophe however one class animals know die effects asteroids impact ammonites kolbert explains even though ammonites fit current environment single moment completely change traits advantageous kolbert uses extinction graptolites clades explain glaciation mechanism extinction explains carbon dioxide levels air high typically accompanying increase temperatures sea level right around time graptolites became extinct carbon dioxide levels dropped temperatures fell sea levels plummeted caused change chemistry ocean devastating impact life kolbert states human activity transformed third half land surface planet dammed major rivers world increased levels nitrogen higher fixed naturally terrestrial ecosystems used half worlds readily accessible freshwater runoff removed one third primary producers oceans coastal waters changed composition atmosphere deforestation fossil fuel since beginning industrial revolution seen increasing levels carbon dioxide atmosphere alarming rate studies show added approximately billion tons burning fossil fuels additional billion tons result deforestation add another billion tons year amount increasing percent annually essentially increased concentration carbon dioxide air higher last several million carbon dioxide absorbed oceans create carbonic acid lowering ph ocean killing much marine life kolbert uses drastic decline life forms around castello aragonese warning sign come continue increase carbon dioxide levels coral reefs support thousands species providing food protection subsequently many species coevolved corals due ocean acidification possible corals become extinct end century prior industrial revolution underwater reefs aragonite saturation state however current emission intensities remain today longer region lead increase energy needed extra energy eventually expended calcification currently vital corals use recover eaten away marine species battered waves thus ocean acidification mechanism extinction global warming commonly seen threat coldloving species temperatures rise ice north pole south pole melt living thing depends ice faced extreme challenges could ultimately drive kolbert points poles places affected global warming areas much higher latitudinal diversity gradients discusses work scientists used measures speciesarea relationship model possible effects global warming extent species mobile relocate new areas response shifting climate conditions predicted significant factor possible species extinction particular importance trees plant species even difficult estimate extent ecological communities species able tolerate disruptive kolbert points everything life interconnected discusses importance patch dynamics time fragmentation environmental areas leads decrease number species area occurs part size islands small support stable number species members also smaller populations vulnerable changing events addition disconnection islands makes difficult species reach recolonize one researcher describes obstacle course dispersal kolbert also notes habits many species highly specialized environment explains one minor change cause domino effect various ecological kolbert points evolutionary arms race species must equipped defend potential predators need fit competition species defense encounters new fungus virus bacterium extremely deadly case american bats killed psychrophilic fungus geomyces another example occurred american chestnut dominant deciduous tree eastern american forests fungus cryphonectria parasitica started cause chestnut blight nearly percent lethal fungus unintentionally imported us kolbert explains global trade travel creating virtual pangaea species kinds redistributed beyond historical geographic barriers furthers first chapters idea invasive species mechanism extinction sumatran rhino abundant numbers considered agricultural pest however southeast asias forests cut rhinos habitat became fragmented rhino population shrunk hundred captive breeding program widely regarded failure resulted deaths several rhinos decades single baby born today one hundred living sumatran kolbert uses rhino species illustrate habitat fragmentation another mechanism extinction europe home neanderthals least years years ago neanderthals vanished fossil records show modern humans arrived europe years ago within years neanderthals bred molecular sequencing scientists found one four percent neanderthal dna nonafrican humans indicates humans neanderthals interbred resulting hybrids reproduced pattern continued neanderthals literally bred kolbert states every reason believe neanderthals would still exist werent homo sapiens kolbert concludes hope humanity pointing various efforts conserve preserve species whether meaning deciding evolutionary
