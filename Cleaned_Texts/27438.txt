population model evolutionary algorithm ea describes structural properties population members subject population set proposed solutions ea considered one iteration also called individuals according biological role model individuals population generate individuals offspring help genetic operators procedure simplest widely used population model eas global panmictic model corresponds unstructured allows individual choose individual population partner production offspring crossover whereby details selection irrelevant long fitness individuals plays significant role due global mate selection genetic information even slightly better individuals prevail population generations iteration ea provided better offspring emerged phase solution found way optimum sought called premature effect observed often panmictic nature global mating pools rarely found prevails certain limited isolation due spatial distance resulting local neighbourhoods initially evolve independently mutants higher chance persisting several generations result genotypic diversity gene pool preserved longer panmictic population therefore obvious divide previously global population substructures two basic models introduced purpose island models based division population fixed subpopulations exchange individuals time neighbourhood models assign individuals overlapping also known cellular genetic evolutionary algorithms cga associated division population also suggests corresponding parallelization procedure reason topic population models also frequently discussed literature connection parallelization island model also called migration model coarse grained model evolution takes place strictly divided subpopulations organised panmictically time time exchange individuals takes place called time exchange called epoch end triggered various criteria eg given time given number completed generations occurrence stagnation stagnation detected example fact fitness improvement occurred island given number generations island models introduce variety new strategy parameters selection pressure influenced considerable extent example increases interconnectedness islands decreases number subpopulations epoch length neighbourhood model also called diffusion model fine grained model defines topological neighbouhood relation individuals population independent phenotypic properties fundamental idea model provide ea population special structure defined connected graph vertex individual communicates nearest particularly individuals conceptually set toroidal mesh allowed recombine close individuals leads kind locality known isolation set potential mates individual called neighbourhood deme adjacent figure illustrates showing two slightly overlapping neighbourhoods two individuals marked yellow genetic information spread two demes known kind algorithm similar individuals tend cluster create niches independent deme boundaries particular larger clear borderline adjacent groups close niches could easily colonized competitive ones maybe merge solution contents process simultaneously farther niches affected eas type population also well known cellular eas cellular genetic algorithms commonly used structure arranging individuals population toroidal although number dimensions easily extended reduced eg see figure right neighbourhood particular individual grid defined terms manhattan distance others population basic algorithm neighbourhoods size identical shapes two commonly used neighbourhoods two dimesional ceas see figure left l stands linear c stands compact deme represents panmictic subpopulation within mate selection acceptance offspring takes place replacing parent rules acceptance offspring local nature based neighbourhood example specified best offspring must better parent replaced less strictly better worst individual first rule elitist creates higher selective pressure second nonelitist rule elitist eas best individual population always survives respect deviate biological model overlap neighbourhoods causes mostly slow spread genetic information across neighbourhood boundaries hence name diffusion model better offspring needs generations panmixy spread population promotes emergence local niches local evolution thus preserving genotypic diversity longer period time result better dynamic balance breadth depth search adapted search space run depth search takes place niches breadth search niche boundaries evolution different niches whole neighbourhood size spread genetic information larger elongated figures like block like significantly larger means ring neighbourhoods well suited achieving high quality results even requires comparatively long run times hand one primarily interested fast good possibly suboptimal results topologies suitable applying population models genetic evolutionary splitting total population subpopulations usually reduces risk premature convergence leads better results overall reliably faster would expected panmictic eas island models disadvantage compared neighbourhood models introduce large number new strategy parameters despite existing studies topic certain risk unfavourable settings remains user neighbourhood models hand size neighbourhood specified case twodimensional model choice neighbourhood figure added since population models imply population partitioning well suited basis parallelizing applies even cellular eas since rely locally available information members respective demes thus extreme case independent execution thread assigned individual entire cea run parallel hardware island model also supports parallelization eg assigning processor island subpopulations islands organized panmictically evaluations descendants generation parallelized realworld applications evaluations usually far timeconsuming part course also possible design island subpopulations ceas statements made parallelizing ceas apply way hierarchical population structures appropriate parallelizations comparatively expensive computer clusters also inexpensive graphics cards gpus used however important stress ceas eas population distributed across islands represent search model differs many ways traditional eas moreover run sequential parallel platforms highlights fact model implementation two different concepts
