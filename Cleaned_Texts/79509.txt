prenatal stress prenatal maternal stress exposure expectant mother psychosocial physical stress caused daily life events environmental psychosocial physical stress expectant mother experiencing effect fetus according developmental origins health disease dohad wide range environmental factors woman may experience perinatal period contribute biological impacts changes fetus causes health risks later childs health risks include impaired cognitive development low birth weight risk mental disorders studies conducted longitudinally order explore way prenatal stress impacts fetus development studies took place course pregnancy months order collect data necessary stress mothers assessed using selfquestionnaires like perceived stress scale patient health focusing stress mothers pregnancy researchers also focused hypothalamicpituitary adrenal axis hpa axis set glucocorticoid feedback interactions mother placenta focusing hpa axis researchers see prenatal stress affects fetal development research includes studies like mckenna et al suggesting idea pregnancy cause increased risk psychopathology exposures gestation impacts mothers usage selective serotonin repute inhibitors ssris observed epigenetic age child calculated fetal umbilical cord saboory et al found prenatal psychosocial stress cause delays child growth development assessing childs weight height head circumference every two months also assessed childs cognitive development use ages stages questionnaire another study brannigan et al focused prenatal stress contributes personality disorders looking children decades later born mothers spent time mental health clinic research found negative correlations prenatal stress childs development stress development fetus inherited change gene expression change epigenetic change modifies affect building dna sequence modification affect whether gene turned lead transgenerational stress one pathways studied inheritance disrupted heterochromatin heterochromatin important many functions cell mostly gene regulation high levels stress pregnancy required formation heterochromatin phosphorylate disrupt formation lead release heterochromatin inherited another pathway prenatal stress interfere fetal development telomere telomere structure repetitive dna sequences found end chromosomes made short dna sequence repeated multiple times serve protect ends chromosomes become another function telomeres allow chromosomes properly function process replication however time cell divides telomeres loses length becomes shorter repeated replications eventually become short cell unable divide cell offspring exposed prenatal distress development affect length offsprings telomeres specifically result shortened shortened telomeres linked multiple issues including shortened lifespan increased risk typically telomeres shorten substantially increasing age telomere length thus bioindicator aging however prenatal stress puts offspring increased state vulnerability shortening telomeres leaving less room shortening offspring continue study sandman davis shows timing prenatal stress crucial understanding prenatal stress affects prenatal postnatal development cortisol often used measure stress hormone released stressful events expectant mother experiencing stressful event income insecurity teenage mother cortisol secreted however demonstrated sandman davis timing cortisol release sometimes harmful effect development sometimes depending pregnancy stress prenatal stress increase likelihood maternal endocrinological problems prenatal stress even cause embryo arrive earlier expected sandman davis studied full term infants months determine effects maternal cortisol timing differences development found exposure elevated concentrations cortisol early gestation associated slower rate development year lower mental development scores months elevated levels maternal cortisol late gestation associated accelerated cognitive development higher scores overall cortisols effects infant cognitive development dependent upon timing cortisol furthermore prenatal stress effect fetal development causing obesity diabetes cardiovascular disease problems poor eating habits lack physical activity contributing factors prenatal stress baby stress mother pregnancy lead issues cognitive development social development great deal brain development happens fetal period pregnancy progress happens rapidly since large amount growth occurring timeperiod childs life lot outside factors environment affect outside factors could anything poor nutrition excess cortisol levels even genetic influences fetuss development impacted level placenta evidence show prenatal stress consequences placenta turn fetus resulting effects impact many different areas developing childs brain hypothalamus corpus callosum amygdala hippocampus cerebellum animal studies shown prenatal stress may result reduced hippocampus volumes amygdala nuclei volumes may negative impact indirect evidence suggest prenatal stress could alter size morphology corpus callosum known alterations corpus callosum observed autism adhd furthermore alterations cerebellum may also involved autism adhd schizophrenia prenatal stress may also play role altering physiology cerebellum studies done rats shown prenatal stress may affect size number granule cells cerebellum well cause increase number purkinje also shown rats evidence suggest prenatal stress result feminization males reducing volume one hypothalamic nuclei involved sexual behavior impacts mostly noted animal studies concerns surround human studies prenatal ethical concerns human studies prenatal stress led little studies showing direct impacts stress fetal development shown difficult draw inferences connections animal studies human suggested one way monitor impact stress infants development mothers exposure natural disasters research analyzing natural disasters hurricanes affect fetal development mother exposed research showed impacts psychologically children exposed type stress womb terms increased risk developing childhood natural disaster research like shown effects stress pregnancy without issues surround human research able show results within humans instead drawing animals prenatal distress shown increase risk offspring develop mental disorder well severity symptoms typical disorders increased due prenatal distress include autism severity adhd development mood prenatal stress disrupts multiple developmental systems within individual carrying offspring one disrupted processes hormone production maternal exposure excess dihydrotestosterone progestin norethindrone linked higher risk offspring developing study found children whose mothers experienced moderate severe stress pregnancy tended develop symptoms frequently fell severe side adhd severity spectrum distinction made comparison adhd whose mothers exposed prenatal increased development adhd heightened prenatal distress due many factors one popular founded claims neurological development offspring exposure stress process pregnancy affects fetal brain development predisposes offspring development multitude mental many studies found association adhd lessened functioning within prefrontal cortex pfc area brain plays crucial role attention regulation well behavioral emotional control pfc right hemisphere particular linked decreased size individuals notable due important role pfc right hemisphere behavioral inhibition common struggle individuals adhd prenatal distress also linked development mood disorders depression anxiety study found prenatal distress specifically first weeks gestation linked higher mood dysregulation lower grey matter gm volume lessening grey matter volume detrimental loss multitude functions structure essential grey matter found throughout central nervous system crucial motor function memory reduction gm volume impactful many negative ways another contributing factor lead development mental disorders children experience utero stress prenatal stress increased result recent changes caused pandemic researchers attempting determine pandemic relates prenatal stress many women experiencing stress anxiety issues avoided researchers conducted study developing questionnaire pregnant women included age sex race health insurance status financial status pregnancy risks medical conditions treatments doctors appointments many appointments canceled due stress levels scale mild moderate severe threequarters research participants white nonhispanic according questionnaire women reported mild cases reported moderate cases reported severe cases following questionnaire researchers discovered mothers experiencing high levels anxiety stress afraid contacting covid virus virus affect fetus one person delivery room making online appointments without checked person result researchers proposed inperson engagement mother information provided mother protocols reduce risk contacting consistent checkin appointments check mothers mental health pups underwent prenatal stress showed lower plasma testosterone compared control pups caused disruption prenatal development allow complete masculinization prenatally stressed pups central nervous system humans prenatal stress affects development differently boys girls males may exhibit less masculine characteristics result prenatal stress whereas females may exhibit less feminine characteristics prenatal stress hand serious consequences particularly striatum prenatally stressed male pups showed increase vanilmandelic acid dopamine serotonin acid affect sexual behavior prenatally stressed male pups showed significant latency mounting behavior compared performing radial arm maze task prenatally stressed male rats showed greater increase dopamine prenatally stressed females thought facilitate impairment males improve female performance females prenatally stressed also effect corticosterone secretion prenatally stressed increased anxiety response female rats yet effect prenatal stress inhibits masculinization male brain inhibiting growth sexually cluster cells preoptic area prenatal stress effect brain sexual differentiation measuring volume sexually dimorphic nucleus preoptic area female males control stressed groups previous studies found decrease testosterone seen pups prenatally stressed mothers authors suggest may cause reduced sexually dimorphic nucleus preoptic area says similar effects neonatal castration also stressed males larger sexually dimorphic nucleus preoptic area birth days found volume control males whereas control males two times larger control females days stressed males show statistical difference control females respective days findings show support male brain showing expected sexual dimorphism prenatally another study led kerchner et al investigated volume medial amygdala two compartments posterodorsal posteroventral mice
