martin r ralph circadian biologist serves professor psychology department university toronto research primarily focuses circadian rhythmicity fields neuroscience psychology endocrinology notable work suprachiasmatic nucleus recognized central circadian pacemaker mammals also investigated circadian rhythms context time memory light martin ralph attended stanford university earned bachelors degree biology received doctorate attending university oregon earning phd stayed worked circadian biologist dr michael menaker university virginia notably helped discover tau mutation golden hamsters joined university toronto professor psychology working grad student dr michael menaker one modern grandfathers circadian biology discovered golden hamster period noticeably less hours motor activity rhythms golden hamsters typically follow periods hours little breeding mutant hamsters noticed homozygous mutants hour period daily activity rhythms heterozygous mutants hours circadian biology tau Ï„ denoted

homozygous mutant observed hour period experiment proved necessity sufficiency scn generate daily sleepwake rhythms circadian researchers continued study scn structure recognized primary circadian pacemaker mammals dr ralph cited work includes contributions showed masking light masking refers ability external cues light influence animal behavior integrated circadian rhythm animal continues innate biological clock exogenous cues factored enable animal respond right away environmental changes example pulse light diurnal animal rest phase could lead change period rhythmicity even time short work done dr gary pickard menaker lab dr ralph studied mice intergeniculate leaflet igl retinal pathway important perceiving light surgically overall found lesioned mice increased phase delays less responsive phase shifts due light pulses additionally active period mice lengthen constant light conditions data suggested igl likely played major role feeding light information back suprachiasmatic nucleus later experiments done golden hamster added results suggested circadian response dependent environmental situation light working menaker lab ralph also investigated gaba regulation circadian responses light found gaba antagonist bicuculline blocks phase delays benzodiazepine diazepam potentiator gaba activity blocks phase advances golden hamsters exposed light bicucullineinduced blockade phase delays decreased activators gaba activity diazepaminduced blockade phase advances could decreased competitive noncompetitive antagonists gaba findings suggest gababenzodiazepine receptorionophore complex likely site action circadian alterations drugs interestingly found gaba agonists antagonists produce blocking phase advances phase delays diazepam bicuculline respectively suggesting alternative mechanism changes chloride another area dr ralph research circadian rhythm effect learning working mice dr ralph researchers found timing important
