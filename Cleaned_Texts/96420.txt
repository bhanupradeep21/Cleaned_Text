ethology cognitive ethology hawkgoose effect refers behavior observed young birds another bird flies flying bird goose young birds show reaction flying bird hawk young birds either become agitated cower reduce danger observation shortnecked longtailed birds flying overhead caused alarm noted oskar heinroth friedrich goethe conducted experiments silhouettes examine alarm reactions systematic study conducted year konrad lorenz nikolaas tinbergen considered one classic experiments part introducing experimentalism animal behavior research performed experiments made silhouettes various birdlike shapes moved across young birds line vision gooselike shapes ignored hawklike shapes produced response later tinbergen reported single shape sort abstract composite hawk goose silhouettes could produce effect moved one direction study later confirmed perception object influenced direction motion object question considered moving forwards initially thought inborn instinct developed natural selection subsequently shown others socially reinforced like seen tinbergen figure used represent hawk goose hawkgoose experiments moving figure one direction represents shape resembling hawk short neck long tail moving figure opposite direction resembles goose long neck short perceived identity influences figure perceived move figure assumed hawk goose based movement direction head protrusion wings short one end long one brief history pointing innate behavior friedrich goethe first perform experiments using silhouettes found naive capercaillie exhibited greater fear response silhouette hawk circle triangle generalized bird silhouette varied species prior tinbergen pointed inspired oscar heinroths observations stated domestic chickens alarmed short necked birds long necks provoked konrad lorenzs nikolaas tinbergens design explore hawkgoose effect konrad lorenz nikolaas tinbergen worked together experiments published separately lorenz tinbergen reported differences experiments lorenz arguing short neck elicits flight response tinbergen claimed reactions young gallinaceous birds ducks geese flying bird prey released signstimulus short neck among others tinbergen published papers tinbergen continued report described innate behavior stated goslings display fear response ambiguous goosehawk figure moved hawk direction implying goslings associate particular shape particular direction number studies supporting tinbergens short neck recent helmut c mueller patricia g parker demonstrated naive mallard ducklings shows greater variance heart rate hawk models goose concluded cardiac response excellent measurement fear controlled learned behavior maintaining ducklings brooder transported laboratory opaque elizabeth l moore helmut c mueller found chicks heart rate greater variance response hawk model without prior pertinent experience suggesting greater innate fear response hawk obvious behavioral responses fear ethologists today believe behaviors elicited hawkgoose modals socially reinforced likely support schleits selective habituation hypothesis brief history pointing learned behavior discrepancies results konrad lorenz nikolaas tinbergen hirsch et al concluded tinbergens hypothesis could replicated leghorn mcniven concluded tinbergens hypothesis could replicated ducklings attempt replicate tinbergens experiments schleits believed tinbergen falsified like experiments still support tinbergans short neck hypothesis many experiments konrad lorenz met nikolaas tinbergen leiden instinct tinbergen lorenz worked two projects experimental analysis eggrolling behavior greylag goose supporting fixed action pattern hypothesis responses various young birds cardboard models raptors flying birds based oscar heinroth hypothesis domestic chickens showed greatest amount fear towards long tailed short necked birds flying tinbergen lorenz designed silhouettes could represent hawk like figure moved one direction goose like figure moved tinbergen lorenz moved models overhead varies species birds recorded tinbergen believed experiments prove heinroth hypothesis lorenz noted shape model seem matter species except lorenz pointed species presented alarm responses fixating alarm calling marching cover regardless model used slow relative speed flying object elicit antipredator lorenz tinbergen published original findings separately reexamination experiments invoked due differences results hirsch et al presented tinbergens hypothesis could replicated leghorn schleidt best replicate tinbergen experiments using freeranging geese ducks turkeys found regardless shape birds presented fear response diminished number trials pointing likelihood schleidt find evidence support lorenz slow relative speed second experiment performed schleidt determine turkeys never exposed flying object would support tinbergen predisposition hypothesis present fear response hawkshaped object hawkgoose model schleidt used bronze turkeys raised indoors schleidt results supported selective habituation hypothesis innate thus short neck hypothesis appears falsified httpsenwikipediaorgwikihawkgooseeffect
