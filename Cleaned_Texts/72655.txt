mental accounting psychological accounting model consumer behaviour developed richard thaler attempts describe process whereby people code categorize evaluate economic mental accounting incorporates economic concepts prospect theory transactional utility theory evaluate people create distinctions financial resources form mental accounts turn impacts buyer decision process reaction economic outcomes people presumed make mental accounts self control strategy manage keep track spending people budget money mental accounts savings eg saving home expense categories eg gas money clothing people also assumed make mental accounts facilitate savings larger purposes eg home college mental accounting result people demonstrating greater loss aversion certain mental accounts resulting cognitive bias incentivizes systematic departures consumer rationality increased understanding mental accounting differences decision making based different resources different reactions based similar outcomes greater understood thaler puts organizations general motors single person households explicit andor implicit accounting systems accounting system often influences decisions unexpected ways particularly individual expenses usually considered conjunction present value one total wealth instead considered context two accounts current budgetary period could monthly process due bills yearly due annual income category expense people even multiple mental accounts kind resource person may use different monthly budgets grocery shopping eating restaurants example constrain one kind purchase budget run constraining kind purchase even though expenditures draw fungible resource one detailed application mental accounting behavioral life cycle hypothesis posits people mentally frame assets belonging either current income current wealth future income implications behavior accounts largely nonfungible marginal propensity consume account different mental accounting theory framing effect defines way person subjectively frames transaction mind determine utility receive concept framing adopted prospect theory commonly used mental accounting theorists value function analysis richard thaler included prospect theory value function concave gains implying aversion risk indicating decreasing marginal utility accumulation gain value function convex losses implying riskseeking attitude concave value function gain incentivizes riskaverse behavior marginal gain decreases relative increase value conversely convex value function losses means impact loss detrimental person equivalent gain thus incentivizing riskseeking behavior order avoid loss proponents value function portray concept loss aversion asserts people likely make decisions order minimize loss maximise given prospect

influences spending influence pain paying associated spending money mental pain paying negative affective response associated financial loss prototypical examples unpleasant feeling one experiences watching fare increase taximeter gas pump considering expense consumers appear compare cost expense size account would deplete eg numerator vs tshirt example would subjectively larger expense drawn ones wallet ones checking account larger fraction pain paying purchase appears generate less likely consumers exchange money good evidence relation pain paying spending include lower debt held consumers report experiencing higher pain paying goods services consumers report experiencing less pain richard thaler divided concept mental accounting two main principles segregation gains losses account reference points principles utilize concepts related utility pain paying interpret people evaluate economic outcomes main principle mental accounting assertion people frame gains losses segregating different mental accounts rather integrating overall account impact tendency means outcomes framed based context decision mental accounting framing decision reduces overall account smaller segregated account incentivize purchase decisions example posed thaler people inclined drive minutes save purchase principle applies mental accounting gains losses viewed relative smaller segregated account outcome viewed differently account reference points refer tendency people set reference point current decision based prior outcome mental account result impact prior outcomes integrate current decision determining overall utility example posed thaler gamblers inclined make riskseeking bets last race day phenomenon justified assertion gamblers segregate gains losses day separate accounts integrate gains losses day interpreted endofday riskseeking bets example loss aversion gamblers attempt equalize daily account since inception concept mental accounting applied interpret consumer behavior particularly contexts online shopping consumer reward points public taxation policy mental accounting subject many logical fallacies cognitive hold many implications another example mental accounting greater willingness pay goods using credit cards swiping credit card prolongs payment later date pay monthly bill integrates large existing sum bill delay causes payment stick memory less clearly saliently furthermore payment longer perceived isolation rather seen relatively small increase already large credit card bill example might change instead regular outofpocket cost see value function smaller thus pain paying reduced mental accounting useful marketers predict customer response bundling pricing segregation products people respond positively incentives costs gains segregated losses integrated marketers segregate net losses silver lining principle integrate net gains automotive dealers example benefit principles bundle optional features single price segregate feature included bundle eg velvet seat covers aluminum wheelsantitheft car cellular phone companies use principles mental accounting deciding much charge consumers new smartphone give tradein cost phone large value phone traded low better charge consumers slightly higher price phone return money higher value trade conversely cost phone value tradein comparable consumers loss averse better charge less new phone offer less mental accounting also utilized public economics public policy inherently way people therefore taxpayers voters perceive decisions outcomes influenced process mental accounting policymakers public economists could potentially apply mental accounting concepts crafting public systems trying understand identify market failures redistribute wealth resources fair way reduce saliency sunk costs limiting eliminating freerider problem even delivering bundles multiple goods services taxpayers following examples exist mental accounting applied public policy programs produced
