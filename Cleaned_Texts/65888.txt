prolactinoma tumor adenoma pituitary gland produces hormone prolactin common type functioning pituitary symptoms prolactinoma due abnormally high levels prolactin blood hyperprolactinemia due pressure tumor surrounding tissues based size prolactinoma classified microprolactinoma mm diameter symptoms due prolactinoma broadly divided caused increased prolactin levels mass effect caused increased prolactin levels caused mass effect cause pituitary tumors remains unknown though pituitary tumors sporadic genetic syndromes include increased risk pituitary adenomas including multiple endocrine neoplasia type caused mutation gene familial isolated pituitary adenoma fipa majority moderately raised prolactin levels miul due microprolactinomas causes effects prescription drugs common causes pituitary tumours normal pregnancy breastfeeding discussed xenoestrogenic chemical bisphenola shown lead hyperprolactinaemia growth prolactinproducing pituitary increasing prolonged exposure bisphenola childhood may contribute growth doctor test prolactin blood levels women unexplained milk secretion galactorrhea irregular menses infertility men impaired sexual function rare cases milk secretion prolactin high doctor test thyroid function ask first conditions medications known raise prolactin secretion doctor also request magnetic resonance imaging mri sensitive test detecting pituitary tumors determining size mri scans may repeated periodically assess tumor progression effects therapy computed tomography ct scan also gives image pituitary less sensitive addition assessing size pituitary tumor doctors also look damage surrounding tissues perform tests assess whether production pituitary hormones normal depending size tumor doctor may request eye exam measurement visual fieldscitation needed goal treatment return prolactin secretion normal reduce tumor size correct visual abnormalities restore normal pituitary function mentioned impact stress ruled diagnosis prolactinoma given exercise significantly reduce stress thereby prolactin levels case large tumors partial reduction prolactin levels may dopamine chemical normally inhibits prolactin secretion clinicians may treat prolactinoma drugs act like dopamine bromocriptine type drug called dopamine drugs shrink tumor return prolactin levels normal approximately patients bromocriptine cabergoline approved food drug administration treatment hyperprolactinemia bromocriptine associated sideeffects nausea dizziness hypotension patients already low blood pressure readings avoid sideeffects important bromocriptine treatment start bromocriptine treatment interrupted without consulting qualified endocrinologist prolactin levels often rise people drug discontinued however prolactin levels remain normal doctor may suggest reducing discontinuing treatment every two years trial basis recent studies shown increased success remission prolactin levels discontinuation patients treated least years prior cessation bromocriptine cabergoline also associated side effects nausea dizziness may less common less severe bromocriptine however people low blood pressure use caution starting cabergoline treatment long halflife drug days may inadvertently affect ability keep blood pressure within normal limits creating intense discomfort dizziness even fainting upon standing walking single first dose clears system bromocriptine therapy side effects may avoided minimized treatment started slowly patients prolactin level remains normal months doctor may consider stopping treatment cabergoline interrupted without consulting qualified endocrinologistcitation needed dopamine agonists used less commonly suppress prolactin include dihydroergocryptine ergoloid lisuride metergoline pergolide quinagolide surgery considered medical therapy tolerated fails reduce prolactin levels restore normal reproduction pituitary function reduce tumor size medical therapy partially successful therapy continue possibly combined surgery radiation results surgery depend great deal tumor size prolactin level higher prolactin level lower chance normalizing serum prolactin best medical centers surgery corrects prolactin levels patients serum prolactin less ngml even patients large tumors completely removed drug therapy may able return serum prolactin normal range surgery depending size tumor much removed studies show recur usually within five yearscitation needed people microprolactinoma generally excellent prognosis cases tumor show signs growth periodcitation needed macroprolactinomas often require aggressive treatment otherwise may continue grow way reliably predict rate growth different every individual regular monitoring specialist detect major changes tumor recommendedcitation needed hyperprolactinemia cause reduced estrogen production women reduced testosterone production men although estrogentestosterone production may restored treatment hyperprolactinemia even year two without estrogentestosterone compromise bone strength patients protect osteoporosis increasing exercise calcium intake diet supplementation avoiding smoking patients may want bone density measurements assess effect estrogentestosterone deficiency bone density may also want discuss testosteroneestrogen replacement therapy physiciancitation needed woman one small prolactinoma reason conceive normal pregnancy successful medical therapy pituitary enlarges prolactin production increases normal pregnancy women without pituitary disorders women prolactinsecreting tumors may experience pituitary enlargement must closely monitored pregnancy however damage pituitary eye nerves occurs less one percent pregnant women prolactinoma women large tumors risk damage pituitary eye nerves greater doctors consider high woman completed successful pregnancy chances completing successful pregnancies extremely highcitation needed woman prolactinoma discuss plans conceive physician carefully evaluated prior becoming pregnant evaluation include magnetic resonance imaging mri scan assess size tumor eye examination measurement visual fields soon patient pregnant doctor usually advise stop taking bromocriptine cabergoline common treatments prolactinoma endocrinologists see patients every two months throughout pregnancy patient consult endocrinologist promptly develops symptoms particular headaches visual changes nausea vomiting excessive thirst urination extreme lethargy bromocriptine cabergoline treatment may renewed additional treatment may required patient develops symptoms growth tumor pregnancycitation needed one time oral contraceptives thought contribute development prolactinomas however longer thought true patients prolactinoma treated bromocriptine cabergoline may also take oral contraceptives likewise postmenopausal estrogen replacement safe patients prolactinoma treated medical therapy surgerycitation needed autopsy studies indicate u population small pituitary forty percent pituitary tumors produce prolactin considered clinically significant clinically significant pituitary tumors affect health approximately people nonselective surgical series tumor accounts approximately pituitary growth hormone tumors also cosecrete prolactin prolactinoma microprolactinomas much common httpsenwikipediaorgwikiprolactinoma
