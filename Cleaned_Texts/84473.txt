zond russian зонд lit probe spacecraft soviet zond program september became first spaceship travel circle moon circumlunar trajectory first moon mission include animals first return safely earth zond carried first terrestrial organisms vicinity moon including two tortoises fruit fly eggs russian tortoises underwent biological changes flight concluded changes primarily due starvation little affected space travel zond spacecraft version soyuz crewed lunarflyby spacecraft launched protonk carrier rocket block upperstage conduct scientific studies lunar flyby first four circumlunar missions launched soviet union one partial success zond three zond mission march followup zond launched april launch failed erroneous abort command shut proton rockets second stage escape rocket fired pulled descent module july zond prepared launch block secondstage rocket exploded launchpad killing three people leaving proton firststage booster rocket spacecraft minor zond mission originally planned fly cosmonauts around moon failures zond zond led soviets send uncrewed mission instead fear negative propaganda unsuccessful crewed two russian tortoises agrionemys horsfieldii included biological payload weighing kilograms lb soviet scientists chose tortoises since easy tightly secure also two tortoises used control specimens four vivarium twelve days launch two spacebound tortoises secured vehicle deprived food water control tortoises similarly food deprivation part pathomorphological histochemical biological payload also included fruit fly eggs cells wheat barley pea pine carrots tomatoes specimens wildflower species tradescantia paludosa three strains singlecelled green algae chlorella one strain lysogenic purpose sending variety terrestrial lifeforms test effect cosmic radiation however test subjects analogous humans choice life forms extremophiles substantially higher russian academy sciences stated mannequin equipped radiation sensors occupied pilots kazan optical mechanical plant developed imager installed spacecraft giving ability image zond also contained proton zond could transmit data back ground stations although data stored onboard collected return earth less zond launched september utc site baikonur cosmodrome thrust thirdstage rocket terminated kilometres mi start coast block upperstage rocket ignited burned seconds placing spacecraft parking orbit kilometres mi mi fiftysix minutes parking orbit block fired final time translunar maneuver launch announced mission control discovered problem zond attitude traced cause contaminated star tracker heat caused interior coating delayed attitude correction way moon maneuver performed kilometres mi earth using sun earth reference september spacecraft flew around moon although orbit closest distance kilometres way back moon another star tracker failed spacecraft also erroneously switched guided reentry eight ships deployed indian ocean prior launch precaution case spacecraft could reach soviet territory three rescue helicopters september reentry capsule entered earths primary landing zone kazakhstan instead zond splashed indian ocean recovered soviet vessels borovichy боровичи vasiliy golovnin василий landed latitude kilometres mi nearest soviet naval ship landing occurred night impaired recovery zond became first spacecraft circle moon return earth entire journey took days hours although ballistic reentry would probably lethal human occupants appear affect biological specimens alive descent module opened four days uss mcmorris shadowed soviet recovery ships collecting left shortly spacecraft brought board soviet highquality photographs earth first photos taken distance kilometres british astronomer bernard lovell considered britains top space expert said zond mission showed soviets ahead space race british interplanetary society believed ussr would able send cosmonauts around moon within matter october sources us claimed mission successful soviets advertised mission intended fly closer moon actual distance allow useful lunar photography also said angle spacecraft reentered atmosphere steep cosmonaut survive sources indicated spacecraft landed indian ocean planned location soviet territory factor recovery taking ten official soviet news agency tass announced november flight carried living animals tortoises dissected october fasting days flying tortoises identified lost body weight trip showed loss control tortoises lost weight comparison analyses blood spacetravelling tortoises control specimens revealed differences another analysis showed flying tortoises elevated iron glycogen levels liver flight also affected internal structures authors concluded changes flight tortoises primarily due starvation space travel little november announced spacecraft planned precursor crewed lunar spacecraft soviets made announcement month planned apollo flight attempt show close able carry crewed trip zond caused scare united states september voices cosmonauts valery bykovsky vitaly sevastyanov pavel popovich transmitted spacecraft intercepted jodrell bank observatory cosmonauts apparently reading telemetry data computer readings even discussing making attempt land height cold war real concern soviets might actually beat nasa moon apollo astronaut eugene cernan remarked incident shocked hell popovich would later recall realized would never make moon decided engage little bit hooliganism asked engineers link ontheprobe receiver transmitter jumper wire moon flight missions controlled command centre yevpatoria crimea probe path round moon center took mic said flight proceeding according normal approaching surface seconds later report outer space received earth including americans us space advisor frank borman got phone call president nixon actually johnson asked popovich reporting moon joke caused real turmoil months time frank came ussr instructed meet airport hardly walked plane shook fist said hey space zond return capsule
