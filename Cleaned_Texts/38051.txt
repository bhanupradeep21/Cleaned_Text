fear discovered guilt feeling interpersonal deception theory burgoon et al recently generated research challenging depaulo kirkendols motivation impairment effect offering set alternative predictions derived interpersonal deception theory burgoon et al suggest increased motivation often enhance verbal nonverbal performance irrespective whether individuals telling truth engaging early stages work interpersonal deception burgoon stated researchers view deception chain offensive defensive maneuvers part deception examined separate senders receivers rather integral part overall process deception game isnt balanced however deceivers always know name game usually lose fail heightened motivation deceivers successful sensing suspicion respondents spotting nonverbal behavior primarily automatic reactive often unintentional communicators attempt hide control arousal might expose nonverbal leakage unintentionally communicating nonverbally might attempting deceive question certain types nonverbal leakage often occur outside conscious motivated deceiver harder try compared less motivated deceivers mask control behavior order perform deception believably according motivation impairment effect hypothesis however increased arousal behavioral control associated efforts actually impairs deceptive success rather enhances consequence increased nonverbal leakage harder deceivers try create convincing lies likely arouse suspicion hence fail non verbal leakage observed similar situations involve verbal nonverbal cues associated particular emotions liar attempts hide good example individual attempts act like like someone observers may tend assume person likes person due faked nevertheless observers keen assess individual pretending like person actually behaves around people love one would observe significant may observe individuals show liking people like pretend like individual increased desire deceive another individual attempt regulate behaviors express feelings

nonverbal cues deceiving another individual attributed various reasons including connection persons feelings nonverbal cues exist verbal speakers talking members opposite sex lies wereas predictedmore readily detected channels included nonverbal cues talking members sex presumably less highly motivated get away speakers talking attractive listeners presumably highly motivated succeed lies talking unattractive listeners appeared judges insincere lying telling truth lies told women readily detected channels included visual nonverbal cues lies told law enforcement help researchers developing new strategies detecting deceptionlying look obvious nonverbal verbal signs indicating deception enough sometimes found culture specific differences tone voice vocal authorities researchers conducted interview investigations furthermore individuals highly motivated deceive others may use motivation advantage channeling mental energy creating convincing story heightened desire may fail due nonverbal cues may recognize unable giving authorities upper hand making interviews complex example making tell stories reverse rather chronological word count word used also analyzed liar plans going say going larger quantity words giving fabricated story testimony also examined someone trying lie use singlesyllable words repeat certain words well words convey uncertainty might rather lie detectors also used convey certainty lying telling truth order succeed deception liars required repress verbal nonverbal cues conceal fact lying expert liars individuals appear truthful even lie even look sincere lying also many individuals look sincere fact lying people also fabricate truth even talk way around lie lower cognitive load thus limiting nonverbal verbal cues show deception
