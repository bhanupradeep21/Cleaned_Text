erythema infectiosum fifth disease slapped cheek one several possible manifestations infection parvovirus fifth disease typically presents rash common children parvovirus affect humans ages two ten individuals present physical name fifth disease comes place standard list rashcausing childhood diseases also includes measles first scarlet fever second rubella third dukes disease fourth longer widely accepted distinct scarlet fever roseola treatment mostly supportive fifth disease starts lowgrade fever headache rash coldlike symptoms runny stuffy symptoms pass days later rash appears bright red rash commonly appears face particularly defining symptom infection children hence name slapped cheek occasionally rash extend bridge nose around mouth addition red cheeks children often develop red lacy rash rest body upper arms torso legs common locations rash typically lasts days may itch cases known last several weeks patients usually longer infectious rash teenagers adults may present selflimited manifests painful swelling joints feels similar arthritis older children adults fifth disease may difficulty walking bending joints wrists knees ankles fingers disease usually certain risk groups rare circumstances serious consequences fifth disease also known erythema infectiosum caused parvovirus infects infection parvovirus lead multiple clinical manifestations common fifth parvovirus small singlestranded nonenveloped dna virus binding capsid cellular receptor globoside results cascade structural changes subsequent signal transduction processes facilitating entry parvovirus host cell gaining access host cell binds glycosphingolipid globoside blood group p antigen targeting erythroid lineage bone marrow replication viral genome release virus infected cells lead various complex effects hosts cellular environment induction dna damage hijack cell cycle apoptosis killing infected dna found wide range tissues healthy diseased individuals indicates persistence infection according clinical microbiology review published jianming qiu persistence viral dna detected biopsy specimens spleen lymph nodes tonsils liver heart synovial tissues skin brain testes decades recovery parvovirus infection achieved production igm antibodies specific virus generated days day signs fifth disease red rashes arthralgia pain joints becomes apparent specific anti igg produced immune cells production serum anti igg keeps infection control facilitates recovery erythroid cell production erythroid lineage cells targeted parvovirus slapped cheek appearance rash suggestive fifth disease however rash mistaken skin related disease infections blood samples testing definitive confirming antiparvovirus igm antibody serum assay preferred method detect previous infection antibody assay uses antibodies designed detect parvovirus antigen protein blood circulation assay result positive one week initial infection negative results may prompt retesting future rule early sampling blood positive result also indicative infection within past two six people acquire lifetime immunity igg antibodies produced response parvovirus infection parvovirus also confirmed isolation viral dna detected pcr direct hybridization pcr considered significantly sensitive detecting viral antigen compared direct dna hybridization dna hybridization assay better detect variants parvovirus exists biological similar genotypes parvovirus numbered one three common genotype circulating genotype laboratory tests indicate complications infection including anemia liver damage low platelet fifth disease transmitted primarily respiratory secretions saliva mucus etc also spread contact infected blood incubation period time initial infection onset symptoms usually days individuals fifth disease infectious onset symptoms typically school children daycare workers teachers parents likely exposed virus symptoms evident risk transmission small therefore symptomatic individuals need vertical transmission maternal infection may also occur lead hydrops fetalis due infections detrimental effects red blood cell treatment supportive infection frequently selflimiting specific therapy recommended antipyretics commonly used reduce fevers cases arthropathy arthritis arthralgia nonsteroidal antiinflammatories nsaids antiinflammatories rash usually itch mildly painful rash considered infection generally lasts days stress hot temperatures exercise exposure sunlight contribute reoccurrence within months initial infection upon resolution immunity considered populations greater risk complications see may need referral specialist anemia severe complication could result parvovirus infection requires blood transfusion part fifth disease viral illness caused parvovirus illness common selflimiting modes transmission include respiratory droplets blood mother fifth disease prevalent children aged years old fifth disease occurs lower rates virus spreads easily contracted body begin developing lasting immunity reinfection prevalence antibodies children virus affects men women spring winter epidemic outbreaks likely occur summer fall sporadic cases outbreaks outbreaks commonly occur daycares periodicity outbreak cycle threetoseven risk acquiring viral illness increases exposed infected person contaminated blood individuals occupation requires close contact infected people healthcare workers teachers increased risk acquiring viral another risk factor fifth disease immunocompromised individuals anemia higher risk developing complications pregnant women risk acquiring viral illness especially first half pregnancy though complications rare less cases experience serious common complication among pregnant women anemia rare cases severe anemia occur buildup fluid develop buildup fluid cause congestive heart failure death blood infusion induction may vaccine available human parvovirus though attempts made develop parvovirus virus causing fifth disease first discovered yvonne disease presenting first described robert willan book cutaneous diseases rubeola sine catarrho better defined anton tschamer rubella variant örtliche rotheln described abortive rubella identified distinct condition theodor escherich given name erythema infectiosum term fifth disease coined physician léon cheinisse proposed numbered classification six common childhood virus first described university pennsylvania werner et systematic review examined rates parvovirus infection among daycare workers since transmission typically occurs respiratory secretions thought daycare workers would increased risk infection young children spread saliva drool systematic review indicates daycare workers increased risk another review also supports finding daycare workers increased risk contracting parvovirus metaanalysis examined rates parvovirus infection among sickle cell disease scd using igg igm antibody detection pooled data africa asia americas revealed parvovirus infection prevalence among persons scd prevalence infection also determined geographic location areas reduced access adequate housing higher prevalence africa literature review also supports finding persons scd well blood disorder beta thalassemia higher risk parvovirus known complications associated fifth disease relating pregnancy parvovirus typically transmitted via respiratory secretions hand mouth contact also known passed pregnant mothers roughly pregnant women immune parvovirus remainder women susceptible mild majority fetuses contract parvovirus show either significant symptoms complete resolution virus however following serious complications rare possible miscarriage stillbirth fetal anemia hepatic failure abnormal neurodevelopment outcome cases fetuses would develop hydrops fetalis due congenital parvovirus condition studied determinant later fetal outcomes miscarriage perinatal death systematic review review showed born parvovirus caused hydrops fetalis association higher mortality risk higher risk potential consequences erythema infectiosum quite serious pregnancy mothers tested immunity via presence igg igm addition fetuses parvovirus infection effects studied adults well virus also associated development neurological complications identified systematic review analysis included total studies covering complications central nervous system encephalitis meningitis peripheral neuropathy however specific pathophysiology complications yet discovered review encourage use antibody testing determine patients infection virus limited nervous system parvovirus also linked cases cardiac inflammation cause structural damage heart time damage progresses significant cardiac cell death may individuals living hiv also susceptible complications infected due immunocompromised relatively rare live hiv parvovirus infection unable fight virus result substantial loss red blood cells cause httpsenwikipediaorgwikififthdisease
