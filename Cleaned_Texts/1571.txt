hormonal therapy oncology hormone therapy cancer one major modalities medical oncology pharmacotherapy cancer others cytotoxic chemotherapy targeted therapy biotherapeutics involves manipulation endocrine system exogenous external administration specific hormones particularly steroid hormones drugs inhibit production activity hormones hormone antagonists steroid hormones powerful drivers gene expression certain cancer cells changing levels activity certain hormones cause certain cancers cease growing even undergo cell death surgical removal endocrine organs orchiectomy oophorectomy also employed form hormonal therapy hormonal therapy used several types cancers derived hormonally responsive tissues including breast prostate endometrium adrenal cortex hormonal therapy may also used treatment paraneoplastic syndromes ameliorate certain cancer chemotherapyassociated symptoms anorexia perhaps familiar example hormonal therapy oncology use selective estrogenresponse modulator tamoxifen treatment breast cancer although another class hormonal agents aromatase inhibitors expanding role disease one effective strategy starving tumor cells growth survivalpromoting hormones use drugs inhibit production hormones organ origin aromatase inhibitors important class drugs used treatment breast cancer postmenopausal women menopause estrogen production ovaries ceases tissues continue produce estrogen action enzyme aromatase androgens produced adrenal glands action aromatase blocked estrogen levels postmenopausal women drop extremely low levels causing growth arrest andor apoptosis hormoneresponsive cancer cells letrozole anastrozole aromatase inhibitors shown superior tamoxifen firstline treatment breast cancer postmenopausal exemestane irreversible aromatase inactivator superior megestrol acetate treatment tamoxifenrefractory metastatic breast cancer appear osteoporosispromoting side effects drugs aminoglutethimide inhibits aromatase enzymes critical steroid hormone synthesis adrenal glands formerly used breast cancer treatment since replaced selective aromatase inhibitors also used treatment hyperadrenocortical syndromes cushings syndrome hyperaldosteronism adrenocortical analogs gonadotropinreleasing hormone gnrh used induce chemical castration complete suppression production estrogen progesterone female ovaries complete suppression testosterone production male testes due negative feedback effect continuous stimulation pituitary gland hormones leuprorelin goserelin gnrh analogs used primarily treatment hormoneresponsive prostate cancer initial endocrine response gnrh analogs actually hypersecretion gonadal steroids hormone receptor antagonists flutamide typically used prevent transient boost tumor hormone receptor antagonists bind normal receptor given hormone prevent activation target receptor may cell surface case peptide glycoprotein hormones may intracellular case steroid hormone receptors selective estrogen receptor modulators serms important class hormonal therapy agents act antagonists estrogen receptor used primarily treatment chemoprevention breast cancer members family tamoxifen actually partial agonists actually increase estrogen receptor signalling tissues endometrium tamoxifen currently firstline treatment nearly premenopausal women hormone receptorpositive breast raloxifene another partial agonist serm seem promote endometrial cancer used primarily chemoprevention breast cancer highrisk individuals well prevent toremifene fulvestrant serms little agonist activity used treatment metastatic breast antiandrogens class drug bind inhibit androgen receptor blocking growth survivalpromoting effects testosterone certain prostate cancers flutamide bicalutamide antiandrogens frequently used treatment prostate cancer either longterm monotherapy initial weeks gnrh analog see also androgen deprivation therapy hormonal therapy strategies seek block hormone signalling cancer cells instances supplementation specific hormone agonists may growthinhibiting even cytotoxic effect tumor cells many hormones produce antagonism feedback inhibition synthesis hormones significant overlap concept discussed progestins progesteronelike drugs megestrol acetate medroxyprogesterone acetate used treatment hormoneresponsive advanced breast cancer endometrial cancer prostate cancer progestins also used treatment endometrial hyperplasia precursor endometrial adenocarcinoma exact mechanism action hormones unclear may involve direct effect tumor cells suppression estrogen receptor levels alteration hormone metabolism direct cytotoxicity indirect endocrine effects suppression adrenal androgen production plasma estrone sulfate fluoxymesterone anabolic steroid testosteronelike medication occasionally used treatment advanced breast cancer mechanism anticancer effects androgen breast cancer unclear may analogous estrogen diethylstilbestrol des occasionally used treat prostate cancer suppression testosterone production previously used treatment breast cancer replaced effective less toxic agents estrace estrogen also formerly used antiandrogen therapy prostate polyestradiol phosphate longacting derivative estradiol applied intramuscular injection octreotide analog peptide hormone somatostatin inhibits production growth hormone well numerous peptide hormones gastrointestinal system including insulin glucagon pancreatic polypeptide gastric inhibitory polypeptide gastrin octreotide used suppression hormonal syndromes accompany several pancreatic islet cell tumors including zollingerellison syndrome gastrinoma chronic hypoglycemia insulinoma also effective suppression carcinoid syndrome caused advanced extragastrointestinal carcinoid tumors octreotide may also used treatment severe diarrhea caused chemotherapy radiation addition use medication produce tumorsuppressing endocrine alterations destruction endocrine organs surgery radiation therapy also possible surgical castration removal testes males ovaries females widely used past treat hormoneresponsive prostate cancer breast cancer respectively however invasive methods widely supplanted use gnrh agonists forms pharmacologic still situations surgical castration may beneficial special cases women high risk brca mutations information topic see immunotherapy hormonal stimulation immune system interferons cytokines used treat specific cancers including renal cell carcinoma melanoma
