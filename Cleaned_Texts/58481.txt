david lisak american clinical psychologist received phd duke university retired associate professor psychology university massachusetts lisaks research focuses causes consequences interpersonal violencemotives behaviors rapists murderers impact childhood abuse adult men relationship child abuse later lisak began research graduate school duke noticed research rape sexual assault consisted interviews victims reported almost exclusively acquaintance rape rather stranger rape studies incarcerated rapists almost exclusively stranger rapists lisak became interested studying rapists committed common form rape get caught go lisak performed metaanalysis four surveys conducted surveying male boston college students resulting landmark study undetected rapists published study began questionnaire lisak reported following interviews questions included things like ever sexual intercourse someone even though want intoxicated alcohol drugs resist sexual advances ever sexual intercourse adult didnt want used physical force twisting arm holding etc didnt linda lefauve associate vice president davidson college contributor american libertarian think tank reason foundation questioned lisak conducted followup interviews based responses anonymous survey lisak refused comment hung social science interviews questionnaires interpersonal violence lisak avoided use terms rape assault abuse instead describing detail behavior question without applying labels perpetrators might identify although situations described legally rape lisak found men reluctant talk seeing sexual conquests brag think rapists according lisak men narcissistic like nothing better talk sexual approximately study participants reported committed lisak notes rapists prosecuted convicted single count rape describes sobering studies find incarcerated rapists typically raped multiple people findings ranging average seven average research found true undetected rapists serial rapists accounting campus average six rapes found undetected convicted rapists held prejudiced attitudes towards women need compared nonrapists lisak found rapists measurably angry women motivated desire dominate control impulsive disinhibited antisocial hypermasculine less empathic lisak characterized rapists extremely adept identifying potential victims testing boundaries said planned attacks used sophisticated strategies isolate groom victims used violence instrumentally order terrify coerce used psychological weapons victims including power manipulation control lisak also says rapists target vulnerable victims female freshmen less experience drinking likely take risks people already intoxicated use alcohol makes victim vulnerable time also impairs credibility justice system choose report lisak also noted recent research contradicted longheld assumption rapists specialize particular types victims reality says far murkier multiple studies written documented rapists also sexually attacked children child molesters also sexually attacked adults incest offenders also sexually attacked children outside lisak argues similar findings conflict sharply widely held view college rapes typically perpetrated basically decent young man much alcohol little communication would never thing evidence actually suggesting vast majority rapes committed serial violent predators therefore argues prevention efforts aimed persuading men rape unlikely work universities instead focus helping nonrapists identify rapists intervene highrisk situations stop also argues whenever nonstranger sexual assault reported represents window opportunity law enforcement comprehensively investigate alleged offender rather putting blinders looking solely alleged interaction two research campus rape
