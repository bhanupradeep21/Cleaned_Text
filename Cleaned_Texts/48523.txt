topical glucocorticoids topical forms glucocorticoids topical glucocorticoids used treatment many skin conditions provide antiinflammatory antimitotic immunesystem suppressing actions various topical glucocorticoids indicated treatment variety skin topical glucocorticoids available different formulations inappropriate formulation administered therapeutic effect treatment may delayed rendered condition even worsened cases instance usage topical glucocorticoid gel fissured hand eczema intensifies pain well stinging alcohol present gel ointment applied moist skin injury might lead follicle infection due occlusive features ointments formed water suspended oil ointments effective lubricants retain heat lower loss water skin provide better absorption medication ointments also semiocclusive ointments usually effective formulations topical glucocorticoids occlusive effect however acceptance compliance patients pharmacological treatment may relatively low oily tacky usually applied large hairy creams semisolid emulsions consisting oil suspended water pleasant appearance rinsed away water regarding topical glucocorticoid creams generally potent lotions less effective creams especially useful acute inflammation exudates due drying effects creams also applied intertriginous areas inappropriate application lotions refer suspensions solutions drugs water alcohol types solvent therefore container shaked adequately ensure drug mixed well solvent dosage achieve best therapeutic effect lotions especially effective hairy areas also situations medication applied large areas lotions exert cooling drying effect dry making effective moist skin lesions andor itching gels emulsions oil suspended water containing alcohol base gels jellylike property dry thin watery film gel formulations therapeutic effects good ointments appearance cosmetically appealing creams resulting high patient gels absorbed readily appropriate distributing topical glucocorticoids hairy areas gels especially effective inflammation foams spread efficiently easier applied preparations especially skin inflammation scalp conditions foams applied spread readily especially hairy areas compliance foam formulations usually however due difficulty designing appropriate vehicles foam formulations generally higher price formulations topical glucocorticoids alter functions epidermal dermal cells well

including differences extent percutaneous absorption different parts body percent total dose absorbed body skin topical glucocorticoids generally safer systemic glucocorticoids however cutaneous systemic adverse effects may happen especially use superpotent potent topical glucocorticoids excessive use lowerpotency agents withdrawal syndrome withdrawal topical glucocorticoids longterm use particularly face genitals may bring different kinds signs symptoms including redness skin burning stinging sensation itching pain hot flashes symptoms could persist days weeks glucocorticoids

children used prolonged periods time generally smaller dose topical glucocorticoid required children given condition adults children relatively smaller body surface area compared adults based evidence
