adhesive capsulitis also known frozen shoulder condition associated shoulder pain common shoulder ailment marked pain loss range motion particularly external loss ability move shoulder voluntarily others multiple shoulder however generally hurt significantly muscle loss around shoulder may also onset gradual weeks complications include fracture humerus biceps tendon cause cases condition also occur injury surgery risk factors include diabetes thyroid underlying mechanism involves inflammation diagnosis generally based persons symptoms physical diagnosis may supported adhesive capsulitis

favor particular approach fact reviews suggest multimodal approaches combining several treatments effects treatments primarily shortterm focusing alleviating symptoms shoulder pain reduced joint movement common treatments include exercise physical therapy oral analgesics paracetamol nsaids intraarticular corticosteroid injections nonsurgical treatment may continue months complex treatments

condition longlasting evidence suggests surgical intervention also several surgical procedures may alleviate medications nsaids used pain control oral steroids may provide shortterm benefits range
