onychodus onychodontiformes highly kinetic flexible unusual characteristic due loose attachment skull bones sometimes overlapped connected soft tissue even braincase partially made bone distinctive traits related tusk whorls lower jaw could rotate different method jaw articulation compare primitive rayfinned fish lower jaw entirely articulated cartilage without intermediate structure opposite sides allowing separation bones prey struck moreover loose articulation caused lateral movement making tusk walls move alignment parts lower jaw would rotated inwards upon closing order tusk whorls fit exactly hollow spaces upper jaw suggested ligament attachment retractor mechanism existed pit tusk whorl unique condition vertebrates capacity teeth lower jaw fit tooth rows upper jaw upon closure kept tusk whorls studies scientists believe onychodus ambush predator john long suggested onychodus probably hid devonian reefs lunging prey swam fossil specimen onychodus western australia found
