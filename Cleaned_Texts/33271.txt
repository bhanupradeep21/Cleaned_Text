supposedly competitively excluded multituberculates mammalian however idea multituberculates replaced rodents placentals criticised several authors one thing relies assumption mammals inferior derived placentals ignores fact rodents multituberculates coexisted least million years according researchers multituberculate decline shaped sharp extinction events notably tiffanian sudden drop diversity occurs finally youngest known multituberculates exemplify patterns competitive exclusion oligocene ectypodus rather generalistic species rather specialist combination factors suggests rather gradually declining due pressure rodents similar placentals multituberculates simply could cope climatic vegetation changes well rise new predatory eutherians recent studies show mixed effect multituberculate faunas north america europe indeed decline correlation introduction rodents areas however asian multituberculate faunas coexisted rodents minimal extinction events implying competition main cause
