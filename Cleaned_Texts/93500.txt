agonistic behaviour social behaviour related fighting term broader meaning aggressive behaviour includes threats displays retreats placation conciliation term agonistic behaviour first defined used jp scott emil fredericson paper causes fighting mice rats physiological agonistic behaviour seen many animal species resources including food shelter mates often limited forms agonistic behaviour contestants competing access resources food mates times involves tests strength threat display make animals look large physically fit display may allow gain resource actual battle takes place although agonistic behaviour varies among species agonistic interaction consists three kinds behaviours threat aggression three behaviours functionally physiologically interrelated yet fall outside narrow definition aggressive behaviour one divisions behaviours may seen alone interaction two animals normally occur sequence start depending availability importance resource behaviours range fight death much safer ritualistic behaviour though ritualistic display behaviours common form agonistic scott fredericson describe agonistic behaviour displayed variety different circumstances response different stimuli scott fredericson studied mice rats classified three main categories agonistic behaviour animals display include preliminary behaviour attack defensive escape behaviour preliminary behaviour

also important understand behaviours natural setting fully comprehend evolved therefore differ different selective pressures mantis shrimp predatory crustaceans example aggressive territorial organism whose agonistic behaviour studied ecological evolutionary context mantis shrimp among worlds aggressive sea creatures secretive highly alert active predators inhabit burrows cavities along coral reefs rocky coasts muddy shores tropical subtropical roy caldwell hugh dingle conducted research mantis shrimp stomatopods focused evolution agonistic behaviour applies ecology agonistic behaviour coevolved alongside biotic factors body morphology competition within species species habitats shrimp inhabit stomatopods arose leptostracan stock indicated fossil evidence approximately million years

stomatopods fighting behaviour referred raptorial appendage actually pair enlarged second maxillipeds behind strong maxillipeds used purposes prey capture addition fighting morphology appendage particularly propodus dactyl extend forward way resembles striking appendage praying mantis gives crustacean caldwell et al classified raptorial appendage two categories based functional purpose smashing appendage spearing appendage smashing appendage possessed members gonodactylidae dactyl contains several short spines spearing appendage possessed squillids lysiosquillids bathysquillids couple gonodactylids last group contains spearers smashers able use raptorial appendage force particularly gonodactylids able smash glass double walled aquaria laboratorycitation needed smashers able use immense force kill samespecies competitors one blow caldwell et al describe two stomatopods generally display severe fighting behaviour encounter species within species males females display level behaviour except breeding species stomatopods regardless type appendage ordinarily deliver blows agonistic encounters dactyl closed dactyl open result usually serious injury death opponent crustaceans may deliver blows dactyl open generally situations extremely intense fighting displays rare amongst behaviour common agonistic displays raptorial appendage display common behaviour across many taxa

display display behaviour evolutionarily conserved behaviour agonistic displays evolutionary differences clear smasher spearer stomatopods inhabit different substrates either burrow burrow caldwell et al describe differences respect behavioural display called meral behaviour described researchers extreme raptorial appendage displays defined elevation cephalothorax antennae antennules raptorial appendage elevated spread interestingly meral spread may displayed dozens times agonistic encounter caldwell et al explain used method inhibit actual physical violence evolutionary divergence stomatopods described appearance meral spot dorsal medial groove raptorial merus raptorial smasher stomatopods species tend inhabit cavities within rocks coral brightly coloured meral spots aid making meral spot visible meral spread displays fights bright meral spots possessed smashers either yellow blue red white outlined conspicuous black pigment conversely spearing stomatopods smashing species inhabit rock coral cavities much duller meral correlation suggests researchers habitat meral spot colouration coevolved inhabit burrows possess bright spots species dull spots demonstrates ecology evolution organisms within order directly affects agonistic behaviour agonistic behaviour influenced action hormones vasopressin small peptide synthesized brain magnocellular agonistic behaviour may divided two categories offensive classes agonistic behaviour result different neurobehavioural pathways offensive defensive agonistic behaviour elicited different offensive behaviour specifically studied context intruder interactions studies employing rodents test subjects example unfamiliar male hamster placed cage conspecific male stereotypical suite agonistic behaviours resident male approaches intruder sniffs intently threatens intruder upright posture finally initiates physical attack intruder resident male attacks belly intruder male attempts maneuver intruder onto studies shown offensive behaviour displayed hamsters may modulated due presence vasopressin specifically research conducted ferris et al suggests vasopressin receptor antagonist injected anterior hypothalamus resident male tendency attack intruder males decreases dose antagonist antagonist known decrease tendency offensive aggression via injections ventrolateral hypothalamus therefore able act multiple regions brain exhibit effects offsetting agonistic behaviour vasopressin plays role offensive aggression agonistic behaviour serotonin also plays role aggressive behaviour rodents well similar effects humans research shown increased levels serotonin stimulating serotonic receptors rodents corresponds decreased agonistic behavioural display behaviours like attacking male resident hamsters typically always display stereotypical offensive agonistic behaviours display significant decrease bite attempts toward intruder males treated serotonin reuptake inhibitor called fluoxetine vasopressin serotonin play significant roles agonistic behavioural displays understanding interaction two opposing neurotransmitters important fully understanding neurobiology agonistic understood vasopressin enhances aggression agonistic displays due increased activity neural pathways associated increased flank marking offensive aggression demonstrated resident hamsters presence intruder neural pathway enhances aggression subdued presence hypothesizedby serotonin acts antagonist vasopressin eliciting effects vasopressinsensitive neurons therefore inhibiting neurons steroid hormones also associated offensive aggression behaviour androgens particular well documented effects enhancing aggression male rodents testosterone injections septum medial preoptic area castrated mice greatly increased offensive glucocorticoids also reported effects agonistic behaviour mice though effects thoroughly understood effects androgens research demonstrated mice defeated agonistic encounters elevated levels corticosterone appears enhance submissive behaviour therefore opposing effects agonistic aggressive type agonistic behaviour observed whether aggressive submissive depend likelihood winning instance

aggressive behaviour male stalkeyed flies males square displaying females show strong preference mating males longer eyestalks due female preference males evolved compete mating rights threat display two flies face headtohead forelegs spread outward parallel behaviour allows individual judge distance competitors eyes eyestalk length increases body size males shorter eyestalks usually distance eyes
