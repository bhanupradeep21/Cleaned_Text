kupffer cells also known stellate macrophages cells specialized cells localized liver within lumen liver sinusoids adhesive endothelial cells make blood vessel walls kupffer cells comprise largest population tissueresident macrophages body gut bacteria bacterial endotoxins microbial debris transported liver gastrointestinal tract via portal vein first come contact kupffer cells first immune cells liver change kupffer cell functions connected various liver diseases alcoholic liver disease viral hepatitis intrahepatic cholestasis steatohepatitis activation rejection liver liver transplantation liver form part mononuclear phagocyte system kupffer cells found attached sinusoidal endothelial cells centrilobular periportal regions hepatic lobules kupffer cell function structures specialized depending location periportal kupffer cells tend larger lysosomal enzyme phagocytic activity whereas centrilobular kupffer cells create superoxide radical kupffer cells amoeboid character surface features including microvilli pseudopodia lamellipodia project every direction microvilli pseudopodia play role endocytosis particles nucleus indented ovoid lobulated notable cytoplasmic elements include ribosomes golgi complexes centrioles microtubules microfilaments kupffer cells also contain rough endoplasmic reticulum nuclear envelope annulate lamellae demonstrate peroxidase activity importantly kupffer cells express sraiii scavenger receptor receptor involved recognising binding lipid domain lipopolysaccharide lps lipoteichoic acid lipopolysaccharide lps bacterial endotoxin found cell wall gramnegative bacteria whereas lipoteichoic acid present grampositive bacteria detection system kupffer cells play critical role initiating mediating immune responses bacterial infection development initial population kupffer cells begins embryonic yolk sac precursor cells differentiate fetal macrophages enter blood stream migrate fetal liver stay complete differentiation kupffer cells normal conditions kupffer cell populations longlived however resident kupffer cell populations depleted monocytes derived hematopoietic stem cells bone marrow transported blood circulation liver also fully differentiate true kupffer cells unlike tissue macrophages must continually renewed circulating monocytes monocytederived kupffer cells capable selfrenewal population development mature kupffer cells regulated numerous growth factors macrophage colonystimulating factor playing key role cytokines involved type inflammation may also stimulate kupffer cell proliferation time frame days complete replenishment kupffer cell populations demonstrated animal studies despite high monocyte influx maturation rates hepatic kupffer cell populations tightly maintained evidently high rate turnover average lifespan kupffer cell estimated days however ultimate fate kupffer cells vivo yet fully primary function kupffer cell remove foreign debris particles come hepatic portal system passing liver possible kupffer cells take large particles phagocytosis smaller particles via kupffer cells integral innate responses immune system important host defense play role metabolism many different compounds including lipids protein complexes small particles also useful removing apoptotic cells amount kupffer cells liver held constant kupffer cells proliferative capacity allowing cell populations replenish complete contrast monocytederived macrophages proliferative potential old defective cells removed apoptosis well phagocytized neighbouring kupffer cells kupffer cells heterogeneous function dependent location liver lobules cells periportal zone directly exposed bloodflow express greater lysosomal activity efficiently process incoming

critical component innate immune kupffer cells incredibly plastic cells capability polarize specific activation states perform different functions different microenvironments classical activation alternative activation designate two extremes macrophage polarization kupffer cells produce large amount proinflammatory cytokines like tnfalpha hand kupffer cells produce large quantity antiinflammatory mediators example kupffer cells play role pathogenesis damaged liver response sepsis macrophages liver activate release tnfalpha turn activates leukocytes sinusoidal endothelial cells

ethanolinduced liver injury common chronic alcoholics chronic alcoholism liver injury deal twohit system first hit direct mediated direct toxicity ethanol metabolic byproducts second hit indirect mediated increased uptake lipopolysaccharide endotoxin intestine ethanol increases permeability intestinal epithelium resulting endotoxin produced intestinal flora leaking intestinal lumen liver via portal vein presence endotoxin induces strong polarization kupffer cells large amount reactive oxygen species proinflammatory cytokines chemokines produced activated kupffer cells lead liver injury
