μαστός breast ὀδούς nipplelike projections crowns molars mastodon genus name valid name mammut name preceded cuviers description making mastodon junior synonym change met resistance authors sometimes applied mastodon informal name consequently became common term members genus mastodon also used informally describe nonelephant proboscideans gomphotheres species include mammut genus extinct proboscidean family mammutidae related family elephantidae mammoths elephants originally diverged approximately twentyseven million years following cladogram shows placement american mastodon among proboscideans based hyoid following cladogram shows relationships among elephantimorphs based hyoid mastodons gomphotheres stegodontids elephantidae elephants mammoths mammutids originated africa late oligocene oldest member family losodokodon known deposits kenya approximately million years mammutids expanded eurasia early miocene approximately million years ago following collision two mammutids represented zygolophodon first arrived north america across bering land bridge late early approximately million years mammut thought evolved zygolophodon though relationship north american mammut eurasian species assigned genus late mioceneearliest pleistocene species mammut borsoni authors proposed various hypotheses including second migration mammutids north america late miocenepliocene north american mammut descended eurasian mammut species eurasian north american species mammut closely related evolved parallel second migration hypothesis criticised lacking supporting compared mammoths extant elephants mastodons longer wider body tall due shorter legs limbs heavily muscled considerably thicker limb bones making mastodons much robust comparison modern elephants females

questioned little genetic evidence presence two mastodons typically depicted thick woolly mammothlike coat hair preserved evidence consideration long tail usually present animals living warm climates size body mass environment implies animal similarly hairy scant preserved evidence body based characteristics mastodon bone sites strontium oxygen isotopes tusks inferred modern proboscideans mastodon social group consisted adult females young living bonded groups called mixed herds males abandoned mixed herds reaching sexual maturity lived either alone male bond modern probably seasonal synchrony mating activity males females seeking mating sexually mastodons characterized predominantly browsing animalsnote new world proboscideans appear consistent browsing rather grazing consuming opposed plants occupying closed forests versus open dietary inflexibility may prevented invading south america great american interchange due need cross areas grassland accounts gut contents identified coniferous twigs dominant element diet accounts eg burning tree mastodon reported coniferous content suggest selective feeding low herbaceous vegetation implying mixed browsing grazing evidence provided studies isotopic bone chemistry indicating seasonal preference study mastodon teeth microwear patterns indicates mastodons could adjust diet according ecosystem regionally specific feeding patterns corresponding boreal forest versus cypress swamps population given location sometimes able maintain dietary niche changes climate browse species mastodons found eating pumpkins along species like woolly mammoths elephant species time pumpkin would toxic many animals mastodons able avoid toxicity due large body mastodons also distributed pumpkin seeds around place aiding pumpkin range

dating early pleistocene million years ago identified preserved dna fragments mastodons assigned americanum suggests mastodons ranged far north greenland optimal conditions around time northern greenland warmer holocene boreal forest hosting species assemblage modern analogue among oldest dna fragments ever fossil evidence indicates mastodons probably disappeared north america years part quaternary extinction event pleistocene megafauna widely believed result human hunting latest paleoindians entered americas expanded relatively large numbers years hunting may caused gradual attrition mastodon analysis tusks mastodons american great lakes region span several thousand years prior extinction area shows trend declining age maturation contrary one would expect experiencing stresses unfavorable environment consistent reduction intraspecific competition would result population reduced human hand environmental dna sequencing indicates disappearance megafaunal dna north america
