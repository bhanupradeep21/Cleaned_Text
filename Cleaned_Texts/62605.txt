swarming honey bee colonys natural means reproduction process swarming single colony splits two distinct swarming mainly spring phenomenon usually within two threeweek period depending locale occasional swarms happen throughout producing season secondary afterswarms cast swarms may happen cast swarms usually smaller accompanied virgin queen sometimes beehive swarm succession almost totally depleted one species honey bee participates swarming behavior apis cerana reproduction swarms species settle ft away natal nest days depart new nest site getting information scout bees scout bees search suitable cavities construct swarms home successful scouts come back report location suitable nesting sites apis mellifera participates similar swarming process worker bees create queen cups throughout year hive getting ready swarm queen lays eggs queen cups new queens raised hive may swarm soon queen cells capped new virgin queens emerge queen cells laying queen heavy fly long distances therefore workers stop feeding anticipated swarm date queen stop laying eggs swarming creates interruption brood cycle original colony swarm preparation scout bees simply find nearby location swarm cluster honey bee swarm emerges hive fly far first may gather tree branch metres hive cluster queen send scout bees find suitable new nest locations intermediate stop permanent habitation normally leave within hours suitable location temporary location cluster determine final nest site based level excitement dances scout bees unusual swarm clusters three days intermediate stop swarming creates vulnerable time life honey bees swarms provisioned nectar honey carry stomachs swarm starve quickly find home nectar stores happens often early swarms leave warm day followed cold rainy weather spring remnant colony produced one swarms usually well provisioned food new queen lost eaten predators mating flight poor weather prevent mating flight case hive young brood raise additional queens survive cast swarm usually contain young virgin propensity swarm differs among honey bee species africanized bees notable propensity swarm abscond absconding process whole hive leaves rather splits like swarming tropical bees tend swarm abscond time food scarce thus making vulnerable colder locales mainly lack sufficient winter stores africanized bee colonies tend perish winter higher latitudescitation needed generally weak bee colony swarm colony produced larger population bees weak bee colonies result low food supply disease foulbrood disease queen produces low quantities eggs good nesting site honey bees must large enough accommodate swarm minimum litres imp gal us gal volume preferably litres imp gal us gal well protected elements small entrance approximately square centimetres sq located bottom must receive certain amount warmth sun infested ants addition criteria nest sites abandoned honeycombs scout bees find one preferred allows bees better conserve resources scout bees experienced foragers resting swarm cluster individual scout returning cluster promotes location found uses waggle dance indicate direction distance quality others cluster excited findings excitedly dances convince scouts check location found take check proposed site choose promote site upon return several sites may promoted different scouts first several hours sometimes days favorite location gradually emerges decisionmaking process order decision made relatively short amount time swarm survive three days honey gorged leaving hive decision often made somewhere around scouts agreed upon single location andor quorum scouts present potential nest swarm waited less scouts agree bees would lack confidence suitability site waited scouts agree swarm would wasting stored scout bees agree nest whole clustered swarm takes flies swarm may fly kilometer scouted location scouts guiding rest bees quickly flying overhead proper collective decisionmaking process remarkably successful identifying suitable new nest site keeping swarm beekeepers wish increase number active hives may use one many methods swarm control methods simulate swarming extinguish swarming drive alternatively also swarm traps nasonov pheromone lures used attract swarms beekeepers aware colony swarmed may add brood eggs free mites given young brood bees second chance raise new queen first one fails beekeepers sometimes called capture swarms cast feral honey bees hives domestic beekeepers remove honeybee swarm small fee maybe even free nearby bee swarms almost always collected alive relocated competent beekeeper bee removal company extermination bee swarm rarely necessary discouraged bee removal various methods capture swarm swarm first settles forms cluster relatively easy capture swarm suitable box nuc one method employed sunny day swarm located lower branch small tree put white sheet swarm location nuc box put sheet swarm sprayed outside sugar solution soaking bees become heavy fly away vigorously shaken branch main cluster hopefully including queen fall onto white sheet bees quickly go first dark entrance space sight opening nuc organized march toward opening ensue minutes majority bees inside nuc capture method work night swarm embroiled perch dropped box sheet skep suspended gentle smoke used herd swarm skep smoke recommended calm clustered swarm smoke opposite effect clustered swarm many bees become agitated fly instead settling bee vac also used swarm bees sometimes frightens people though bees usually aggressive stage life cycle principally due swarming bees lack brood developing bees defend interest finding new nesting location queen mean bees swarm attack perceive threat however bees attack response intrusions colony additionally bees seldom swarm except position sun direct impressivefurther explanation needed swarm clusters hanging tree branch move find suitable nesting location day two encountering bee swarm first time alarming bees tend swarm near hives honeycombs swarm visible nest nearby swarms usually aggressive unless provoked important keep good distance swarms order avoid provoking
