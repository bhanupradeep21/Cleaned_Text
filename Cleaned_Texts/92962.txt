amblyopia also called lazy eye disorder sight brain fails fully process input one eye time favors results decreased vision eye typically appears normal amblyopia common cause decreased vision single eye among children younger cause amblyopia condition interferes focusing early occur poor alignment eyes strabismic eye irregularly shaped focusing difficult one eye nearsighted farsighted refractive clouding lens eye underlying cause addressed vision restored right away mechanism also involves amblyopia difficult detect vision testing recommended children around ages four early detection improves treatment glasses may treatment needed sufficient treatments encourage force child use weaker eye done either using patch putting atropine stronger without treatment amblyopia typically treatment adulthood usually much less amblyopia begins age adults disorder estimated affect treatment improves vision typically restore normal affected amblyopia first described condition may make people ineligible pilots police word amblyopia greek ἀμβλύς amblys meaning blunt ὤψ ōps meaning many people amblyopia especially mild form aware condition tested older ages since vision stronger eye normal people amblyopia typically poor stereo vision since requires eyes may affected eye poor pattern recognition poor visual acuity low sensitivity contrast amblyopia characterized several functional abnormalities spatial vision including reductions visual acuity contrast sensitivity function vernier acuity well spatial distortion abnormal spatial interactions impaired contour detection addition individuals amblyopia binocular abnormalities impaired stereoacuity stereoscopic acuity abnormal binocular also central vision amblyopes crowded central vision normal deficits usually specific amblyopic eye subclinical deficits better eye also people amblyopia also problems binocular vision limited stereoscopic depth perception usually difficulty seeing threedimensional images hidden stereoscopic displays perception depth monocular cues size perspective motion parallax remains normal amblyopia three main causes strabismus sometimes also incorrectly called lazy eye condition eyes strabismus usually results normal vision preferred sighting fellow eye eye person prefers use may cause abnormal vision deviating strabismic eye due difference images projecting brain two adultonset strabismus usually causes double vision diplopia since two eyes fixed object childrens brains neuroplastic easily adapt suppressing images one eyes eliminating double vision plastic response brain interrupts brains normal development resulting amblyopiacitation needed recent evidence points cause infantile strabismus lying input visual strabismic amblyopia tend show ocular motion deficits reading even use nonamblyopic eye particular tend make saccades per line persons normal stereo vision reduced reading speed especially reading text small font source needed strabismic amblyopia treated clarifying visual image glasses encouraging use amblyopic eye eyepatch dominant eye pharmacologic penalization better eye penalization usually consists applying atropine drops temporarily paralyze accommodation reflex leading blurring vision good eye also dilates pupil helps prevent bullying teasing associated wearing patch although sometimes application eye drops challenging ocular alignment may treated surgical nonsurgical methods depending type severity refractive amblyopia may result anisometropia unequal refractive error two anisometropia exists difference power two eyes eye provides brain clearer image typically becomes dominant eye image eye blurred results abnormal development one half visual system refractive amblyopia usually less severe strabismic amblyopia commonly missed primary care physicians less dramatic appearance lack obvious physical manifestation given refractive correction anisometropia means spectacles typically leads different image magnification two eyes may turn prevent binocular vision refractive correction using contact lenses considered also pediatric refractive surgery treatment option particular conventional approaches failed due aniseikonia lack compliance frequently amblyopia associated combination anisometropia strabismus cases vision eyes differ point one eye twice average vision eye completely blind deprivation amblyopia
