skin immunity property skin allows resist infections pathogens addition providing passive physical barrier infection skin also contains elements innate adaptive immune systems allows actively fight infections hence skin provides defense depth infection skin acts barrier kind sheath made several layers cells related glands skin dynamic organ contains different cells contains elements innate adaptive immune systems activated tissue attack invading pathogens shortly infection immune adaptive response induced dendritic cells langerhans cells present epidermis responsible capture processing presentation antigens lymphocytes local lymphoid organs result lymphocytes express cutaneous lymphocyte antigen cla molecule modified form pselectin glycoprotein lymphocytes move epidermis reside memory cells thus activated trigger inflammatory response dysregulation mechanisms associated inflammatory diseases humoral cellular components skin pass vessel lymph get circulation circulation net

activated rapidly migrate lymph nodes accumulate paracortex show antigen skin lymph nodes via efferent lymph vessels langerhans cells induce vast proliferation naïve lymphocytes participate immunoestimulation phase immune response converting lymphocytes helper cells recently shown langerhans cells express antigenic peptide associated mhci capable inducing response cytotoxic lt effector functions production skin microbiota plays important role tissue homeostasis local skin microbial communities highly diverse remodeled time response environment around scientific community thoroughly developed concept human begun systematic study establish relationship microbiome human physiology health wewho begin understand gut microbiota helps modulating host immunity systemic however gut microbiome affect skin immunity significantly instead skin immunity modulated skin microflora according results obtained naik et analyzing immunologic changes germfree gf mice reconstituted gut microbiota showed recovery ifnγ levels observed gastrointestinal tract specific pathogen free spf mice gut microbiome restoration affect skin immunity comparing gf spf mice showed decrease skin production ifnγ evaluate functional consequences absence skin microbiota leishmania major introduced intradermally lesions evaluated l major lesions gf mice significantly smaller less severe spf mice however number parasites infection significantly higher gf mice results clearly indicate gf mice impaired capacity response front infections compared spf mice finally monoassociation gf mice epidermidis clearly restored immunity function case skin mediated key restoration ifnγ levels thus skin commensals exert effect enhancing signaling amplifying responses according local inflammatory milieu implicated etiology pathology psoriasis cutaneous likely skin commensals important drivers amplifiers skin pathologies recent studies demonstrated specific components microbiota well metabolites selectively promote activation expansion different cell subsets normal andor pathological example colonization staphylococcus epidermidis may diverse effects promote growth cells reside epidermis would limit pathogen invasion improving innate immune barrier dependent manner according investigation led us researchers skinresident dendritic cells would ones orchestrate specific response interacting commensal bacteria stimulating proliferation cells capacity produce activation mechanism commensal specific clearly belongs adaptive immune system however strikingly improves innate immune protection shown challenging gnobiotic mice candida albicans indeed monoassociation gnobiotic mice epidermidis significantly improves innate protection c albicans connection innate adaptive system driven case production alarmins known elicit microbicidal responses potent chemoattractants majority bacteria tested increased number skin cells interactions cells specific microbiota components may represent evolutionary outcome skin immune system microbiota provide heterologous protection invasive pathogens calibrate barrier immunity use chemical signals shows skin immune system highly dynamic environment rapidly specifically remodeled certain finally studying microbiota interactions skin cells help detect cause various diseases possible cures increasing development tools
