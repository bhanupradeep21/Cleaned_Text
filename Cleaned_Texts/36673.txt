find difference effects cocaine adults versus mice rats rodents far widely used animals biomedical research recent studies highlighted example utility use rodents testing multiple parkinsons illnesses called question number researchers regarding experiments mice particular researchers complained years billions dollars wasted following false leads result preoccupation use animals mice differ humans several immune properties mice resistant toxins humans lower total neutrophil fraction blood lower neutrophil enzymatic capacity lower activity complement system different set pentraxins involved inflammatory process lack genes important components immune system laboratory mice reared specificpathogenfree spf conditions usually rather immature immune system deficit memory cells mice may limited diversity microbiota directly affects immune system development pathological conditions moreover persistent virus infections example herpesviruses activated humans spf mice septic complications may change resistance bacterial coinfections dirty mice possibly better suitable mimicking human pathologies addition inbred mouse strains used overwhelming majority studies human population heterogeneous pointing importance studies interstrain hybrid outbred nonlinear article scientist notes difficulties associated using animal models human disease result metabolic anatomic cellular differences humans creatures problems go even deeper including issues design execution tests example researchers found many rats mice laboratories obese excess food minimal exercise alters physiology drug many laboratory animals including mice rats chronically stressed also negatively affect research outcomes ability accurately extrapolate findings researchers also noted many studies involving mice rats rodents poorly designed leading questionable one explanation deficiencies studies rodents housed laboratory cages lack access environmental agency thus ongoing freedom make decisions experience consequences housing rodents extreme impoverished conditions captive animals bear diminished resemblance humans wild studies suggests inadequate published data animal testing may result irreproducible research missing details experiments done omitted published papers differences testing may introduce bias examples hidden bias include study mcgill university montreal canada
