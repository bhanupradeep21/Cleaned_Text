dromaeosaurs although much pronounced kuru lacrimal also preserved deep excavation ventral side interpreted napoli colleagues canal nasolacrimal duct mandible represented nearly complete left dentary surangular bone bones preserved continuously consist several discrete pieces also nine preserved dentary teeth three isolated teeth either dentary maxilla dentary straight along length unlike velociraptorines similar dromaeosaurus deinonychus preserved possibly tooth positions much higher typical dromaeosaurs although similar saurornitholestes comparable number dentary teeth teeth ziphodont shape narrower along mediolateral axis anteroposterior axis possess deep roots serrations front back edges least case teeth wellpreserved enough contain details however possess enamel ridges sides teeth seen dromaeosaurs notably third dentary tooth highly elongated forming characteristic fang lower jaw much greater length second fourth dentary teeth however fourth dentary alveolus large third napoli colleagues suggest fourth tooth type specimen fully erupted may similar size third tooth finished surangular mostly complete contains several diagnostic traits kuru genus notable among two foramina rather single one prevalence trait velociraptorinae ambiguous due incompleteness poor preservation area skull tsaagan linheraptor napoli colleagues also comment putative tyrannosauroid bagaraatan two surangular foramina remark specimen may chimera thus may offer limited comparative value surangular also exhibits shelf inclined dorsally condition seen deinonychus differs dromaeosaurs
