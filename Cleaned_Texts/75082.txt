diversity species genes ecological communities affects functioning communities ecological effects biodiversity turn affected climate change enhanced greenhouse gases aerosols loss land covercitation needed biological diversity causing rapid loss biodiversity extinctions species local populations current rate extinction sometimes considered mass extinction current species extinction rates order times high two main areas effect biodiversity ecosystem function studied relationship diversity productivity relationship diversity community biologically diverse communities appear productive terms biomass production less diverse communities appear stable face perturbations also animals inhabit area may alter surviving conditions factors assimilated climate order understand effects changes biodiversity ecosystem functioning important define terms biodiversity easily defined may thought number andor evenness genes species ecosystems region definition includes genetic diversity diversity genes within species species diversity diversity species within habitat region ecosystem diversity diversity habitats within region two things commonly measured relation changes diversity productivity stability productivity measure ecosystem function generally measured taking total aboveground biomass plants area many assume used general indicator ecosystem function total resource use indicators ecosystem function correlated productivity stability much difficult define generally thought two ways general stability population measure assumes stability higher less chance extinction kind stability generally measured measuring variability aggregate community properties like total biomass definition stability measure resilience resistance ecosystem returns quickly equilibrium perturbation resists invasion thought stable one importance stability community ecology clear unstable ecosystem likely lose species thus indeed link diversity stability likely losses diversity could feedback causing even losses species productivity hand less clear importance community ecology managed areas like cropland areas animals grown caught increasing productivity increases economic success area implies area become efficient leading possible long term resource difficult find importance productivity natural ecosystems beyond value biodiversity regulating stabilizing ecosystem processes direct economic consequences losing diversity certain ecosystems world whole losing species means losing potential foods medicines industrial products tourism direct economic effect peoples field experiments test degree diversity affects community productivity variable results many longterm studies grassland ecosystems found diversity indeed enhance productivity additionally evidence relationship also found grassland microcosms differing results studies may partially attributable reliance samples equal species diversities rather species diversities mirror observed experiment utilizing realistic variation species composition grassland samples found positive correlation increased diversity increased however studies come different conclusions whether cause due diversity species composition specifically diversity functional roles species may important quality predicting productivity diversity species recent mathematical models highlighted importance ecological context unraveling problem models indicated importance disturbance rates spatial heterogeneity others indicated time since disturbance habitats carrying capacity cause differing ecological context yield different relationship different contribution relationship due diversity composition current consensus holds least certain combinations species provide increased community order correctly identify consequences diversity productivity ecosystem processes many things must happen first imperative scientists stop looking single relationship obvious models data theory one overarching effect diversity productivitycitation needed scientists must try quantify differences composition effect diversity effects many experiments never quantify final realized species diversity instead counting numbers species seeds planted confound sampling effect facilitators compositional factor diversity effects relative amounts overyielding much species grows grown species monoculture used rather absolute amounts relative overyielding give clues mechanism diversity influencing productivity however experimental protocols incomplete one may able indicate existence complementary facilitative effect experiment able recognize cause experimenters know goal experiment whether meant inform natural managed ecosystems sampling effect may real effect diversity natural ecosystems managed ecosystems composed maximize complementarity facilitation regardless species number knowing able choose spatial temporal scales appropriate experiment lastly resolve diversityfunction debate advisable experiments done large amounts spatial resource heterogeneity environmental fluctuation time types experiments able demonstrate diversityfunction relationship models predicted empirical relationships temporal variation community productivity species diversity indeed real almost temporal stability data almost completely explained averaging effect constructing null models test data competition causes negative covariances serves strengthen relationships area contentious area temporal stability mostly tried generalizing findings temporal stability models theory stability general relationship temporal variations productivity diversity mathematical cause allow relationship seen much often case resistanceresilience stability experimenters seen correlation diversity reduced invasibility though many also seen correlation diversity disease also tenuous though theory data seem support order fully understand effects diversity temporal stability ecosystems necessary recognize bound occur constructing null models test data doak et al becomes possible find situations ecological contexts ecosystems become less stable finding contexts would allow mechanistic studies ecosystems stable may allow applications conservation management importantly complete experiments whether diverse ecosystems actually resist invasion disease better less diverse equivalents invasion disease two important factors lead species extinctions present day order address problems specifically future work focus practical methods increase successful establishment poor performing desirable one major problem

strong topdown forcing ecosystems see keystone species little actual data available regarding effects different food webs theory helps us area first food web ecosystem lot weak interactions different species stable populations community whole upper levels web diverse less biomass lower levels lower levels diverse better able resist consumption stable face consumption also topdown forcing reduced less diverse ecosystems bias species higher trophic levels go extinct lastly recently shown consumers dramatically change biodiversityproductivitystability relationships implied plants thus important
