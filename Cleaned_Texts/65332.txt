zoopharmacognosy behaviour nonhuman animals selfmedicate selecting ingesting topically applying plants soils insects medicinal properties prevent reduce harmful effects pathogens toxins even term derives greek roots zoo animal pharmacon drug medicine gnosy knowing example zoopharmacognosy occurs dogs eat grass induce vomiting however behaviour diverse animals ingest apply nonfoods clay charcoal even toxic plants invertebrates apparently prevent parasitic infestation whether animals truly selfmedicate remains somewhat controversial subject early evidence mostly circumstantial however recent examinations adopted experimental hypothesisdriven approach methods animals selfmedicate vary classified according function prophylactic preventative infection poisoning therapeutic infection combat pathogen behaviour believed widespread adaptive janzen suggested vertebrate herbivores might benefit medicinally secondary metabolites plant term zoopharmacognosy coined derived greek roots zoo animal pharma drug gnosy term gained popularity academic book cindy engel entitled wild health animals keep well learn antiparasitic effect zoopharmacognosy could occur least two mechanisms namely demonstrated modes deglutition ingestion first ingested material may pharmacological antiparasitic properties phytochemicals decreasing ability worms attach mucosal lining intestines chemotaxis attracting worms folds leaves additionally many plants trichomes often presented hooked spiky hairs attach parasites dislodge intestines another possible mode action ingested material may initiate purging response gastrointestinal tract rapidly inducing diarrhoea substantially decreases gut transit time causing worm expulsion interruption life cycle parasites similar mechanism could explain undigested materials faeces various animals birds carnivores topical application materials often used animals treat wounds repel plant leaves chewed directly rubbed onto fur compounds said leaves released use compounds often analgesic antiparasitic nature regards insect repellant secondary metabolites traditionally used plants deter herbivores insects eating used animals protective measure interfering neuroreceptors secondary metabolites specifically act olfactory cues insects avoid certain three reported methods selfmedication deglutition ingestion topical application using one methods

chimpanzees pick aspilia leaves rather chewing roll around mouths sometimes long seconds swallow capsulelike leaves whole afterwards trichomes leaves attach intestinal parasites namely nodular worm oesophagostomum stephanostomum tapeworm bertiella studeri allow chimpanzee physically expel many aspilia leaves may used bout behaviour particularly rainy season abundance many parasitic larvae cause

bonobos group demonstrating indeed utilized bonobos tamarins observed swallowing large seeds fruit regularly ingest although consumed along rest fruit seeds nutritional value monkeys since tamarins routinely infected trematodes cestodes nematodes acanthocephalans speculation deliberate swallowing large seeds help dislodge parasites monkeys similar wild chimpanzees alaskan brown bears swallow whole carex leaves springtime ensure complete expulsion parasites specifically tapeworms thrive previously digested nutrients gut rough carex leaves lacerate scolices facilitating defecation process proactive swallowing leaves ensure low levels active parasites within hibernating bear many examples zoopharmacognosy involve animal ingesting substance potential medicinal properties many parrot

laboratory models parasites woolly bear caterpillars grammia incorrupta sometimes lethally endoparasitised tachinid flies caterpillars ingest plant toxins called pyrrolizidine alkaloids improve
