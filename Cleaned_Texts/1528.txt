amorphosynthesis also called hemisensory deficit neuropsychological condition patient experiences unilateral inattention sensory phenomenon frequently associated damage right cerebral hemisphere resulting severe sensory deficits observed contralesional left side body rightsided deficit less commonly observed effects reported temporary evidence suggests right cerebral hemisphere dominant role attention awareness somatic sensations ipsilateral contralateral contrast left cerebral hemisphere activated contralateral thus left right cerebral hemispheres exhibit redundant processing rightside body lesion left cerebral hemisphere compensated ipsiversive processes right cerebral reason rightsided amorphosynthesis less often observed generally associated bilateral brain areas parietal lobes play integral role processing interpreting somatic sensations body right parietal lobe associated sensory integration perception whereas left parietal lobe believed function conceptual level involving speech reading central sulcus divides frontal lobe parietal lobe located superior occipital lobe posterior frontal lobe primary somatosensory cortex main processing center tactile sensations
