biology hybrid offspring resulting combining qualities two organisms different varieties species genera sexual reproduction generally means cell genetic material two different organisms whereas individual cells derived different organism called hybrids always intermediates parents blending inheritance show hybrid vigor sometimes growing larger taller either parent concept hybrid interpreted differently animal plant breeding interest individual parentage genetics attention focused numbers chromosomes taxonomy key question closely related parent species species reproductively isolated strong barriers hybridization include genetic morphological differences differing times fertility mating behaviors cues physiological rejection sperm cells developing embryo act fertilization others similar barriers exist plants differences flowering times pollen vectors inhibition pollen tube growth somatoplastic sterility cytoplasmicgenic male sterility structure chromosomes animal species many

tame sow wild boar term came popular use english century though examples use found early conspicuous hybrids popularly named portmanteau words starting breeding hybrids liger point view animal plant breeders several kinds hybrid formed crosses within species different single cross hybrids result cross two truebreeding organisms produces hybrid first filial generation cross two different homozygous lines produces hybrid heterozygous two alleles one contributed parent typically one dominant recessive typically generation also phenotypically homogeneous producing offspring similar

reliably described extremely interordinal hybrids different orders engineered sea urchin strongylocentrotus purpuratus female sand dollar dendraster excentricus two distinct types organisms breed resulting hybrids typically intermediate traits eg one plant parent red flowers white hybrid pink commonly hybrids also combine traits seen separately one parent eg bird hybrid might combine yellow head one parent orange belly interspecific hybrids bred mating individuals two species normally within genus offspring display traits characteristics parents often sterile preventing gene flow sterility often attributed different number chromosomes two species example donkeys chromosomes horses chromosomes mules hinnies chromosomes mules hinnies normally sterile interspecific hybrids produce viable gametes differences chromosome structure prevent appropriate pairing segregation meiosis meiosis disrupted viable sperm eggs formed however fertility female mules reported donkey

aurochs steppe plant hybridization commonplace compared animal hybridization many crop species hybrids including notably polyploid wheats four sets chromosomes tetraploid six hexaploid wheat species like eukaryotic organisms two sets diploid hybridization events likely involved doubling chromosome sets causing immediate genetic hybridization may important speciation plant groups however homoploid hybrid speciation increasing number sets chromosomes may rare eight natural examples fully described experimental studies suggest hybridization offers rapid route speciation prediction confirmed fact early generation hybrids ancient hybrid species matching genomes meaning hybridization occurred new hybrid genome remain many hybrid zones known ranges two species meet hybrids continually produced great numbers hybrid zones useful biological model systems studying mechanisms speciation recently dna analysis bear shot hunter northwest territories confirmed existence naturally occurring fertile bear hybridization reproductively isolated species often results hybrid offspring lower fitness either parental however hybrids might expected always intermediate parents blending inheritance sometimes stronger perform better either parental lineage variety phenomenon called heterosis hybrid vigour heterozygote advantage common plant transgressive phenotype phenotype displays extreme characteristics either parent plant breeders use several techniques produce hybrids including line breeding formation complex hybrids economically important example hybrid maize corn provides considerable seed yield advantage open pollinated varieties hybrid seed dominates commercial maize seed market united states canada many major maizeproducing hybrid trait falls outside range parental variation thus simply intermediate parents considered heterotic positive heterosis produces robust hybrids might stronger bigger term negative heterosis refers weaker smaller heterosis common animal plant hybrids example hybrids lion tigress ligers much larger either two progenitors tigons lioness tiger smaller similarly hybrids common pheasant phasianus colchicus domestic fowl gallus gallus larger either parents produced common pheasant hen golden pheasant chrysolophus spurs absent hybrids former type although present hybridization greatly influenced human impact effects habitat fragmentation species impacts make difficult conserve genetics populations undergoing introgressive hybridization humans introduced species worldwide environments long time intentionally purposes biological control unintentionally accidental escapes individuals introductions drastically affect populations including kind continuum three semidistinct categories dealing anthropogenic hybridization hybridization without introgression hybridization widespread introgression backcrossing one parent species hybrid swarms highly variable populations much interbreeding well backcrossing parent species depending population falls along continuum management plans population change hybridization currently area great discussion within wildlife management habitat management global climate

pure individuals population becomes complete mixture goal becomes conserve hybrids avoid loss conservationists treat case merits depending detecting hybrids within population nearly impossible formulate uniform hybridization policy hybridization occur beneficially occurs naturally hybrid swarms remaining evidence prior species need conserved regionally developed ecotypes threatened extinction new alleles genes introduced alter ecotype sometimes called genetic hybridization introgression happen natural hybrid populations new genetic material lead replacement local genotypes hybrids fit breeding advantages indigenous ecotype species hybridization events result introduction nonnative genotypes humans habitat modification bringing previously isolated species contact genetic mixing especially detrimental rare species isolated habitats ultimately affecting population degree none originally genetically distinct population agriculture animal husbandry green revolutions use conventional hybridization increased yields breeding highyielding varieties replacement locally indigenous breeds compounded unintentional crosspollination crossbreeding genetic mixing reduced gene
