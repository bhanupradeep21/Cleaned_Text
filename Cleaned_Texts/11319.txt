pulmonary contusion also known lung contusion bruise lung caused chest trauma result damage capillaries blood fluids accumulate lung tissue excess fluid interferes gas exchange potentially leading

close monitoring needed however intensive care may required example breathing severely compromised mechanical ventilation may necessary fluid replacement may required ensure adequate blood volume fluids given carefully since fluid overload worsen pulmonary edema may lethal severity ranges mild severe small contusions may little impact health yet pulmonary contusion common type potentially lethal chest trauma occurs severe chest injuries risk death following pulmonary contusion pulmonary contusion usually accompanied injuries although associated injuries often cause death pulmonary

pulmonary contusion associated complications including pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome cause longterm respiratory disability pulmonary contusion laceration injuries lung tissue pulmonary

wounds seriously damage large areas lung tissue blast injury physical processes behind pulmonary contusion poorly understood however known lung tissue crushed chest wall bends inward three possible

front chest may cause contusion back lungs shock wave travels chest hits curved back chest wall reflects energy onto back lungs concentrating similar mechanism may occur front lungs back amount energy transferred lung determined large part compliance flexibility chest childrens chests flexible ribs elastic less ossification intercostal therefore chest walls bend absorbing less force transmitting
