anticonvulsant used treat acute epileptic buccal administration vaccines studied challenges approach due immune tolerance mechanisms prevent body overreacting immunogens encountered course daily buccal tablets type solid dosage form administered orally gums inner linings tablets held within buccal pouch either act oral mucosa rapidly absorbed buccal mucosal since drugs absorbed buccal mucosa bypass gastrointestinal enzymatic degradation hepatic firstpass prescribing buccal tablets increasingly common among healthcare professionals buccal tablets serve alternative drug delivery patients compliance known issue including unconscious nauseated difficulty swallowing ie wide variety drugs available market prescribed hospitals healthcare settings including common examples like common route drug transport buccal mucosa paracellular pathway hydrophilic drugs permeate cheek linings via paracellular pathway mechanism passive diffusion hydrophobic drugs transported transcellular route administration beneficial mucosal administration transmucosal buccal tablets typically formulated direct compression drug powder mixture swollen polymer agents assist buccal tablets offer many advantages terms accessibility ease administration withdrawal hence may improve patient notable drawbacks buccal tablets include hazard choking involuntarily swallowing tablet irritation caution exercised along counselling medical practitioners use tablets recent advances buccal tablets conditions conventional oral route ie swallowing tablet delivered effectively commonly prescribed buccal tablets available healthcare settings listed examples hydrocortisone corticosteroid clinically used relieve pain discomfort mouth ulcers functions speed healing mouth ulcerscitation needed common side effects include oral thrush visual disturbances eg blurry vision worsening diabetes worsening mouth infections allergic reactions eg skin rash hydrocortisone contraindicated patients hypersensitive hydrocortisone mouth ulcers caused dentures infection worsen severity mouth ulcers cautions remarks include needing gargle spit water tablet fully dissolved minimise risk oral thrush prolonged use may lead withdrawal symptoms chewing swallowing tablet may limit efficacy give rise additional side effects caution inhibitors fentanyl opioid analgesic used treatment breakthrough pain cancer patients already receiving andor tolerant maintenance opioid therapy chronic cancer common side effects include nausea vomiting headache constipation drowsiness fentanyl contraindicated patients hypersensitive fentanyl opioid nontolerant patients management acute postoperative pain severe hypotension severe obstructive airway diseases eg copd cautions include needing keep tablets sight reach children must sucked chewed swallowed remarks include caution administered patients hepatic renal impairment drug interactions inducers inhibitors coadministration cns sedative agents eg antihistamines increase cns side effects prochlorperazine maleate class antiemetics antipsychotics buccal tablets administered treatment severe nausea vomiting associated well managed symptoms schizophrenia side effects typically seen patients using prochlorperazine maleate tablets include drowsiness blurred vision dry mouth headache rare cases tablets may cause serious allergic reactions ie anaphylaxis prochlorperazine maleate contraindicated certain patient groups including hypersensitivity prochlorperazine maleate certain diseases like glaucoma epilepsy parkinsons disease also avoided hepatic prostate gland problems special caution taken patients high risk blood clot stroke along associated risk factors eg high blood pressure high cholesterol levels taking prochlorperazine maleate avoid exposure direct sunlight due photosensitivity taken certain drugs either sedative give dry mouth eg anticholinergics target heart eg antihypertensives anticoagulants remarks include effective taken food possible withdrawal symptoms abruptly stopped buccal mucosa along gingival sublingual mucosa part oral composed nonkeratinised tissue unlike intestinal nasal mucosae lacks tight junctions instead equipped loose intercellular links desmosomes gap junctions less permeable effect sublingual administration buccal administration still capable creating local systemic effects following drug oral cavity buccal tablets potentiate effect entering bloodstream direction internal jugular vein superior vena avoiding acidic hydrolysis take place gastrointestinal two major routes drug transportation buccal mucosa transcellular paracellular small hydrophobic molecules lipophilic compounds mostly move across buccal mucosa via transcellular pathway drugs transferred via transcellular pathway either facilitated diffusion polar ionic compounds diffusion low molecular weight molecules transcytosis endocytosis physicochemical properties drug example oilwater partition coefficient molecular weight structural conformation determines whether molecules transported transcellular cell membrane lipophilic difficult drugs hydrophilic permeate membrane hence excipients formulation phospholipid bilayer assist enhancing diffusion hydrophilic compounds ie peptides proteins generally small lowmolecularweight hydrophilic compounds diffuse across buccal epithelium paracellular pathway via passive diffusion extracellular amphiphilic lipid matrix proves major barrier macromolecular hydrophilic administration buccal tablet must transport either epithelial layers achieve effect systemic circulation systemic effect remain target site elicit local buccal tablets offer many advantages solid dosage forms also intended oral administration eg entericcoated tablets chewable tablets capsules buccal tablets considered patients experience difficulty swallowing since tablets absorbed blood stream gum difficulty swallowing occur age groups especially young infants elderly buccal tablets also used unconscious patientscitation needed additionally case accidental swallowing buccal tablet adverse effects minimal buccal drugs survive hepatic firstpass metabolism compared orally ingested capsules tablets buccal tablets provide rapid onset action oral mucosa highly buccal tablets also used emergency situations exert effects quickly buccal tablets directly enter systemic circulation bypassing gastrointestinal tract firstpass metabolism patients take reduced overall dose minimise symptoms addition buccal tablets removed adverse reactions appear general many drugs suitable delivered via buccal mucosa due small dose criteria buccal tablets rarely used healthcare settings due unwanted properties may limit patient compliance example unpleasant taste irritation oral undesired characteristics may lead accidental swallowing involuntary expulsion buccal tablet buccal tablets also preferred drugs require absorption drugs via buccal membrane may suitable patients due possible undesirable side effects loss drug effectiveness buccal tablets must crushed chewed swallowed circumstances buccal tablets always appropriate patients eg individuals enteral tube feeding also noted eating drinking smoking avoided buccal tablet fully dissolved prevent drug efficacy changes concerns buccal tablets dry formulations attain bioadhesion dehydrating local mucosal many bioadhesive buccal tablet formulations created direct compression method release retardant swollen designed either release drug unidirectional multidirectional manner conventional dosage forms unable ensure therapeutic drug levels circulation mucosa mucosal transmucosal administration washing effect saliva mechanical stress oral two mechanisms act physiological removal system removes formulation mucosa resulting decreased exposure time unpredictable pharmacological profile drugs effect countered prolonging contact active substance buccal tablet mucosa tablet contain mucoadhesive agents penetration enhancers enzyme inhibitors solubility mucoadhesive agents assist maintenance prolonged contact drug absorption penetration enhancers improve ability drug permeate mucosa transmucosal delivery
