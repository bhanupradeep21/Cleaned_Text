effects combination estrogen gestodene include menstrual irregularities headaches nausea breast tenderness mood changes otherscitation needed gestodene progestin synthetic progestogen hence agonist progesterone receptor biological target progestogens like weak androgenic activity weak antimineralocorticoid activity weak glucocorticoid gestodene discovered introduced medical use specifically birth control pills subsequently introduced use menopausal hormone therapy gestodene sometimes referred thirdgeneration marketed birth control pills widely throughout world whereas available use menopausal hormone therapy gestodene approved united gestodene neutral terms androgenic activity meaning contraceptive pills containing gestodene exhibit androgenic side effects eg acne hirsutism sometimes associated secondgeneration contraceptive pills containing estrogen dosage thirdgeneration contraceptive pills including containing gestodene lower secondgeneration oral contraceptives reducing likelihood weight gain breast tenderness thirdgeneration oral contraceptives also suitable use patients diabetes lipid disorders minimal impact blood glucose levels lipid gestodene also available combination estradiol use menopausal hormone contraceptive products containing gestodene include women take oral contraceptives containing gestodene times likely develop venous thromboembolism women take contraceptive pill times likely develop venous thromboembolism compared women taking oral contraceptives containing gestodene highly potent progestogen also possesses weak androgenic antimineralocorticoid glucocorticoid due progestogenic activity antigonadotropic functional antiestrogenic medication little estrogenic antiandrogenic gestodene progestogen hence agonist progesterone based dosage necessary inhibit ovulation women gestodene potent currently used oral contraceptive oral dosage gestodene required ovulation inhibition μg per times lower oral dosage progesterone required inhibit ovulation dosage gestodene μgday used gestodene relatively high affinity androgen receptor ar twice levonorgestrel known one androgenic however ratio progestogenic androgenic effects gestodene distinctly higher levonorgestrel increase sex hormonebinding globulin shbg levels marker androgenicity produced oral contraceptives containing gestodene slightly less produced oral contraceptives containing desogestrel known one weakly androgenic addition difference acne incidence observed oral contraceptives containing gestodene oral contraceptives containing gestodene may also act extent taken together like desogestrel gestodene appears low potential androgenic gestodene relatively high affinity glucocorticoid receptor corticosteroid weak glucocorticoid gestodene high affinity mineralocorticoid receptor mr relatively weak antimineralocorticoid effect comparable although gestodene bind estrogen receptor drug may estrogenic activity would appear mediated weakly estrogenic metabolites lesser extent gestodene binds shbg relatively high affinity bound protein gestodene shows inhibition cytochrome enzymes vitro greater potency action compared progestins halfmaximal inhibitory concentration medication also shows inhibition vitro μm like cytochrome inhibition gestodene potent action compared progestins including desogestrel oral bioavailability gestodene found range mean unlike thirdgeneration progestins like desogestrel norgestimate gestodene peak levels gestodene occur within hours oral dose usually within plasma protein binding gestodene bound sex hormonebinding globulin albumin circulating gestodene metabolized liver via reduction group form metabolites major pathway via hydroxylation positions spite differing
