neuronal connections provides owls advantage many mammals neuronal connections require much reason visual cues slightly less important owls especially comes utilizing sound localization eyes nonspherical immobile head making difficult orient eyes towards visual dr eric knudsen performed many different experiments barn owls course several years study vision plays role ability localize
