cameleon engineered protein based variant green fluorescent protein used visualize calcium levels living cells genetically encoded calcium sensor created roger tsien name conflation cam common abbreviation calmodulin chameleon indicate fact sensor protein undergoes conformation change radiates altered wavelength upon calcium binding calmodulin element cameleon cameleon first genetically encoded calcium sensor could used ratiometric measurements first used transgenic animal record activity neurons muscle cameleon genetically encoded calcium indicators gecis found many applications neuroscience fields biology created fusing bfp calmodulin calmodulinbinding peptide dna encoding cameleon fusion protein must either stably transiently introduced cell interest protein made cell according dna information serves fluorescent indicator calcium concentration presence calcium binds enables calmodulin wrap around domain brings two gfpvariant proteins closer increases fret efficiency
