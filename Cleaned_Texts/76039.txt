magnesium cyanide chemical compound formula toxic white solid unlike calcium isocyanide cyanide ligands prefer coordinate carbon isomerization heated decomposes magnesium first attempt prepare magnesium cyanide attempted attempted reacting solution hydrogen cyanide water magnesium however magnesium cyanide observed magnesium hydroxide formed avoid problem instead using water reaction medium pure ammonia used formed magnesium cyanide ammoniate turn heated produce magnesium methods possible decomposition magnesium ferricyanide electric carbon tube produces iron carbide magnesium cyanide reacts silver nitrate form magnesium silver cyanide formula compound heated produces hydrogen cyanide gas magnesium hydroxide presence water meant could used pathway production magnesium cyanide silver nitrate reacts magnesium cyanide also produces another magnesium silver cyanide formula httpsenwikipediaorgwikimagnesiumcyanide
