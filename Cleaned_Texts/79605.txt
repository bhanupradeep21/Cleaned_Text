wormbase online biological database biology genome nematode model organism caenorhabditis elegans contains information related wormbase used c elegans research community information resource place publish distribute results database regularly updated new versions released every two months wormbase one organizations participating generic model organism database gmod project wormbase comprises following main data sets addition wormbase contains uptodate searchable bibliography c elegans research linked wormbook project wormbase offers many ways searching retrieving data database sequence curation wormbase refers maintenance annotation primary genomic sequence consensus gene set even though c elegans genome sequence accurate complete eukaryotic genome sequence continually needed refinement new evidence created many changes single nucleotide insertions deletions however several large misassemblies uncovered example kb cosmid inverted improvements come comparing genomic dna cdna sequences analysis rnaseq highthroughput data differences genomic sequence transcripts identified reanalysis original genomic data often leads modifications genomic sequence changes genomic sequence pose difficulties comparing chromosomal coordinates data derived different releases wormbase coordinate remapping program mapping data available aid comparisons genesets wormbase species initially generated gene prediction programs gene prediction programs give reasonable set gene structures best predict complete gene structures correctly difficulty predicting genes unusual structures well weak translation start signal weak splice sites single exon genes incorrectly predict coding gene model gene pseudogene predict isoforms gene poorly gene models c elegans c briggsae c remanei c
