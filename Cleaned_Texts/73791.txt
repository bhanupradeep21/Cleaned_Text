pseudoresponse regulator prr refers group genes regulate circadian oscillator plants four primary prr proteins perform majority interactions proteins within circadian oscillator another limited function genes paralogs repress transcription circadian clock associated late elongated hypocotyl lhy various times throughout day expression peak around morning midday afternoon evening respectively group genes one part threepart repressilator system governs biological clock plants multiple labs identified prr genes parts circadian clock akinori matsushika seiya makino masaya kojima takeshi mizuno first understand prr genes pseudoresponse repressor genes rather response regulator arr factor distinguishes prr arr genes lack phosphoaccepting aspartate site characterizes arr proteins though
