desmostylia greek δεσμά desma bundle στῦλος stylos extinct order aquatic mammals native north pacific early oligocene rupelian late miocene tortonian million years ago desmostylians known extinct order marine desmostylia together sirenia proboscidea possibly embrithopoda traditionally assigned afrotherian clade tethytheria group named paleoocean tethys around originally evolved relationship desmostylia orders within tethytheria disputed common ancestor tethytheres semiaquatic proboscidea became secondarily terrestrial alternatively desmostylia sirenia could evolved independently aquatic assignment desmostylia afrotheria always problematic biogeographic standpoint given africa locus early evolution afrotheria desmostylia found along pacific rim assignment seriously undermined cladistic analysis places anthracobunids desmostylians two major groups putative nonafrican afrotheres close within laurasiatherian order however subsequent study shows anthracobunids definite
