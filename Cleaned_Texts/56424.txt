microcytic anaemia several types anemia characterized smaller normal red blood cells called microcytes normal mean corpuscular volume abbreviated mcv full blood count results also known mean cell volume approximately fl mcv fl macrocytic latter occurs macrocytic anemia mcv average red blood cell size microcytic anemia red blood cells erythrocytes contain less hemoglobin usually also hypochromic meaning red blood cells appear paler usual reflected low mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration mchc measure representing amount hemoglobin per unit volume fluid inside cell normally gl gdl typically therefore anemia category described microcytic hypochromic anemia typical causes microcytic anemia include rare hereditary causes microcytic anemia include sideroblastic anemia xlinked anemias hereditary hypotransferrinemia hereditary aceruloplasminemia erythropoietic protoporphyria ironrefractory iron deficiency anemia thalassemic mutations hemoglobin e hemoglobin lepore rare acquired causes microcytic anemia include lead poisoning zinc deficiency copper deficiency alcohol certain causes typically thought causing normocytic anemia macrocytic anemia must also considered presence two causes anemia distort typical picture nearly half anemia cases due iron deficiency common nutritional although common nutritional disorder causes irondeficiency anemia ida due blood occurs commonly among children females menstruating happen individual well low mcv diagnostic criteria includes low serum ferritin levels transferrin saturation may also differential diagnoses ida include lead poisoning anemia chronic disease hemoglobin cc disease hemoglobin dd disease autoimmune hemolytic anemia hemoglobin sbeta thalassemia fatiguecausing conditions like fibromyalgia depression hypothyroidism patient may present pallor conjunctivitis tachycardia increased respiratory rate exhaustion koilonychia spoonshaped nails severe cases may also present anemia chronic disease acd second common cause anemia often fairly mild sometimes asymptomatic potential symptoms including fatigue headache paleness shortness usually occurs individuals chronic inflammation due medical diagnosis treatment difficult may overlap iron deficiency thus typically diagnosis diagnosis may involve review morphology blood film bone marrow reticulocyte count stool analysis serum bilirubin lactate dehydrogenase assay assessment renal since acd caused underlying disorder complete resolution condition unlikely treatments focus controlling inflammatory disorder rather treating acd potential inflammatory conditions cause acd pulmonary tuberculosis rheumatoid arthritis malignancies among many acd common older individuals affects almost elderly clear cause anemia reported also suggests multifactorial thalassemia inherited condition variants alpha beta globin genes result lower levels globin chains required make hemoglobin resulting alpha thalassemia beta thalassemia diagnosis made dna analysis alpha thalassemia hemoglobin analysis beta management thalassemia involves chronic transfusions maintain hemoglobin level reduces symptoms anemia well suppresses extramedullary hematopoiesis lead multiple folic acid supplements also recommended cases theory three common microcytic anemias iron deficiency anemia anemia chronic disease thalassemia differentiated red blood cell rbc morphologies anemia chronic disease shows unremarkable rbcs iron deficiency shows anisocytosis anisochromia elliptocytosis thalassemias demonstrate target cells coarse basophilic stippling practice though elliptocytes anisocytosis often seen thalassemia target cells occasionally iron three may show unremarkable rbc morphology basophilic stippling one morphologic finding thalassemia appear iron deficiency anemia chronic disease patient ethnically atrisk group diagnosis confirmed without confirmatory method hemoglobin hplc h body staining molecular testing another reliable method coarse basophilic stippling occurs cases seen table ida acd often confused important evaluate laboratory parameters ida associated low hemoglobin ferritin transferrin saturation also associated normal creactive protein high acd associated well low hemoglobin ferritin may normalhigh transferrin saturation transferrin mcv may additional difference ida acd acd often associated high creactive treatments microcytic anemia depend cause anemia irondeficiency anemia ida treated addressing underlying cause example gastrointestinal bleeding inadequate dietary iron latter case anemia treated via either dietary pharmacological oral intravenous iron nonpharmacological measures treat ida entail increasing intake dietary iron especially heme sources liver seafood red however measures often take great deal time longer replenish iron stores compared pharmacological agents iron pharmacological agents may also required cases deficiency severe cases iron loss exceeds dietary intake individuals follow plantbased diet nonheme sources often lower oral iron supplements used taken empty stomach increase however may increase risk side effects nausea epigastric individuals severe ida limit physical activity deficiency acd iron therapy may effective pathogenesis absolute iron deficiency rather relative deficiency availability iron red cell however cases iron may administered orally potential treatments include red cell transfusion administration polyunsaturated fatty acids administration erythropoiesisstimulating thalassemias treated differently depending severity mild cases may treated prescription folic acid supplement help red blood cells blood transfusions may necessary severe cases prevent iron overload due transfusions chelation therapy may also required remove excess iron cases bone marrow transplant hematopoietic stem cell transplantation gene therapy treatments may prognosis microcytic anemias depends cause anemia speed treated ida prognosis excellent long underlying cause deficiency however cause addressed deficiency becomes chronic longterm prognosis much poorer especially older adults untreated iron deficiency associated cognitive impairment heart conditions developmental delay children pregnancy complications depression negative acd prognosis largely depends whether underlying cause outlook thalassemia depends severity consistently treated severe forms may cause stillbirth early death less severe forms wellmanaged cases often shorten expected httpsenwikipediaorgwikimicrocyticanemia
