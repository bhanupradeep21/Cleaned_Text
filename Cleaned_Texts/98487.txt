psychology drive theory theory drives drive theory attempts analyze classify define psychological drives drive instinctual need power driving behavior excitatory state produced homeostatic drive theory based principle organisms born certain psychological needs negative state tension created needs satisfied need satisfied drive reduced organism returns state homeostasis relaxation according theory drive tends increase time operates feedback control system much like thermostat two psychologists clark hull kenneth spence put forward drive theory explanation study conducted hull two groups

described revolutionary addition psychology paving way theoretical psychiatry psychoanalytical early attachment theory behavioral drive reduction proposed dollard miller explanation mechanisms behind early attachment infants behavioural drive reduction theory suggests infants born innate drives hunger thirst caregiver usually mother reduce process classical conditioning infant learns associate mother satisfaction reduced drive thus able form key attachment bond however theory challenged work done harry harlow particularly experiments involving maternal separation rhesus monkeys indicate comfort possesses greater motivational value social psychology drive theory used robert zajonc explanation phenomenon social audience effect notes cases presence passive audience facilitate better performance task cases presence audience inhibit performance task zajoncs drive theory suggests variable determining direction performance whether task composed correct dominant response task perceived subjectively easy individual incorrect dominant response perceived subjectively difficult presence passive audience individual heightened state arousal increased arousal stress causes individual enact behaviours form dominant responses since individuals dominant response likely response given skills available dominant response correct social presence enhances performance task however dominant response incorrect social presence produces impaired performance increasing performance well learned tasks impairing performance poorly learned tasks behaviour first noticed triplett observing cyclists racing together versus cyclists racing found mere presence cyclists produced greater performance similar effect observed chen ants building however zajonc investigated behaviour empirical explanation audience effect zajoncs drive theory based involving investigation effect social facilitation cockroaches zajonc devised study individual cockroaches released tube end light presence cockroaches spectators cockroaches observed achieve significantly faster time reaching light control nospectator group however cockroaches conditions given maze negotiate performance impaired spectator condition demonstrating incorrect dominant responses presence audience impair performance cottrells evaluation apprehension model later refined theory include yet another variable mechanisms social facilitation suggested correctness dominant responses plays role social facilitation expectation social reward punishment based performance study differs design zajoncs introduced separate condition participants given tasks perform presence audience blindfolded thus unable evaluate participants performance found social facilitation effect occurred hence anticipation performance evaluation must play role social evaluation apprehension however key human social facilitation observed abschnitt trieblehre kapitel das menschliche triebsystem triebe sind radikale der menschlichen
