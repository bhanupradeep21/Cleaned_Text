fontan procedure procedure palliative surgical procedure used children univentricular hearts involves diverting venous blood inferior vena cava ivc superior vena cava svc pulmonary arteries procedure varies differing congenital heart pathologies example tricuspid atresia procedure done blood pass morphologic right ventricle ie systemic pulmonary circulations placed series functional single ventricle whereas hypoplastic left heart syndrome heart reliant functional right ventricle provide blood flow systemic circulation procedure initially performed francis fontan eugene baudet bordeaux france published simultaneously described guillermo kreutzer buenos aires argentina finally published fontan kreutzer procedure used pediatric patients possess single functional ventricle either due lack heart valve eg tricuspid mitral atresia abnormality pumping ability heart eg hypoplastic left heart syndrome hypoplastic right heart syndrome complex congenital heart disease biventricular repair impossible inadvisable surgery allows blood delivered lungs via central venous pressure rather via right patients typically present neonates cyanosis congestive heart fontan completion usually carried patient years age also performed years four variations fontan fontan procedure third procedure staged surgical performed children born congenital heart disease without two functional ventricles effective parallel blood flow first stage known norwood procedure stage generally involves combining pulmonary artery aorta form larger vessel blood get body artificial tube shunt placed larger vessel pulmonary arteries blood get heart lungs wall left right atrium removed allow mixing oxygenated deoxygenated second stage called hemifontan bidirectional glenn procedure intermediary stage incorporates shifting oxygenpoor blood top body superior vena cava svc carries blood returning upper parts body disconnected heart instead redirects blood pulmonary inferior vena cava ivc carries blood returning lower body continues connect right third stage called fontan procedure involves redirecting blood inferior vena cava point oxygenpoor blood upper lower body flows lungs without pumped driven pressure builds veins central venous pressure improves lower normal oxygen levels results one functional ventricle responsible supplying blood rest body currently three various modern techniques fontan procedure include atriopulmonary connection lateral tunnel total cavopulmonary connection extracardiac conduit fontan kreutzer completion blood must flow lungs without pumped heart therefore children high pulmonary vascular resistance may tolerate fontan procedure often cardiac catheterization performed check resistance proceeding surgery also reason fontan procedure done immediately birth pulmonary vascular resistance high utero takes months drop fontan procedure also contraindicated pulmonary artery hypoplasia significant mitral insufficiencycitation needed short
