drug abuse retinopathy damage retina eyes caused chronic drug abuse types retinopathy caused drug abuse include maculopathy saturday night retinopathy talc retinopathy common symptoms include temporary permanent vision loss blurred vision night blindness substances commonly associated condition include poppers heroin cocaine methamphetamine tobacco retina innermost layer made three layers namely outer pigmented layer middle photoreceptor layer inner neural layer pigmented layer responsible absorbing light penetrates inner neural layer photoreceptor layer consists kinds photoreceptor cells rod cells cone cells rod cells high sensitivity light responsible night vision differentiate colors meaning black white vision cone cells low sensitivity light ability differentiate colors photoreceptors cells unevenly distributed throughout retina density rod cells increases peripherally cone cells concentrated region called macula rod region responsible highresolution color maculopathy eye disease refers breakdown macula region retina containing highest concentration cone cells responsible color symptoms maculopathy include reduction central vision acuity distorted vision perceived flashes light occur without actual light saturday night retinopathy condition due central retinal ophthalmic artery common clinical features include ophthalmoplegia orbital etiology condition related unconsciousness drug use leading patient sleeping unusual position continuously exerts pressure orbital compression result ophthalmic central retinal artery occlusion lead ischemia inner retina patient may experience sudden unilateral blindness eye talc filler commonly added tablet formulation acting glidant improve flowability drug powdercitation needed also frequently added adulterant illicit drugs heroin methamphetamine increase volume weight thus street inhaled enter systemic circulation capillaries nasal entering systemic circulation deposit retinal blood vessels undergo reaction lead focal narrowing retinal significantly reduces blood flow retina eventually lead retinal clinical features include refractile yellow deposit seen patients may experience reduction visual field visual poppers inhaled drug contains range alkyl nitrites isobutyl nitrite amyl despite primary usage potent popularity among homosexual community largely stems ability facilitate anal sexual intercourse relaxing smooth muscles internal anal use intranasal poppers associated development macular degeneration poorly known mechanism condition may consequence increase nitric oxide level following oxidation alkyl nitrites increase level exerts significant stimulatory effect guanylate cyclase enzyme found cone upon activation guanylate cyclase converts guanosine triphosphate gtp cyclic guanosine monophosphate cgmp cgmp involved phototransduction pathway allows calcium sodium enter depolarize high level cgmp results high levels calcium cells increase intracellular cgmp calcium level results production reactive oxygen species ros damage macular cone cells leading macular heroin opioid rapid onset action intravenously administration injected binds mu receptors central nervous system within users feel sense euphoria shortly application making highly addictive use intravenous heroin associated development saturday night currently specific treatment deemed effective treating saturday night retinopathy ischemic injury caused prolonged compression external forces irreversibly dealt retinal case high intraocular pressure anterior chamber paracentesis lateral canthotomy considered standard treatments symptoms proptosis enlargement extraocular muscles eye pain seem resolve absence drugrelated problems patients evaluated heroinrelated sequelae referred cocaine central nervous system stimulant used recreationally produce euphoric cocaine associated retinal toxicity mainly negative impacts retinal cocaine use causes increased norepinephrine levels resulting sympathetic activation leads vasospasm risk factors retinal blood vessel damage related retinal vasculature conditions include central retinal artery central retinal vein cilioretinal artery occlusion retinal blood vessels reduces blood supply retina causes tissue ischemia insufficient blood flow deprives retina oxygen removal waste metabolites prevents proper retinal homeostasis causes tissue injury long period time tissue damage accumulates leads tissue death retinal duration cocaine use major contributing factor severity adverse retinal cocaine use also associated retinal hemorrhage due general increase blood pressure blood vessel occlusion within signs symptoms retinal hemorrhage include painless unilateral floaters seeing red hue cobwebs haze shadows visual advanced retinal hemorrhage may limit visual acuity fields may lead formation blind vision often poorer morning treatments retinal hemorrhage include cryotherapy laser methamphetamine highly addictive stimulant stimulates release dopamine brain common manufacturing process methamphetamine includes reduction overthecounter nasal decongestant pseudoephedrine contains talc therefore intranasal intravenous use methamphetamine associated talc treatment talc retinopathy cessation methamphetamine plays role preventing reduction visual field acuity nicotine highly addictive substance found tobacco products cigarettes cigars chewing nicotine inhaled consumed enters bloodstream damages blood vessels common symptoms include blurred vision dark spots vision even blindness severe exact mechanisms nicotine causes retinopathy fully understood however believed nicotine cause oxidative stress inflammation leading ocular vascular additionally nicotine cause constriction blood vessels reducing blood flow eyes making vulnerable damage recommended smokers exhibiting signs symptoms retinopathy engage smoking cessation improve quality heavy alcohol use associated higher blood pressure consumption alcohol leads release renin enzyme aids activation hormone called angiotensin hormone causes blood vessels constrict increases blood pressure relationship particularly pronounced people elevated blood pressure damage delicate blood vessels eye lead hepatic metabolism excess alcohol leads increase level endogenous methanol often present homemade causes swelling eye optic nerve damage retina especially people underlying liver disease already risk retinopathy due alcoholinduced liver disease also exacerbate health conditions contribute retinopathy alcohol consumption leads abnormalities metabolism pathways several essential nutrients eye health vitamin zinc alcohol undergoes oxidative metabolism liver converted acetaldehyde acetic retinol form vitamin food dietary supplements oxidatively metabolized following similar pathway converted retinal retinoic acid active form vitamin excessive alcohol consumption places heavy burden enzymes catalyzing reactions leads poor vitamin besides alcohol mediates modulation zinc transporters leads decrease levels zinc results retinopathic symptoms macular httpsenwikipediaorgwikidrugabuseretinopathy
