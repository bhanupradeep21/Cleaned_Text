hypertensive kidney disease medical condition referring damage kidney due chronic high blood pressure manifests hypertensive nephrosclerosis sclerosis referring stiffening renal distinguished renovascular hypertension form secondary hypertension thus opposite direction causation signs symptoms chronic kidney disease including loss appetite nausea vomiting itching sleepiness confusion weight loss unpleasant taste mouth may hypertensive refers high blood pressure nephropathy means damage kidney hence condition chronic high blood pressure causes damages kidney tissue includes small blood vessels glomeruli kidney tubules interstitial tissues tissue hardens thickens known narrowing blood vessels means less blood going tissue less oxygen reaching tissue resulting tissue death risk factors hn include poorly controlled moderatetosevere hypertension older age kidney disorders afrocaribbean background whose exact cause unclear may due either genetic susceptibility poor health management among people afrocaribbean kidneys result benign arterial hypertension hyaline pink amorphous homogeneous material accumulates walls small arteries arterioles producing thickening walls narrowing arterial openings process known arteriolosclerosis resulting inadequate blood flow produces tubular atrophy interstitial fibrosis glomerular alterations smaller glomeruli different degrees

complications often associated hypertensive nephropathy include glomerular damage resulting protein blood urinecitation needed hypertensive nephropathy refers kidney failure attributed history chronic condition serious risk factor development endstage kidney disease eskd however despite wellknown association hypertension chronic kidney disease underlying mechanism remains unclear two proposed mechanisms hns centre around glomerulus network dense capillaries carries kidney filtration process affected one theory identifying glomerular ischemia main contributor hn identifying glomerular hypertension glomerular hyperfiltration centre hns high blood pressure long term damage endothelium commonly known blood vessel lining leads buildup plaques deposited renal arteries causing stenosis ischemic kidney diseasecitation needed situation kidney supplied blood narrowed renal artery suffers inadequate blood flow turn causes size kidneys decrease consequences include arterial stiffening involves gradual breakdown elastic fibers intima innermost layer blood vessel thickeningcitation needed alternative mechanism hypertensive nephropathy prolonged glomerular hypertension hence glomerular hyperfiltration occur simultaneously necessarily idea hypertension results sclerosis glomeruli ultimately means reduced kidney function compensatory mechanism unaffected nephrons specifically preglomerular arterioles vasodilate increase blood flow kidney perfusion increase glomerular filtration across undamaged glomerulicitation needed diagnosis hn made clinical history biochemical investigations chronic hypertension progressive kidney disease progresses long period time damage glomeruli allows proteins usually large pass nephron filtered leads elevated concentration
