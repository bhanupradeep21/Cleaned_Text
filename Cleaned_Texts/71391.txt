hepatitis infectious disease liver caused hepatovirus type viral many cases symptoms especially time infection symptoms develop symptoms occur typically last weeks may include nausea vomiting diarrhea jaundice fever abdominal around people experience recurrence symptoms months initial acute liver failure may rarely occur common usually spread eating food drinking water contaminated infected
