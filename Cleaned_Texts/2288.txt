adding sharovs two characters olshevsky believes longisquama archosaur moreover early unwin benton think possible diagnose crucial fenestrae holes could simply damage agreed sharov longisquama acrodont teeth interclavicle instead furcula saw paired clavicles features would typical member lepidosauromorpha meaning longisquama archosaur thus closely related birds according cladistic study

skull one fossil slabs previously used justify presence antorbital fenestrae contain actual bone study concluded none proposed classifications longisquama could confirmed refuted using available evidence authors study tentatively placed longisquama among archosauromorpha result hypothesis developmental deep homology plumes bird feathers crocodile scales pterosaur questions relating reptilian classification longisquama exact function long scales relate wider debate origin birds whether descended dinosaurs consensus paleontologists agrees birds evolved theropod dinosaurs scenario hypothesis early theropod dinosaurs endothermic evolved simple filamentous feathers insulation feathers later increased size complexity adapted aerodynamic uses ample evidence hypothesis found fossil record specifically dinosaurs kulindadromeus sinosauropteryx caudipteryx microraptor many others longisquama thus regarded diapsid strange scales ambiguous skeletal features real significance bird evolution minority scientists prefer hypothesis birds evolved small arboreal archosaurs like longisquama see ectothermic animals adapted gliding developing elongated scales pennaceous feathers hypothesis
