ventral slot technique procedure allows surgeon reach decompress spinal cord associated nerve roots ventral route veterinary medicine also alternative ways open spinal canal dorsal performing hemilaminectomy often gives limited access even main pathological changes evolve midline necessary choose ventral ventral slot commonly performed splitting ventral soft tissues neck pushing great vessels laterally entering disc space securing esophagus trachea located taking medial part disc leaving lateral part intact cutting away small part adjacent vertebrae extend gap vertical manner way vertical slot including upper lower bone plates next disc makes possible decompress spinal cord midline necessary sides including leaving nerve roots also necessary spacer placed disc space prevent operated segment collapse secondary kyphosis possible serious complications complete incomplete tetraplegia pneumonia unnoticed injury general data discovery development original procedure belong british physician charles bell first describe extent soft tissue ventral spinal canal condition recognized prolapse nucleus pulposus took till first vet janson realized disc extrusion classical condition dog main pathology detailed descriptions precise radiological imaging pathologic changes dog develop hoerlein olsson hansen funquist many others contributed significantly literature forming foundations current medical surgical therapies ivd protrusion extrusion especial belonging surgical technique important advancements human surgery made robert robinson ralph robert baily basic contributions taken veterinary veterinary medicine common procedure treat centrally located intervertebral disc herniation veterinary surgeons use ventral slot technique animal shows symptoms pain sensorimotor deficits belonging either compression spinal cord single nerve root alternatively single nerve root affected also possible release compressed nerve root via surgery performed dogs cats meticulous preparation needed prevent damage region involved part neck vertebral column ventral slot procedure divided eight main steps surgeon isnt allowed mobilize shift spinal cord otherwise affected animal paralyzed afterwards midline pathology approach ventral direction mandatory vertical skin incision made ventral side midline ventral musculature split midline vascular structures retracted laterally trachea esophagus mobilized across midline opposite side attention paid deep nerve structures recurrent laryngeal nerve goal expose affected disc ventral surface adjacent two vertebral bodies steps important break lateral border disk space otherwise vertebral artery could entering disk space taking material slot created following natural orientation disc space expanded adjacent vertebral bodies staying midline extent slot exceed half vertebral body cranial caudal time providing surgical room slot disc material taken easily disc ligament reached removing ligament spinal canal finally opened step taking away bone spurs simultaneously myelon working laterally orientation foraminotomy starts part osteophyte removed fashion nerve root free visible foramen probed nerve hook ensure nerve free decompress longer part cervical canal corpectomy performed one disc another ventral every surgery comes along kind risk possible complications injury structures way disc space like nerves trachea esophagus vessels resulting intraoperative blood loss apoplexy postoperative paresis tetraparesis avoid collapse across opened disc space several implants available implanted material consists cervical disc prosthesis fixed spacer metal titanium synthetic material peek veterinary medicine using similar materials human medicine referring common insert cage allograf cases surgeon using ventral plate screws keep vertebral bodies together implant position main goal using prosthesis obtain physiological motion two affected vertebral bodies however cases myelopathy secure fusion attempted compressed myelin recover decompression time initial paralysis sensorimotor deficits resolve step general animal needs weeks recovery normal positive path development past surgery everything goes planned recovery statistics shown cases urinary catheter needed besides continuous pain medication doubt infection especially pneumonia antibiotic therapy started based actual data dogs receiving physiotherapy serves strengthening muscles stimulating spinal cord functions show quickly better recovery dogs without risk early infection damage operated vertebrae animal moves quick uncontrolled adverse effects like postoperative paresis tetraparesis pneumonia appear cases depending width lateral extension slot dogs may suffer subluxation included vertebrae one control early postoperative course making sure animal stays calm gets controlled short walks prevent overuse fixed still fusing vertebral ensure good recovery good longterm results serial neurologic evaluation postsurgical patient recommended according hard foresee actual outcome spinal cord injury even early surgery due many important facts like animal breed age size statistics shown dogs cervical spinal trauma reported good prognosis recovery rate animal suffer pulmonary complications terms todays statistical basis surgeons able give secure prognosis outcome httpsenwikipediaorgwikiventralslot
