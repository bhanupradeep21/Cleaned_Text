carotenoids kəˈrɒtɪnɔɪd yellow orange red organic pigments produced plants algae well several bacteria archaea carotenoids give characteristic color pumpkins carrots parsnips corn tomatoes canaries flamingos salmon lobster shrimp daffodils identified carotenoids categorized two classes xanthophylls contain oxygen carotenes purely hydrocarbons contain derivatives tetraterpenes meaning produced isoprene units contain carbon atoms general carotenoids absorb wavelengths ranging nanometers violet green light causes compounds deeply colored yellow orange red carotenoids dominant pigment autumn leaf coloration tree many plant colors especially reds purples due polyphenols carotenoids serve two key roles plants algae absorb light energy use photosynthesis provide photoprotection via nonphotochemical carotenoids contain unsubstituted betaionone rings including βcarotene αcarotene βcryptoxanthin γcarotene vitamin activity meaning converted retinol eye lutein mesozeaxanthin zeaxanthin present macular pigments whose importance visual function remains clinical carotenoids produced photosynthetic organisms primarily used accessory pigments chlorophyll lightharvesting part photosynthesis highly unsaturated conjugated double bonds enables carotenoids absorb light various wavelengths time terminal groups regulate polarity properties within lipid membranes carotenoids tetraterpenoids regular c displaystyle ce isoprenoids several modifications structures exist including cyclization varying degrees saturation unsaturation functional carotenes typically contain carbon hydrogen ie hydrocarbons prominent members include αcarotene βcarotene lycopene known carotenes carotenoids containing oxygen include lutein zeaxanthin known color ranging pale yellow bright orange deep red directly related structure especially length xanthophylls often yellow giving class name carotenoids also participate different types cell able signal production abscisic acid regulates plant growth seed dormancy embryo maturation germination cell division elongation floral growth stress length multiple conjugated double bonds determines color absorbing photon carotenoid transfers excited electron chlorophyll use upon absorption light carotenoids transfer excitation energy chlorophyll singletsinglet energy transfer lower energy state transfer used triplettriplet transfer higher energy state essential light produces damaging species photosynthesis damaging reactive oxygen species ros high energy ros produced chlorophyll energy transferred carotenoid polyene tail undergoes series reactions electrons moved carotenoid bonds order find balanced lowest energy state carotenoids defend plants singlet oxygen energy transfer chemical reactions also protect plants quenching triplet protecting lipids freeradical damage generate charged lipid peroxides oxidised derivatives carotenoids support crystalline architecture hydrophobicity lipoproteins cellular lipid structures hence oxygen solubility diffusion like fatty acids carotenoids lipophilic due presence long unsaturated aliphatic consequence carotenoids typically present plasma lipoproteins cellular lipid carotenoids located primarily outside cell nucleus different cytoplasm organelles lipid droplets cytosomes granules visualised quantified raman spectroscopy algal development monoclonal antibodies translycopene possible localise carotenoid different animal human betacarotene found pumpkins sweet potato carrots winter squash responsible orangeyellow dried carrots highest amount carotene food per serving measured retinol activity equivalents provitamin vietnamese gac fruit contains highest known concentration carotenoid although green kale spinach collard greens turnip greens contain substantial amounts diet flamingos rich carotenoids imparting orangecolored feathers reviews preliminary research indicated foods high carotenoids may reduce risk head neck prostate correlation consumption foods high carotenoids vitamin risk parkinsons humans animals mostly incapable synthesizing carotenoids must obtain diet carotenoids common often ornamental feature animals example pink color salmon red coloring cooked lobsters scales yellow morph common wall lizards due needed proposed carotenoids used ornamental traits extreme examples see puffin birds given physiological chemical properties used visible indicators individual health hence used animals selecting potential carotenoids diet stored fatty tissues exclusively carnivorous animals obtain compounds animal fat human diet absorption carotenoids improved consumed fat cooking carotenoidcontaining vegetables oil shredding vegetable increase carotenoid common carotenoids include lycopene vitamin precursor βcarotene plants xanthophyll lutein abundant carotenoid role preventing agerelated eye disease currently lutein carotenoid pigments found mature leaves often obvious masking presence chlorophyll chlorophyll present autumn foliage yellows oranges carotenoids predominant reason carotenoid colors often predominate ripe fruit unmasked disappearance chlorophyll carotenoids responsible brilliant yellows oranges tint deciduous foliage dying autumn leaves certain hardwood species hickories ash maple yellow poplar aspen birch black cherry sycamore cottonwood sassafras alder carotenoids dominant pigment autumn leaf coloration tree however reds purples blended combinations decorate autumn foliage usually come another group pigments cells called anthocyanins unlike carotenoids pigments present leaf throughout growing season actively produced towards end dietary carotenoids metabolic derivatives responsible bright yellow red coloration studies estimate around modern bird species display carotenoid coloration ability utilize pigments external coloration evolved independently many times throughout avian evolutionary carotenoid coloration exhibits high levels sexual dimorphism adult male birds generally displaying vibrant coloration females differences arise due selection yellow red coloration males female many species birds females invest greater time resources raising offspring male partners therefore imperative female birds carefully select high quality mates current literature supports theory vibrant carotenoid coloration correlated male though direct effects immune function oxidative connection carotenoid metabolizing pathways pathways cellular generally considered sexually selected traits carotenoidbased coloration evolve honest signals phenotypic genetic quality instance among males bird species parus major colorfully ornamented males produce sperm better protected oxidative stress due increased presence carotenoid however also evidence attractive male coloration may faulty signal male quality among stickleback fish males attractive females due carotenoid colorants appear underallocate carotenoids germline since carotinoids beneficial antioxidants underallocation germline cells lead increased oxidative dna damage therefore female sticklebacks may risk fertility viability offspring choosing redder deteriorated partners reduced sperm quality products carotenoid degradation
