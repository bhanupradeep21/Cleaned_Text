science history science mathematics chemistry physics earth sciences biology scientific study life natural science broad scope several unifying themes tie together single coherent field instance organisms made cells process hereditary information encoded genes transmitted future generations another major theme evolution explains unity diversity life energy processing also important life allows organisms move grow reproduce finally organisms able regulate internal environments biologists able study life multiple levels organization molecular biology cell anatomy physiology plants animals evolution populations hence multiple subdisciplines within biology defined nature research questions tools use like scientists biologists use scientific method make observations pose questions generate hypotheses perform experiments form conclusions world around life earth emerged billion years ago immensely diverse biologists sought study classify various forms life prokaryotic organisms
