human fertilization union human egg sperm occurring primarily ampulla fallopian result union leads production fertilized egg called zygote initiating embryonic development scientists discovered dynamics human fertilization process fertilization involves sperm fusing ovum common sequence begins ejaculation copulation follows ovulation finishes fertilization various exceptions sequence possible including artificial insemination vitro fertilization external ejaculation without copulation copulation shortly upon encountering secondary oocyte acrosome sperm produces enzymes allow burrow outer shell called zona pellucida egg sperm plasma fuses eggs plasma membrane nuclei fuse triggering sperm head disconnect flagellum egg travels fallopian tube reach uterus vitro fertilization ivf process egg cells fertilized sperm outside womb vitro antiquity aristotle depicted formation new individuals occurring fusion male female fluids form function emerging gradually mode called fertilization occurs ampulla fallopian tube section curves around ovary capacitated sperm attracted progesterone secreted cumulus cells surrounding progesterone binds catsper receptor sperm membrane increases intracellular calcium levels causing hyperactive motility sperm continue swim towards higher concentrations progesterone effectively guiding around million spermatozoa reach ampulla beginning process sperm undergoes series changes freshly ejaculated sperm unable poorly able sperm must undergo capacitation females reproductive tract increases motility hyperpolarizes membrane preparing acrosome reaction enzymatic penetration eggs tough membrane zona pellucida surrounds sperm binds corona radiata layer follicle cells outside secondary oocyte corona radiata sends chemicals attract sperm fallopian tube oocyte lies zona pellucida membrane glycoproteins surrounds spermatozoan pierce yolk ooplasm drawn conical elevation termed cone attraction reception cone spermatozoon entered peripheral portion yolk changes membrane perivitelline membrane prevents passage additional binding corona radiata sperm reaches zona pellucida extracellular matrix glycoproteins glycoprotein zona pellucida binds receptor cell surface sperm head binding triggers acrosome burst releasing acrosomal enzymes help sperm penetrate thick zona pellucida layer surrounding oocyte ultimately gaining access eggs cell sperm cells consume acrosome prematurely surface egg cell facilitating penetration sperm cells population mature haploid sperm cells average genome similarity premature acrosomal reactions aid fertilization member may regarded mechanism kin selection recent studies shown egg passive process words appear undergo changes help facilitate sperm enters cytoplasm oocyte tail outer coating sperm disintegrate fusion sperm oocyte membranes causes cortical reaction cortical granules inside secondary oocyte fuse plasma membrane cell causing enzymes inside granules expelled exocytosis zona pellucida turn causes glycoproteins zona pellucida crosslink ie enzymes cause hydrolyse making whole matrix hard impermeable sperm prevents fertilization egg one preparation fusion genetic material oocyte sperm undergo transformations reaction fusion cell membranes oocyte completes second meiotic division results mature haploid ovum release polar nucleus oocyte called pronucleus process distinguish nuclei result fertilization sperms tail mitochondria degenerate formation male pronucleus mitochondria humans maternal origin still considerable amount rna sperm delivered resulting embryo likely influences embryo development phenotype sperm nucleus fuses ovum enabling fusion genetic material sperm enters perivitelline space spermspecific protein izumo head binds juno receptors oocyte bound two blocks polyspermy occur approximately minutes juno receptors oocyte lost membrane causing longer fusogenic additionally cortical reaction happen caused ovastacin binding cleaving receptors zona two blocks polyspermy prevent zygote much dna pronuclei migrate toward center oocyte rapidly replicating dna prepare zygote first mitotic usually chromosomes spermatozoon chromosomes egg cell fuse approximately half spermatozoons carry x chromosome half membranes dissolve leaving barriers male female chromosomes dissolution mitotic spindle forms spindle captures chromosomes disperse egg cytoplasm upon subsequently undergoing mitosis includes pulling chromatids towards centrioles anaphase cell gathers genetic material male female together thus first mitosis union sperm oocyte actual fusion two daughter cells resulting mitosis one replica chromatid replicated previous stage thus genetically identicalcitation needed fertilization event commonly used mark
