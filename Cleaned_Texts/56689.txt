composting toilet type dry toilet treats human waste biological process called composting process leads decomposition organic matter turns human waste compostlike material composting carried microorganisms mainly bacteria fungi controlled aerobic composting toilets use water flushing therefore called dry toilets many composting toilet designs carbon additive sawdust coconut coir peat moss added use practice creates air pockets human waste promote aerobic decomposition also improves carbontonitrogen ratio reduces potential odor composting toilet systems rely mesophilic composting longer retention time composting chamber also facilitates pathogen dieoff end product also moved secondary system usually another composting step allow time mesophilic composting reduce pathogens composting toilets together secondary composting step produce humuslike end product used enrich soil local regulations allow composting toilets urine diversion systems toilet bowl collect urine separately control excess moisture vermifilter toilet composting toilet flushing water earthworms used promote decomposition compost composting toilets require connection septic tanks sewer systems unlike flush common applications include national parks remote holiday cottages ecotourism resorts offgrid homes rural areas developing countries term composting toilet used quite loosely meaning varies country example germany scandinavian countries composting always refers predominantly aerobic process aerobic composting may take place increase temperature due microbial action without temperature increase case slow composting cold composting earth worms used vermicomposting also increase temperature composting toilets differ pit latrines arborloos use less controlled decomposition may protect groundwater nutrient pathogen contamination provide optimal nutrient recycling also differ urinediverting dry toilets uddts pathogen reduction achieved dehydration also known precise term desiccation feces collection vault kept dry possible composting toilets aim certain degree moisture composting chamber composting toilets used implement ecological sanitation approach resource recovery people call composting toilet designs ecosan toilets reason however recommended two terms ie composting ecosan composting toilets also called sawdust toilets appropriate amount aerobic composting taking place toilets container clivus multrum type composting toilet large composting chamber toilet seat also receives undigested organic material increase carbon nitrogen ratio alternatives smaller composting chambers called selfcontained composting toilets since composting chamber part toilet unit composting toilets suitable areas rural area park lacks suitable water supply sewers sewage treatment also help increase resilience existing sanitation systems face possible natural disasters climate change earthquakes tsunami composting toilets reduce perhaps eliminate need septic tank system reduce environmental footprint particularly used conjunction onsite greywater treatment system types toilets used resource recovery reusing sanitized feces urine fertilizer soil conditioner gardening ornamental activities composting toilet consists two elements place sit squat collectioncomposting composting unit consists four main many composting toilets collect urine chamber feces thus divert urine adding small amounts water used anal cleansing problem composting toilet handle composting toilets divert urine water used anal washing prevent creation anaerobic conditions result saturation compost leads odors vector problems usually requires users use toilet seated position offering waterless urinal addition toilet help keep excess amounts urine composting chamber alternatively rural areas men boys may encouraged find tree composting chamber constructed ground level inside structure include separate superstructure drainage system removes leachate otherwise excess moisture cause anaerobic conditions impede decomposition urine diversion improve compost quality since urine contains large amounts ammonia inhibits microbiological composting toilets greatly reduce human waste volumes psychrophilic thermophilic mesophilic composting keeping composting chamber insulated warm protects composting process slowing due low temperatures following gases may emitted composting process takes place composting toilets hydrogen sulfide ammonia nitrous oxide volatile organic compounds gases potentially lead complaints odours methane may also present odorous wastederived compost recycles fecal nutrients carry spread pathogens process reuse waste done properly pathogen destruction rates composting toilets usually low particularly helminth eggs genus carries risk spreading disease proper system management place compost human waste processed mesophilic conditions taken directly compost chamber safe food high temperatures long composting times required kill helminth eggs hardiest pathogens helminth infections common many developing countries thermophilic composting bacteria thrive temperatures oxidize break waste components consumed process reducing volume eliminating potential pathogens destroy pathogens thermophilic composting must heat compost pile sufficiently enough time years must elapse since fresh material added biological activity pathogen removal effect one guideline claims pathogen levels reduced safe level thermophilic composting temperatures least two weeks one alternative guideline claims complete pathogen destruction may achieved already entire compost heap reaches temperature one hour one day one week one although others regard overly four main factors affect decomposition human waste food waste provide optimum conditions composting usually water nitrogen content high particularly urine mixed feces additives bulking material wood chips bark chips sawdust shredded dry leaves ash pieces paper absorb moisture additives improve pile aeration increase carbon nitrogen bulking material also covers feces reduces insect access absent sufficient bulking material material may become compact form impermeable layers leads anaerobic conditions leachate removal controls moisture levels necessary ensure rapid aerobic composting commercial units include urineseparator urinediverting system andor drain bottom composter purpose microbial action also requires oxygen typically air commercial systems provide ventilation moves air bathroom waste container vertical pipe venting roof air movement via

toilets use slow composting also called cold composting compost heap built step step time finished end product slow composting toilets moldering toilets moldering privies us generally free pathogens world health organization guidelines offer framework safe reuse waste using multiple barrier slow composting toilets employ passive approach common applications involve modest often seasonal use remote trail networks typically designed materials deposited isolated operational part toilet also closed allow mesophilic slow composting toilets rely long retention times pathogen reduction

compost container within toilet unit slightly larger flush toilet use roughly floor space units use fans aeration optionally heating elements maintain optimum temperatures hasten composting process
