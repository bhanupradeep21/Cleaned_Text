soil increase metal solubility mobilization plants absorb additives increase metal uptake plants also lead large amounts available metals soil beyond plants able translocate causing potential leaching subsoil examples plants known accumulate following contaminants phytostabilization reduces mobility substances environment example limiting leaching substances focuses long term stabilization containment pollutant plant immobilizes pollutants binding soil particles making less available plant human uptakecitation needed unlike phytoextraction phytostabilization focuses mainly sequestering pollutants soil near roots plant tissues pollutants become less bioavailable resulting reduced exposure plants also excrete substance produces chemical reaction converting heavy metal pollutant less toxic stabilization results reduced erosion runoff leaching addition reducing bioavailability example application phytostabilization using vegetative cap stabilize contain mine soil amendments
