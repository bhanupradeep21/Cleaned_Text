alphablockers also known αblockers αadrenoreceptor antagonists class pharmacological agents act antagonists αadrenergic receptors historically alphablockers used tool pharmacologic research develop greater understanding autonomic nervous system using alpha blockers scientists began characterizing arterial blood pressure central vasomotor control autonomic nervous today used clinical treatments limited number alpha blockers treat small range diseases hypertension raynauds disease benign prostatic hyperplasia bph erectile generally speaking treatments function binding αblocker α receptors arteries smooth muscle ultimately depending type alpha receptor relaxes smooth muscle blood vessels increases fluid flow term alpha blocker used without qualification refer blocker blocker nonselective blocker activity α blocker β however common type alpha blocker usually blocker nonselective αadrenergic receptor antagonists include selective receptor antagonists include selective receptor antagonists include finally agents carvedilol labetalol α βblockers common drugs used clinic irreversibly blocks alpha induced hours action initial lowers blood pressure decreasing peripheral cardura xl coreg cr limited clinical αblocker uses αblockers used hypertension benign prostatic hyperplasia αblockers used treat diseases raynauds disease congestive heart failure chf pheochromocytoma erectile furthermore αblockers occasionally used treat anxiety panic disorders posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd induced studies also great medical interest testing alpha blockers specifically blockers treat type ii diabetes psychiatric hypertension due increase vascular resistance vasoconstriction using selective antagonists prazosin efficacious treating mild moderate hypertension decrease vascular resistance decrease however drugs generally well tolerated potential produce side effects orthostatic hypotension however unlike treatments hypertension ace inhibitors arbs calcium channel blockers thiazide diuretics beta blockers alpha blockers demonstrated mortality morbidity benefits therefore generally used first even second line agents another treatment hypertension using drugs blocking activity well nonselective β activity labetalol low doses labetalol carvedilol decrease peripheral resistance block effects isoprenaline reduce hypertensive pheochromocytoma disease catecholamine secreting tumor specifically norepinephrine epinephrine secreted tumors either continuously excess release catecholamines increases central nervous system stimulation thus causing blood vessels increase vascular resistance ultimately giving rise addition patients rare tumors often subject headaches heart palpitations increased phenoxybenzamine nonselective blocker used treat drug blocks activity epinephrine norepinephrine antagonizing alpha receptors thus decreasing vascular resistance increasing vasodilation decreasing blood pressure blockers ability block α β receptors carvedilol bucindolol labetalol ability mitigate symptoms congestive heart binding α β receptors drugs decrease cardiac output stimulate dilation blood vessels promote reduction blood yohimbine blocker derived bark pausinystalia johimbe tree tested increase libido treat erectile dysfunction proposed mechanism yohimbine blockade adrenergic receptors associated neurotransmitters inhibition including dopamine nitric oxide thus aiding penile erection alter blood flow penis aid achieving erection however side effects occur palpitation tremor elevated blood pressure yohimbe bark contains adrenergic receptors blocking alkaloids phentolamine nonselective alpha blocker also tested treat erectile dysfunction reducing vasoconstriction penis appears increased blood flow aids penile erection side effects associated phentolamine include headache flushing nasal phenoxybenzamine noncompetitive blocker used dr giles brindley first intracavernosal pharmacotherapy erectile dysfunctionmedical citation needed benign prostatic hyperplasia bph men experience urinary obstruction unable urinate thus leading urinary specific blockers used relax smooth muscle bladder enlarged prazosin doxazosin terazosin particularly useful patients bph especially patients patients drugs treat conditions patients without hypertension tamsulosin used ability relax bladder prostate smooth muscle without causing major changes blood blockers blockers examined treat raynauds disease although blockers prazosin appeared give slight improvement sclerotic symptoms raynauds disease many side effects occur taking drug conversely blockers yohimbine appear provide significant improvement sclerotic symptoms raynauds disease without excessive side patients posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd often continued symptomatic despite treated ptsdspecific addition ptsd patients often debilitating nightmares continue despite high doses blocker prazosin efficacious treating patients ptsd induced nightmares due ability block effects adverse effects prazosin treat ptsd nightmares include dizziness first dose effect sudden loss consciousness weakness nausea although alpha blockers ability reduce disease pathology side effects come alpha however several structural compositions make alpha blocker different side effects different drug side effects arise taking alpha blockers include first dose effect cardiovascular side effects genitourinary side effects well side one common side effects alpha blockers first dose phenomenon patients hypertension take alpha blocker first time suddenly experience intense decrease blood pressure ultimately gives rise orthostatic hypotension dizziness sudden loss consciousness due drastic drop blood alpha blockers possess side effects include prazosin doxazosin alpha blockers give rise changes cardiovascular system induction reflex tachycardia orthostatic hypotension heart palpitations via alterations qt alpha blockers may side effects include yohimbine phenoxybenzamine alpha blockers used treat bph causes vasodilation blood vessels bladder prostate thus increasing urination however alpha blockers produce exact opposite side effect edema abnormal fluid retention addition due relaxation prostate smooth muscle another side effect arises men treated bph impotence well inability however ejaculation activity occur oftentimes results phenomenon called retrograde ejaculation semen flows urinary bladder instead exiting drugs may produce side effects include prazosin terazosin tamsulosin finally general side effects caused alpha blockers however frequently blockers side effects include dizziness drowsiness weakness fatigue psychiatric depression dry priapism unwanted painful long term erection brought sexual arousal lasting several hours associated alpha blocker use extremely rare particularly tamsulosin cause permanent impotence treated hospital setting male patients made aware result single dose develop time one compelling indication alpha blockers benign prostatic patients need alpha blockers bph history hypotension postural heart failure use drugs caution may result even greater decrease blood pressure make heart failure even compelling contraindication urinary incontinence overall fluid combat fluid retention patients take diuretic combination absence compelling indications contraindications patients take alpha blockers step therapy reduce blood pressure use ace inhibitors angiotensinii receptor blockers calcium channel blockers thazide diuretics full dose combinations drug drug interactions occur alpha blockers instance alpha blockers used reduction blood pressure phenoxybenzamine phentolamine synergy drugs affect smooth muscle blood vessels drugs used erectile dysfunction ie sildenafil tamsulosin etc stimulates exaggerated alternative alpha blockers prazosin tamsulosin doxazosin terazosin adverse interactions beta blockers erectile dysfunction drugs anxiolytics interactions cause dangerous hypotension furthermore rare cases drug interactions cause irregular rapid heartbeats increase blood yohimbine interact stimulants hypertension drugs naloxone clonidine interactions drugs cause either unintended increase blood pressure potentiate increase blood finally drugs alpha beta blocking properties carvedilol labetalol interactions alpha beta blockers exaggerate decrease blood conversely also drug interactions carvedilol labetalol blood pressure increased unintentionally cough cold finally may also alphabeta blocker drug interactions worsen previous heart alpha blockers work blocking effect nerves sympathetic nervous system done binding alpha receptors smooth muscle blood αblockers bind reversibly several α receptors throughout body drugs bind specifically receptors found vascular smooth muscle pupillary dilator muscle heart prostate pilomotor smooth hand receptors found platelets cholinergic nerve terminals vascular smooth muscle postsynaptic cns neurons fat
