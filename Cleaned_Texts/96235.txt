coffin birth also known postmortem fetal expulsion nonviable fetus vaginal opening decomposing body deceased pregnant woman due increasing pressure intraabdominal gases kind postmortem delivery occurs rarely decomposition body practice chemical preservation whereby chemical preservatives disinfectant solutions pumped body replace natural body fluids bacteria reside therein made occurrence coffin birth rare topic rarely mentioned international medical discourse typically decomposition human body naturally occurring bacteria organs abdominal cavity stomach intestines generate gases byproducts metabolism causes body swell cases confined pressure gases squeeze uterus womb even forcing downward may turn insideout forced body vaginal opening process called prolapse fetus contained within uterus could therefore expelled mothers body vaginal opening uterus turns insideout process outward appearances mimics childbirth main differences lie state mother fetus mechanism delivery event natural live childbirth mothers contractions thin widen cervix expel infant womb case coffin birth builtup gas pressure within putrefied body pregnant woman pushes dead fetus body mother cases recorded medical authorities since century though archaeological cases provide evidence occurrence many periods human history cases postmortem fetal expulsion always rare phenomenon recorded disparate circumstances occasionally seen modern forensic context body pregnant woman lies undisturbed undiscovered time following death also cases whereby fetus may become separated body pregnant woman time

become depleted oxygen body begins putrefy anaerobic bacteria gastrointestinal tract proliferate result increased metabolic activity release gases carbon dioxide methane hydrogen bacteria secrete exoenzymes break body cells proteins ingestion thus weakens organ tissues increasing pressure forces diffusion excessive gases weakened tissues enter circulatory system spread parts body causing torso limbs become bloated decompositional processes weaken structural integrity organs separating necrotizing tissue bloating usually begins two five days death depending external temperature humidity environmental volume gas increases pressure begins force various body fluids exude natural point decomposition pregnant body amniotic membranes become stretched separated intraabdominal gas pressure
