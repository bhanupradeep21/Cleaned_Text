pagophagia greek pagos frostice phag≈ç compulsive consumption ice iced form disorder known pica latin refers magpie eats everything medical definition refers persistent consumption nonnutritive substances period least one however different studies included alternative definitions including daily consumption full glasses ice purposeful ingestion least one ordinary tray ice daily period excess two pagophagia shown associated irondeficiency responsive iron leading investigators postulate forms pica may result nutritional similarly folk wisdom also maintained pica reflected appetite compensate nutritional deficiencies low iron zinc iron deficient pregnant women experience symptoms pagophagia decreased cravings ice observed iron later research demonstrated substances ingested pica generally provide mineral nutrient people deficient long run people start consuming nonfoods compulsively pica also cause additional nutritional hypothesis neurological basis pagophagia proposed study iron deficiency anemia shown improved response times performing neuropsychological test given ice chew result researchers hypothesized chewing ice causes vascular changes allow increased perfusion brain well activation sympathetic nervous system also increases blood flow brain allowing increased processing speed although also hypothesize chewing ice may lessen pain glossitis stomatitis related irondeficiency anemia specific pathophysiology still unknown hypothesis remains american dental association recommends chewing ice lead dental injury suggests ice allowed melt mouth main symptom pagophagia intense cravings chewing ice pagophagia find constantly chewing ice cubes shaved ice even frost since common underlying cause pagophagia irondeficiency anemia many people disorder also experience weakness fatigue pallor sore tongue dizziness headache cold extremitiesmedical citation needed symptoms associated iron deficiency may include brittle nails cracking corner mouth restless legs severe cases iron deficiency also cause body make decreased oxygencarrying capacity blood increasing cardiac output thus palpitations angina well shortness breath may also present specially preexisting cardiovascular disease excess water intake source lead hyponatremia noted least one case although compulsive consumption ice frequently associated deficiency iron exact etiology form pica wellunderstood one hypothesis states consumption ice activates vasoconstrictive response causes increase blood flow brain fatigue common symptom experienced irondeficiency anemia due decreased levels oxygen delivered brain increase blood flow brain consumption ice thought increase alertness improve symptoms fatigue support hypothesis individuals irondeficient anemia found improved response times neuropsychological tests compared healthy controls chewing reports demonstrated improvement resolution pagophagia given iron people irondeficiency anemia showed symptoms pagophagia complete resolution symptoms iron levels treated suggesting association serum iron levels symptoms pagophagia another case individual presented pagophagia prescribed tablets ferrous sulfate twice daily individual also administered low molecular weight dextran hour symptoms pagophagia immediately another case woman irondeficiency anemia related gynecological bleeding admitted dietary screening showed consumption ice cubes day past years given iron supplementation anemia treated along disappearance pagophagia within two one study looked relationship pagophagia h pylori infection iron deficiency anemia found pagophagia increase risk h pylori infections specific population addition h pylori infection pagophagia synergistic effect development iron absorption abnormalities pagophagia often reported calcium deficiency pathophysiology several cases pagophagia associated certain psychological conditions compulsive behavior depressive disorder pagophagia used coping mechanism deal psychological suggestions causes pagophagia include hunger gastrointestinal distress related ways body attempts ease known risk factors pica include stress cultural factors learned behavior low socioeconomic status underlying mental health disorder nutritional deficiency child neglect pregnancy epilepsy familial one case report woman presented complaints freezer frost eating ice developed habit eating ice cubes freezer frost day eventually increased consumption ice cubes day medical assessment revealed past family history chronic psychiatric disorder physical disorder hemoglobin serum calcium stool examination normal one suspected cause pagophagia psychological stress stressor sons annual examinations woman previously prescribed venlafaxine vitamin bcomplex two six weeks improvement doctor initiated fluoxetine daily venlafaxine tapered dose increased three weeks counseling behavioral treatment given pagophagia resolved four months along case previous reports shown selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors effective treating pagophagia counseling behavioral strategies positive negative reinforcement utilized people psychiatric pagophagia may often go undiagnosed condition may consider harmless seek medical help unless behavior begins interfere lives however disorder harmless seems since underlying medical causes remain undiagnosed may lead complications example anemia treated properly heart need exert force order supply adequate oxygen throughout body progress heart complications pagophagia include tooth sensitivity dental injury leading cracked chipped teeth overconsumption ice may cause bloating gas stomach pain imaging exams abdominal xrays endoscopy may ordered person presents abdominal due relation pagophagia iron deficiency anemia diagnosis begins obtaining medical history physical exam well blood tests includes complete blood count additional tests determine levels hemoglobin hematocrit serum iron ferritin protein helps body store individuals anemic tests would show results lower normal levels would confirm diagnosis blood slide ordered doctor may show red blood cells smaller paler normal case severe iron deficiency white blood cell count may also differential diagnosis psychiatric conditions performed setting pagophagia schizophrenia psychosis eating disorders substance use autism considered differential screening suspected pagophagia may appropriate include screening iron deficiency screening pagophagia may help clinicians gather valuable information towards diagnosis treatment especially populations risk iron deficiency women menstruating pregnant lactating may benefit pagophagia screening high occurrence iron deficiency groups groups risk due prevalence iron deficiency include blood donors individuals postsurgery trauma people experience malabsorption collecting information health screening determine causes blood loss malabsorption iron diet laboratory tests determine iron deficiency may appropriate people present symptoms pagophagia iron deficiency confirmed laboratory screening iron replacement therapy considered oral supplementation counter prescription formulations iron containing ferrous gluconate ferrous sulfate ferrous fumarate available one study pica iron deficient versus iron replete blood donors pica reported donors iron depletiondeficiency compared ironreplete donors pagophagia accounting reported pica case series pagophagia men irondeficiency anemia concluded pagophagia occurred men irondeficiency anemia men older higher platelet counts less likely pagophagia compared younger men lower platelet women pica often seen pregnancy estimates pregnant women experiencing pica pica prevalence manifestation culturally geographically study pregnant women tehran iran found pica study population pagophagia accounting observed pica cases logistic regression showed positive correlation pica pregnancy pregnancy complications lower educational attainment use iron study pica pregnant mexicanborn women living either united states mexico found differing rates pagophagy two metaanalysis prevalence pica german children found german children engaged pica behavior point lives specify types pica despite pica observed young children important note also common eating disorder among intellectually thus proper diagnosis pica essential requiring children least two years age common see
