amlodipine allergy amlodipine situations occur however amlodipine generally used patients cardiogenic shock hearts ventricles able pump enough blood calcium channel blockers exacerbate situation preventing flow calcium ions cardiac cells required heart use patients aortic stenosis narrowing aorta meets left ventricle since inhibit ventricles function generally safe still cause collapse cases severe unstable angina excluding variant angina amlodipine cause reflex increase cardiac contractility hard ventricles squeeze heart rate together increase demand oxygen heart patients severe
