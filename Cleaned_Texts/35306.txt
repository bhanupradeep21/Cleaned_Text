hooverdrickamer effect occurs adult female mice exposed urine pregnant lactating adult female mice resulting longer typical oestrus period effect first noted j e hoover l c drickamer study wherein randomly assigned adult female mice one four treatment conditions control group subjects exposed water group exposed urine pregnant mice group exposed urine lactating mice group exposed urine singly caged female mouse results study demonstrated adult female mice exposed urine pregnant lactating females exhibited significantly longer mean periods oestrus adult females mice control group exposed urine singly caged female mouse female mice exposed urine pregnant lactating mice also found ovulate atypical longer oestrus period successfully conceived bore litters mated male mice hoover drickamer also found initial method psychically paint subjects urine used mice exposed urine capsule containing soaked cotton ball effect still occurred demonstrating airborne nature pheromones urine pregnant lactating hooverdrickamer effect initially demonstrated je hoover lc drickamers study researchers noted studies examined effect urine pregnant andor lactating females onset puberty young female mice work done examine urine pregnant andor lactating females would oestrous cycles already matured female mice research utilized two different experiments demonstrate female mouse oestrus cycles effected upon exposure urine pregnant andor lactating mice pheromones involved process first experiment study hoover drickamer randomly assigned adult female rats four treatment groups control group subjects exposed water group subjects exposed urine pregnant mice group subjects exposed urine lactating mice finally group subjects exposed urine singly caged female mouse findings subjects exposed urine pregnant lactating mice oestrus significantly days relative female mice control group exposed urine singly caged female mouse second experiment study utilized four subject groups changed method exposing subjects rather painting mice urine housed subjects capsules contained soaked cotton balls varied water urine pregnant mice urine lactating mice urine singly caged female like experiment one parallel results first experiment subjects housed capsules injected urine pregnant lactating mice demonstrated significantly total oestrus smears twenty one day period complete oestrus cycles longer total duration oestrus cycles relative subjects control group group exposed urine singly caged hoover drickamers original study delve specific mechanisms action effect female oestrus cycles beyond stating results work support conclusion factor urine pregnant lactating mice used act affect oestrus cycles subjects used conclusions suggested exploring excretory components urine pregnant lactating mice explore whether substances constituted pheromone could impact mice physiological level oestrus cycles could study stephen liberles linda b buck demonstrated mouse olfactory epithelium specialized receptor subclass called trace amineassociated receptor taar receptors found activated volatile amines mouse urine least one presumed mouse future research requires specific breakdown assess urine pregnant lactating mice composed particular set amines pheromones another chemical compound may explain mature female mouse oestrus cycles effected urine pregnant lactating female mice female mice demonstrated show sexual receptivity behaviour including lordosis behavior estrus estrus results release hormones estrogen estradiol facilitate sexually receptive behaviour lordosis particular increases likelihood successful copulation therefore overall reproductive lordosis like hooverdrickamer effect demonstrated initiated least part sexual signals detected olfactory hoover drickamers original discovery effect explicitly explore potential adaptive features may estrus increases likelihood sexually receptive behaviour females overall reproductive success likely may case prolonged estrus cycle adaptive sense allowing longer period sexual receptivity successful copulation similar phenomenon menstrual synchrony investigated multiple times determine whether even exists adaptive said variations duration estrus rationale behind investigations menstrual synchrony could also applied duration estrus including male monopolization fertile females one argument menstrual synchrony reduce interfemale competition particular differences species terms mating period length may influence useful ability mediate change estrus first given mice breed year round may adaptive females able influence others frequency sexual receptivity order increase likelihood overall species survival hoover drickamers work exploring effect urinary chemosignals change onset puberty female mice proposed similar underlying mechanism urine pregnant lactating females speeding onset puberty female mice signals environment andor social conditions optimal included factors like available food supply weather conditions nest sites materials may inducing longer estrus cycle adult females mature female mice may also take advantage environmental social factors increase likelihood successful could explored manipulating whether pregnant lactating female mice continue give urinary chemosignal mating conditions optimum httpsenwikipediaorgwikihooverdrickamereffect
