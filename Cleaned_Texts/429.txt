pruritic folliculitis pregnancy skin condition occurs one people cases second third trimester pregnancy hair follicle becomes inflamed infected resulting pus filled dermatologic conditions aside pruritic folliculitis pregnancy include pruritic urticarial papules plaques pregnancy atopic eruption pregnancy pemphigoid gestationis intrahepatic cholestasis pregnancy pustular psoriasis pruritic folliculitis pregnancy differs typical pruritic folliculitis pregnancy characterized sterile hair follicles becoming inflamed mainly involving trunk contrasting typical pruritic folliculitis mainly localized upper back shoulders condition first observed pregnant individuals showed signs folliculitis different seen inflammation thought caused hormonal imbalance infection bacteria fungi viruses even ingrown hair however known definitive cause bumps usually begin belly spread upper regions body well condition harm fetus mother usually resolves delivery rate incidence could possibly higher due unknown etiology condition misdiagnosis varying levels severity difficult pruritic folliculitis pregnancy currently classified atopic eruption pregnancy aep retrospective study done compared condition eczema prurigo pregnancy occurred cases respectively eczema clearly unlike typical pruritic folliculitis resolve pruritic folliculitis pregnancy clears spontaneously delivery postpartum pruritic folliculitis pregnancy mortality effects significant adverse effects mother currently treatment guidelines condition due nature unknown etiology symptom relief strongly emphasized using nonpharmacological interventions warm baths wearing loose itchiness discomfort persists benzoyl peroxide low mid potency topical steroids antihistamines novel treatments also shown potential treating case studies pruritic folliculitis pregnancy using ultraviolet phototherapy however investigation still required study efficacy safety second third trimester pregnant condition first observed six people many different speculations real evidence specific people papules starting various times throughout second third trimester varying biopsies taken people month period order examine composition papules using hematoxylin eosin stain samples researchers found inflammatory cells like neutrophils monocytes lymphocytes four samples immunofluorescence microscopy fluorescent antibodies bind protein interest expression levels observed microscopy used signs immunoglobulins igg igm iga since first description condition case reports indicating infrequency pruritic folliculitis also shown prospective study conducted roger et al concluded one individual pregnant mothers symptoms consistent diagnosis pruritic folliculitis common inflammation process hair follicles response infection damage hair inflammatory response caused bacteria fungi viruses simply ingrown hair however pruritic folliculitis pregnancy different occurs pregnant women second third trimester pregnancy clear mechanism pruritic folliculitis pregnancy rare condition still currently enough research study cause research suggest condition may due hormone level imbalance pregnancy research indicate condition could due immunological changes reduction helper immune cells increase helper immune cells occur specifically however enough evidence clearly support claims although pathophysiology pruritic folliculitis pregnancy currently unknown significantly linked harm either mother moreover condition resolves pregnancy affect development baby recovery mother delivery currently studies etiology behind pruritic folliculitis specifically pregnancy however suspected risk factors include signs symptoms pruritic folliculitis pregnancy include redness skin small red bumps surrounds hair follicle red bumps filled pus usually appear first abdomen may spread chest upper portion back shoulders arms thighs occurs second third trimester symptoms typically mildly pruritic asymptomatic lasting one week several months however symptoms usually selfrelieves spontaneously within one month diagnosis pruritic folliculitis pregnancy established based clinical features redness skin consisting small red bumps surrounds hair follicle histopathologic features immune cells within pus along microscopic testing shows bacteria microorganism conditions could cause itchy diagnosis pruritic folliculitis pregnancy requires patients go biopsy consists taking samples tissue evaluate whether lesions match physical factors pruritic pregnancy associated skin diseases must ruled alongside obstetric cholestasis disorder affects liver great deal overlap following conditions pregnancy eczema prurigo pruritic folliculitis grouped class called atopic eruption compared pregnancy associated skin conditions conditions class atopic eruption pregnancy occurs much currently official treatment guidelines pruritic folliculitis pregnancy etiology clinical presentations still require investigation however goal treatment relieve symptoms without causing harm mother nonpharmacological intervention recommended first using pharmacological agents treat symptoms since pruritic folliculitis pregnancy appears later stages pregnancy selfresolves postpartum nonpharmacological interventions recommended first relieve itching symptoms interventions focuses incorporating lifestyle changes include switching loosefitting clothes using emollients taking warm baths avoiding harsh soaps maintaining good personal itching symptoms still persist low mid potency topical corticosteroids firstgeneration antihistamines considered may improve appearance skin lesions however may also provide complete relief commonly used agents treat pruritic folliculitis pregnancy include topical benzoyl peroxide topical hydrocortisone first generation receptor blockers diphenhydramine chlorpheniramine short course systemic corticosteroids narrowband ultraviolet b phototherapy also explored novel treatment option pruritic folliculitis pregnancy one case study investigation leads clinical trials still required understand efficacy safety unconventional treatment comprehensive literature review using medline cochrane database relating skin disease pregnancy found pruritic folliculitis pregnancy associated morbidity mother fetus condition go away article american family physician states pruritic folliculitis pregnancy identified adverse effects pregnancy risks pruritic folliculitis pregnancy treated using topical corticosteroids topical benzoyl peroxide ultraviolet b light case report year old women tenth week second pregnancy widespread papulopustular follicular eruption rash involving hair follicles mainly affecting limbs first treated bacteriaassociated folliculitis symptom relief however continuation pruritic folliculitis still later diagnosised pruritic folliculitis pregnancy histopathologic test done confirm sterility immune started narrowband ultraviolet uv b phototherapy minimal erythemal dose increments using three times per week treatment schedule weeks treatment skin greatly improved treatments completely resolved pruritic folliculitis remainder treatment whether pharmacological nonpharmacological vary pregnant individuals pruritic folliculitis patients choice accept treatment vary well case reports resolution pruritic folliculitis patients declined accepted treatment case report woman experienced long manifestation pruritic folliculitis week pregnancy signs symptoms histology physical presentation consistent pruritic folliculitis although benzoyl peroxide prescribed patient declined treatment without treatment pruritic folliculitis condition resolved giving another case report year old woman weeks pregnancy reported inflamed pustules formed upper torso especially around linea nigra changed course last diagnosis confirmed laboratory tests showed mainly neutrophils damaged follicle symptoms treated topical benzoyl peroxide gel pruritic folliculitis completely went away first week delivering effort establish possible pathophysiologic mechanism behind pruritic folliculitis pregnancy case study found pityrosporum yeast hair follicles pregnant yearold pityrosporum yeast typically grouped hair follicles leading inflammation pore causing folliculitis symptoms itching however important note patients pruritic folliculitis lesions improve delivery baby finding may lead investigators believe patients lesions may contributed pregnancy instead speculated reason behind presence patients lesions postpartum due hot humid weather making lesions difficult heal giving
