animals general may evolved heterochronically ie beaks first occurring adults gradually appearing juveniles lineages evolved accordance presence genetic signal pathways molecular processes control formation teeth wang colleagues analyzed growth rings visible bone crosssections analogous growth rings trees tibiae various developmental stages limusaurus found animal skeletally mature six years age bone tissue primarily composed fibrolamellar bone internal fibres indicating limusaurus grew contrast noasaurines masiakasaurus vespersaurus parallelfibred bone indicative slower growth possibly due drier resourcepoor environments would lived older specimens outermost growth rings close together forming known external fundamental system indicating rapid growth ceased anatomical features limusaurus small head toothless jaws long neck interpreted indicating herbivorous diet xu colleagues paleontologist lindsay e zanno colleagues found adult specimens limusaurus show morphological traits associated herbivory shared groups herbivorous theropods including ornithomimosauria therizinosauria oviraptorosauria alvarezsauroidea along troodontid wang colleagues pointed adult specimens particular characterized presence gastroliths ingested stones retained stomach older adults gastroliths larger numerous younger adults size quantity gastroliths comparable birds young adults ornithomimosaurs oviraptorosaurs older adults groups theropods used gastroliths processing plant matter suggesting limusaurus increased number gastroliths older adults may indicative guts ability process plant matter finely aged isotope analysis available specimens limusaurus likewise showed adults consistently match isotope signatures herbivorous dinosaurs analysis juveniles subadults found vary greatly isotopic signatures indicates juveniles likely omnivorous feeding animals plants switched strict herbivory aged comparable diet shift experienced aforementioned mullets armored paleontologist david eberth colleagues suggested large number limusaurus specimens shishugou formation mud pits indicates either abundant among small vertebrate animals area trapped individuals drawn
