dentistry hydrodynamic fluid movement theory one three main theories developed explain dentine hypersensitivity sharp transient pain arising stimuli states different types stimuli act exposed dentine causing increased fluid flow dentinal tubules response movement mechanoreceptors pulp nerves trigger acute temporary pain dentine fluid flow mechanism behind hydrodynamic theory first introduced alfred gysi subsequently developed martin brännström series experimental supporting evidence since collected epidemiological surveys experimental data comparing dentinal tubule numbers hypersensitive nonhypersensitive alternate theories include dentine innervation odontoblast transduction lack substantial supporting evidence hydrodynamic theory currently accepted explanation dentine hypersensitivity upon several treatment diagnostic strategies built dental hydrodynamic theory proposes dentinal tubules exposed pulp dentine surface external stimuli cause changes fluid dentinal tubules may become exposed due various reasons eg dental erosion enamel loss periodontal exposed dentinal tubules subject stimuli direction rate fluid flow movement within tubules change causes shifts pressure within dentine stimulate myelinated nerves located pulp causing sensation main nerve fibres responsible responding stimuli mostly type abeta carry tactile adelta aδ relay pain temperature

occlusion dentinal tubules reduces severity dentine hypersensitivity led several treatment methods block reduce diameter tubules either mechanically one notable noninvasive method depolarisation pupal nerve using dentifrice chemical treatments eg strontium chloride potassium nitrate desensitising treatments separated two groups athome procedures form mouthwash toothpaste inoffice products resin sealers glass ionomers dentine solutions desensitising agents prescribed block nerve impulses physically reducing width dentinal tubules chemically preventing transmission stimuli across recently laser treatment proposed potential method treating dentine hypersensitivity lowoutput lasers may used block electric transmission stimuli pulpal nerves whereas highoutput lasers considered alternate method occluding dentinal occlusion using lasers may occur two forms partial melting clotting fluid proteins within
