selective breeding also called artificial selection process humans use animal breeding plant breeding selectively develop particular phenotypic traits characteristics choosing typically animal plant males females sexually reproduce offspring together domesticated animals known breeds normally bred professional breeder domesticated plants known varieties cultigens cultivars two purebred animals different breeds produce crossbreed crossbred plants called hybrids flowers vegetables fruittrees may bred amateurs commercial noncommercial professionals major crops usually provenance professionals animal breeding artificial selection often combined techniques inbreeding linebreeding outcrossing plant breeding similar methods used charles darwin discussed selective breeding successful producing change time book origin species first chapter discusses selective breeding domestication animals pigeons cats cattle dogs darwin used artificial selection analogy propose explain theory natural selection distinguished latter former separate process deliberate exploitation selective breeding produce desired results become common agriculture experimental biology selective breeding unintentional example resulting process human cultivation may also produce unintended desirable undesirable results example grains increase seed size may resulted certain ploughing practices rather intentional selection larger seeds likely interdependence natural artificial factors resulted plant selective breeding plants animals practiced since early prehistory key species wheat rice dogs significantly different wild ancestors millennia maize required especially large changes teosinte wild form selectively bred mesoamerica selective breeding practiced treatises much years old give advice selecting animals different purposes ancient works cite still older authorities mago notion selective breeding later expressed persian muslim polymath abu rayhan biruni century noted idea book

process illustration proposed wider process natural selection darwin noted many domesticated animals plants special properties developed intentional animal plant breeding individuals showed desirable characteristics discouraging breeding individuals less desirable characteristics darwin used term artificial selection twice first edition work origin species chapter iv natural selection chapter vi

animals different especially less civilized countries little artificial animals homogeneous appearance behavior characteristics known particular breeds pure breeds bred culling animals particular traits selecting breeding traits purebred animals single recognizable breed purebreds recorded lineage called pedigreed crossbreeds mix two purebreds whereas mixed breeds mix several breeds often unknown animal breeding begins breeding stock group animals used purpose planned breeding individuals looking breed animals look certain valuable traits purebred stock certain purpose may intend use type crossbreeding produce new type stock different presumed superior abilities given area endeavor example breed chickens breeder typically intends receive eggs meat new young birds reproduction thus breeder study different breeds types chickens analyze expected certain set characteristics starts breeding therefore purchasing initial breeding stock breeder seeks group birds closely fit purpose intended purebred breeding aims establish maintain stable traits animals pass next generation breeding best best employing certain degree inbreeding considerable culling selection superior qualities one could develop bloodline superior certain respects original base stock animals recorded breed registry organization maintains pedigrees andor stud books however singletrait breeding breeding one

terrestrial livestock higher response selection aquatic farmed species attributed following selective breeding aquaculture provide remarkable economic benefits industry primary one reduces production costs due faster turnover rates faster growth rates decreased maintenance rates increased energy protein retention better feed applying genetic improvement program aquaculture species increase productivity meet increasing demands growing populations selective breeding direct way determine specific trait evolve response selection singlegeneration method breeding accurate direct process also practical easier understand sibling analysis selective breeding better traits physiology behavior hard measure requires fewer individuals test singlegeneration testing however disadvantages process single experiment done selective breeding used assess entire group genetic variances individual experiments must done every individual trait also necessity selective breeding experiments require maintaining organisms tested lab greenhouse impractical use breeding method many organisms controlled mating instances difficult carry case necessary component selective
