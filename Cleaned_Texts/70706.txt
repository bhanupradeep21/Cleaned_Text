goronyosaurus extinct genus marine lizard belonging mosasaur family fossils goronyosaurus exclusively known late maastrichtian iullemmeden basin west africa specifically dukamaje formation niger nigeria farin doutchi formation niger type specimen first described mosasaurus subsequent remains revealed highly unique set adaptations prompted species reclassified species new genus goronyosaurus unique adaptations made goronyosaurus notoriously difficult classify within mosasauridae often left phylogenetic analyses although authors agree goronyosaurus belonged goronyosaurus possesses unique teeth unlike teeth mosasaur instead cutting teeth common among mosasaurs goronyosaurus straight teeth rounded apices adapted smashing food type specimena goronyosaurus bmnh r found within section
