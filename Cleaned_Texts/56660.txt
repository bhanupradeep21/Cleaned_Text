panthera atrox better known american lion also called north american lion american cave lion extinct pantherine cat panthera atrox lived north america late pleistocene epoch early holocene epoch around years species initially described american paleontologist joseph leidy based fragmentary mandible jawbone mississippi species name atrox means savage cruel status species debated mammalogists paleontologists considering distinct species subspecies panthera leo contains living lions however novel genetic evidence shown instead distinct species derived eurasian cave steppe lion panthera
