design concept either object process system specific cases detailed design refers something intentionally created thinking agent though sometimes used refer nature something verb design expresses process developing design cases direct construction object without explicit prior plan may also considered design artwork craftwork design usually satisfy certain goals constraints may take account aesthetic functional economic sociopolitical considerations expected interact certain environment typical examples designs include architectural engineering drawings circuit diagrams sewing patterns less tangible artefacts business process designing aka design process developing design people produce designs called designers term designer generally refers someone works professionally one various design areas within professions word designer generally qualified area practice one may example fashion designer product designer web designer interior designer also designate others architects engineers see types designing designers sequence activities produce design called design process using design thinking possibly design methods process creating design brief quick sketch lengthy complicated involving considerable research negotiation reflection modeling interactive adjustment redesign designing also widespread activity outside professions done people formally recognised
