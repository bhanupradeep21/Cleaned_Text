frontal lobe human brain relatively large mass less restricted movement posterior portion component cerebral system supports goal directed lobe often cited part brain responsible ability decide good bad choices well recognize consequences different actions location anterior part head frontal lobe arguably susceptible injuries following frontal lobe injury individuals abilities make good choices recognize consequences often impaired memory impairment another common effect associated frontal lobe injuries effect less documented may may result flawed damage frontal lobe cause increased irritability may include change mood inability regulate particularly injury frontal lobe could lead deficits executive function anticipation goal selection planning initiation sequencing monitoring detecting errors selfcorrection initiating novel widely reported case frontal lobe injury phineas gage railroad worker whose left frontal lobe damaged large iron rod though gages subsequent personality changes almost always grossly exaggerated patients damaged frontal lobes often complain minimal substantial memory loss frontal lobe injuries long associated memory problems despite little evidence actually showing relation true fact patients injuries tested using standard memory tests often score within normal close relatives patients however may describe substantial memory problems disparity occurs memory system affected functions frontal lobe facilitate working working memory closely involved ability hold working memory simply much information maintain brief period time describes primary memory small part working memory relates important part working memory secondary memory individual retrieves information high working memory able perform retrieval even distracted another task patients damaged frontal lobes show lower working memory therefore lessened ability retrieve information secondary increase impulsivity risk taking often seen individuals following frontal lobe damage two related terms differ impulsivity response disinhibition risk taking related rewardbased aspects put simply impulsive person make decision quickly without considering consequences leading ultimately lack selfcontrol contrarily risk takers look consequences weigh jump opportunity reward even likelihood receiving reward slim increase risk taking amongst damaged frontal lobe patients directly observed gambling gambling tasks developed measure behavior advanced technology came scientists tested individual behavior using lowtech means technology progressed

obtaining reward value reward say low probability high reward high probability low thus actual gambling skills tested simply preference high reward despite risks one ways carry set cards presented

specific frontal lobe injuries traumatic brain injuries general many factors consider examining effects traumatic brain injury nature injury well cause severity injury seems important affecting memory impairment specific frontal lobe damage patients mild traumatic brain injury frontal lobe damage seem slightly affected affected frontal lobe injuries shown cause decreased ability combining events temporally separated separated time well recalling information correct context however standardized testing may mask exaggerate possible impairment patients strictly regulated discretionary behaviors
