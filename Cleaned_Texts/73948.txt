bone damage repeated shoulder dislocations mri scan may used assess soft tissue damage regards recurrent dislocations apprehension test anterior instability sulcus sign inferior instability useful methods determining predisposition future dislocationcitation needed three main types dislocations anterior posterior inferiorcitation needed shoulder dislocations humerus displaced head humerus comes rest coracoid process referred subcoracoid dislocation subglenoid subclavicular rarely intrathoracic retroperitoneal dislocations may also anterior dislocations usually caused direct blow fall

electric shock may caused strength imbalance rotator cuff muscles people dislocated shoulders typically present holding arm internally rotated adducted exhibiting flattening anterior shoulder prominent coracoid processcitation needed posterior dislocations may go unrecognized especially elderly people state unconscious average interval year noted injury diagnosis series inferior dislocation least likely occurring less condition also called luxatio erecta arm appears permanently held upward behind caused hyper abduction arm forces humeral head injuries high complication rate

dislocation requires wearing arm slings weeks strong evidence difference outcomes arm immobilized internal versus external rotation following anterior shoulder study people almost six years found conventional shoulder immobilisation sling offered young adults engaged highly demanding activities shoulder surgery may arthroscopic surgery techniques may used repair glenoidal labrum capsular ligaments biceps long head anchor slap lesion tighten shoulder arthroscopic stabilization surgery evolved bankart repair timehonored surgical treatment recurrent anterior instability however failure rate following bankart repair shown increase markedly people significant bone loss glenoid cases improved results reported form bone augmentation glenoid latarjet although posterior dislocation much less common instability following less challenging form bone augmentation may required control damaged ligaments including labral tears occurring result posterior dislocations may treated arthroscopicallycitation needed remains situations characterized multidirectional instability failed respond satisfactorily rehabilitation falling ambri classification previously noted usually due overstretched redundant capsule longer offers stability support traditionally responded well reefing procedure known open inferior capsular recently procedure carried arthroscopic procedure rather open surgery comparable recently procedure carried using radio frequency technology shrink redundant shoulder capsule thermal capsular longterm results development currently unproven recent studies
