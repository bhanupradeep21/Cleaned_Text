two main questions arise law surrounding driving ingested cannabis whether cannabis actually impairs driving ability whether common practice testing thc main psychoactive substance cannabis reliable means measure impairment first question studies mixed several recent extensive one conducted national highway traffic safety administration one conducted american automobile association drivers detectable thc blood likely cause car crashes drivers amount thc others show cannabis impair certain abilities important safe driving reaction time divided attention cognitive studies able show increases actual risk drivers thc blood cause disproportionate number second question studies conducted far consistently found thc blood levels degree impairment closely known relationship blood levels thc main psychoactive substance cannabis increased relative crash risk thc blood levels level driving impairment shown singlecrash classiccontrol thus even though possible cannabis impairs driving ability extent currently reliable means test measure whether driver actually nonetheless policymakers united states generally dealt cannabisanddriving criminalization importing alcohol dui regime cannabis led complications road cannabisdriving cases land criminal court cannabis detection science differs vastly alcohol detection science example blood alcohol content bac similar rates absorption distribution elimination across humans also fairly good correlation bac level impairment words impairment increases bac increases impairment decreases bac allowed law enforcement use tools like breathalyzers blood tests criminal court alcohol concentration relatively reliable indicator recently much alcohol contrast thc levels vary widely depending means ingestion thc metabolized exponentially declining rate opposed steady metabolization rate alcohol poor correlation thc blood levels impairment stated report congress produced us department transportations national highway traffic safety administration contrast situation alcohol someone show little impairment thc level someone else may show greater degree impairment report also noted studies thc detectable late days though acute psychoactive effects cannabis last several studies shown increased risk associated cannabis use drivers studies found increased largest precisely controlled study kind carried us department transportations national highway traffic safety administration research risks cannabis found studies measure presence thc drivers blood oral fluid rather relying selfreport tend much lower elevated crash risk estimates likewise better controlled studies found lower elevated crash risk study found adjusting age gender race alcohol use drivers tested positive marijuana likely crash used drugs alcohol prior study however cautions results indicate drug use drivers british medical journal metaanalysis indicated drivers consume cannabis within three hours driving nearly twice likely cause vehicle collision influence drugs alcohol found acute cannabis use increased risk automobile cannabis driving review literature commentary united kingdoms department transport reviewed data
