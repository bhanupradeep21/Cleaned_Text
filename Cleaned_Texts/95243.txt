tropical research institute bennett known contributions fields evolutionary comparative honored several awards including named hansen distinguished lecturer university california berkeley august krogh distinguished lecturer american physiological bennetts research focuses temperature affects rate processes various organisms including growth reproduction examines factors limit processes energy intake allocation maintenance thermoregulation synthesis activity much early research included comparative experimental studies reptiles understand evolution endothermy mammals birds including physiological morphological alterations involved selective factors promoted development work also explored adaptive patterns behavior energy allocation ectothermic particularly limited oxygen uptake rely anaerobic metabolism intense activity highly cited joint research work j ruben compared aerobic metabolism endothermic ectothermic vertebrates highlighting importance aerobic metabolism former study suggested evolution endothermy driven need increase aerobic capacities sustained activity thermoregulation studies also evaluated thermal dependence locomotor capacity ectothermic vertebrates found low temperature greatly constrains argued need comprehensive concept thermal adaptation considers levels biological organization molecules whole organisms connections fitness ecological bennetts research focus metabolism explores various organizational levels including enzymatic organismal ecological aspects regard compared contrasted physiology lower vertebrates reptiles amphibians fish mammals birds activity particularly exploring oxygen consumption anaerobic metabolism body temperature research studies found organisms metabolic design capacities play significant role determining types levels feasible behavior allowing behavior within another study measured metabolic rates western fence lizards laboratory field settings research stressed upon importance considering activity levels measuring metabolic rates comparing birds conjunction r huey garland bennetts research highlighted importance using phylogenetic information comparative studies introduced three methods provided examples addressing potential difficulties emphasizing importance evolutionary research adopted ecological evolutionary framework developed examine organisms adapt natural environmental variations analyze organismal adjustments heat bennett outlined four general approaches study evolutionary physiology demonstrated value selection experiments testing hypotheses functional character maintaining experimental evolution valuable tool test evolutionary hypotheses determine adaptive responses new environments collaboration r lenski researchers examined patterns evolutionary change bacterial populations exposed different thermal acidic conditions investigate evolutionary dynamics diverse environments studied number diversity beneficial mutations subjecting escherichia coli populations generations evolution high temperature experiment resulted identification mutations affecting sites revealing presence epistasis among beneficial mutations shape adaptive two additional bacterial experiments assessed impact adaptation chance history evolution fitness cell size found populations achieved similar fitness regardless history chance evolution cell size influenced history additionally tested evolutionary hypothesis tradeoff necessary loss fitness environments adaptation new one twentyfour bacterial populations adapted low temperature correlated fitness change high temperature determined loss fitness observed populations consequently tradeoffs generally universally httpsenwikipediaorgwikialbertfbennett
