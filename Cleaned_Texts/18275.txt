breast ovarian cancer necessarily imply cancers occur time rather getting one cancer would lead development within years women history breast cancer higher chance developing ovarian vice versa breast cancer refers uncontrolled division breast cells possible males females get breast cancer breast cancer common cancer women face ovarian cancer type cancer begins ovaries anyone ovaries get including women trans men nonbinary people intersex although ovarian cancer much less frequent deadliest among gynecologic people experience different symptoms breast cancer others may asymptomatic common symptoms may clear signs symptoms early stages ovarian cancer especially benign conditions symptoms likely emerge metastasis process cancer cells spread site origin different organs blood lymphatic vessels form new tumor common symptoms hboc inherited cancer syndrome produces breast cancer ovarian cancer genetically related families mutations breast cancer breast cancer significantly related

relatives similar trend seen ovarian cancer women fdrs diagnosed ovarian cancer shows risk three times higher general families ashkenazi jewish ancestry backgrounds increased risk hboc mutations times common ashkenazi jewish individuals ashkenazi jewish ancestry genetic testing available testing mutations methods include sequence analysis genetargeted deletionduplication however boc occur chance without known cause genetic testing recommended people family history suggesting prior diagnosis breast cancer associated higher risk ovarian cancer particularly women diagnosed young age estrogen receptornegative breast similarly women ovarian cancer increased risk developing breast people encounter environmental exposures accumulate genetic mutations age therefore breast cancers found women aged older similarly risk ovarian cancer greatest female populations aged hormone replacement therapy hrt includes estrogen progesterone used treating menopausal symptoms woman exposed estrogen either endogenously exogenously long period time increased risk developing studies suggest using hrt postmenopausal women five years increases risk breast also increases risk ovarian cancer ovarian cancers
