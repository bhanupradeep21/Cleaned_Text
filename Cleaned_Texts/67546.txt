nerve allotransplantation allo means greek transplantation nerve receiver donor species example nerve tissue transplanted one person another allotransplantation commonly used type transplantation nerve repair one specific aspect transplant called allograft allogeneic transplant currently fda approved nerve allograft avance graft axogen nerve allograft used reconstruction peripheral nerve discontinuities order support axonal regeneration across nerve gap caused injury human nerve tissue processed remove cellular noncellular factors cells fat blood axonal debris chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans preserving threedimensional scaffold basal lamina tubular structure nerve means nerve allograft consists extracellular matrix ecm sterile three types nerves trauma surgical resection nerve damaged called nerve defect defect needs repaired order regain full partial sensory motor function peripheral nerve injury major clinical problem result neuropathic pain pain arising direct consequence lesion disease affecting somatosensory system damaged nerve fibers continuously excite electric pulses inducing pain abnormal sensation dysesthesia shown allograft surgeries postoperative neuropathic pain present patients condition patients without neuropathic pain surgery complain neuropathic pain hence allograft treatment seem risk factor specific problem golden standard therapy transected nerves endtoend repair nerve also known primary nerve repair certain amount tension nerve due injury blood flow nerve decreases eventually lead ischemia nerve damage gap nerve ends could example bridged nerve harvested less critical area patient piece nerve used case called autograft commonly used nerve autotransplantation sural nerve upper leg unfortunately treatment disadvantages first risk donor site morbidity functional loss secondly patients increased risk symptomatic neuroma formation thirdly longer anaesthesia time needed additional surgical site donor nerve lastly higher costs also due extra surgical site despite downsides reducing function affected area beyond risks committed harvest donor case insufficient amount autologous nerve tissue inability attach nerve ends securely tension free two options possible another option bridge gap nerve allotransplantation nerve allografts prepared donated human nerve tissue allograft contains many beneficial characteristics nerve autograft threedimensional microstructural scaffolding protein components inherent nerve one adverse effects nerve allotransplantation immunogenic response tissue another human used restore defect induce immunogenic response immune response allograft xenograft called transplant rejection prevent rejection new immunosuppressive techniques performed graft transplanted receiver donated nerve tissue disinfected selectively removing cellular components debris cleave growth inhibitors terminally procedures make immunogenic response insignificant processed nerve allografts used successfully restore nerve continuity two decades rhazes persian doctor first mentioned nerve repair ad nerve regeneration described first time first nerve allograft transplantation wwii sir sunderland described anatomy peripheral nerves developed techniques improve outcomes nerve repair successful regeneration short allografts cm achieved however period failure accomplish successful recovery allografts longer cm therefore peripheral nerve injury committee support nerve allograft early first successful clinical trials longer grafts reported using new combination radiation freezedrying nowadays rejection still adverse effect nerve allotransplantation modern immunosuppressive regimens used prevent rejection days rejection become rare complication nerve allograft become axon part neuron conducts electrical impulses axons surrounded myelin contain schwann cells schwann cells improve electrical conduction myelin surrounded endoneurium protective sheath connective tissue surrounded perineurium epineurium latter outmost layer dense connective tissue comes nerve repair crucial layers make good connection several kinds organ transplantation techniques nervus suralis nerve lower leg often used consequently patient miss specific nerve used autograft therefore persons nerves used unlimited number times surgery allograft nerve explained steps first surgeon prepare broken nerve standard operation procedures means surgeon examine local tissue resecting scar tissue needed proximal distal segments injured nerves debrided healthy tissue visual tactile signs surgeon measures distance nerve ends well diameter damaged nerve processed nerve allografts come different sizes gap closed without unwanted tension chosen right allograft nerve procedure different autograft used applies microsurgery surgeon may use repair nerve means sutures connect allograft damaged nerve placed epineurium important anatomical structures nerve kept several factors help surgeon decide whether choose nerveautograft allograft differences autografts allografts discussed use nerve autografts disadvantages one surgeon always creates defect donorplace nerve taken another disadvantage defect large amount available autografts may insufficient nerve allografts bring possible solution problems allografts human nerves processed way immune response transplant provoked procedure differs little autograftprocedure except fact need create donorplace defect therefore allografts used often patient autografts nerve repaired whether using autograft allograft wallerian degeneration seen distal coaptation means part nerve lies distal breaking point starts dissolving end nerve grow back direction surgeons transplant functions shell growth take place studies suggest nerve allografts work good nerve autografts therefore good alternative classic nerve currently nerve reconstruction limited length relationship length nerve gap level recovery following nerve repair two large clinical studies divided three different gap lengths nerve gaps adjustment technical failures nerve grafts meaningful level functional recovery studies nerve grafts seen studies meaningful recovery around seems likely shorter nerve gap better recovery despite significant difference since studies nerve allotransplantation determined outcomes sensory motor mixed nerves separately meaningful recovery nerve type assessed comparison outcomes found difference successful words sensation movement affected body parts studies forearm equally improved successful recovery three nerve types achieved approximately mixed nerves slightly lower recovery rate sensory motor nerves success rate still within range concluding allograft surgery appropriately used functional repair nerve injury sensory motor mixed use nerve allografts relatively new development therefore autografts currently still used frequently efforts made determine procedure ie autograft allograft surgery preferred nerve type research needs done comparison two procedures made one single clinical study let alone randomized controlled trial specific study type crucial value evidencebased medicine
