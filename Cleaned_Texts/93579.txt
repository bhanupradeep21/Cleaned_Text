sperm granuloma lump leaked sperm appears along vasa deferentia epididymides vasectomized individuals majority sperm granulomas present along vas deferens rest form epididymis sperm granulomas range size one millimeter one centimeter consist central mass degenerating sperm surrounded tissue containing blood vessels immune system sperm granulomas may also yellow white cream colored center cut open sperm granulomas painful painless sperm granulomas appear result surgery vasectomy trauma infection sexually transmitted appear early four days surgery fully formed ones appear late days sperm granulomas common complication different types vasectomy vasectomies vas deferens cut two ends tied prevent sperm passing sperm granuloma may form point vas deferens cut due possibility sperm leaking site history trauma inflammation epididymis also lead sperm sperm granulomas seen bodys immune response sperm outside normal location therefore seen protective mechanism sperm granulomas quite common surgery occurring patients contrary sperm granulomas comprise general amongst adolescents pediatric patients sperm granulomas considered rare phenomenon population undergo vasectomy often common cause sperm granuloma pediatric adolescent patients often attributed tumor obstruction injury infection sperm granuloma considered complication cases allows decompression vas deferens epididymis vasectomy site allows successful future reversal vasectomy given good quality sperm vas fluid surgery genital area lead castration anxiety fear loss damage genital sperm granulomas diagnosed using microscope examine tissues histology taken area typically done fine needle aspiration occur within weeks example histology based diagnosis supporting sperm granuloma would sperm core surrounded inflammatory cells apoptotic cells fibrous tissue often empty tubes cellular debris near additionally physicians might use high frequency ultrasounds aid properly diagnosing epididymal conditions sperm using ultrasounds provide better view anatomy epididymis could prevent misdiagnosis conditions testicular tumors supernumerary testis presence two sperm granulomas appear hard firm nodules exceed cm size sperm granulomas form vasectomy injury epididymal epithelium caused penetration germ cells epididymal supportive tissue infiltration germ cells allows pathogenesis sperm granulomas moreover penetration germ cells leads inflammatory autoimmune reactions increase risk sperm granuloma sperm granuloma also mimic presence abnormal number testis sperm granulomas mostly however cause pain swelling epididymis spermatic cord testis pain usually radiates groin junctional area abdominal wall thigh imitate feeling kidney sperm granuloma common complication vasectomies common effective procedure sterilization males history trauma epididymitis also lead sperm granuloma vasectomies vas deferens cut two ends tied prevent sperm passing sperm granuloma may grow point vas deferens could happen two three weeks post procedure sperm granuloma also form sperm leaking vas deferens surrounding interstitium leakage sperm elicits immune response lead chronic inflammation histological examination confirm sperm granuloma checking inflammatory markers macrophages lymphocytes surrounding sperm sperm granulomas asymptomatic absorbed time however severe cases nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids ibuprofen may used surgery rarely performed cases symptoms resolve reasonable amount time nsaid therapy ineffective provider may choose surgically resect area pain localized additionally stumps vas deferens burned closed order reduce pain patient experiencing prevent happening sperm granulomas occasionally mistaken conditions testicular tumors complicated treatment approach orchiectomy may accidentally cauterization vasectomy method used seal vas deferens utilizing heat electricity burn lumen using thermal heat cautery instead electrocautery help prevent granulomas nodular refraining ejaculation week potentially reduce risk developing sperm also evidence sperm granuloma formation may linked testosterone deficiency testosterone supplementation may reduce inflammation related sperm granulomas potentially even prevent however evidence supported animal models complications involving sperm granuloma pediatric case documented year old boy admitted hospital edema redness left upon physical examination found scrotum enlarged soft red painless initial sonographs detected possibility inflammation testis epididymis patient received antiinflammatory antibiotic treatment examined one week testis still painless hardened upon second reexamination five days later low perfusion testis detected testicular necrosis led patient emergency operation histology determined ruptured sperm granuloma led testicular thrombosis specifically walls vas deferens contained many growths small ducts glandlike structures came response displacement sperm fluid exact cause ruptured sperm granuloma determined found likely secondary response inflammation andor another complication sperm granulomas mistaken tumor due tumorlike year old man presented right testicular chronic pain vasectomy years ago upon physical examination ultrasound solid nodule right epididymis found medical staff suspected tumor findings sperm undergone phagocytosis final diagnosis sperm granuloma determined unknown whether sperm granulomas definitively detrimental sperm quality fertility humans however studies donkeys shown sperm quality marginally affected lower percentage sperm intact plasma membranes however effects motility morphology cases presence absence sperm granulomas may determine success rate vasectomy reversal believed sperm granulomas may protective prevent obstruction testicles sperm granulomas believed reduce pressure generated vasectomy prevent blockages sperm output vas fluid ejaculation therefore changes amount sperm produced vas additionally sperm granulomas exist nonhuman species rats dogs horses fish etc nonhuman species exhibit causes sperm granulomas including infection injury trauma epididymal region example vasectomized rats seen also high prevalence sperm granulomas postoperation general populations rats experienced much lower prevalence sperm case sperm granulomas within dogs presence common amongst poorly performed consistent idea lesions form site trauma chance sperm leak outside vasa deferentia epididymis multiple species sperm granulomas also linked success rate certain procedures vasectomy reversals also association sperm granuloma antibodies produced sperm antigens case study sperm granuloma antisperm antibody count donkeys found sperm granuloma resulted increase iga igg bound sperm donkeys also found donkeys sperm granuloma reduction sperm motility reduction percentage sperm intact plasma membrane significant damage found total sperm motility compared healthy control donkeys extent sperm granuloma antisperm antibodies affect donkey fertility still yet determined research studies httpsenwikipediaorgwikispermgranuloma
