horseshoe canyon formation alberta specimen also housed collection american museum natural history additional specimen crowsnest pass alberta rtmp initially referred montanoceratops lacks features unique type specimen instead considered intermediate leptoceratopsid possibly montanoceratops typical primitive ceratopsian many respects distinguished later species presence claws rather hooves teeth upper jaw rather toothless beak thought horn nose misplaced cheek according brown schlaikjer montanoceratops distinguished based following characteristics brown assigned type material amnh genus leptoceratops concluded member taxon protoceratopsidae charles mortram sternberg examined material belonging leptoceratops showed amnh distinct genus hence reassigned new genus chinnery weishampel conducted phylogenetic analysis basal neoceratopsians showed protoceratopsidae polyphyletic group ie valid taxon designated montanoceratops advanced basal mackovicky concluded montanoceratops belonged
