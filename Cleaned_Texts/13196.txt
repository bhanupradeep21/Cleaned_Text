human immunodeficiency virus hiv hepatitis c virus hcv coinfection multifaceted chronic condition significantly impacts public health according world health organization infected hiv also affected hcv increasing risk morbidity mortality due accelerated liver disease burden coinfection especially high certain highrisk groups intravenous drug users men sex individuals hivpositive commonly coinfected hcv due shared routes transmission including limited exposure hivpositive blood sexual intercourse passage hepatitis c virus mother infant infection hcv asymptomatic resolve without treatment lead cirrhosis cancer although symptoms hiv hcv monoinfection wellstudied years symptoms associated hiv hcv coinfection remain developing field research many coinfected individuals report difficulty attributing symptoms particular viral infection indicating overlap symptoms diseases suggests interventions aiming reduce disease burden associated hiv hcv coinfection must consist strategies manage symptoms individual infectioncitation needed contrast hiv hcv coinfection significant research delineating signs symptoms individual illnesses common symptoms experienced hivinfected individuals include fever night sweats diarrhea nausea headache hand symptoms associated hcv infection include fatigue depression urticaria peripheral neuropathy joint pain irritability coinfected individuals experience range symptoms studies showing fatigue prevalent due similar routes transmission hiv hcv hivpositive individuals great risk hiv hcv routes transmission include percutaneous blood exposure sexual intercourse mothertochild united states injection drug use known common mode transmission studies shown coinfection significantly associated older age well illicit intravenous nonintravenous drug use hivinfected individuals higher overall risk hcv infection irrespective intravenous drug use risk hiv contracted coming contact bodily fluids someone hiv positive fluids include blood semen preseminal fluid rectal fluids vaginal fluids breast milk individual become infected hiv fluids enter bloodstream way mucous membrane damaged tissue injection common hiv routes transmission include sharing needles unprotected sex someone hiv positive mother fetus pregnancy stuck hivcontaminated sharp object virus entered blood stream attaches enters thelper cells cells order replicate reverse transcription new viral dna integrates host cells dna instructs cell produce viral proteins viral proteins bud host cell move infect cells virus spreads body destroys immune hcv transmitted coming contact blood someone infected hcv virus commonly spread sharing needles mother infant birth improperly sterilized medical equipment intercourse infected individual unregulated inside body virus enters livers hepatocyte cells via receptormediated endocytosis inside cell viral rna undergoes translation end whole process viral proteins created proteins fuse lipid droplets cytosol hepatocyte form cell known highdensity hcv precursor golgi apparatus hcv precursor cell fuses two cells becoming hcv lipoviral particle hcv particle form protected antibody neutralization would normally stop virus spreading lipoviral particles released hepatocyte find hepatocytes since two viruses spread similar ways possible cotransmission occur individual gets infected viruses time people coinfected hiv hcv way blood contact likely infected hcv hiv studies shown comparison hiv fold greater risk transmitting hcv contact infected diagnose individual hiv test must taken determine virus present system several test options including elisa athome saliva viral load western establish presence hiv virus tests measure level hiv antibodies blood andor saliva level hiv antigens antibodies blood tests detect presence hiv virus calculating amount actual virus present blood none tests available determine person positive immediately believe exposed virus test window time initial exposure occurred test accurately tell individual infected one reason focus tests antibodies initial exposure virus usually takes weeks take six months antibodies produced body nucleic acid tests like viral load blood test take anywhere days test provide accurate result individuals first hiv test positive recommended take second test confirm results followup test also positive hiv positive diagnosis likely individual diagnosed hcv must first take hepatitis c antibody hcv ab screening test test used determine presence hcv antibodies blood take anywhere weeks time initial exposure antibodies appear blood therefore even person infected hcv hcv ab test may show positive result amount time passed hcv ab test result positive hcv antibodies individual either active hcv infection previously infection since cleared individual must followup quantitative andor qualitative hcv rna blood test provides count hcv viral load indicates infection chronic virus rna detected blood weeks exposure quantitative test low viral load value iul anything iul considered high viral load lower viral loads start treatment associated greater likelihood clear positive result qualitative hcv rna blood test confirms active virus present individuals bloodstream infection chronic negative result indicate persons immune system able spontaneously clear body infection without treatment lastly hcv genotype test done identify particular genotype strain hcv virus individual infected total six different hcv genotypes knowing specific genotype virus important deciding treatment options antiviral medications effective certain persons living hcvhiv coinfection higher risk certain adverse medical outcomes accelerated hepatic hepatic immune due higher mortality rates coinfected individuals result accelerated liver disease comparison individuals hiv treatment objective would primarily target hcv infection individuals living hiv antiretroviral therapy art shown preserve immune function reduce effects hivrelated inflammation delay hepatic disease therefore treatment plans individuals hivhcv coinfection include initial art regimen recommended hiv monoinfected individuals simultaneous hcv treatment involving oral directacting antivirals daa special consideration given potential severe drugdrug interactions selected medication initiating daa therapy individual typically assessed artnaivety recommended individual previously already art hiv maintenance initiate art weeks prior daa administration order adequately adjust regimen provide greater foundation efficacious response hcv hcv treatment options overall goal hcv daa therapy create sustained virological response consecutive weeks ensure hepatitis c virus detected clinical trials use following daa combinations shown similar efficacy rates

note considerable overlap hivpositive individuals coinfected hcv fact hivpositive individuals also hepatitis c overlap related common ways viruses spread including contaminated blood bodily fluids semen vaginal marked differences groups affected coinfection however consistent hivpositive individuals higher prevalence hepatitis c infection coinfected hiv hcv almost intravenous drug users high risk group monoinfection hiv hcv additionally prevalence varies geographical location highest prevalence coinfection located north africa middle east versus lowest prevalence located east time liver disease complications arisen morbidity mortality concern people hiv studies determined coinfection hiv hcv associated faster severe liver damage hcv infection fact mortality due liver disease one top three causes death hivinfected individuals liver diseaserelated deaths due concurrent hcv additionally due development novel therapies treat hiv antiretroviral therapies hivpositive individuals taking chronic medications prevent progression hiv aids however medications negative side effects liver therefore worsen liver effects hiv infection hcv widely studied however data effects hcv infection hiv
