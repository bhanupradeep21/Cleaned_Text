salt consumption extensively studied role human physiology impact human health chronic high intake dietary salt consumption associated hypertension cardiovascular disease addition adverse health major health scientific organizations world health organization us centers disease control prevention american heart association established high salt consumption major risk factor cardiovascular diseases common edible salt chemical compound known sodium human body evolved balance salt intake need means system humans salt important biological functions relevant risk cardiovascular disease salt highly involved maintenance body fluid volume including osmotic balance blood extracellular intracellular fluids resting membrane well known effect sodium blood pressure explained comparing blood solution salinity changed ingested salt artery walls analogous selectively permeable membrane allow solutes including sodium chloride pass depending osmosiscitation needed circulating water solutes body maintain blood pressure blood well functions regulation body temperature salt ingested dissolved blood two separate ions na water potential blood decrease due increased solutes blood osmotic pressure increase kidney reacts excrete excess sodium chloride body water retention causes blood pressure cochrane review controlled trials people chronic kidney diseased stage including dialysis found highcertainty evidence reduced salt intake may help lower systolic diastolic blood pressure well however also moderate certainty evidence people may experience hypotensive symptoms dizziness following sudden sodium restriction unclear whether affects dosage required antihypertensive medications effect salt restriction extracellular fluid oedema total body weight reduction also uncertain dashsodium

intervention phase participants ate assigned diets containing three distinct levels sodium random order blood pressure monitored control period three intervention study concluded effect reduced dietary sodium intake alone blood pressure substantial largest decrease blood pressure occurred eating dash eating plan lowest sodium level milligrams per however study especially significant participants control dash diet group showed lowered blood pressure decreased sodium agreement studies regarding salt sensitivity participants african descent showed high reductions blood american heart association published advisory stating us population dropped sodium intake mgday overall blood pressure could decrease estimated billion health care savings another estimate projected achieving

review metaanalysis clinical trials showed reduced sodium intake reduces blood pressure hypertensive normotensive since controlling hypertension related reduced risk cardiovascular disease plausible salt consumption risk factor cardiovascular however properly study effects sodium intake levels risk development cardiovascular disease longterm studies large groups using dietary biochemical measures major government research organizations us centers disease control prevention european food safety authority advise consumers reduce consumption salt lower risk cardiovascular one review found five studies supportive evidence reduced sodium intake lowers cardiovascular disease incidence mortality three contradicted evidence two found insufficient evidence reach survey found primary studies

incidencesspelling cardiovascular disease researchers cast doubts link lowering sodium intake health given government regulatory agencies clinical organizations european food safety authority us centers disease control american heart association recommend consumers use less salt diets mainly reduce risk high blood pressure associated cardiovascular diseases adults world health organization issued fact sheet encourage reducing global salt consumption united states centers disease control prevention began initiative encouraging americans reduce consumption salty american heart association defined daily sodium consumption limit milligrams contained less teaspoon table according health canada report canadians age groups consuming mg per day sodium twice much us centers disease control

legislated change form taxation mandatory nutrition labeling regulated nutrition health claims address overconsumption response eu salt reduction diet high sodium increases risk hypertension people sodium sensitivity corresponding increase health risks associated hypertensions including cardiovascular unfortunately universal definition sodium sensitivity method assess sodium sensitivity varies one study another studies sodium sensitivity defined change mean blood pressure corresponding decrease increase sodium intake method assess sodium sensitivity includes measurement circulating fluid volume peripheral vascular resistance several studies shown relationship sodium sensitivity increase circulating fluid volume peripheral vascular number factors found associated sodium sensitivity demographic factors affect sodium sensitivity include race gender one study shows american population african descent significantly salt sensitive women found sodium sensitive men one possible explanation based fact women tendency consume salt per unit weight women weigh less men several studies shown increase age also associated occurrence sodium difference genetic makeup family history significant impact salt sensitivity studied improvement efficiencies techniques genetic hypertensive nonhypertensive individuals haptoglobin phenotype likely sodium sensitivity people haptoglobin phenotypes specifically haptoglobin phenotypes contribute characteristic sodiumresistance moreover prevalence family history hypertension strongly linked occurrence sodium influence physiological factors including renal function insulin levels sodium sensitivity shown various one study concludes effect kidney failure sodium sensitivity substantial due contribution decreasing glomerular filtration rate gfr moreover insulin resistance found related sodium sensitivity however actual mechanism still possible mechanisms high intakes dietary potassium decrease risk hypertension instances cardiovascular disease proposed extensively however studies found strong inverse association longterm adequate high rates potassium intake development cardiovascular recommended dietary intake potassium higher unfortunately average absolute intake potassium studied populations lower sodium according statistics canada canadians potassium intake age groups lower recommended sodium intake greatly exceeded recommended intake every age ratio potassium sodium intake may account large difference occurrence hypertension primitive cultures eating diets made mostly unprocessed foods western diets tend include highly processed growing awareness excessive sodium consumption connection hypertension cardiovascular disease increased usage salt substitutes consumer industrial consumer level salt substitutes usually substitute portion sodium chloride content potassium chloride used increase potassium sodium consumption change shown blunt effects excess salt intake hypertension cardiovascular also suggested salt substitutes used provide essential portion daily potassium intake may even economical prescription potassium food industry processes developed create lowsodium versions existing meat industry especially developed finetuned methods decrease salt contents processed meats without sacrificing consumer research demonstrates salt substitutes potassium chloride synergistic compounds phosphates used decrease salt content meat concerns certain populations use potassium chloride substitute salt high potassium loads dangerous groups diabetes renal diseases heart
