hereditary spastic paraplegia hsp group inherited diseases whose main feature progressive gait disorder disease presents progressive stiffness spasticity contraction lower hsp also known hereditary spastic paraparesis familial spastic paraplegia french settlement disease strumpell disease strumpelllorrain disease symptoms result dysfunction long axons spinal cord affected cells primary motor neurons therefore disease upper motor neuron hsp form cerebral palsy even though physically may appear behave much spastic diplegia origin hsp different cerebral palsy despite antispasticity medications used spastic cerebral palsy sometimes used treat hsp symptoms hsp caused defects transport proteins structural proteins cellmaintaining proteins lipids substances cell long nerve fibers axons affected long distances make nerve cells particularly sensitive defects mentioned disease first described german neurologist adolph described extensively maurice lorrain french due contribution describing disease still called str√ºmpelllorrain disease frenchspeaking countries term hereditary spastic paraplegia coined anita harding symptoms depend type hsp inherited main feature disease progressive spasticity lower limbs due pyramidal tract dysfunction also results brisk reflexes extensor plantar reflexes muscle weakness variable bladder disturbances furthermore among core symptoms hsp also included abnormal gait difficulty walking decreased vibratory sense ankles individuals hsp experience extreme fatigue associated central nervous system neuromuscular disorders initial symptoms typically difficulty balance stubbing toe stumbling symptoms hsp may begin age infancy older years symptoms begin teenage years later spastic gait disturbance usually progresses many years canes walkers wheelchairs may eventually required although people never require assistance disability described progressing rapidly adult onset specifically patients autosomal dominant pure form hsp reveal normal facial extraocular movement although jaw jerk may brisk older subjects speech disturbance difficulty swallowing upper extremity muscle tone strength normal lower extremities muscle tone increased hamstrings quadriceps ankles weakness notable iliopsoas tibialis anterior lesser extent hamstring complex form disorder additional symptoms present include peripheral neuropathy amyotrophy ataxia intellectual disability ichthyosis epilepsy optic neuropathy dementia deafness problems speech swallowing anita classified hsp pure complicated form pure hsp presents spasticity lower limbs associated neurogenic bladder disturbance well lack vibration sensitivity pallhypesthesia hand hsp classified complex lower limb spasticity combined additional neurological symptomcitation needed classification subjective patients complex hsps sometimes diagnosed cerebellar ataxia spasticity intellectual disability spasticity genes listed described diseases hsp therefore key genes overlap disease groupscitation needed past hsp classified early onset beginning early childhood later onset adulthood age onsets two points maximum age around age new findings propose earlier onset leads longer disease duration without loss ambulation need use also described earlier later onset forms evolve hsp group genetic disorders follows general inheritance rules inherited autosomal dominant autosomal recessive xlinked recessive manner mode inheritance involved direct impact chances inheriting disorder genotypes described genetic loci linked ten genes identified autosomal dominant inheritance one accounts genetically solved cases approximately hsp twelve genes known inherited autosomal recessive fashion collectively latter group account casescitation needed altered genes known

long q band number designations human genes locations may probably vary organisms despite number genes known involved condition cases yet cause table spg used indicate gene associated hsp yet received official hsp gene designation major feature hsp lengthdependent axonal include crossed uncrossed corticospinal tracts legs fasciculus gracilis spinocerebellar tract involved lesser extent neuronal cell bodies degenerating axons preserved evidence primary loss anterior horn cells spinal cord observed cases dorsal root ganglia posterior roots peripheral nerves directly affectedcitation needed hsp affects several pathways motor neurons many genes identified linked hsp remains challenge accurately define key players affected pathways mainly many genes multiple functions involved one pathwaycitation needed pathfinding important axon growth right destination eg another nerve cell muscle significant mechanism gene cell surface glycoprotein immunoglobulin superfamily mutations leading lossoffunction also found xlinked syndromes disorders display corticospinal tract impairment hallmark feature hsp participates set interactions binding molecules well extracellular cell adhesion molecules integrins proteoglycans intracellular proteins like ankyrinscitation needed pathfinding defect occurs via association interacts plexina proteins form receptor complex released ventral spinal cord steer corticospinal neurons away midline spinal cord medullary junction work correctly due mutation cortiocospinal neurons directed correct position impairment axons central peripheral nervous system coated insulation myelin layer increase speed action potential propagation abnormal myelination cns detected forms hsp several genes linked myelin malformation namely mutations alter myelin composition thickness integritycitation needed endoplasmic reticulum er main organelle lipid synthesis mutations genes encoding proteins role shaping er morphology lipid

initial diagnosis hsps relies upon family history presence absence additional signs exclusion nongenetic causes spasticity latter particular important sporadic cerebral spinal mri important procedure performed order rule frequent neurological conditions multiple sclerosis also detect associated abnormalities cerebellar corpus callosum atrophy well white matter abnormalities differential diagnosis hsp also exclude spastic diplegia presents nearly identical daytoday effects even treatable similar medicines baclofen orthopedic surgery times two conditions may look feel similar perceived difference may hsps hereditary nature versus explicitly nonhereditary nature spastic diplegia however unlike spastic diplegia forms spastic cerebral palsy hsp reliably treated selective dorsal rhizotomycitation needed ultimate confirmation hsp diagnosis provided carrying genetic tests targeted towards known genetic mutationscitation needed hereditary spastic paraplegias classified based symptoms mode inheritance patients age onset affected genes biochemical pathways involvedcitation needed specific treatment known would prevent slow reverse hsp available therapies mainly consist symptomatic medical management promoting physical emotional wellbeingcitation needed therapeutics offered hsp patients include although hsp progressive condition prognosis individuals hsp varies greatly primarily affects legs although upperbody involvement individuals cases seriously disabling whilst others leave people able ordinary activities ordinary extent without needing adjustments
