nettie maria stevens july may american geneticist discovered sex chromosomes soon rediscovery mendels paper genetics observed male mealworms produced two kinds sperm one large chromosome one small chromosome sperm large chromosome fertilized eggs produced female offspring sperm small chromosome fertilized eggs produced male pair sex chromosomes studied later became known x nettie maria stevens born july cavendish vermont julia née adams ephraim stevens death mother father remarried family moved westford father worked carpenter earned enough money provide nettie sister emma strong education high school education stevens near top class sister emma women graduate westford academy graduating stevens moved lebanon new hampshire teach high school zoology physiology mathematics english latin three years returned vermont continue studies stevens continued education westfield normal school westfield state university completed fouryear course two years graduated highest scores seeking additional training sciences stevens enrolled newly established stanford university received ba biology became increasingly focused histology completing one year graduate work physiology oliver peebles jenkins former student assistant professor frank mace studying physiology histology stanford stevens enrolled bryn mawr college pursue phd cytology focused doctoral studies topics regeneration primitive multicellular organisms structure single celled organisms development sperm eggs germ cells insects cell division sea urchins worms graduate studies bryn mawr stevens named presidents european fellow spent year zoological station naples italy worked marine organisms zoological institute university würzburg germany returning united states phd advisor geneticist thomas hunt addition stevens experiments influenced work previous head biology department edmund beecher wilson moved columbia university stevens received phd bryn mawr remained college research fellow biology year continued reader experimental morphology another year worked bryn mawr associate experimental morphology offered position long sought research professor bryn mawr college cancer took life unable accept offer due ill receiving phd bryn mawr stevens awarded research assistantship carnegie institute washington stevens postdoctoral year work carnegie institution required fellowship support wilson morgan wrote recommendations behalf applied funding research heredity related mendels specifically sex determination receiving grant used germ cells aphids examine possible differences chromosome sets two sexes one paper written stevens award best scientific paper written woman major sex determination work published carnegie institution washington two part monograph studies spermatogenesis highlighted increasingly promising focus sexdetermination studies chromosomal stevens received alice freeman palmer fellowship association collegiate alumnae american association university fellowship year stevens conducted research naples zoological station university würzburg addition visiting laboratories throughout stevens one first american women recognized contribution science research completed bryn mawr college highest rank attained associate experimental morphology bryn mawr expanded fields genetics cytology although stevens university position made career conducting research leading marine stations laboratories record publications includes several major contributions emerging concepts chromosomal heredity experimenting germ cells stevens interpreted data conclude chromosomes role sex determination development result research stevens provided critical evidence mendelian chromosomal theories using observations insect chromosomes stevens discovered species chromosomes different sexes chromosome segregation occurs sperm formation difference leads outcomes female versus male progeny discovery first time observable differences chromosomes could linked observable difference phenotype physical attributes ie whether individual male female work published continuing experiments used range identified small chromosome currently known chromosome mealworm tenebrio deduced chromosomal basis sex depended smaller chromosome carried male egg fertilized sperm carries small chromosome becomes male egg fertilized sperm larger chromosome becomes studying egg tissue fertilization process aphids mealworms beetles flies stevens saw chromosomes existed smalllarge pairs known xy chromosome pairs also saw chromosomes unpaired hermann henking studied firebug chromosomes earlier noticed chromosome called x didnt find small chromosome called stevens realized previous idea clarence erwin mcclung x chromosome determines sex wrong sex determination fact due presence absence small stevens name chromosomes x current names came edmund wilson worked spermatogenesis preparations simultaneously stevens performed cytological examination testes examine female germ cells eggs male germ cells sperm studies paper stated eggs fatty staining procedures reading papers describing stevens discoveries wilson reissued original paper footnote acknowledged stevens finding sex bryn mawr following publications stevens bred studied drosophila melanogaster fruit flies laboratory worked subjects research years morgan adopted model although stevens wilson worked chromosomal sex determination many authors credited wilson alone additionally thomas hunt morgan credited discovery sex chromosomes although time cytological discoveries argued wilsons stevens interpretations morgans recognition came part work sex linkage white mutant gene fruit flies especially heightened nobel prize award stevens even recognized immediately discovery example morgan wilson invited speak conference present theories sex determination stevens invited following nettie stevens death thomas hunt morgan wrote extensive obituary journal article morgan said share discovery importance continued obituary describe detail implications work however morgan also claimed confirmed mcclungs hypothesis sex chromosomes actually refuted main claim larger x chromosome determined morgan recognized wilsons parallel less complete convincing studies producing joint discovery wilson said later footnote made also morgan claimed stevens seemed appear times wanting sort inspiration utilizes plain fact discovery wider vision apparently morgan forgetting fact often excluded scientific dialogue example invited speak meetings wilson expounded theory sex textbook mechanism genetics published credit either stevens wilson discovery sex described sex linkage white gene chapter immediately one described stevens results without mentioning name implying laboratorys sex linkage analysis basis one understand sex determination earlier letter recommendation wrote graduate students last twelve years noone capable independent research miss years old years completing phd stevens
