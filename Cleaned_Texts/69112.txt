cough sudden expulsion air large breathing passages help clear fluids irritants foreign particles microbes protective reflex coughing repetitive cough reflex following three phases inhalation forced exhalation closed glottis violent release air lungs following opening glottis usually accompanied distinctive frequent coughing usually indicates presence disease many viruses bacteria benefit evolutionary perspective causing host cough helps spread disease new hosts time irregular coughing caused respiratory tract infection also triggered choking smoking air asthma gastroesophageal reflux disease postnasal drip chronic bronchitis lung tumors heart failure medications angiotensinconvertingenzyme inhibitors ace inhibitors beta treatment target cause example smoking cessation discontinuing ace inhibitors cough suppressants codeine dextromethorphan frequently prescribed demonstrated little effect treatment options may target airway inflammation may promote mucus expectoration natural protective reflex suppressing cough reflex might damaging effects especially cough productive producing complications coughing classified either acute chronic acute complications include cough syncope fainting spells due decreased blood flow brain coughs prolonged forceful insomnia coughinduced vomiting subconjunctival hemorrhage red eye coughing defecation women prolapsed uterus cough urination chronic complications common include abdominal pelvic hernias fatigue fractures lower ribs costochondritis chronic violent coughing contribute damage pelvic floor possible cough children may either normal physiological reflex due underlying healthy children may normal absence disease cough ten times common cause acute subacute cough viral respiratory tract healthy adult also coughs times day average population respiratory disease geometric mean frequency times adults chronic cough ie cough longer weeks cases due postnasal drip asthma eosinophilic bronchitis gastroesophageal reflux causes chronic cough similar children addition bacterial cough result respiratory tract infection common cold acute bronchitis pneumonia pertussis tuberculosis vast majority cases acute coughs ie coughs shorter weeks due common people normal chest xray tuberculosis rare finding pertussis increasingly recognised cause troublesome coughing adults respiratory tract infection cleared person may left postinfectious cough typically dry nonproductive cough produces phlegm symptoms may include tightness chest tickle throat cough may often persist weeks illness cause cough may inflammation similar observed repetitive stress disorders carpal tunnel syndrome repetition coughing produces inflammation produces discomfort turn produces postinfectious cough typically respond conventional cough treatments medication used postinfectious coughs may include ipratropium treat inflammation well cough suppressants reduce frequency cough inflammation inflammation may increase sensitivity existing issues allergies treatment causes coughs use air purifier allergy medicines may help speed coughing complaint person meets criteria asthma bronchial hyperresponsiveness reversibility termed coughvariant asthma atopic cough eosinophilic bronchitis related conditions atopic cough occurs individuals family history atopy allergic condition abundant eosinophils sputum normal airway function responsiveness eosinophilic bronchitis characterized eosinophils sputum bronchoalveolar lavage fluid without airway hyperresponsiveness atopic condition responds treatment corticosteroids cough also worsen acute exacerbation chronic obstructive pulmonary disease asthma common cause chronic cough adults children coughing may symptom person asthma asthma symptoms may also include wheezing shortness breath tight feeling chest depending severe asthma treated bronchodilators medicine causes airways open inhaled steroids treatment asthma make cough go away chronic bronchitis defined clinically persistent cough produces sputum phlegm mucus least three months two consecutive years chronic bronchitis often cause smokers cough tobacco smoke causes inflammation secretion mucus airway difficulty clearing mucus airways coughing helps clear secretions may treated quitting smoking may also caused pneumoconiosis longterm fume inhalation people unexplained cough gastroesophageal reflux disease occurs acidic contents stomach come back esophagus symptoms usually associated gerd include heartburn sour taste mouth feeling acid reflux chest although half people cough gerd symptoms esophageal ph monitor confirm diagnosis gerd sometimes gerd complicate respiratory ailments related cough asthma bronchitis treatment involves antiacid medications lifestyle changes surgery indicated cases manageable conservative measures coughing may caused air pollution including tobacco smoke particulate matter irritant gases dampness human health effects poor air quality far reaching principally affect bodys respiratory system cardiovascular system individual reactions air pollutants depend type pollutant person exposed degree exposure individuals health

behind inside airway branches cause coughing cough triggered dryness mouth breathing recurrent aspiration food windpipe people swallowing drugs used treatments coughs ace inhibitors often used treat high blood pressure sometimes cause cough side effect stopping use stop beta blockers similarly cause cough adverse event tic cough previously called habit cough one responds behavioral psychiatric

may attributed sensory neuropathic treatment neurogenic cough may include use certain neuralgia medications coughing may occur tic disorders tourette syndrome although distinguished throatclearing disorder cough may also caused conditions affecting lung tissue bronchiectasis cystic fibrosis interstitial lung diseases sarcoidosis coughing also triggered benign malignant lung tumors mediastinal masses irritation nerve diseases external auditory canal wax example also cause cough cardiovascular diseases associated cough heart failure pulmonary infarction aortic aneurysm nocturnal cough associated heart failure heart compensate increased volume shift pulmonary circulation turn causing pulmonary edema resultant causes nocturnal cough include asthma postnasal drip gastroesophageal reflux disease another cause cough occurring preferentially supine position recurrent given irritant nature mammal tissues capsaicin widely used determine cough threshold tussive stimulant clinical research cough suppressants capsaicin makes chili peppers spicy might explain workers factories fruits develop cough coughing may also used social reasons always involuntary voluntary cough often written ahem used attract attention express displeasure form nonverbal paralingual coughing huffing important ways removing mucus sputum many conditions cystic fibrosis chronic bronchitis cough protective reflex healthy individuals influenced psychological cough reflex initiated stimulation two different classes afferent nerves namely myelinated rapidly adapting receptors nonmyelinated cfibers endings type cough may help diagnosis instance inspiratory whooping sound coughing almost doubles likelihood illness pertussis blood may occur small amounts severe cough many causes larger amounts suggests bronchitis bronchiectasis tuberculosis primary lung workup may include labs xrays cough classified duration character quality duration either acute sudden onset present less three weeks subacute present three eight weeks chronic lasting longer eight cough nonproductive dry productive phlegm produced may coughed sputum may occur night called nocturnal cough night day number characteristic coughs exist found diagnostically useful adults use barky cough part common presentation staccato cough classically described neonatal chlamydial treatment cough children based underlying cause children half cases go away without treatment days according american academy pediatrics use cough medicine relieve cough symptoms supported little evidence thus recommended treating
