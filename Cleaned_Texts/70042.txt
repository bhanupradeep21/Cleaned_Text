symbiosis greek συμβίωσις symbíōsis living together σύν sýn together βίωσις bíōsis type close longterm biological interaction two biological organisms different species termed symbionts mutualistic commensalistic heinrich anton de bary defined living together unlike organisms term sometimes used restricted sense mutually beneficial interaction symbionts contribute others symbiosis obligatory means one symbionts depend survival facultative optional generally live independently symbiosis also classified physical attachment symbionts form single body called conjunctive symbiosis arrangements called disjunctive one organism lives surface another head lice humans called ectosymbiosis one partner lives inside tissues another symbiodinium within coral termed definition symbiosis matter debate albert bernhard frank used term symbiosis describe mutualistic relationship german mycologist heinrich anton de bary defined living together unlike definition varied among scientists advocating refer persistent mutualisms others thought apply persistent biological interactions words mutualism commensalism parasitism excluding brief interactions predation century latter become definition widely accepted edward haskell proposed integrative approach classification later adopted biologists relationships obligate meaning one symbionts entirely depend survival example lichens consist fungal photosynthetic symbionts fungal partners live algal cyanobacterial symbionts lichens trentepohlia generally live independently part relationship therefore described facultative optional one participants symbiotic relationship capable photosynthesis lichens called ectosymbiosis symbiotic relationship symbiont lives body surface host including inner surface digestive tract ducts exocrine examples include ectoparasites lice commensal ectosymbionts barnacles attach jaw baleen whales mutualist ectosymbionts cleaner fish competition defined interaction organisms species fitness one lowered presence limited supply least one resource food water territory used usually facilitates type interaction although competition also needed mutualism interspecies reciprocal altruism longterm relationship individuals different species individuals mutualistic relationships may either obligate species obligate one facultative facultative many herbivores mutualistic gut flora help digest plant matter difficult digest animal gut flora comprises cellulosedigesting protozoans bacteria living herbivores coral reefs result mutualism coral organisms various algae living inside land plants land ecosystems rely mutualism plants fix carbon air mycorrhyzal fungi help extracting water minerals example mutualism relationship ocellaris clownfish dwell among tentacles ritteri sea anemones territorial fish protects anemone anemoneeating fish turn anemone stinging tentacles protect clownfish predators special mucus clownfish protects stinging example goby fish sometimes lives together shrimp shrimp digs cleans burrow sand shrimp goby fish live shrimp almost blind leaving vulnerable predators outside burrow case danger goby touches shrimp tail warn happens shrimp goby quickly retreat different species gobies elacatinus spp also clean ectoparasites fish possibly another kind spectacular example obligate mutualism relationship siboglinid tube worms symbiotic bacteria live hydrothermal vents cold seeps worm digestive tract wholly reliant internal symbionts nutrition bacteria oxidize either hydrogen sulfide methane host supplies worms discovered late hydrothermal vents

bryozoans hermit crabs bryozoan colony acanthodesia commensale develops cirumrotatory growth offers crab pseudopagurus granulimanus helicospiraltubular extension living chamber initially situated within gastropod endosymbiosis symbiotic relationship one symbiont lives within tissues either within cells examples include diverse microbiomes rhizobia nitrogenfixing bacteria live root nodules

needed endosymbiosis host cell lacks nutrients endosymbiont provides result host favors endosymbionts growth processes within producing specialized cells cells affect genetic composition host order regulate increasing population endosymbionts ensure genetic changes passed onto offspring via vertical transmission endosymbiont adapts hosts lifestyle endosymbiont changes dramatically drastic reduction genome size many genes lost process metabolism dna repair recombination important genes participating dnatorna transcription protein translation dnarna replication retained decrease genome size due loss protein coding genes due lessening intergenic regions open reading frame orf size species naturally evolving contain reduced sizes genes accounted increased number noticeable differences thereby leading changes evolutionary rates endosymbiotic bacteria related insects passed offspring strictly via vertical genetic transmission intracellular bacteria go across many hurdles process resulting decrease effective population sizes compared freeliving bacteria incapability endosymbiotic bacteria reinstate wild type phenotype via recombination process called mullers ratchet phenomenon mullers ratchet phenomenon together less effective population sizes leads accretion deleterious mutations nonessential genes intracellular due lack selection mechanisms prevailing relatively rich host commensalism describes relationship two living organisms one benefits significantly harmed helped derived english word commensal used human social interaction derives medieval latin word meaning sharing food formed com mensa commensal relationships may involve one organism using another transportation phoresy housing inquilinism may also involve one organism using something another created death metabiosis examples metabiosis hermit crabs using gastropod shells protect bodies spiders building webs plants parasitic relationship parasite benefits host parasitism takes many forms endoparasites live within hosts body ectoparasites parasitic castrators live surface micropredators like mosquitoes visit intermittently parasitism extremely successful mode life animal species

amensalism nonsymbiotic asymmetric interaction one species harmed killed one unaffected two types amensalism competition antagonism antibiosis competition larger stronger organism deprives smaller weaker one resource antagonism occurs one organism damaged killed another chemical secretion example competition sapling growing shadow mature tree mature tree rob sapling necessary sunlight mature

black walnut secreting juglone substance destroys many herbaceous plants within root term amensalism often used describe strongly asymmetrical competitive interactions spanish ibex weevils genus timarcha feed upon type shrub whilst presence weevil almost influence food availability presence ibex enormous detrimental effect weevil numbers consume significant quantities plant matter incidentally ingest weevils upon cleaning symbiosis association individuals two species one cleaner removes eats parasites materials surface putatively mutually beneficial biologists long debated whether mutual selfishness simply exploitative cleaning symbiosis well known among marine fish small species cleaner fish notably wrasses also species genera specialized feed almost exclusively
