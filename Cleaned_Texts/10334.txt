convinced fraction social contacts given threshold adopt novel therefore number exposures increase chances contagion unless number source exposures pass certain threshold threshold value divide contagion processes two types simple contagion complex individual needs one person displaying novel behaviour copy instance cars travel groups twolane highway since car cluster travels slower speed car behind relative speed spreads cars slow match speed car individual needs contact two sources exhibiting novel copying behaviours needs reinforcement encouragement multiple sources multiple sources especially close friends make imitation legitimate credible worthwhile due collective effort put examples complex contagions copying risky behaviour joining social movements social contagion simple contagion models occurs effectively weak long ties social contacts weak tie two people means interact frequently influence close friends however relationally weak tie structurally strong long connects socially distant people showing greater outreach relationally strong tie long ties allow flow new information increasing rate transmission relationally strong ties even though close friends strongly influence help learn new opportunities ideas behaviours socially distant settings know things weak long ties help spread information quickly two socially distant strong networks people strong ties within networks help spread information amongst peers hand complex social contagion processes require multiple sources influence possible weak ties need long multiple number increase probability imitation socially distant however social contagion also occur absence ties competition happens two people structurally equivalent ie occupy position social network pattern relationships people instance two students publishing kind research professor structurally equivalent similar relations people ie substitutable one another copy makes look better stay ahead behavioral contagion result reduction fear restraints aspects group situation prevent certain behaviors restraints typically groupderived meaning observer individual wishing perform certain behavior constrained fear rejection group would view behavior lack impulse individual observer wants perform behavior behavior would violate unspoken accepted rules group situation rules restraints preventing observer performing action

intimidation imitate behaviour known dominance people likely follow dominant leaders avoid cost punishment however behaviour influential amongst children rather adults coercive children thought likeable whereas coercive adults less likeable hence dominant behaviour displayed animal kingdom well prestigious behaviour unique humans unlike animals understand intentions behind someones actions rather able copy movements precisely important since easier learn best models rather learning might know behaviour contributes someones success mastering skill hence look see everyone else copying ie tend copy prestigious individuals prestigious people enjoy high degree influence respect generally people study done rate information transmission via retweets twitter found popular people ie people large following inefficient hubs spreading concepts followers someone overloaded information lower chances retweet particular message due limited attention hence rate social contagion slows rather social contagion amplify amongst ordinary users low following closely connected peer network people likely retweet messages close friends facilitate social bonding peers also higher similar interests influenced ordinary popular user mutual ties hence social contagion occur efficiently amongst tight community structures absence prestigious dominant mass media greatly influence peoples opinions amplify social contagion reporting stories socially distant unconnected networks help turn minority opinions popular opinion independent degree connectivity moreover bandura showed children learn

similar interests lead minority majority groups overestimating sizes vice versa cause people falsely predict frequency behaviour real world since estimate based personal networks people overestimate
