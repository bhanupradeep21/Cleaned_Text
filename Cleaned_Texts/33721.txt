olfactory system sense smell sensory system used smelling olfaction olfaction one special senses directly associated specific organs mammals reptiles main olfactory system accessory olfactory system main olfactory system detects airborne substances accessory system senses fluidphase stimuli senses smell taste gustatory system often referred together chemosensory system give brain information chemical composition objects process called transduction peripheral olfactory system consists mainly nostrils ethmoid bone nasal cavity olfactory epithelium layers thin tissue covered mucus line nasal cavity primary components layers epithelial tissue mucous membranes olfactory glands olfactory neurons nerve fibers olfactory odor molecules enter peripheral pathway reach nasal cavity either nostrils inhaling olfaction throat tongue pushes air back nasal cavity chewing swallowing retronasal inside nasal cavity mucus lining walls cavity dissolves odor molecules mucus also covers olfactory epithelium contains mucous membranes produce store mucus olfactory glands secrete metabolic enzymes found olfactory sensory neurons epithelium detect odor molecules dissolved mucus transmit information odor brain process called sensory olfactory neurons cilia tiny hairs containing olfactory receptors bind odor molecules causing electrical response spreads sensory neuron olfactory nerve fibers back nasal olfactory nerves fibers transmit information odors peripheral olfactory system central olfactory system brain separated epithelium cribriform plate ethmoid bone olfactory nerve fibers originate epithelium pass cribriform plate connecting epithelium brains limbic system olfactory main olfactory bulb transmits pulses mitral tufted cells help determine odor concentration based time certain neuron clusters fire called timing code cells also note differences highly similar odors use data aid later recognition cells different mitral low firingrates easily inhibited neighboring cells tufted high rates firing difficult bulbar neural circuit transforms odor inputs bulb bulbar responses sent olfactory cortex partly understood mathematical uncus houses olfactory cortex includes piriform cortex posterior orbitofrontal cortex amygdala olfactory tubercle parahippocampal gyrus olfactory tubercle connects numerous areas amygdala thalamus hypothalamus hippocampus brain stem retina auditory cortex olfactory system total inputs outputs oversimplification role state checks ensure odor signals arose actual odors rather villi irritation regulates motor behavior primarily social stereotypical brought odors integrates auditory olfactory sensory info complete aforementioned tasks plays role transmitting positive signals reward sensors thus involved amygdala olfaction processes pheromone allomone kairomone samespecies crossspecies crossspecies emitter harmed sensor benefited respectively signals due cerebrum evolution processing secondary therefore largely unnoticed human allomones include flower scents natural herbicides natural toxic plant chemicals info processes comes vomeronasal organ indirectly via olfactory main olfactory bulbs pulses amygdala used pair odors names recognize odor odor stria terminalis specifically bed nuclei bnst act information pathway amygdala hypothalamus well hypothalamus pituitary gland bnst abnormalities often lead sexual confusion immaturity bnst also connects septal area rewarding sexual mitral pulses hypothalamus promotediscourage feeding whereas accessory olfactory bulb pulses regulate reproductive odorrelatedreflex processes hippocampus although minimally connected main olfactory bulb receives almost olfactory information via amygdala either directly via bnst hippocampus forms new reinforces existing memories similarly parahippocampus encodes recognizes contextualizes parahippocampal gyrus houses topographical map olfaction orbitofrontal cortex ofc heavily correlated cingulate gyrus septal area act positivenegative reinforcement ofc expectation rewardpunishment response stimuli ofc represents emotion reward decision anterior olfactory nucleus distributes reciprocal signals olfactory bulb piriform anterior olfactory nucleus memory hub different odor objects components mixed humans mammals sniffing mixture presented eg sniff bottle often unable identify components mixture even though recognize individual component presented largely odor sensory neuron excited multiple odor components proposed olfactory environment typically composed multiple odor components eg odor dog entering kitchen contains background coffee odor feedback olfactory cortex olfactory suppresses preexisting odor background eg coffee via olfactory newly arrived foreground odor eg dog singled mixture loss smell known anosmia anosmia occur sides single side olfactory problems divided different types based malfunction olfactory dysfunction total anosmia incomplete partial anosmia hyposmia microsmia distorted dysosmia characterized spontaneous sensations like phantosmia inability recognize odors despite normally functioning olfactory system termed olfactory agnosia hyperosmia rare condition typified abnormally heightened sense smell like vision hearing olfactory problems bilateral unilateral meaning person anosmia right side nose left unilateral right anosmia hand sides nose called bilateral anosmia total destruction olfactory bulb tract primary cortex brodmann area results anosmia side destruction also irritative lesion uncus results olfactory hallucinations damage olfactory system occur traumatic brain injury cancer infection inhalation toxic fumes neurodegenerative diseases parkinsons disease alzheimers disease conditions cause anosmia contrast recent finding suggested molecular aspects olfactory dysfunction recognized hallmark amyloidogenesisrelated diseases may even causal link disruption multivalent metal ion transport doctors detect damage olfactory system presenting patient odors via scratch sniff card patient close eyes try identify commonly available odors like coffee peppermint candy doctors must exclude diseases inhibit eliminate sense smell chronic colds sinusitus making diagnosis permanent damage olfactory system prevalence olfactory dysfunction general us population assessed questionnaire examination national health survey among thousand persons aged years older reported problem smell past months olfactory dysfunction examination prevalence rose age years older higher men women blacks mexican americans whites less educated concern safety persons aged older unable identify smoke natural gas common causes olfactory dysfunction advanced age viral infections exposure toxic chemicals head trauma neurodegenerative age strongest reason olfactory decline healthy adults even greater impact cigarette smoking agerelated changes smell function often go unnoticed smell ability rarely tested clinically unlike hearing vision people years age chronic smelling problems increases greatly people ages half experiencing significant problems smelling adults numbers rise almost basis agerelated changes smell function include closure cribriform cumulative damage olfactory receptors repeated viral insults throughout life common cause permanent hyposmia anosmia upper respiratory infections dysfunctions show change time sometimes reflect damage olfactory epithelium also central olfactory structures result viral invasions brain among virusrelated disorders common cold hepatitis influenza influenzalike illness

alter ability agents damage olfactory epithelium likely enter brain via olfactory traumarelated olfactory dysfunction depends severity trauma whether strong accelerationdeceleration head occurred occipital side impact causes damage olfactory system frontal however recent evidence individuals traumatic brain injury suggests smell loss occur changes brain function outside olfactory cortex neurologists observed olfactory dysfunction cardinal feature several neurodegenerative diseases alzheimers disease parkinsons disease patients unaware olfactory deficit testing earlystage patients showed decreased activity central odor processing neurodegenerative diseases affect olfactory dysfunction include huntingtons disease multiinfarct dementia amyotrophic lateral sclerosis schizophrenia diseases moderate effects olfactory system alzheimers parkinsons furthermore progressive supranuclear palsy parkinsonism associated minor olfactory problems findings led suggestion olfactory testing may help diagnosis several different neurodegenerative neurodegenerative diseases wellestablished genetic determinants also associated olfactory dysfunction dysfunction example found patients familial parkinsons disease studies concluded olfactory loss may associated intellectual disability rather alzheimers diseaselike huntingtons disease also associated problems odor identification detection
