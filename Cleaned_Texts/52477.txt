mgml creatinine kriˈætɪnɪn niːn ancient greek κρέας kréas flesh breakdown product creatine phosphate muscle protein metabolism released constant rate body depending muscle serum creatinine blood measurement important indicator kidney health easily measured byproduct muscle metabolism excreted unchanged kidneys creatinine via biological system involving creatine phosphocreatine also known creatine phosphate adenosine triphosphate atp bodys immediate energy supply creatine synthesized primarily liver methylation glycocyamine guanidino acetate synthesized kidney amino acids arginine glycine sadenosyl methionine transported blood organs muscle brain phosphorylation becomes highenergy compound creatine conversion phosphocreatine catalyzed creatine kinase spontaneous formation creatinine occurs creatinine removed blood chiefly kidneys primarily glomerular filtration also proximal tubular secretion little tubular reabsorption creatinine occurs filtration kidney deficient blood creatinine concentrations rise therefore creatinine concentrations blood urine may used calculate creatinine clearance crcl correlates approximately glomerular filtration rate gfr blood creatinine concentrations may also used alone calculate estimated gfr egfr gfr clinically important measurement kidney function cases severe kidney dysfunction though crcl rate overestimate gfr hypersecretion creatinine proximal tubules account larger fraction total creatinine ketoacids cimetidine trimethoprim reduce creatinine tubular secretion therefore increase accuracy gfr estimate particular severe kidney dysfunction absence secretion creatinine behaves like inulincitation needed alternative estimation kidney function made interpreting blood plasma concentration creatinine along urea buntocreatinine ratio ratio blood urea nitrogen creatinine indicate problems besides intrinsic kidney example urea concentration raised proportion creatinine may indicate prerenal problem volume depletion counterintuitively supporting observation higher creatinine production women compared men putting question algorithms gfr distinguish sex accordingly women higher muscle protein synthesis higher muscle protein turnover across life hdl supports muscle anabolism higher muscle protein turnover links increased creatine generally higher serum hdl women compared serum hdl men hdl associated benefits like reduced incidence cardiovascular complications reduced studies indicate creatinine effective killing bacteria many species gram positive gram negative well diverse antibiotic resistant bacterial creatinine appears affect growth fungi yeast used isolate slower growing fungi free normal bacterial populations found environmental samples mechanism creatinine kills bacteria presently known recent report also suggests creatinine may immunosuppressive serum creatinine commonly used indicator direct measure renal function elevated creatinine always representative true reduction gfr high reading may due increased production creatinine due decreased kidney function interference assay decreased tubular secretion creatinine increase serum creatinine due increased
