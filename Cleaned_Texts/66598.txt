westlothiana animal west lothian genus reptilelike tetrapod lived million years ago latest part viséan age carboniferous members genus bore superficial resemblance modernday lizards genus known single species westlothiana lizziae type specimen discovered east kirkton limestone east kirkton quarry west lothian scotland specimen nicknamed lizzie lizard fossil hunter stan wood name quickly adopted paleontologists press specimen formally named given specific name lizziae homage however despite similar body shape westlothiana considered true lizard westlothianas anatomy contained mixture labyrinthodont reptilian features originally regarded oldest known reptile however updated studies shown identification entirely accurate instead one first amniotes tetrapods laying hardshelled eggs including synapsids reptiles descendants westlothiana rather close relative result paleontologists since original description place genus within group reptiliomorpha among amniote relatives diadectomorphs later analyses usually place genus earliest diverging member collection unusual tetrapods may close amniotes lissamphibians modern amphibians like frogs salamanders potentially species probably lived near freshwater lake probably hunted small creatures lived habitat slender animal rather small legs long tail together casineria another transitional fossil found scotland one smallest reptilelike amphibians known mere cm adult length small size made key fossil search earliest amniote amniote eggs thought evolved small shares many features reptiles early amniotes rather amphibious tetrapods age include lower number ankle bones labyrinthodont infolding dentin lack otic notch generally small many features also present lepospondyls ruta et al interpreted long body small legs possible adaption burrowing similar seen modern members westlothiana heavily scaled thin scales belly many rows thick overlapping scales skull small compared overall body length although flattened known specimens many components visible components initially hidden crushing palate roof mouth later revealed preparation xray orbits eye sockets quite large filled sclerotic ring skull fairly broad shallow basal tetrapods teeth size unlike case many early amniotes larger fanglike teeth middle mouth addition lack labyrinthodont internal folding lepospondyls amniotes unlike case larger reptiliomorphs however trait may correlated size necessarily relations lower jaw similar amniotes terms pattern component bones quadrate bone jaw joint vertical rather slanted basal reptiliomorphs

features palate noticeably lacks amniote adaptations missing adaptations relate pterygoid bones elongated bladelike structures lie along middle palate palate lacks labyrinthodont features large fangs instead pterygoids completely covered small toothlike prickles known denticles unusually primitive compared early amniotes typically denticles concentrated parts pterygoids several rows denticles also present along palatine bones along rim mouth apparently ectopterygoid bones immediately behind palatines rear palate possesses bone known parasphenoid acquired unusually complex dartlike shape pterygoids thin rear branch reaches far back jaw joints towards front skull converge together perhaps notable feature palate fact rear branches pterygoids simple concave outer edges notable contrast early amniotes area possesses outward prong known transverse flange covered teeth preparation skull reveal feature palate one primary reasons westlothianas classification reworked belong outside body elongated vertebrae skull hip known specimen westlothiana preserves complete tail length region unknown vertebrae body multipart bones primarily formed large pleurocentrum bone rear segment smaller intercentrum front segment vertebrae possess format defined gastrocentrous pleurocentra spoolshaped cylinders pierced large canal spinal cord fused low triangular neural spines intercentra crescentshaped despite smaller pleurocentra relatively large compared amniotes advanced reptiliomorphs overall vertebrae westlothiana closely resemble early sauropsid captorhinus although short neural spines similar lepospondyl however vertebrae also possess unique feature shared reptiliomorphs feature presence several large keels run along underside pleurocentrum although keels also run along underside pleurocentra synapsids keels much closer midline members group compared westlothiana ribs westlothiana connect intercentra present every vertebra skull forelimb significantly shorter hindlimb characteristic shared lepospondyls wellpreserved portions shoulder girdle scapulocoracoids shoulder blades large robust humerus simple thinnest middle similar microsaurs early amniotes rather larger tetrapods ulna similar gracile pelycosaurs including small species dimetrodon milleri although hand lizzie disarticulated four metacarpal bones could identified indicates members westlothiana possessed least four possibly even five practically reptiliomorphs possessed fivefingered hands except majority lepospondyls lepospondyls exception diceratosaurus urocordylus possessed four fewer fingers analyses consider westlothiana possess four fingers generally agree pelvis hip large upper portion formed rodshaped ilium lower portion formed narrow long puboischiadic plate rear portion puboischiadic plate particularly elongated westlothiana compared reptiliomorphs parts pelvis fairly normal groups standards femur long robust also thinnest middle humerus also similar humerus femurs

later claimed ten bones arguing components astragalus completely fused intermedium tibiale still piñeiro demarco meneghel could determine two interpretations superior note largest bone closely resembled fused astragalus rather unfused foot likely fivetoed phalangeal formula number phalanges per toe innermost outermost toe formula identical early amniotes conversely foot westlothiana shorter robust longtoed feet amniotes additionally phalanges decrease relative size towards tip foot genus opposite true phylogenetic placement westlothiana varied basal amniote ie primitive basal lepospondyl analyses lepospondyls branching within actual phylogenetic position westlothiana uncertain reflecting fragmentary nature find uncertainty labyrinthodont phylogeny modern consensus classification westlothiana supported analyses clack ruta et al ruta coates considers genus earliest diverging basal primitive member lepospondyli westlothianas placement lepospondyli supports hypothesis lepospondyls distant amniotes however modern lissamphibians sometimes considered descended lepospondyls therefore westlothiana may actually closer modern amphibians amniotes although still close
