cramp sudden involuntary painful skeletal muscle overshortening associated electrical generally temporary nondamaging cause significant pain paralysislike immobility affected muscle cramp usually goes away period several seconds sometimes cramps common tend occur rest usually night nocturnal leg also often associated pregnancy physical exercise overexertion age common older adults cases cramps called idiopathic underlying pathology addition benign conditions cramps also associated many pathological cramp definition narrower definition muscle spasm spasms include involuntary abnormal muscle contractions cramps sustained true cramps distinguished cramplike conditions cramps different muscle contracture also painful involuntary electrically silent main distinguishing features cramps dystonia suddenness acute onset pain involvement one muscle spontaneous resolution cramps resolution stretching affected restless leg syndrome considered muscle cramps confused rest skeletal muscle cramps may caused muscle fatigue lack electrolytescitation needed sodium condition called hyponatremia potassium called hypokalemia magnesium called skeletal muscle cramps known motor neuron disorders eg amyotrophic lateral sclerosis metabolic disorders eg liver failure medications eg diuretics inhaled haemodialysis may also cause muscle causes cramping hyperflexion hypoxia exposure large changes temperature dehydration low blood salt muscle cramps also symptom complication pregnancy kidney disease thyroid disease hypokalemia hypomagnesemia hypocalcaemia conditions restless legs syndrome varicose multiple early researchers observed leg cramps restless legs syndrome result excess insulin sometimes called normal circumstances skeletal muscles voluntarily controlled skeletal muscles cramp often calves thighs arches foot north america sometimes called charley horse corky cramping associated strenuous physical activity intensely painful however even occur inactive relaxed around people experience skeletal cramps likely endure extreme muscle pain may unable use entire limb contains lockedup muscle group may take week muscle return painfree state depending persons fitness level age several factorscitation needed nocturnal leg cramps involuntary muscle contractions occur calves soles feet muscles body night less commonly resting duration nocturnal leg cramps variable cramps lasting anywhere seconds several minutes muscle soreness may remain cramp ends cramps common older happen quite frequently teenagers people exercising night besides painful nocturnal leg cramp cause much distress precise cause cramps unclear potential contributing factors include dehydration low levels certain minerals magnesium potassium calcium sodium although evidence reduced blood flow muscles attendant prolonged sitting lying nocturnal leg cramps almost exclusively calf cramps considered normal late stages however vary intensity mild extremely painfulcitation needed lactic acid buildup around muscles trigger cramps however happen anaerobic respiration person exercising engaging activity heartbeat rises medical conditions associated leg cramps cardiovascular disease hemodialysis cirrhosis pregnancy lumbar canal stenosis differential diagnoses include restless legs syndrome claudication myositis peripheral neuropathy differentiated careful history physical gentle stretching massage putting pressure affected leg walking standing taking warm bath shower may help end cramp calf muscle dorsiflexing foot lifting toes back toward shins stretch muscle provide almost immediate relief limited evidence supporting use magnesium calcium channel blockers carisoprodol vitamin quinine longer recommended treatment nocturnal leg cramps due potential fatal hypersensitivity reactions thrombocytopenia arrhythmias cinchonism hemolytic uremic syndrome also occur higher various medications may cause nocturnal leg statins may sometimes cause myalgia cramps among possible side effects raloxifene evista medication associated high incidence leg cramps additional factors increase probability side effects physical exercise age history cramps hypothyroidism athletes using statins experience significant adverse muscular effects including rate appears approximately typical statinusing cases adverse effects disappear switching different statin however ignored persist rare cases develop serious problems coenzyme supplementation helpful avoid statinrelated adverse effects currently enough evidence prove effectiveness avoiding myopathy stretching massage drinking plenty liquids may helpful treating simple muscle antimalarial drug quinine traditional treatment may slightly effective reducing number cramps intensity cramps number days person experiences cramps quinine shown reduce duration length muscle quinine treatment may lead haematologic cardiac toxicity due low effectiveness negative side effects use medication treating muscle cramps recommended magnesium commonly used treat muscle cramps moderate quality evidence indicates magnesium effective treating preventing cramps older known magnesium helps cramps due pregnancy liver cirrhosis medical conditions oral magnesium treatment appear significant major side effects however may associated diarrhea nausea people use exertional heat cramps due electrolyte abnormalities primarily potassium loss calcium magnesium sodium appropriate fluids sufficient potassium improves vitamin b complex naftidrofuryl lidocaine calcium channel blockers may effective muscle adequate conditioning stretching mental preparation hydration electrolyte balance likely helpful preventing muscle httpsenwikipediaorgwikicramp
