racine stages categorization epileptic seizures proposed ronald j racine prior racines research epilepsy quantifiable means describe seizure intensities causes readily available racines work allowed epilepsy understood level previously thought impossible brain electrical signals spread firing neurons lead desired outcome body caused release neurotransmitter voluntary contractions muscle action potential must met order electrical signal epileptic patients electrical signals reach threshold causing spread firing neurons brain causes multiple signals spread nervous system resulting seizure seizure occurred damage seen area action potential came example initial action potential came hippocampus damage seen surrounding neurons eeg able determine presence seizure intensity action potentials overall result body hard ronald j racine developed method split severity seizures stages mouth facial movement head nodding forelimb clonus rearing forelimb clonus rearing falling forelimb clonus racine stages used determine stages patient experiencing seizure level stimulus patient able reach certain stage time mapping stimulus level resulting seizure intensity show damage stimulated area mappings patients made sending electrical signals different strengths measure bodys epileptic patient experiences seizure patient becomes susceptible seizures racine stages developed using animal model outline five developed racine stages served quantitative way categorize intensity seizure epileptic patient experiencescitation needed seizure described large amounts synchronized action potentials cause body perform uncontrollable muscle contractions resulting involuntary movement incapacity control ones synchronized action potential must surpass certain threshold different patient reverberates throughout patients epilepsy seizure occurs constantly continue grow intensity patient epilepsy always risk experiencing seizure however patient different environmental stimuli cause patient experience patient treatment method success treatment method different henry molaison hm known contribution memory studies neuroscience lost ability retain longterm memories debilitating hm showed small signs seizures growing age fifteen hms sign seizure lull conversation seconds would appear described absent minded seconds first traumatic seizure happened fifteen family car hm experienced seizure caused entire body deep brain stimulation experiment developed test fluctuations thresholds patients epilepsy experiment researchers used implanted electrodes measure electrographic activity introduction stimulus resulting seizure experiment successful showing seizure happened lower thresholds repeated treatments overall severity seizure well prior racines research epilepsy model severity seizure ronald j racine sought develop model quantified severity seizure using animal testing rat model racine able stimulate specific parts brain using slight electrical impulses used methods deep brain stimulation order ensure targeted areas brain able reach specific threshold see reaction rats separated categories target area duration stimuli overall intensity stimuli specifically targeted hippocampus amygdala test animals rat model anesthetized special probes placed specific parts brain according target area using electrical stimulation one second intervals different intensities racine observed change muscle stimulation excited rats would demonstrate signs seizure racine able categorize bodies reaction stimuli five different categories also observed continuation treatment easier seizure take stages increasing severity serve way quantify intensity seizure increases severity efferent actions stage result action potentials causing muscle contract relax resulting involuntary observable action level stimulus increases resulting involuntary movement goes level stages levels racine stages also contain symptoms previous stages example person demonstrating actions stage four seizure may also demonstrate head nodding indicative level two known repeated exposure stimuli lowers overall threshold first two stages seen two four days increase severity seizure seen recorded patient experiencing reactive behavior seen higher racine seen patients since development use racine stages helped research treating epileptic patients currently racine stages used rat racine models still used laboratory settings demonstrate severity seizures model serves standard method quantify severity seizure additional stages added model severe cases pinel rovne developed model added traditional five stages based classic five stages increase severity called additional stagescitation needed stages also include addition symptoms seen stages one five research cure epilepsy ongoing different levels tolerance outside stimulus exist patient patients experience seizures audio visual stimulation however patients sensitive environmental factors cases treatment medication surgery help limit prevalence however treatment methods always cure classic five racine stages adapted many times since designation depending changes stimuli intensity duration researches add take away levels according reactions rat adaptations exist racine stages model original model served backbone idea creating method determining intensity seizure use racine
