risk compensation theory suggests people typically adjust behavior response perceived levels risk becoming careful sense greater risk less careful feel although usually small comparison fundamental benefits safety interventions may result lower net benefit expected even higher way example observed motorists drove closer vehicle front vehicles fitted antilock brakes also evidence risk compensation phenomenon could explain failure condom distribution programs reverse hiv prevalence condoms may foster disinhibition people engaging risky sex without condoms contrast shared space urban street design method consciously aims increase level perceived risk uncertainty thereby slowing traffic reducing number seriousness injuries risk compensation related broader term behavioral adaptation includes behavior changes response safety measures whether compensatory however since researchers primarily interested compensatory negative adaptive behavior terms sometimes used
