perceptual paradox illustrates failure theoretical prediction theories perception supposed help researcher predict perceived senses stimulated theory usually comprises mathematical model formula rules collecting physical measurements input model rules collecting physical measurements model outputs map arbitrarily choosing valid input data model reliably generate output data indistinguishable measured system modeled although theory may useful limited predictions theories vision hearing touch smell taste typically reliable comprehensive modeling perception based sensory inputs paradox
