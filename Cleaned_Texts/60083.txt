cancer genome project part cancer aging somatic mutation research based wellcome trust sanger institute united kingdom aims identify sequence variantsmutations critical development human cancers like cancer genome atlas project within united states cancer genome project represents effort war cancer improve cancer diagnosis treatment prevention better understanding molecular basis disease cancer genome project launched michael stratton peter campbell group leader project project works combine knowledge human genome sequence high throughput mutation detection project operates within scope international cancer genome consortium working participating organizations countries build database genomic changes present different types somatic mutation information gathered project located cosmic database wellcome trust sanger institutes project currently several internal partners focus different types cancer mutagenesis utilizing different research goes beyond sequencing include therapeutic biomarker discoveries made utilizing bioinformatics programs among discoveries drug sensitivity biomarkers inhibitor biomarkers discoveries paired evolution dna sequencing technologies nextgeneration sequencing techniques important potential disease treatment may even help lead personalized medicine cancer goals project help sequence catalog different cancer genomes beyond sequencing projects internal partners different areas focus assist projects overall goal determining unique ways early detection cancer better prevention improved treatment following groups internal partners wellcome trust sanger institute labs involved cancer genome project carrying different areas research involving cancer genomics diseases therapy improvements aforementionedcitation needed garnett group headed mathew garnett work improve current cancer therapies determining alterations dna cells results cancer implications involving patient responses therapy potential improvement current research carried
