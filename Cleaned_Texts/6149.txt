authorlevel metrics citation metrics measure bibliometric impact individual authors researchers academics scholars many metrics developed take account varying numbers factors considering total number citations looking distribution across papers journals using statistical graphtheoretic principles quantitative comparisons researchers mostly done distribute resources money academic positions however still debate academic world effectively authorlevel metrics accomplish authorlevel metrics differ journallevel metrics attempt measure bibliometric impact academic journals rather individuals however metrics originally developed academic journals reported researcher level authorlevel author impact formally f function corresponds number citations publication hindex computed follows first order values f largest lowest value look last position f greater equal position call h position example researcher publications b c e citations respectively hindex equal publication citations contrast publications citations index fourth paper individual hindex normalized number authors proposed h h n displaystyle n displaystyle nat number authors considered h displaystyle h found distribution hindex although depends field normalized simple rescaling factor example assuming standard hs biology distribution h mathematics collapses h multiplied three mathematician h equivalent biologist h method readily adopted perhaps complexity avoid incentivizing hyperautorship coauthors per paper might simpler divide citation counts number authors ordering papers obtaining fractional hindex originally suggested hirsch index also called hfrac highly correlated hindex currently correlated scientific three additional metrics proposed lower center upper give accurate representation distribution shape three metrics measure relative area within scientists citation distribution low impact area lower area captured hindex center area publications highest visibility upper scientists high upper percentages perfectionists whereas scientists high lower percentages mass producers metrics percentages intended give qualitative description supplement quantitative hindex shown strong discipline bias however simple normalization h h displaystyle hlangle hrangle average h scholars discipline effective way mitigate bias obtaining universal impact metric allows comparison scholars across different number models proposed incorporate relative contribution author paper instance accounting rank sequence generalization hindex indices gives additional information shape authors citation function heavytailed flatpeaked etc hindex never meant measure future publication success recently group researchers investigated features predictive future hindex possible try predictions using online however later work shown since hindex cumulative measure contains intrinsic autocorrelation led significant overestimation predictability thus true predictability future hindex much lower

praised authorlevel metrics useful yardstick compare unbiased way different individuals competing resource important evaluation criterion scientific however members scientific community even hirsch criticized particularly susceptible gaming work bibliometrics demonstrated multiple techniques manipulation popular authorlevel metrics used metric hindex manipulated even computergenerated nonsense documents used purpose example using metrics also manipulated coercive citation practice editor journal forces authors add spurious citations articles journal agree publish additionally hindex considered decision criterion research funding agencies gametheoretic solution competition implies increasing average length coauthors leo szilard inventor nuclear chain reaction also expressed criticism decisionmaking system scientific funding book voice dolphins senator j lister hill read excerpts criticism senate hearing slowing governmentfunded cancer szilards work focuses metrics slowing scientific progress rather specific methods gaming matter fact think would quite easy could set foundation annual endowment thirty million dollars research workers need funds could apply grants could mail convincing case ten committees committee composed twelve scientists appointed pass applications take active scientists laboratory make members committees best men field appointed chairman salaries fifty thousand dollars also twenty prizes one hundred thousand dollars best scientific papers year would lawyers could easily prepare charter foundation matter fact national science foundation bills introduced seventyninth eightieth congress could perfectly well serve model first best scientists would removed laboratories kept busy committees passing applications funds secondly scientific workers need funds would concentrate problems considered promising pretty certain lead publishable results years might great increase scientific output going obvious pretty soon science would dry science would become something like parlor game somethings would considered interesting others would fashions followed fashions would get grants would pretty soon would learn follow fashion
