monogyny specialised mating system male mate one female throughout lifetime female may mate one male system males generally provide paternal many spider species monogynous males two copulatory organs allows mate maximum twice throughout commonly seen honeybees ants certain spider species male may put energy single copulation knowing lower overall fitness copulation monogynous males adapted cause self genital damage even death increase chances paternity monogyny one several mating systems observed nature male mates females however may mate multiple males important emphasize distinctions monogyny polyandry monogyny monogamy polyandry mating system female mates one male male turn also mate one female monogamous setting male female consent one mate one time thus mate partner time period hence monogyny sometimes referred male monogamy male mates one mating system monogyny common ants honeybees spiders species ants honeybees one female queen mates males colony males attend queen mate circumstances however colony become queenless therefore certain males must adapt surrounding order increase paternity ants honeybees two different types monogynous settings type monogynous queenright colonies queen mated female everyone else unmated type b monogynous workerreproductive colonies queen rather gamergates mated workers take queenlike queen normally egg producer however colony becomes queenless workers intact undeveloped ovaries may develop thus become capable laying certain colonies singly mated worker called gamergate reproduces functional queen workers termed totipotent able change adapt different surrounding longer queen males certain species spiders often employ drastic methods paternally successful monogyny spiders culminates extreme traits dramatic male selfsacrifice emasculation male female since males mate one female monogynous setting individual male must whatever takes increase particular paternity success even means sacrificing male redback spiders twist abdomens onto fangs mates copulation cannibalized matings increase paternity relative males way males redback spiders monogynous setting increase chance paternity actually surrendering cannibalized female benefits mate guarding securing paternity higher searching many mates monogynous system male securing paternity becomes males first priority reproduction one way mate guard creating physical barrier turn away males male cause severe physical damage breaking pedipalps order plug genital opening female males argiope bruennichi remove pedipalp females thus reduce risk sperm competition males also remove sperm previous mate female deposit sperm increasing likelihood success copulation golden orb spider male may sacrifice copulatory organs one mating order turn away wandering cases see casting body parts anterior legs golden orb spider male attacked aggressive female continue mate eats legs eat copulation monogynous male sacrificial system cause genital damage many cases die copulation spontaneously argiope aurantia cannibalized female observed many spider species red back spider consumes male either right copulation male quick enough size age female play role whether male able escape usually successful attempt escape female older heavier making much dominant male another factor survival demise male duration copulation high copulation time chances eaten much higher copulation duration ten seconds chances eaten much greater jump ten monogyny increases males chance paternity male biased ratio population males make large majority population likelihood finding multiple females slim thus males mate first female encounter mate guarding males beneficial looking another female odds meeting another female male biased population male standpoint evolutionary theory suggests focus mating enhance paternity order produce viable offspring therefore sexual selection theory would suggest male attempt mate several means male wants ensure paternally successful mate one female sex ratio male biased however male monogamy monogyny would arise means increasing paternity producing offspring words setting contains sex ratio male one female monogyny would arise means produce offspring model predicts malebiased sex ratio required monogyny males adapt order increase paternity monogynous setting example would formation gamergates queenless colony honeybees

mating obstructing females genital openings order paternally male animals especially species males provide little parental investment time energy invested current offspring expense future offspring generally expected maximize fitness mating several certain monogynous settings however paternal investment male greater males mating systems benefits paternal protection exceed searching additional paternal investment includes even dramatic examples remarkable adaptation male sacrifice via sexual cannibalism ability inflict genital damage unto oneself increase paternity success circumstances selection may favor extreme mechanisms paternity protection amount maximal investment single mating also circumstances monogyny evolves males provide paternal investment researchers focused sexual behaviour systems males low paternal investment frequently mate lifetimes often killed female mating effort high males particular time energy costs risks incurred males securing given mating could
