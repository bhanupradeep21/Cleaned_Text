carlo jucci june rieti october biologist important contribution jucci studies silkworm whose metabolism investigated comparing larval growth among several races moth thus opening new chapter comparative physiology jucci also interested biochemical genetics directed attention especially silkworm cocoon color studies concerning migration leaf pigments differential permeability intestine silkworm salivary gland function carotenoids flavones first example biochemical genetics animal worldcitation needed following course classical studies jucci graduated natural sciences university rome july defending thesis biology student giovanni battista grassi particular began intern institute comparative anatomy meanwhile enrolled faculty medicine acquire complete biological obtained scholarship rome fondazione corsi assistant post portici biological institute scuola superiore di agraria obtained degree medicine surgery university naples also convincingly passed examinations qualify university lecturer comparative anatomy assistant filippo bottazzi naples grant rockefeller foundation allowed travel work usa marine biological laboratory near plymouth massachusetts jucci conducted research cell permeability ciliary movement returned institute physiology university naples following year seconded zoological chair zoology comparative anatomy university sassari remained

evolution succeeded chair zoology university pavia following death cesare artom whose studies chromosomal cellular aspects heredity jucci wished build part anniversary celebrations honor lazzaro spallanzani jucci organized scientific conference pavia year founded center genetics allow concentration research collaboration experimental genetics center launched alongside new scientific journal genetics scientia genetica periodical international circulation wide participation researchers latin countries genetics center merely forerunner become juccis institute genetics established within

becoming fully operational apennine center seven laboratories library museum addition land experimentation housed society agricultural member several italian foreign academies jucci died rome october career jucci inspired general themes biology evolution relationships genetics embryology physiology ontogenetic development able achieve remarkable results fields entomology comparative physiology genetics documented two hundred publications years within roman school grassi shared research topics debut biology termitids topic great biological interest clarify multiple forms assumed members societies insects already determined egg depend way external factors grassi argued colony could stop divert development number individuals destined become perfect insects inducing assume form functions workers soldiers royalty varying proportions qualities food others like americans snyder thompson believed demolish results scientist supporting intrinsic differentiation ontogenetic development individuals experiments objects thesis successive investigations carried also transfer agricultural school portici directed student grassi anna fo√† jucci could confirm thesis teacher moreover already taken filippo silvestri noted royals absent society change diet causes development nymphs stop induces differentiation mature genital organs giving rise replacement neotenic reals original part work deals different metabolisms found different forms initiated tissues glandular activity new histology insects study excretory functions real neotenic related histology detection anabolic catabolic products different organisms jucci introduced original method comparative physiological research additionally among things hypothesized examination structure tentorial glands showed evolution occurred phylogenetic path group considered although systematic position termites derived cockroaches million years ago mesozoic evolved convergently ants appearance social behavior distant hymenopterans would reasonable rely help explain phenomena convergence social insects discovered existence tentorial glands species reticulitermes lucifugus made biometric study theorized mediation hormonal factors induced special diet could taken differentiation castes would able reach broader understanding mechanisms development insects confirming aforementioned hypothesis continued researches jucci agricultural school portici turned interests biology silkworm one topics dealt field breeding already studied italian scientists marcello malpighi agostino bassi also scholars active china japan thanks great variability characters species seen privileged material genetic experimentation intends follow development various phases began research development bombyx mori using comparative physiological method represented curve highlighted metabolic aspects univoltine breeds whose egg develops pause single generation lives within year bi polyvoltine whose egg hatches soon laid sequence two generations year showing different metabolism growth would less meaning passing univoltine polyvoltines able demonstrate polyvoltinism common feature metabolic capacities vary depending ability insect react external environment many degrees transition uni bi polyvoltinism studying bivoltinism tendency fertilized egg direct development without pauses jucci investigated existence silkworm
