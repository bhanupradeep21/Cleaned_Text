united states august intravenous formulation approved united states february laboratory studies clinical trials started investigating possibility increasing anticancer potency temozolomide combining pharmacologic agents example clinical trials indicated addition chloroquine might beneficial treatment glioma laboratory studies found temozolomide killed brain tumor cells efficiently epigallocatechin gallate egcg component green tea added however efficacy effect yet confirmed braintumor preclinical studies reported investigations use novel oxygen diffusionenhancing compound trans sodium crocetinate tsc combined temozolomide radiation clinical trial underway august abovementioned approaches investigated whether combination temozolomide agents might improve therapeutic outcome efforts also started study whether altering temozolomide molecule increase activity one approach permanently fused perillyl alcohol natural compound demonstrated therapeutic activity brain cancer temozolomide molecule resultant novel compound called tmzpoh revealed anticancer activity significantly greater either two parent molecules temozolomide perillyl alcohol although tested humans shown superior cancer therapeutic activity animal models brain metastasis triplenegative breast tumor cells express methyltransferase mgmt gene resistant effects temozolomide researchers investigated whether inclusion agt inhibitor could overcome resistance improve drugs therapeutic effectiveness laboratory combination indeed showed increased temozolomide activity tumorcell culture vitro animal
