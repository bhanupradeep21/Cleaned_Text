botany floral morphology study diversity forms structures presented flower definition branch limited growth bears modified leaves responsible reproduction protection gametes called floral piecesnote fertile leaves sporophylls carry sporangiums produce male female gametes therefore responsible producing next generation plants sterile leaves modified leaves whose function protect fertile parts
