bone whether neural spines vertebrae horizontally expanded futalognkosaurus ligabuesaurus mendozasaurus like futalognkosaurus titanosaurs preserved complete set back vertebrae patagotitan probably several characteristics back vertebrae distinguished patagotitan titanosaurs laminae ridges bone crossing vertebrae thin strongly developed back vertebrae patagotitan unlike argentinosaurus puertasaurus uniquely prezygodiapophyseal laminae prdls ran articular processes prezygapophyses front diapophyses sides nearly vertical prezygapophyses situated higher vertebrae diapophyses prdls usually instead extended forward diapophyses sauropods neural spines back tall vertical patagotitan first expanded arrowshaped ends argentinosaurus front neural spines arrowshaped ends like members titanosauriformes rear neural spines inclined backwards patagotitan represents reversal condition nontitanosauriforms dreadnoughtus puertasaurus members lognkosauria short front neural spines lacking arrowshaped ends uniquely first two back vertebrae prespinal laminae ran alongside front neural spines bulged outwards near bottom also uniquely third back vertebra preserves hyposphene rear end hypantrum front missing fourth back vertebra presumably corresponding hypantrum hyposphenehypantrum articulations stiffen vertebrae primitively present among sauropods lost multiple patagotitan first

bifurcated tips curling forwards neural spine longitudinal laminae separated prespinal postspinal laminae previously seen bonitasaura sides front tail vertebrae transverse processes diapophyses located high thin like futalognkosaurus mendozasaurus unlike dreadnoughtus titanosaurs unlike diplodocidae transverse processes front tail vertebrae formed winglike shapes wider bottom patagotitan expanded transverse processes would resulted greater attachment areas caudofemoralis longus ilioischiocaudalis spinalis muscles therefore muscular tail also like futalognkosaurus mendozasaurus drusilasaura welldeveloped spinodiapophyseal laminae sdls ran neural spines tranverse processes patagotitan robust expanded scapula blade times long wide narrowest point except drusilasaura isisaurus

ninjatitan possibly closer patagotitan argentinosaurus agustín pérez moreno colleagues performed analysis based gallina colleagues found similar arrangement except ninjatitan closer due completeness carballido colleagues found patagotitan among phylogenetically stable titanosaurs high recuperation index meaning stable enough removed due instability analyses due firm position within lognkosauria found uncertainty regarding whether lognkosauria belonged within lithostrotia largely arose definition lithostrotia based phylogenetically unstable malawisaurus instead using lithostrotia suggested
