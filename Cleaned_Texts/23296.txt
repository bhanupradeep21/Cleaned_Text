pantothenate kinaseassociated neurodegeneration pkan formerly called genetic degenerative disease brain lead parkinsonism dystonia dementia ultimately death neurodegeneration pkan accompanied excess iron progressively builds brain pkan caused loss function enzyme due biallelic genetic mutations follows autosomal recessive inheritance enzyme first step pathway converting vitamin coenzyme currently treatments modify disease progress though number medications therapies help improve symptoms active research symptoms typically begin childhood progressive often resulting death early adulthood symptoms pkan begin middle childhood often noticed ten years age symptoms includecitation needed individuals experience uncharacteristic form pkan develops years age follows slower gradual pace deterioration years age individuals face significant speech deficits well psychiatric behavioral disturbancescitation needed progressive degenerative nerve illness pkan leads early immobility often death early adulthood death occurs prematurely due infections pneumonia disease technically life limitingcitation needed pkan autosomal recessive disorder parents affected child must heterozygous carriers disease therefore must carry one mutant allele autosomal disorder heterozygous disorder may display atypical characteristics considered suggestive disorder however reported cases compound heterozygosity heterozygous individuals develop classic form disorder caused mutant gene located chromosomal locus responsible coding protein pantothenate kinase encodes enzyme pantothenate kinase mutations gene lead inborn error vitamin pantothenate metabolism vitamin required production coenzyme cells disruption enzyme affects energy lipid metabolism may lead accumulation potentially harmful compounds brain including ironcitation needed encodes transcript derived seven exons covering total distance approximately genomic dna gene also encodes functional pantothenate kinase essential regulatory enzyme coenzyme coa biosynthesis catalyzing phosphorylation pantothenate vitamin npantothenoylcysteine pantetheine omim mutant gene coded proteins often caused null missense mutations notably deletion gene coding sequencecitation needed disorder reported specific communities based intracommunity marriages parents child carrying mutation one communities reported agrawal agarwal

neurological examination would show evidence muscle rigidity weakness abnormal postures movements tremors family members also affected may help determine diagnosis genetic tests confirm abnormal gene causing disease however test yet widely available movement disorders diseases must ruled individuals exhibiting listed symptoms often tested using mri magnetic resonance imaging number neurorelated disorders mri usually shows iron deposits basal ganglia development diagnostic criteria continues hope separating pkan forms neurodegenerative diseases featuring nbiacitation needed microscopic
