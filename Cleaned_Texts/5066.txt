hearing auditory perception ability perceive sounds organ ear detecting vibrations periodic changes pressure surrounding academic field concerned hearing auditory science sound may heard solid liquid gaseous one traditional five senses partial total inability hear called hearing loss humans vertebrates hearing performed primarily auditory system mechanical waves known vibrations detected ear transduced nerve impulses perceived brain primarily temporal lobe like touch audition requires sensitivity movement molecules world outside organism hearing touch types three main components human auditory system outer ear middle ear inner ear outer ear includes pinna visible part ear well ear canal terminates eardrum also called tympanic membrane pinna serves focus sound waves ear canal toward
