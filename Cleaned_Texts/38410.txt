epithelial cell adhesion molecule epcam also known among names transmembrane glycoprotein mediating homotypic adhesion epcam also involved cell proliferation additionally epcam oncogenic potential via capacity upregulate cmyc efabp cyclins since epcam expressed exclusively epithelia epithelialderived neoplasms epcam used diagnostic marker various cancers appears play role tumorigenesis metastasis carcinomas also act potential prognostic marker potential target immunotherapeutic first discovered epcam initially described dominant surface antigen human colon prevalence many carcinomas discovered many different epcam therefore many aliases notable include tumorassociated calcium signal transducer cluster differentiation epcam expression limited human colon carcinomas fact epcam expressed variety human epithelial tissues carcinomas progenitor stem cells however epcam found nonepithelial cells cancers nonepithelial origin epcam expressed basolateral membrane simple especially glandular pseudostratified transitional epithelia contrast normal squamous stratified epithelia negative epcam level expression may differ significantly individual tissue types gastrointestinal tract gastric epithelium expresses low levels epcam expression levels substantially higher small intestine colon epcam probably expressed highest levels among epithelial cell epcam frequently upregulated carcinomas expressed cancers nonepithelial origin cancer cells epcam expressed dispersed pattern across cell however epcam expression carcinomas often heterogeneous cells tumor epcam cells tumor squamous carcinomas often express epcam whereas normal squamous cells express epcam epcam expression differs different types renal cell carcinomas epcam expression increases development androgen resistance prostate points towards utility epcam diagnostic tool various cancers although identified cell adhesion molecule epcam structurally resemble four major families cell adhesion molecules namely cadherins integrins selectins members immunoglobulin epcam glycosylated type membrane protein sequence epcam molecule predicts presence three potential nlinked glycosylation sites composed amino acids epcam consists extracellular domain amino acids epidermal growth factor egf thyroglobulin repeatlike domains single transmembrane domain amino acids short intracellular domain amino extracellular domain sometimes referred epex intracellular domain sometimes referred exact function epcam currently elucidated epcam appears play many different roles epcam first found play role homotypic cell means epcam surface one cell binds epcam neighboring cell thereby holding cells together adhesions mediated epcam relatively weak compared adhesion molecules classic cadherins epicd required epcam mediate intercellular adhesion epcam mediates intercellular adhesion associates actin cytoskeleton via epcam negative impact cadherinmediated adhesions overexpression epcam alter overall total cellular level cadherins rather decreases association cadherin catenin complex cytoskeleton epcam expression increases total amount αcatenin decreases whereas cellular βcatenin levels remain homotypic adhesive activity questioned variety vivo vitro biochemical experiments failed detect epcam proadhesive activity could explained alternative based ability regulate pkc signalling myosin recently discovered epcam contributes maintenance tight active proliferation number epithelial tissues associated increased de novo epcam expression especially evident tissues normally reveal low levels epcam expression squamous epithelium level epcam expression correlates proliferative activity intestinal cells inversely correlates epcam cleaved lends molecule oncogenic potential upon cleavage extracellular domain epex released area surrounding cell intracellular domain epicd released cytoplasm cell epicd forms complex proteins βcatenin lef inside nucleus complex binds dna promotes transcription various genes targets upregulation include cmyc efabp cyclins effect promoting tumor growth additionally epex cleaved stimulate cleavage additional epcam molecules resulting positive feedback amount βcatenin nucleus modulate expression level epcam may also play role epithelial mesenchymal transition emt tumors although exact effects poorly understood ability suppress ecadherin suggests epcam would promote emt tumor metastasis homotypic cell adhesion properties counteract ability suppress results different studies often conflicting one study example silencing epcam short interfering rna sirna led reduction proliferation migration invasion breast cancer cells supporting role epcam promoting emt another study cells undergoing emt found downregulate one study epithelial tumors often strongly positive epcam mesenchymal tumors showed occasional weak suggested epcam expression downregulated emt upregulated metastasis reaches future tumor speculated since epcam normal epithelia expressed mostly basolateral membrane would much less accessible antibodies epcam cancer tissue homogeneously distributed cancer cell surface addition overexpressed many carcinomas epcam expressed cancer stem cells making epcam attractive target immunotherapy however heterogeneous expression epcam carcinomas fact epcam tumorspecific ie found normal epithelium raise concerns immunotherapy directed towards epcam could severe side role epcam cancer cell signaling better understood epcam signaling rather epcam may target therapeutic edrecolomab catumaxomab nofetumomab monoclonal antibodies designed bind epcam often overexpressed certain carcinomas including breast cancer colon cancer basal cell carcinoma diagnosis conditions therefore assisted immunohistochemistry using antibody problem epcam indirectly cause lynch genetic disorder leads increased risk cancer deletion portion end epcam gene causes epigenetic inactivation gene hypermethylating promoter region gene mutations epcam also associated congenital tufting causes intractable diarrhea newborn children article incorporates text united states national library medicine public domain
