cardiorenal syndrome crs umbrella term used medical field defines disorders heart kidneys whereby acute chronic dysfunction one organ may induce acute chronic dysfunction one organs fails may subsequently heart kidneys involved maintaining hemodynamic stability organ perfusion intricate network patients renal failure first may hard determine heart failure two organs communicate one another variety pathways interdependent relationship report national heart lung blood institute crs defined condition treatment congestive heart failure limited decline kidney definition since challenged repeatedly still remains little consensus universally accepted definition crs consensus conference acute dialysis quality initiative adqi crs classified five subtypes primarily based upon organ initiated insult well acuity following risk factors associated increased incidence pathophysiology crs attributed two broad categories hemodynamic factors low cardiac output elevation intraabdominal central venous pressures nonhemodynamic factors cardiorenal connectors neurohormonal inflammatory previously believed low cardiac output heart failure patients results decreased blood flow kidneys lead progressive deterioration kidney function result diuresis patients result hypovolemia prerenal azotemia however several studies find association kidney dysfunction cardiac output hemodynamic addition crs observed patients diastolic dysfunction normal left ventricular systolic therefore must additional mechanisms involved progression crs elevated intraabdominal pressures resulting ascites abdominal wall edema may associated worsening kidney functions heart failure patients several studies shown result increased intraabdominal pressure increased central venous pressure congestion kidneys veins lead worsening kidney addition many neurohormonal inflammatory agents implicated progression crs include increased formation reactive oxygen species endothelin arginine vasopressin excessive sympathetic activity result myocardial hypertrophy cardiorenal connectors include reninangiotensinsystem activation nitric oxidereactive oxygen species imbalance inflammatory factors abnormal activation sympathetic nervous system cause structural functional abnormalities heart andor kidney close interaction within cardiorenal connectors well factors hemodynamic factors makes study crs pathophysiology critical diagnose crs early stage order achieve optimal therapeutic efficacy however unlike markers heart damage stress troponin creatine kinase natriuretic peptides reliable markers acute kidney injury lacking recently research found several biomarkers used early detection acute kidney injury serious loss organ function may occur several biomarkers include neutrophil gelatinaseassociated lipocalin ngal nacetylbdglucosaminidase nag cystatin c kidney injury shown involved tubular biomarkers shown useful include bnp fatty acid binding protein however great variability measurement biomarkers use diagnosing crs must ronco et al first proposed fivepart classification system crs also accepted adqi consensus conference include distinction crs type crs type based assumption also advanced chronic disease two different pathophysiological mechanisms distinguished whereas ckd hf often develop due common pathophysiological background notably hypertension diabetes mellitus furthermore feasibility distinction crs type terms diagnosis braam et al argue classifying crs based order organs affected timeframe acute vs chronic simplistic without mechanistic classification difficult study view cardiorenal syndrome holistic integrative defined cardiorenal syndrome pathophysiological condition combined heart kidney dysfunction amplifies progression failure individual organ inducing similar pathophysiological mechanisms therefore regardless organ fails first neurohormonal systems activated causing accelerated cardiovascular disease progression damage failure organs systems broken two broad categories hemodynamic factors nonhemodynamic factors cardiorenal medical management patients crs often challenging focus treatment one organ may worsening outcome known many medications used treat hf may worsen kidney function population ages burden renal disease cardiovascular disease continue rise efforts better understand complicated relationship two organ systems greatly addition many trials hf excluded patients advanced kidney dysfunction therefore understanding crs management still limited one study shows ace inhibitors angiotensin ii receptor antagonists found prevent nephropathy patients patients kidney failure less likely get guidelinebased therapies patients moderate severe ckd seen similar care compared patients normal kidney function helps show healthcare workers increase outcome kidney failure common patients congestive heart failure shown kidney failure complicates onethird admissions heart failure leading cause hospitalization united states among adults years leading cause hospitalization also increases stays complications led longer hospital stay higher mortality greater chance readmission inpatient mortality seen much higher patients much sever renal increase hospital icu stays also increases cost care hospital patients suffering disease also suffering financially due cost hospital another study found patients nyha class patients nyha class severely impaired kidney similarly kidney failure deleterious effects cardiovascular function estimated deaths patients endstage kidney failure eskf due cardiovascular
