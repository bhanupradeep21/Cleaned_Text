congenital adrenal hyperplasia due deficiency uncommon form congenital adrenal hyperplasia resulting defect gene encodes enzyme causes decreased synthesis cortisol sex steroids resulting increase mineralocorticoid production thus common symptoms include mild hypocortisolism ambiguous genitalia genetic males failure ovaries function puberty genetic females hypokalemic hypertension however partial incomplete deficiency notable inconsistent symptoms affected genetic xx females may wholly asymptomatic except form cah results deficiency enzyme also called accounts less cases congenital

synthesis different alleles gene result enzyme molecules range impaired reduced function produces range clinical dual enzyme activities many decades assumed represent two entirely different genes enzymes thus medical textbooks nosologies quite recently described two different diseases deficient cah distinct even rarer defect sex steroid synthesis termed deficiency form cah last decade become clearer two diseases different forms defects however clinical features two types impairment distinct enough described separately following sectionscitation needed adrenal cortex hyperplastic overstimulated impairment mineralocorticoid pathway consequently levels doc corticosterone elevated although precursors aldosterone weaker mineralocorticoids extreme elevations usually provide enough volume expansion blood pressure elevation potassium depletion suppress renin aldosterone production persons deficiency develop hypertension infancy nearly late childhood lowrenin hypertension often accompanied hypokalemia due urinary potassium wasting metabolic alkalosis features mineralocorticoid excess major clinical clue distinguishing complete deficiency deficiency affects sex steroids treatment glucocorticoid suppresses acth returns mineralocorticoid production toward normal lowers blood although production cortisol inefficient normalize acth elevations corticosterone enough weak

hypothalamuspituitary axis feedback system mainly controlled level serum potassium normal aldosterone level hypertension expected normal cortisol level explained strong negative feedback mechanism cortisol hypothalamuspituitary axis system beginning deficiency block synthesis sex steroid hormones forcing pathways produce cortisol however initial excess cortisol rapidly corrected negative feedback cortisol decreases secretion adrenocorticotropic hormone acth zona fasciculata adrenal gland thus mineralocorticoid overproduction also adrenal hyperplasia also observed patients adrenocorticotropic hormone acth level remains normal range reason still unclear sex steroid deficiency produces effects similar deficiency severely affected genetic females xx born normal internal
