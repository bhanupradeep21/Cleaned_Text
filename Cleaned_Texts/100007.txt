chronobiology field biology examines timing processes including periodic cyclic phenomena living organisms adaptation solar lunarrelated cycles known biological rhythms chronobiology comes ancient greek χρόνος chrónos meaning time biology pertains study science life related terms chronomics chronome used cases describe either molecular mechanisms involved chronobiological phenomena quantitative aspects chronobiology particularly comparison cycles organisms required chronobiological studies include limited comparative anatomy physiology genetics molecular biology behavior organisms related biological aspects include epigenetics development reproduction ecology evolution chronobiology studies variations timing duration biological activity living organisms occur many essential biological processes occur animals eating sleeping mating hibernating migration cellular regeneration etc b plants leaf movements photosynthetic reactions etc microbial organisms fungi protozoa even found bacteria especially among cyanobacteria aka bluegreen algae see bacterial circadian rhythms best studied rhythm chronobiology circadian rhythm roughly cycle shown physiological processes organisms
