sharps waste form biomedical waste composed used sharps includes device object used puncture lacerate skin sharps waste classified biohazardous waste must carefully handled common medical materials treated sharps waste hypodermic needles disposable scalpels blades contaminated glass certain plastics guidewires used addition needles blades anything attached syringes injection devices also considered sharps waste blades include razors scalpels xacto knives scissors items used cutting medical biological research setting regardless whether contaminated biohazardous material glass sharp plastic considered sharps waste handling methods vary glass items contaminated biohazardous material treated concern needles blades even unbroken glass contaminated still often treated sharp break disposal process contaminated plastic items sharp disposed biohazardous waste receptacle instead sharps container injuries sharps waste pose large public health concern used sharps may contain biohazardous material possible waste spread bloodborne pathogens contaminated sharps penetrate skin spread pathogens directly responsible transmission bloodborne diseases hepatitis b hbv hepatitis c hcv hiv health care professionals expose risk transmission diseases handling sharps waste large volume handled health care professionals daily basis increases chance injury may occur general public occasionally risk sustaining injuries sharps waste well hypodermic needles improperly disposed injection drug users hard plastic containers known sharps containers used safely dispose hypodermic needles sharp medical instruments iv catheters disposable scalpels often sealable selflocking well rigid prevents waste penetrating damaging sides container united states sharps containers usually red marked universal biohazard symbol ease recognition elsewhere often yellow waste loaded container reaches certain height usually around threequarters way full point container emptied disposed sharps containers may single use case disposed along waste contain reusable case robotically emptied sterilized returned reuse airports large institutions commonly sharps containers available restrooms safe disposal users injection drugs insulindependent diabetics medical facilities laboratories also equipped sharps containers well equipment required safely sterilize dispose minimizes distance containers travel number people come contact sharps waste smaller clinics offices us without facilities required federal regulations hire services company specializes transporting properly disposing hazardous wastes extreme care must taken management disposal sharps waste goal sharps waste management safely handle materials properly disposed final step disposal sharps waste dispose autoclave less common approach incinerate typically chemotherapy sharps waste incinerated steps must taken along way minimize risk injury material maximizing amount sharps material disposed strict hospital protocols government regulations instruct health care providers manage sharps waste help ensure waste handled effectively safely possible disposal methods vary country locale common methods disposal either truck service united states disposal sharps mail truck service involves trained personnel collecting sharps waste often medical waste point generation hauling away truck destruction facility similarly mailback sharps disposal method allows generators ship sharps waste disposal facility directly us mail specially designed approved shipping containers mailback sharps disposal allows waste generators dispose smaller amounts sharps economically hire truck service recentwhen legislation france stated pharmaceutical companies supplying self injection medications responsible disposal spent needles previously popular needle clippers caps longer acceptable safety devices either sharps box needle destruction devices requiredcitation needed report canadian mental health association found supervised injection sites help reduce amount discarded needles sixteen billion injections administered annually needles largest contributor sharps waste reason many new technologies surrounding injections developed mostly related safety mechanisms technologies developed governments attempted make commonplace ensure sharps waste safety needlestick safety prevention act passed along bloodborne pathogens safety syringes help reduce occurrences accidental needlesticks one recent developments autodisable injection device injection devices automatically disable single use done retracting needle back syringe rendering syringe plunger inoperable injection device inoperable reused shielding needle injection another approach safe management sharps hands free methods usually involving hinging cap pressed table seal needle another technology sharps waste management relating injections needle remover varying approaches taken main goal separate needle syringe allows sharp needle quarantined disposed separately syringe debate around use devices involve additional step handling sharps waste sharps waste great concern developing transitional regions world factors high disease prevalence lack health care professionals amplify dangers involved sharps waste cost newer disposal technology makes unlikely used rest world injection waste make largest portion sharps waste however injection use much prevalent developing world one contributors increase larger emphasis placed injections therapeutic purposes estimated injections developing regions therapeutic average person estimated receive injections per year newly developed injection technologies rarely used provide injections due added costs therefore majority injections given standard disposable syringes developing infrastructure developing regions equipped deal large volume contaminated sharps waste contrary industrialized world disposal incinerators transportation networks always available cost restraints make purchase single use disposable containers unrealistic facilities often overwhelmed patients understaffed educated workers demand facilities limit emphasis enforcement waste disposal protocols factors
