choice architecture design different ways choices presented decision makers impact presentation decisionmaking example following influence consumer choice result advocates libertarian paternalism asymmetric paternalism endorsed deliberate design choice architecture nudge consumers toward personally socially desirable behaviors like saving retirement choosing healthier foods registering organ donor interventions often justifiedby welldesigned choice architectures compensate irrational decisionmaking biases improve consumer techniques consequently become popular among policymakers leading formation uks behavioural insights team white house nudge unit many behavioral scientists stress neutral choicearchitecture consumers maintain autonomy freedom choice despite manipulations choice critics libertarian paternalism often argue choice architectures designed overcome irrational decision biases may impose costs rational agents example limiting undermining respect individual human agency moral moreover result dark patterns problem term choice architecture coined richard thaler cass sunstein book nudge improving decisions health wealth thaler sunstein endorsed thoughtful design choice architecture means improve consumer decisionmaking minimizing biases errors arise result bounded rationality approach example libertarian paternalism philosophy endorsed thaler sunstein aims nudge individuals toward choices best interest without limiting choice libertarian paternalism may also described soft paternalism behavioral scientists grouped elements choice architecture different ways example thaler sunstein john p balz focused following tools choice architecture defaults expecting error understanding mappings involves exploring different ways information presentation affects option comparisons giving feedback structuring complex choices creating another group leading behavioral scientists created typology choice architecture elements dividing structure choice set describe choice examples choice set structuring include number alternatives decision aids defaults choice time describing choice options include partitioning options attributes designing research field behavioral economics shown individuals tend subject predictable biases may lead decision errors following sections describe biases describe ways minimized changing decision context choice architecture classical economics predicts providing options generally improve consumer utility least leave unchanged however additional choice demands additional time consideration evaluate potentially outweighing benefits greater choice behavioral economists shown instances presenting consumers many choices lead reduced motivation make choice decreased satisfaction choices phenomenon often referred choice overchoice tyranny however importance effect appears vary significantly across choice architects reduce choice overload either limiting alternatives providing decision support tools choice architects may choose limit choice options however limits choice may lead reductions consumer welfare greater number choices greater likelihood choice set include optimal choice given consumer result ideal number alternatives depend upon cognitive effort required evaluate option heterogeneity needs preferences across examples consumers faring worse many options rather fewer socialsecurity medicare drug consumption decisions increasingly move online consumers relying upon search engines product recommendation systems find evaluate products services types search decision aids reduce time effort associated information search also power subtly shape decisions dependent upon products presented context presentation way ranked ordered example research consumer goods like wine shown expansion online retailing made simpler consumers gather information products compare alternatives making responsive price quality large body research shown things equal consumers likely choose default default defined choice frame one selection preselected individuals must take active steps select another defaults take many forms ranging automatic enrollment college students university health insurance plans forms default specific option unless changed several mechanisms proposed explain influence defaults example individuals may interpret defaults policymaker recommendations cognitive biases related loss aversion like status quo bias endowment effect might work consumers may fail optout default due associated important note mechanisms mutually exclusive relative influence likely differ across decision contexts types default include simple defaults one choice automatically selected consumers forcedchoice product service denied consumer makes proactive selection sensory defaults choice preselected based upon information gathered specific consumers choices made repeatedly may also affected defaults instance persistent defaults may continually reset regardless past decisions whereas reoccurring defaults remember past decisions use default predictive defaults use algorithms set defaults based upon related one commonly cited studies power defaults example organ donation one study found donor registration rates twice high potential donors opt versus opt donor however influence defaults demonstrated across range domains including choices outcomes manifest future influenced several biases example individuals tend myopic preferring positive outcomes present often expense future outcomes may lead behaviors like overeating overspending shortterm expense longerterm health financial security outcomes addition individual projections future tend inaccurate future uncertain may overestimate likelihood salient desirable generally overly optimistic future example assuming time money future however research indicates several ways structure choice architecture compensate reduce biases example researchers demonstrated improved decisionmaking drawing attention future outcomes emphasizing second best addition limited time offers successful reducing ways options attributes grouped influence choices made examples partitioning options include division household budget categories eg rent food utilities transportation etc categories investments within portfolio eg real estate stocks bonds etc examples partitioning attributes include manner attributes grouped together example label may group several related attributes together eg convenient list individually eg short running time little cleanup low maintenance number type categories important individuals tendency allocate scarce resources equally across people tend divide investments options listed favor equal allocation resources costs across individuals else biased assign equal probabilities events could result aggregate consumption changed number types categorizations instance car buyers nudged toward responsible purchases itemizing practical attributes gas mileage safety warranty etc aggregating less practical attributes ie speed radio design grouped together consumers would optimally consider products attributes deciding options however due cognitive constraints consumers may face similar challenges weighing many attributes evaluating many choices result choice architects may choose limit number attributes weighing cognitive effort required consider multiple value improved information may present challenges consumers care different attributes online forms allow consumers sort different attributes minimize cognitive effort evaluate many options without losing choice presentation information attributes also reduce cognitive effort associated processing reduce errors generally accomplished increasing evaluability comparability one example convert commonly used metrics consumers assumed care example choice architects might translate nonlinear metrics including monthly credit payments miles per gallon relevant linear metrics case payback period associated credit payment gallons per choice architects also influence decisions adding evaluative labels eg good versus bad high versus low numerical explicitly calculating consequences instance translating energy consumption greenhouse gas emissions changing scale metric instance listing monthly cost versus yearly concept choice architecture exists number fields see example work b j fogg computers persuasive technologies concept permission marketing described seth godin choice architecture also similar concept heuristics manipulation changes outcomes without changing peoples underlying preferences described political scientist william h riker choice architecture implemented several public private policy domains variants save tomorrow plan conceived richard thaler shlomo benartzi individuals commit advance allocate portion future salary increases savings adopted companies increase employee retirement lev virine michael trumper applied choice architecture concept project proposed choice engineering choice architecturerelated framework improving project decisions project managers make predictable repeated mental mistakes could lead project failures choice engineering creating processes environment project managers would steered towards making better choices rather mandating choices examples processes would using checklists templates introducing project audit rather direct control providing full disclosure information project team members improving project management education processes virine trumper argued many cases especially smaller projects would beneficial use choice engineering rather strict complex project management processes choice architecture interventions may fail produce desired result several reasons first individual differences may lead consumers respond differently information example liberals conservatives shown respond differently information environmental consequences energyrelated individual numeracy also linked different responses choice second major challenge assessing whether choice architectures fact improving decisionmaking one way assessing evaluate consumer experiences choice made short httpsenwikipediaorgwikichoicearchitecture
