migration pattern northern europe apparently follow strict northwest heading range headings suggests migrating butterflies may adjust migration patterns response local topographical features weather strong wind patterns laboratoryraised autumngeneration painted lady butterflies able distinguish southern orientation return migration path according laboratorybased study butterflies isolated sun unable orient specific direction opposed access sun suggests v cardui requires direct view sky implying use solar compass orient migratory direction maintain straight flight v cardui displays unique system continuous mating throughout seasons including winter may attributed migratory patterns thus significantly affecting mating behaviour european migrations butterflies immediately begin mate lay eggs upon arrival mediterranean spring starting late united states painted lady butterflies migrating towards north experience poor mating conditions many butterflies limited breeding local adult generation develops time roughly middle may early june conjunction butterfly progression throughout migratory process painted lady butterflies start breeding reproduce entirely throughout scientists able find evidence overwintering may migrate warmer locations survive female painted lady butterflies may suspend flight temporarily ready allows opportunity continually reproduce throughout migrations butterflies constantly migrating male butterflies thought lack consistent territory instead requiring territory mate females developing evolutionary behaviour defend territory mating butterflies appear establish particular time place certain locations find suitable reproduction specifically locate certain perches hilltops forestmeadow edges landmarks stay presumably female arrives mate equally important reproduction painted lady butterflies males exhibition polygynous mating behaviour often mate one important painted lady butterflies benefits may supersede costs since permanent breeding ground used upon mating typically occurs afternoon female painted lady butterflies lay eggs one one desired breeding locations variety eclosion locations ultimately dictates male painted lady female painted lady butterflies observed relatively high biotic potential meaning produce large numbers offspring perpetual influx reproduction may reason painted lady butterflies propagated successfully one interesting aspect scientists observed butterflies like fly towards rain studies suggested large amounts rainfall may somehow activate eggs induce better larval inhabited locations begin observe large influx new generations painted lady butterflies fall particularly september october reproductive success declines relatively throughout winter primarily however still continue aspect butterfly behaviour quite unique scientists hypothesize extensive migratory patterns help painted lady butterflies find suitable conditions breeding thus offering possible reason butterflies mate continuously adult butterflies feed flower nectar aphid females oviposit plants nectar immediately available adults even leads high mortality larvae lack discrimination indicates take account volatile chemicals released potential host plants searching oviposition availability adult resources dictates preference specific areas flowers flowers available nectar result larger number eggs deposited plants reinforces idea painted lady butterfly discriminate host plants chooses mainly availability adult food sources even increases mortality rate offspring data also suggest painted lady
