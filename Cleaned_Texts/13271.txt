european finds dromaeosaurid dinosaur remains rare europe typically provide little taxonomic information first dromaeosaurid fossils found france variraptor mechinorum described jean le lœuff eric buffetaut allain taquet considered variraptor mechinorum nomen dubium basis fossil material species collected localities different holotype material enough diagnostic traits warrant naming new however one authors named variraptor jean le lœuff points conversation reasons given considering variraptor mechinorum nomen dubium would apply pyroraptor olympius well since pyroraptors remains present exact description new dromaeosaurid remains assigned variraptor mechinorum phornphen chanthasit eric buffetaut addressed claims allain taquet mentioning original description variraptor mechinorum clearly distinguished holotype referred material argue material clearly belongs individual also elucidating situation pyroraptor quite similar however due disarticulated nature pyroraptor remains unknown belong suspicion affirmed study states known pyroraptor material belong least two different criticism allain taquet enough diagnostic features support validity variraptor also addressed description new overlapping variraptor remains locality holotype variraptor specimen stated undeniably belong holotype individual thus adding new diagnostic traits establishing validity variraptor mechinorum authors also bring light fact allain taquet provide enough diagnosable traits establish holotype pyroraptor valid species noting features stated diagnosis unique pyroraptor simply widespread traits study also agrees pyroraptors unique traits widespread features dromaeosauridae also ruling unique traits results preservation since two existed time place possibility synonymy pyroraptor variraptor

foot predation claws cm long dromaeosaurids claws might used climbing two known teeth flattened curved backwards rear margins finer serrations dromaeosaurid pyroraptor likely welldeveloped forelimbs curved claws probably balanced body long thin tail pyroraptor also covered feathers many relatives like microraptor sinornithosaurus also although pyroraptor olympius shown dromaeosaurid initial description noted due paucity remains enough diagnostic features gathered create good comparison dromaeosaurids concern echoed others notably phylogeny paravia pyroraptor found wildly fluctuate
