identity safety cues aspects environment setting signal members stigmatized groups threat discrimination limited within environment social identities welcomed identity safety cues shown reduce negative impacts impact social identity threats people experience situations feel devalued basis social identity see stereotype threats shown undermine performance academic workrelated contexts make members stigmatized groups feel though identity safety cues proposed way alleviating negative impact stereotype threat social identity threats reducing disparities academic performance members stigmatized groups see achievement gaps united states reducing health disparities caused identity related stressors research shown identity safety cues targeted towards one specific group lead individuals stigmatized identities believe identities respected valued implementation identity safety cues existing research cause members nonstigmatized groups feeling threatened uncomfortable fact work suggested benefits identity safety cues extend members nonstigmatized example implementation identity safety cues within university context shown increase student engagement efficacy reduce average number student absences students especially stigmatized several types identity safety cues evidence suggesting individuals organizations communicate value diversity highly concerns identity threats example hall colleagues tested impact communicating gender inclusive policies selfreported belonging women working engineering firms across two studies hall colleagues found women working engineering firms presented information communicating gender inclusive policies reported increased belonging fewer concerns experiencing gender stereotyping workplace expected pleasant conversations male coworkers within classroom context exposure information stating instructors schools hold multicultural philosophies shown increase student agency selfconfidence classroom engagement students stigmatized exposure diversity philosophies programming lasting effect recent study birnbaum colleagues firstyear college students read diversity statement represented schools diversity philosophy either favor multiculturalism students academic progress tracked course next two years students stigmatized groups read multicultural diversity statement increased academic performance course two years compared students read colorblind diversity statement similarly study found university students presented information equity nondiscrimination policies classroom students stigmatized groups reported greater belonging within classroom reported fewer absences students presented equity nondiscrimination students study also reported perceiving instructor behaving inclusive manner reported greater concerns addressing social inequities presented information equity nondiscrimination policies however evidence effectiveness diversity philosophies programming alone mixed example valarie purdiejones colleagues ran study comparing effects black representation within workplace organizational claims valuing diversity black professionals sense organizational trust black professionals presented information showing organization higher number black employees reported feeling greater organizational trust belonging similarly organizational claims valuing diversity led increased sense organizational trust belonging however type diversity philosophy communicated influenced effective philosophy increasing organizational trust belong black professionals received information stating organization held colorblind philosophy diversity ie idea differences insignificant attended see color blindness felt lower organizational trust belonging black professionals received information stating organization held multicultural perspective ie idea differences social groups meaningful diverse perspectives offer unique insight strengths see multiculturalism similarly study wilton colleagues exposed participants either colorblind multicultural diversity statement measured expectations anticipated bias racial gender diversity participants exposed colorblind diversity statement expected experience increased levels bias expected less racial gender diversity participants exposed multicultural diversity one form identity safety cues shown promise invoking real imagined presence members stigmatized groups way suggesting ones social identity devalued majority work done amongst racial minorities women contexts represent numerical minority eg stem contexts male dominated workplaces example study explored impacts signaling balanced versus unbalanced gender ratios stem belonging female male stem study women watch video showed much larger number men stem conference exhibited greater levels cognitive physiological vigilance reported lower sense belonging less desire participate conference however women watched video showing roughly equal number men women stem conference exhibited less vigilance reported heightened sense belonging greater desire participate conference mens vigilance sense belonging desire participate conference unaffected watching either video role model shared stigmatized identity eg female students female professor role model also shown similar positive example study explored effects roma nonroma role model roma children presenting roma children known role model ethnic group shown increase academic achievement reduce stereotype threat opposed presenting children role models different ethnic groups similarly research found exposed female role model help reduce identity threat women experience exposed information biases women face even though majority work done stem contexts similar work done context workplace instance study found black professionals presented information showing organization higher number black employees felt greater sense trust belonging organization compared black professionals presented information showing organization small number black however cues effective must reasonably reflect actual percentage individuals hold stigmatized identity within given context study found whenever racial ethnic minorities perceive organization falsely inflating percent employees hold stigmatized identity racial ethnic minorities report increased concerns belonging performance expressing environmental cues features environment reduce identity threat communicating inclusive norms values typically cues include background objects eg posters items table counterstereotypic imagery eg rainbow flag gym predominantly frequented heterosexual men studies exploring impact environmental cues belonging stem members marginalized groups found strong evidence power environmental cues influence ones sense belonging concerns discrimination example study found changing objects computer science classroom objects considered stereotypical computer science eg star trek poster video games nonstereotypical objects eg nature poster phone books increased female stem majors sense belonging interest computer science reducing associations computer science masculine different domain presence genderinclusive bathrooms associated greater perceived fairness within workplace positive perceptions workplace climate women racial ethnic minorities increased perceptions workplace presence environmental cues also associated differences academic outcomes well example study randomly assigned male female students give persuasive speech virtualreality classroom photograph male world leader female world leader room featured either photograph male world leader picture male students gave speeches longer rated better female students speeches however presence female leader photographs increased female students speaking time speeches rated higher quality similar study american indian high school students randomly assigned see stereotypic american indian imagery classroom eg chief wahoo cleveland indians less likely mention academic achievement asked imagined future american indian students saw image counterstereotypic poster american indian woman front another form identity safety cues shown promise providing members stigmatized groups information reduces importance relevance negative stereotypes conveys nonbiased expectations andor conveys positive climate members stigmatized majority work done academic contexts order reduce impact stereotype example prominent study explored stereotype threat among female students could reduced telling class prior administrations math exam take revealed gender differences performance students informed taking gender fair math exam female students performed equally well male students taking however female students told exam shown produce gender differences female students performed worse male students similarly telling women differences womens mens leadership abilities shown eliminate gender gaps leadership however studies found merely providing identity safe information alone sometimes enough reduce stereotype threat identity example one study women presented text explaining stereotypes gender differences responsible academic performance gaps men women asked complete math task found women presented information stereotype threat gender differences academic outcomes performed significantly worse math task recently information expectations discrimination lack thereof also explored identity safety cue example study murrar colleagues explored impact informing university students peers endorsed positive diversity related values cared strongly inclusion university classrooms typically behaved nondiscriminatory presented information caused students regardless background evaluate classroom climate positively report positive attitudes toward members stigmatized groups students stigmatized groups reported greater sense belonging better selfreported physical health similar study black women informed presence nonblack female ally reported increased sense belonging much research identity safety cues came early attempts mitigate detrimental effects stereotype instance one first studies use known identity safety cue explored impact telling female students gender differences math exam ie presenting identity safe large portion current research identity safety cues continues explore ways reduce educational disparities members stigmatized groups members stigmatized another major focus identity safety cue research methods successfully increase belonging retention members stigmatized groups within example study explored impact different philosophies intelligence female employees expectations stereotyped workplace organizational consulting company displayed belief intelligence abilities malleable mission statement website compared belief intelligence fixed women trusted company expected stereotyped less however gender representation within company affect womens trust company similarly study found latina women felt greater trust belonging interest fictional stem company learning latinx scientist employee white scientist regardless gender recently study explored whether presence employees pronouns employee biography acted identitysafety cue sexual gender inclusion pronouns resulted positive organizational attitudes among gender sexual minority participants increased perceptions coworker allyship regardless whether disclosure pronouns required optional organization majority research identity safety cues done either academic workplace contexts recent push explore effectiveness cues healthcare contexts see help address disparities health outcomes members stigmatized groups members nonstigmatized groups example recent study explored impact minority representation cues communicating organizational diversity philosophies black latinx participants perceptions physicians racial biases cultural competence general expectations visit physician physicians diversity statements influence participants anticipated quality visit informed physician diverse clientele increased greater anticipated comfort perceptions receiving better treatment black latinx similarly another recent study researchers explored minority representation cues physicians diversity statements might influence sexual minorities perceptions physician bias cultural competence anticipated comfort expectations comfort disclosing sexuality visiting physician diversity statement minority representation cues reduced perceptions physician bias minority representation cues increased perceptions physician culturally competent increased anticipated comfort quality led greater comfort disclosing related work also done fathers medical contexts instance study found prenatal doctors offices environmental safety cues eg pictures fathers babies increased expectant fathers comfort attending prenatal appointments led greater parenting confidence comfort increased intentions learn pregnancy greater intentions engage healthy habits aid partner eg avoiding smoking alcohol partners httpsenwikipediaorgwikiidentitysafetycues
