use system future treat currently incurable diseases altering genome altogether another way modify human genome involves analyzing human embryos identify genes associated disease selecting embryos desired genetic makeup called pgd preimplantation genetic diagnosis ivf vitro fertilization often used obtain embryos evaluation genome alternatively oocytes screened prior fertilization technique first used pgd used primarily select embryos implantationwhen possible genetic defects allowing mutated diseaserelated alleles identified excluded selection especially useful one parents carry heritable genetic disease pgd also used select embryos certain sex useful avoid sexlinked genetic disorders like hemophilia common males infants born traits selected pgd sometimes considered designer one application pgd selection savior siblings children born provide transplant organ group cells sibling usually lifethreatening disease savior siblings conceived ivf screened using pgd analyze genetic similarity child needing transplant order reduce risk rejection embryos pgd obtained ivf procedures oocyte artificially fertilized sperm oocytes woman harvested following controlled ovarian hyper stimulation coh involves fertility treatments induce production multiple oocytes harvesting oocytes fertilized vitro either incubation multiple sperm cells culture via intracytoplasmic sperm injection icsi sperm directly injected tests include amniocentesis ultrasounds preimplantation genetic diagnostic tests tests quite common reliable talk today however past first introduced resulting embryos usually cultured days allowing reach blastomere blastocyst stage embryos reach desired stage development cells biopsied genetically screened screening procedure varies based nature disorder investigated polymerase chain reaction pcr process dna sequences amplified produce many copies segment allowing screening large samples identification specific genes process often used screening monogenic disorders cystic fibrosis another screening technique fluorescent situ hybridization fish uses fluorescent probes specifically bind highly complementary sequences chromosomes identified
