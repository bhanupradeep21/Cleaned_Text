altyn dala conservation initiative adci longstanding collaborative partnership national international ngos government kazakhstan dedicated safeguarding restoring diverse steppe desert wetland ecosystems kazakhstan benefit wildlife people geographically focus parts historical range saiga antelope still reoccupiable main goal adci preserve restore fully functional ecosystems order achieve initiative supports creation cohesive network conservation areas covering priority wilderness areas promoting ecological corridors effective areabased conservation measures oecms larger scale ensure full ecological connectivity cover areas sufficient size protect grow populations threatened species biodiversity enable natural movement migrations lost wildlife species restored suitable habitats still existing depleted species receive better protection valuing interests local people living adci area close wildlife guiding principle initiative adci aims gaining support nature conservation environmental education awareness raising also giving opportunity receiving tangible benefits thriving wildlife underpinned high quality science monitoring get data knowledge needed guide

recognised united nations one world restoration flagships first award kind banner decade ecosystem restoration situated central asia altyn dala conservation initiatives focal areas dominated extensive grasslands interspersed pockets shrubs low woodlands transitioning semidesert desert ecosystems southern part kazakhstan habitat provides wide range wildlife including numerous species mammals birds reptiles insects climate continental hot summers winters extremely cold reaching little precipitation decreasing north south trees shrubs exist along rivers depressions sandy soil water available grasses herbs dwarf shrubs still produce lot biomass decomposed winter due low temperatures therefore herbivoric animals play key role nutrient cycle feeding plant material returning nutrients back soil focal theme initiative therefore protection conservation iconic steppe fauna saiga antelope saiga tatarica flagship species region largest remaining herbivore distinctive large nose extensive migrations saiga antelope emblematic steppe vastness harsh climate like saiga kulans equus hemionus asiatic wild asses iconic steppe species living nomadic herds perfectly adapted life harsh environment growing thicker coat hair winter keep warm moving long distances suitable habitats became extinct kazakhstan first half century przewalski horse equus przewalskii rare endangered wild horse originally native steppes central asia previously extinct wild reintroduced native habitat mongolia well several locations central asia eastern europe april memorandum cooperation signed forestry wildlife committee kazakh ministry ecology natural resources prague zoo begin plans reintroduce przewalski horse kazakh steppe within framework altyn dala conservation initiative steppe predators include species like pallas cat otocolobus manul distinctive expressive face excellent camouflage steppe wolf canis lupus campestris preys upon saiga antelope small mammals corsac fox vulpes corsac historically critically endangered asiatic cheetah acinonyx jubatus venaticus inhabited southern desert regions kazakhstan uncontrolled hunting cheetahs prey well severe winters contributed population decline today asiatic cheetah classified extinct kazakhstan steppe grasslands also provide essential habitat variety bird species many migratory depend region crucial stopover long migrations grasslands support breeding populations globally threatened sociable lapwing vanellus gregarius steppe eagle aquila nipalensis well endangered whiteheaded duck oxyura leucocephala demoiselle crane grus virgo flora kazakh steppe equally important diverse grasslands home rich assemblage herbaceous plants including feather grasses stipa spp fescues festuca spp sagebrush artemisia

steppe blooms veritable carpet colour featuring rare endemic species wild tulip kaufmanniana tulip greig tulip well irises alliums poppies wetland ecosystems also integral component region ecology
