explanations describing emergence traits avoids adaptationist fallacy assumes traits emerge adaptively favoured natural conceptually two components b eg two proteins interact performs function system depend interaction b functionality interaction may randomly arisen individual ability disappear without effect fitness present yet currently unnecessary interaction therefore called excess capacity system mutation may occur compromises ability perform function independently however ab interaction already emerged sustains capacity perform initial function therefore emergence ab interaction presuppresses deleterious nature mutation making neutral change genome capable spreading population via random genetic drift hence gained dependency interaction case loss b ab interaction would negative effect fitness purifying selection would eliminate individuals occurs steps individually reversible example may regain capacity function independently ab interaction may lost random sequence mutations tends reduce capacity function independently random walk dependency space may well result configuration return functional independence far unlikely occur making cne onedirectional
