amphicyon extinct genus large carnivorans belonging family amphicyonidae known colloquially beardogs subfamily amphicyoninae miocene epoch members family received vernacular name possessing bearlike doglike features ranged north america europe asia africa note dated back may french geologist alexandre leymerie wrote letter april requested french palaeontologist édouard lartet provided details exploits palaeontological sites french department gers particular commune sansan lartet described finds fossil taxons found within sites including mastodonte species assigned later reclassified

hoploaceratherium palaeotherium referred equid species known belonging anchitherine anchitherium also recalled finding fossil deer species said largest ones size extant deer france smallest ones size small antelope palaeontologist noted peaceful ruminants coexisted formidable large carnivore provisionally named amphicyon based two halfjaws bones sent museum described unilobed incisors compressed canines similar raccoons also carnivorous molar first two tubercles conforming dogs lartet stated genuss distinct trait existence third tubercle upper jaw known carnivore genus name appears derived ancient greek terms ἀμφί sides κύων dog lartet define genuss despite initial status genus name amphicyon nonpermanent french anatomist henri marie ducrotay de blainville peer lartet regularly discussed fossil findings sketched mammal skeletons fossils recognized species amphicyon major amphicyon lartet reviewed fossil carnivoran genera sansan among amphicyon reconfirmed carnivorous mammal

extant bateared fox known canis megalotis belonging species amphicyon major palaeontologist described also anatomy plantigrade locomotion similar extant bears differences form blainville mentioned speculating must long strong tail species amphicyon minor reclassified separate genus hemicyon described carnivore larger european wolf closer form dog amphicyon dentition similar mustelids also described newer genus pseudocyon misidentified digitigrade described smaller amphicyon coming closest canids based dentition bones three genera lartet said canines retained finely serrated edges

possessed powerful skull long snout high sagittal crests canines robust posterior molars enlarged whereas anterior premolars reduced neck wide similar postcranial skeleton stout robust massive powerful limbs mobile shoulder joints well flexible wrists upper limb bones comparatively long comparison lower ones possess adaption towards cursoriality posture similar plantigrade taxa ursids digitgrade ones like felids claws retractable amphicyon also rather flexible back heavy tail estimated possessed many caudal vertebrae may long rest diet amphicyon proven difficult reconstruct dentition possesses crushing shearing functions proposed basis dental wear patterns morphology european species genus bonecrushing one study argued longiramus hypercarnivorous relative grinding area lower molars similar carnivorous canids whereas another suggested north american species genus dental microwear analysis major recovers diet species mesocarnivorous similar red foxes consuming meat well plants hard items presumably included another dental microwear analysis also supports omnivorous diet giganteus whose dentition possesses high number large pits several small pits notes clearly differs bonecrushing taxa anterior premolars posterior molars reduced olisiponensis may hypercarnivorous european lacked adaptations rapid acceleration amphicyon seems hunted quite unlike lions tigers approach prey closely overtaking quick burst speed however even modern pursuit predators wolves stalk ambush prey likely amphicyon proposed pursued prey longer distances speed notably slower modern wolves catching victim likely able immobilize powerful forelimbs postscapular fossa indicates welldeveloped subscapularis minor muscle fixes shoulder joint prevents head humerus dislocated struggles prey animal trying break free anatomy humerus also supports showcases presence strong pronator teres muscle thereby pronation forearm powerful flexors digits wrists integral preygrasping ability extant bears big cats indeed trochlea humeral condyle shallower tiger suggesting pronationsupination forearms might even greater large felids although likely lacked ability cats retract claws small infraorbital foramina indicates lacked welldeveloped vibrissae cats provides sensory information needed place precise killing bite therefore may killed prey tearing open preys ribcage thylacines biting neck sever major blood vessels like modern predators likely target preys abdomen wounds area kill quickly elongation distal limb segments similar solitary tiger social lion amphicyon likely solitary well due comparatively slow maximum speed lack rapid acceleration unlikely amphicyon preyed cursorial ungulates however proposed pursuit capabilities suited chase mediportal ungulates merycoidodontids specimen rhinoceros prosantorhinus douvillei discovered bitemarks corresponding giganteus although remains unclear result active predation merely scavenging bitemarks referred species olisiponensis found metapodial belonging large anthracothere brachyodus bite traces various mammalian long bones early miocene czechia also attributed amphicyon patterned bones immediate benefit feeding likely represent evidence active strong sexual dimorphism present variety species known eutope north america males considerably larger females although size difference present many amphicyonids strongly developed amphicyon cynelos males furthermore possess slightly longer robust snouts larger canines immense sagittal crests comparison strongly sexually dimorphic carnivorans suggests amphicyon polygynous territorial males competing females mating season may contributed size increase observed within footprints assigned ichnotaxon hirpexipes alfi discovered californian
