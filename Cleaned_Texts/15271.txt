slightly smaller holotype also housed collection museo municipal de lamarque argentina complements holotype several elements mainly lower arm hand largest dromaeosaur discovered southern hemisphere novas et al estimated austroraptor measured ft length head gregory paul later estimated length ft weight kg however thomas r holtz jr suggested weight comparable lion around kg skull low elongated much dromaeosaurs measures cm austroraptor conical nonserrated teeth novas et al compared spinosaurids based enamel surface teeth austroraptor shares trait unique adasaurus descending process lacrimal bones curves anteriorly large austroraptor bizarre morphology pedal phalanges strangely disproportionate phalanx twice width phalanx nearly three times expected width based similarly sized members taxonomic family suggested researchers holotype specimen paleontological chimera however uncertainty affinity taxon chimera hypothesis several austroraptors skull bones bear resemblance smaller troodontids front limbs austroraptor short dromaeosaur humerus less half length femur among dromaeosauridae genus tianyuraptor zhenyuanlong mahakala similarly reduced relative length arms caused austroraptor compared another famous shortarmed dinosaur tyrannosaurus though close relationship two however little entire skeleton found bones available analysis possess distinct characteristics differentiate austroraptor dromaeosaurs austroraptor particularly notable relatively short forearms much shorter proportion compared majority members dromaeosauridae according novas et al austroraptor distinguished based following comparison second specimen showed fourth toe especially broad purported second phalanx fact first cladistic analysis holotype specimens anatomical features describers placed austroraptor within subfamily unenlagiinae dromaeosauridae assignment based characteristics observed bones skull teeth geometry formation specimens vertebral elements determined austroraptor close relative unenlagiine dromaeosaur buitreraptor shares certain derived characteristics neck following cladogram based phylogenetic analysis conducted turner makovicky norell showing relationships austroraptor among genera assigned taxon rahonavis buitreraptor austroraptor unenlagia cau et al published phylogenetic analysis dromaeosauridae description halszkaraptor members unenlagiinae classified austroraptor buitreraptor unenlagia comahuensis unenlagia paynemili neuquenraptor description hesperornithoides many paravian groups examined inclusion new genus analysis austroraptor found basal member austroraptor buitreraptor pyroraptor pamparaptor rahonavis ornithodesmus dakotaraptor unenlagia brum colleagues classified ypupiara sister taxon halszkaraptorinae buitreraptor neuquenraptor unenlagia comahuensis unenlagia paynemili austroraptor ypupiara suggested unenlagiines better capacities running pursuit predation dromaeosaurids laurasian dromaeosaurids eudromaeosauria stocky shorter legs active predatory lifestyle unenlagiines could likely maintain high speeds extended amounts time gracile unenlagiines modified metatarsals resemble microraptorines relatively thin lengthened based adaptations likely unenlagiines preyed small fast animals although exact animals unknown buitreraptor features particular traits attributed specific hunting models buitreraptor propose hunted traveling large distances pursuit prey may explain longlegged trait shared various genera unenlagiidae buitreraptor characterized long forelimbs hands likely relied restrain prey curved claw second pedal digit would injured killed victim buitreraptor probably swallowed prey whole due lack serrated teeth fleshtearing capabilities teeth functioned simply hold model proposed much larger austroraptor teeth austroraptor conical lacking denticles similarly since probably subarctometatarsal condition similar hindlimb lengths compared buitreraptor austroraptor likely welldeveloped cursorial brum colleagues suggested unenlagiines austroraptor sister taxon ypupiara likely consumed fish considerable part diet possibly even main food source based nonserrated conical teeth similar piscivorous tetrapods including gavialoids spinosaurids anhanguerids holotype specimen found terrestrial sediments deposited stage late cretaceous thomas r holtz jr estimated austroraptor lived million million years ago end mesozoic austroraptor shared paleoenvironment allen formation diverse dinosaurs early discovery austroraptor increases understanding ecological morphological diversity among unenlagiines demonstrating members subfamily included giant shortarmed small longarmed members suggesting end cretaceous large coelurosaurs became common decreasing dominance genus represents earliest record gondwanan dromaeosaurids supports fact large dromaeosaurids took role large predators alongside abelisaurids quilmesaurus aucasaurus description pellegrinisaurus salgado suggested large titanosaurs theropods inhabited interior environments region contemporaneous hadrosaurids titanosaur aeolosaurus inhabited coastal diversity among titanosaurs indicates allen formation environments supported great range herbivorous contemporaneous paleofauna includes titanosaurs laplatasaurus rocasaurus saltasaurus bird hadrosaurids bonapartesaurus kelumapusaura
