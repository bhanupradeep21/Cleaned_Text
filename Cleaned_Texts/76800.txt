fertilized embryos fail implant time although unknown whether rate corresponds inherently low human implantation rates natural conception altered physiological implant suffer early pregnancy loss sixth week lmp womans last menstrual period additional miscarry result even without use birth control zygotes never result established pregnancies much less birth intention woman prevent pregnancy important factor whether act contraception seen abortive antiabortion groups hormonal contraceptives possible effect preventing implantation blastocyst discussed previously use drugs intention
