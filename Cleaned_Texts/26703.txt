number visible signs important clinical features pachydermia thickening wrinkling skin furrowing face scalp periostosis swelling periarticular tissue shaggy periosteal new bone formation long bones digital clubbing enlargement features include excessive sweating arthralgia gastrointestinal overview symptoms provided table table overview signs locally acting mediator prostaglandin plays role pathogenesis pdp patients high levels decreased levels pgem metabolite mimic activity osteoblasts osteoclasts respectively building breaking bone tissue acroosteolysis periosteal bone formation explained action furthermore vasodilatory effects consistent prolonged local vasodilation digital elevated levels pdp patients associated mutations hpgd gene patients showed typical pdp symptoms digital clubbing hpgd gene mapped chromosome encodes enzyme hpgd enzyme catalyzes first step degradation related far eight different mutations known leading dysfunctional hpgd enzyme pdp due mutations binding substrate hpgd result transferred pgem remain present high concentrationscitation needed apart elevated levels studies patients hypertrophic osteoarthropathy also showed increased plasma levels several mediators von willebrand factor vascular endothelial growth factor substances could also role pdp progression contrast hpgd mutations suspected mutations factors reported yetcitation needed von willebrand factor marker platelet endothelial suggests activation endothelial cells platelets play important role pathogenesis vegf promotes angiogenesis growth new blood vessels differentiation osteoblasts explain clubbing excessive fibroblast formation pdp mediators found increased concentrations pdp patients include osteocalcin bthromboglobulin plateletderived growth factor pdgf epidermal growth factor described yet role mediators pdp two genes associated condition hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase hpgd chromosome solute carrier organic anion transporter family member chromosome syndrome occurs copies either gene mutated autosomal recessive inheritancecitation needed easiest way diagnose pdp pachydermia finger clubbing periostosis long bones new bone formation periosteum detected radiographs long order diagnose pdp often diseases must excluded example exclude secondary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy signs cardiovascular pulmonary hepatic intestinal mediastinal diseases must mri ultrasound also characterictic skin biopsy another way diagnose pdp however specific method diseases share skin alterations pdp myxedema order exclude diseases hormonal studies done example thyrotropin growth hormone levels examined exclude thyroid acropachy however skin biopsy helps diagnose pdp patients without skin clubbing observed helpful check whether acroosteolysis distal phalanges fingers present useful diagnose pdp combination clubbing acroosteolysis found pdp cheney since elevated levels correlated pdp urinary useful biomarker additionally hpgd mutation analyses relatively cheap simple may prove useful early investigation patients unexplained clubbing children presenting pdplike features early positive results prevent expensive longtime tests identifying followup pdp disease activity bone formation markers tap bap bgp carbodyterminal propeptide type procallagen ntx play important biomarkers considered receptor activator nfκb ligand rankl associated increased bone resorption patients however investigation needed confirm use disease may also raised patients lung cancer finger may related raised levels enzyme involved metabolism similar association noted cystic pdp one two types hypertrophic osteoarthropathy represents approximately total hypertrophic osteoarthropathy form secondary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy sho sho usually underlying disease cardiopulmonary diseases malignancies paraneoplastic syndrome unlike sho pdp underlying disease pdp divided three categories cause differentiating pathologies still effective treatment pdp currently unknown due lack controlled data largely based case although hpgd enzyme likely involved pathogenesis pdp strategies mutation reported yet since hard tackle defective enzyme gene therapy could solution although reported yet literaturecitation needed conventional pdp drug treatment decrease inflammation pain includes nsaids drugs used pdp patients target bone formation skin surgical care used improve cosmetic nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids corticosteroids used pdp drugs inhibit cyclooxygenase activity thereby prostaglandin since likely involved periosteal bone formation acroosteolysis drugs alleviate polyarthritis associated addition nsaids corticosteroids decrease formation inflammatory mediators reducing inflammation case possible gastropathy selective nsaid etorixocib infliximab reduce pain arthritis pdp monoclonal antibody blocks biological action tnfα tumor necrosis factoralpha tnfα inflammatory cytokine found high levels pdp involved production inflammatory mediators increase expression rankl rankl thought increase bone rheumatologic symptoms improved treatment bisphosphonates pamidronate risedronate bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption therefore reduce bone remodeling alleviate painful isolated cases tamoxifen effective pdp treatment especially bone joint pain pdp patients high levels nuclear receptors found steroids rationale use tamoxifen estrogen receptor tamoxifen several metabolites competitively bind estrogen receptors tissue targets producing nuclear complex decreases dna synthesis cells accumulated vitro studies showed tamoxifen acts estrogen agonist bone inhibits resorbing activity osteoclasts disruption bone retinoids used improve skin retinoids act retinoid nuclear receptors thus regulate example isotretinoin effective drug treat acne improves cosmetic features inducing apoptosis within human sebaceous result increase connective tissue hyperplasia sebaceous glands retinoids also decrease procollagen mrna fibroblasts improving like retinoids colchicines also improve skin able bind ends microtubules prevent elongation microtubules involved cell division signal transduction regulation gene expression colchicine inhibit cell division inflammatory processes eg action neutrophils suggested colchicine inhibit chemotactic activity leukocytes leads reduction use botulinum toxin type btxa improved leonine facies patients btxa inhibits release acetylcholine acting neuromuscular junction furthermore blocks cholinergic transmission sweat glands therefore inhibits sweat secretion however exact mechanism improving leonine faces unknown needs aside drug treatments many surgical methods improve facial appearance one facelift technically known facial rhytidectomy method type cosmetic surgery procedure used give youthful appearance involves removal excess facial skin tightening skin face second option plastic also used eye age onset often described cases high affected individuals suffering disease prior age however latosbielenska et al stated percentage lower also another form osteoarthropathy familial idiopathic osteoarthropathy fio taken account pdp usually progresses years becomes life expectancy may normal despite patients getting many functional cosmetic complications including restricted motion neurologic manifestations leonine pdp rare genetic least cases pdp precise incidence prevalence pdp still prevalence suggested jajic et pdp occurs frequently men women ratio around moreover men suffer severe symptoms see table african american people affected higher table distribution different forms pdp among reported affected men women men cases patients familial history suggested incomplete form complete form inherited different ways either autosomal dominant inheritance involving dominant allele autosomal recessive inheritance involving recessive autosomal dominant model inheritance penetrance variable expression confirmed half
