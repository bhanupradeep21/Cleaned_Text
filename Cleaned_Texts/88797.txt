megakaryocytes two proposed mechanisms platelet release one scenario protoplatelet processes break explosively become possible visualize spontaneous release platelets using holotomographic livecell imaging alternatively cell may form platelet ribbons blood vessels ribbons formed via pseudopodia able continuously emit platelets circulation either scenario protoplatelet processes give rise new
