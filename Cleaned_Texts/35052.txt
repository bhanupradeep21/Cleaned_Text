hexing extinct genus basal ornithomimosaur dinosaur known early cretaceous northeastern china contains single species hexing qingyi early twentyfirst century local farmer xiaobeigou liaoning discovered skeleton small theropod prepared fossil trying enhance value restoring damaged bones adding fake parts eventually specimen obtained geological museum jilin university expertly prepared process added parts type species hexing qingyi named described jin liyong chen jun pascal godefroit generic name means like crane chinese specific name means slender holotype found fluvial deposits lower yixian formation highest possible age million years lowest million years thus date time early valanginian early barremian stage consists partial skeleton containing skull lower jaws series five cervical vertebrae shoulder girdle majority forelimbs hindlimbs remains well preserved specimen represents subadult adult holotype specimen consists remains small individual vertebral column absent body length directly determined comparison made previously smallest known ornithomimosaur metres long shenzhousaurus thighbone length millimetres femur length hexing millimetres small body size among

dentary remains three four low conical teeth visible damage obscures detail dentary small opening side surface higher back lower jaw seems show much larger opening artefact caused original inexpert

spines pneumatised large triangular diapophyses shoulder blade elongated narrow without expanded upper end humerus somewhat shorter shoulder blade slender shaft twisted bones lower arm likewise elegant straight large part ten centimetres long hand preserved shows configuration fundamentally different related species describers carefully checked whether could caused falsifications original preparation could find sign tampering result identification respective parts highly problematical preserved hand shows three rows elements first two bones second third four bones would represent phalanges metacarpals series three four five elements however first third row bone missing authors considered likely first finger upper phalanx completely reduced naturally absent however would imply claw attached directly metacarpal metacarpal would exceptionally long allowed alternative possibility visible element first phalanx metacarpal lacking incompleteness fossil third finger number phalanges seemed almost certainly reduced four three place two normal short upper phalanges taken single long element description situation complicated fact describers follow hypothesis xu xing tetanurae including birds hexing first second third fingers actually second third fourth would standard terminology make formula phalanges alternatively following hypothesis xu general phalanges slender elongated hand claws relatively large curved flatter thighbone strongly curved convex anterior end tibia millimetres long thus elongated compared femur juvenile ornithomimid specimens
