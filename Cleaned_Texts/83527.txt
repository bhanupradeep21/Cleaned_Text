aquatic majority meat cooked eating traditional dishes crudos steak tartare mett kibbeh nayyeh sushisashimi raw oysters carpaccio delicacies call uncooked meat risk disease ingesting pathogens found raw meat significantly higher cooked meat although contaminated meat incorrectly insufficiently cooked allowing diseasecarrying pathogens ingested also meat contaminated production process time slicing prepared meats crosscontamination food refrigerator situations lead greater risk every year united states estimated million cases foodborne diseases diagnosed resulting hospitalizations according multistate study published america journal preventative medicine annual cost disease caused foodborne pathogens estimated anywhere billion dollars medical costs productivity losses diseases come contact contaminated raw meat although vehicles transmission becoming frequent due global sources diseasecausing pathogens include limited lettuce sprouts fruit juices vegetables raw milk water however main source disease caused microbial pathogens usually raw type pathogen present varies depending type meat many diseasecarrying pathogens found raw meats differ according source whether mammalian poultry seafood diseasecarrying pathogens found beef salmonellas escherichia coli shigella staphylococcus aureus listeria different varieties salmonellas often found contaminated seafood
