phytotechnology ancient greek φυτο phyto plant τεχνολογία technología τέχνη téchnē art skill craft λογία logía study implements solutions scientific engineering problems form plants distinct ecotechnology biotechnology fields encompass use study ecosystems living beings respectively current study field mostly directed contaminate removal phytoremediation storage phytosequestration accumulation see hyperaccumulators plantbased technologies become alternatives traditional cleanup procedures low capital costs high success rates low maintenance requirements enduse value aesthetic nature phytotechnology application plants engineering science problems phytotechnology uses ecosystem services provide specifically engineered solution problem ecosystem services broadly defined fall four broad categories provisioning ie production food water regulating ie control climate disease supporting ie nutrient cycles crop pollination cultural ie spiritual recreational benefits many times one ecosystem services maximized design space instance constructed wetland may attempt maximize cooling properties system treat water wastewater treatment facility introduction river designed benefit reduction water temperature river system constructed wetland provides habitat food wildlife well walking trails recreation phytotechnology focused abilities plants remove pollutants environment technologies green roofs green walls bioswales generally considered phytotechnology taking broad view even parks landscaping could viewed phytotechnology however little consensus definition phytotechnology even within field phytotechnology technical regulatory guidance decision trees revised defines phytotechnology phytotechnologies set technologies using plants remediate contain contaminants soil groundwater surface water sediments united nations environment programme defines phytotechnology application science engineering study problems provide solutions involving plants third definition department environmental engineering indonesia gives technology based application plants solar driven living technology improving environmental sanitation conservation problems phytotechnology naturally existing properties plants used accomplish defined outcomes ecosystem services designed environment phytotechnologic system uses properties broadly degradationuse chemicals environment transport storage water change output system mechanisms evolved since beginning angiosperms mya become quite effective diversity plants also gives versatility phytotechnologic system plants native environment capable handle many applications nonnatives specific projects hyperaccumulators heavy metal removal ancillary benefits factor community use education use tax credits habitat creation increased sustainability aesthetics benefits phytotechnology cost system also lower compared traditional remediation technologies many cases without pumping systems electricity costs infrastructure costs even initial investment higher cases notably green roofs costs lifetime project less plants tolerate certain conditions much pollution water salt variables kill plants system water solubility pollutants affects system plants also mechanisms halt uptake substances may remove contaminate completely acceptable time frame length time project must completed another limiting factor many phytotechnologies take least two years longer reach maturity could designed legacy projects lifespans may years temperate climates systems may become inactive much less active winter months may usable arctic environments many physiological properties plants used phytotechnology mechanisms work synergistically achieve goals set project phytosequestration ability plants sequester certain contaminants root zone accomplished several plants physiological mechanisms phytochemicals extruded root zone immobilize precipitation target contaminant transport proteins associated root
