tissue symptoms include pain weight bearing frequently short time nature pain varies widely among individuals people experience shooting pain affecting contiguous halves two toes others describe

resulting loss supporting ligamentous structure aesthetic concerns patients possible though unquantified longterm implications foot structure health alternatively making incision ventral side sole foot allows direct access affected nerve without cutting structures however approach requires greater postoperative recovery time patient must avoid weightbearing affected foot ventral aspect foot
