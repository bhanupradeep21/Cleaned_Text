military groupings average achieved mark moreover dunbar noted groups almost always physically close might expect upper limit group size depend degree social dispersal dispersed societies individuals meet less often thus less familiar group sizes smaller consequence thus group would occur absolute intense environmental economic pressures dunbar grooming gossip evolution language proposes furthermore language may arisen cheap means social grooming allowing early humans maintain social cohesion efficiently without language dunbar speculates humans would expend nearly half time social grooming would made productive cooperative effort nearly impossible language may allowed societies remain cohesive reducing need physical social result confirmed mathematical formulation social brain
