forms horizontally flat paddlelike plate top rear depending age crests covered nearly entire skull roof others shorter narrower researchers suggest used pushing may strong enough notable features relatively small head unusually long lower arms beak upper jaw wider hadrosaurs apart brachylophosaurus typical hadrosaur reached adult length least metres gregory paul estimated maximum length metres

skull much wider rear lower edges top surface resulting trapeziumshaped profile posterior view several socalled mummies provide information soft tissues brachylophosaurus mummies actually consist natural casts formed moulds stone matrix surrounding skeleton preserving outline body showing skin imprints best studied mummy leonardo specimen cast surface covered imprints generally surface close bones could caused desiccation burial compressive action covering sediment exception region around right shoulder shows profile six centimetres thick muscles leonardo also indicates base neck heavily muscled soft tissue upper neck profile placed elevated position running much higher usually reconstructed drawings tended follow curvature vertebral column filling much bend front back snout remains
