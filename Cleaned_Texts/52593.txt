challenge hypothesis outlines dynamic relationship testosterone aggression mating contexts proposes testosterone promotes aggression would beneficial reproduction mate guarding strategies designed prevent encroachment intrasexual positive correlation reproductive aggression testosterone levels seen strongest times social challenge hypothesis predicts seasonal patterns testosterone levels

somehow increases aggressive response mating estradiol type non gonadal estrogen seems play key role regulating aggressive behavior nonmating season several species birds previously noted many bird species nonmating season low testosterone levels yet still manage display aggression primary example washington state song sparrow bird shows fairly high levels aggression nonmating season despite low
