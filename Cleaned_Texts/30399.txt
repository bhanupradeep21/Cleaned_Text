cryotherapy sometimes known cold therapy local general use low temperatures medical therapy cryotherapy may used treat variety tissue prominent use term refers surgical treatment specifically known cryosurgery cryoablation cryosurgery application extremely low temperatures destroy abnormal diseased tissue used commonly treat skin conditions cryotherapy used effort relieve muscle pain sprains swelling soft tissue damage surgery decades commonly used accelerate recovery athletes exercise cryotherapy decreases temperature tissue surfaces minimize hypoxic cell death edema accumulation muscle spasms minimising ultimately alleviates discomfort involve range treatments application ice packs immersion ice baths generally known cold therapy use cold chambers two types cryochamber differ mechanisms action use partialbody cryotherapy pbc makes use liquid nitrogen lower temperature chamber used individual tubeshaped enclosure covers persons body open top keep head room contrast

developed japanese rheumatologist toshima introduced europe us australia types cryochamber decrease skin temperature wbc reaches lower temperatures pbc might considered body subjected extreme cooling blood vessels narrowed reduces blood flow areas swelling outside cryogenic chamber vessels expand increased presence antiinflammatory proteins established treatment typically involves exposing individual freezing dry temperatures minutes one proponents say cryotherapy may reduce pain inflammation help mental disorders support exercise recovery improve joint function cryotherapy chambers belong group equipment associated sports rehabilitation wellness cryosurgery application extreme cold destroy abnormal diseased tissue application ultracold liquid causes damage treated tissue due intracellular ice formation degree damage depends upon minimum temperature achieved rate cryosurgery used treat number diseases disorders especially skin conditions like warts moles skin tags solar keratoses liquid nitrogen usually used freeze tissues cellular level procedure used often relatively easy quick done doctors surgery deemed quite low risk cancerous lesion suspected excision rather cryosurgery may deemed contraindications use cryosurgery include limited using neoplasm someone conditions worsened exposure cold ie raynaud urticaria poor circulation sensation precautions using cryosurgery include someone collagen vascular disease darkskinned individuals due high risk hypopigmentation impaired sensation area ice pack therapy treatment cold temperatures injured area body though therapy extensively used agreed alleviates symptoms testing produced conflicting results efficacy possibility producing undesirable ice pack placed injured area intended absorb heat closed traumatic edematous injury using conduction transfer thermal energy physiologic effects cold application include immediate vasoconstriction reflexive vasodilation decreased local metabolism enzymatic activity decreased oxygen demand cold decreases muscle spindle fiber activity slows nerve conduction velocity therefore often used decrease spasticity muscle guarding commonly used alleviate pain minor injuries well decrease muscle soreness use ice packs treatment decreases blood flow rapidly beginning cooling occurs result vasoconstriction initial reflex sympathetic activity although use cryotherapy shown aid muscle recovery studies highlighted degree muscle cooling humans significant enough produce considerable effect muscle recovery based previous research comparing human animal models insufficient degree cooling due larger limb size adipose tissue higher muscle diameter ice commonly used prior rehabilitation performance known adverse effects performance decreased myotatic reflex force production well decrease balance immediately following ice pack therapy however ice pack therapy applied less minutes performance occur without detrimental effects ice pack removed time athletes sent back training competition directly decrease ice also shown possibly slow impair muscle protein synthesis repair recreational athletes especially true cold water immersion equivalent controlled studies done see effects hold true ice packs regardless ice shown studies inhibit uptake dietary protein postmuscle conditioning exercisecitation needed although many positive effects cryotherapy athletes shortterm recovery recent years much controversy regarding whether cryotherapy actually beneficial may causing opposite effect inflammation occurs postinjury damaging exercise may detrimental secondary tissue beneficial structural functional repair damaged tissue therefore researchers recommending ice used delay natural healing process following injury original rice rest ice compression elevation method rescinded inflammatory response necessary healing process practice may delay healing instead facilitating animal studies also show disrupted inflammatory stage healing may lead impaired tissue repair redundant collagen study concludes cryotherapy positive impact shortterm recovery athletes cryotherapy helped manage muscle soreness facilitate recovery within first hours following sportrelated activity athletes use cryotherapy within first hours alleviate pain recovered faster rate athletes use cryotherapy sportrelated postsurgical management following total knee replacement surgery may include cryotherapy goal helping pain management blood loss following cryotherapy applied using ice cold water gel packs sometimes specialized devices surround skin surgical site keeps surgical site evidence clinical trials regarding effectiveness cryotherapy weak use cryotherapy may weak evidence indicates cryotherapy used postoperatively may associated small decrease blood loss pain following surgery clinically significant improvements range motion reported many side effects adverse effects reported addition use cryosurgery several types cold aerosol sprays used shortterm pain relief unlike cold modalities produce similar physiological effects due fact decreases skin temperature muscle temperature reflexively inhibits underling muscle using evaporation cool ordinary spray cans containing tetrafluoroethane dimethyl ether similar substances used numb skin prior possibly place local anesthetic injections prior needles small incisions sutures products containing chloroethane used ease sports injuries similar ice pack therapy cold aerosol spray could also used relieve trigger points improve range motion applying cold spray one stretch muscle improved mobility decrease pain however shortterm effect pain relief improved range motion wear within increasing amount research done effects wholebody cryotherapy wbc exercise beauty health research often inconsistent usage different types cryochambers different treatment periods however becomes increasingly clear wbc positive effect muscle soreness decreases recovery time older papers show inconsistencies cryotherapy also increasingly used nondrug treatment rheumatoid arthritis stress anxiety chronic pain multiple sclerosis studies diseases alzheimers migraines ongoing although evidence becomes available positive effects whole body cryotherapy fda points effects whole body cryotherapy lacks evidence researched cryotherapy treatment involves exposing individuals extremely cold dry air two four minutes yet three four minute exposure wbc different one two minute exposure beneficial expose shorter amount time increase therapeutic benefits longer durations negative effects thermal sensation tissue oxygenation blood volume also amount sessions important part healing process one session exhibit significant effects minimum twenty sessions required thirty sessions recommended
