biomedicine also referred western medicine mainstream medicine conventional branch medical science applies biological physiological principles clinical practice biomedicine stresses standardized evidencebased treatment validated biological research treatment administered via formally trained doctors nurses licensed biomedicine also relate many categories health biological related fields dominant system medicine western world includes many biomedical disciplines areas specialty typically contain bio prefix molecular biology biochemistry biotechnology cell biology embryology nanobiotechnology biological engineering laboratory medical biology cytogenetics genetics gene therapy bioinformatics biostatistics systems biology neuroscience microbiology virology immunology parasitology physiology pathology anatomy toxicology many others generally concern life sciences applied medicine biomedicine cornerstone modern health care laboratory diagnostics concerns wide range

reflects norms values molecular biology process synthesis regulation cells dna rna protein molecular biology consists different techniques including polymerase chain reaction gel electrophoresis macromolecule blotting manipulate dnacitation needed polymerase chain reaction done placing mixture desired dna dna polymerase primers nucleotide bases machine machine heats cools various temperatures break hydrogen bonds binding dna allows nucleotide bases added onto two dna templates gel electrophoresis technique used identify similar dna two unknown samples dna process done first preparing agarose gel jellylike sheet wells dna poured electric current applied dna negatively charged due phosphate groups attracted positive electrode different rows dna move different speeds dna pieces larger others thus two dna samples show similar pattern gel electrophoresis one tell dna samples macromolecule blotting process performed gel electrophoresis alkaline solution prepared container sponge placed solution agarose gel placed top sponge next nitrocellulose paper placed top agarose gel paper towels added top nitrocellulose paper apply pressure alkaline solution drawn upwards towards paper towel process dna denatures alkaline solution carried upwards nitrocellulose paper paper placed plastic bag filled solution full dna fragments called probe found desired sample dna probes anneal complementary dna bands already found nitrocellulose sample afterwards probes washed ones present ones annealed complementary dna paper next paper stuck onto x ray film radioactivity probes creates black bands film called autoradiograph result similar patterns dna probe present film allows us compare similar dna sequences multiple dna samples overall process results precise reading similarities similar different dna biochemistry science chemical processes takes place within living organisms living organisms need essential elements survive among carbon hydrogen nitrogen oxygen calcium phosphorus elements make four macromolecules living organisms need survive carbohydrates lipids proteins nucleic carbohydrates made carbon hydrogen oxygen energystoring molecules simplest carbohydrate glucose used cellular respiration produce atp adenosine triphosphate supplies cells energy proteins chains amino acids function among things contract skeletal muscle catalysts transport molecules storage molecules protein catalysts facilitate biochemical processes lowering activation energy reaction hemoglobins also proteins carrying oxygen organisms lipids also known fats small molecules
