many animals able navigate using sun compass orientation cues position sun sky combined indication time animals internal clock evidence animals navigate using celestial cues position sun since sun apparently moves sky navigation means also requires internal clock many animals depend clock maintain circadian animals use sun compass orientation fish birds sea turtles butterflies bees sandhoppers reptiles sun compass orientation using suns position sky directional azimuth used along sun compass orientation help animals navigate suns azimuth defined direction celestial object observer expressed angular distance north south point horizon point vertical circle passing object intersects horizon sun compass orientation used daily guide animals including sea turtles use sun migratory guide turtles use sun azimuth compensation schedule order find specific breeding locations sandhoppers use sun daily determine home lays experiment group sandhoppers subjected six hours artificial lights movements monitored exposed normal sunlight sandhoppers orientation finally exposed normal sunlight showed orientation degrees respect home study helped show artificial light alter species relationship sun throw species basic directional abilities terms high elevations sun compass decreases precision providing information animals study performed see dung beetles respond better orientations provided sun compass skylight compass results study showed dung beetles use original bearings ie sun compass majority time rarely use skylight fish larva find safety coral reefs predators particular coral reef one larva larva recognize area smell sound direction particular reef fish larvae drift away reef swim order relocate reef use sun compass one tools different cues learned remembered fish larva allows return reef also concluded learning process happens fish larvae young location memorized become second nature useful tool helps fish larva return respective desert ants use sun compass reference amount walking distance specific destination ants like bees compensate sun daily movements moves rotates earth communicate ants already base directions direction go addition sun compass insects ants also use tool called azimuthal position sun additional cues determined ants passed ants sandhoppers talitrus saltator also called sand fleas small shrimplike crustaceans live beaches taken beach easily find way back sea experiment described lockley showed simply moving downhill towards sight sound sea group sandhoppers acclimatised daynight cycle artificial lighting whose timing gradually changed hours phase natural cycle sandhoppers placed beach natural sunlight moved roughly correct direction sea beach experiment implied sandhoppers use sun internal clock determine heading learnt actual direction sea particular lockleys experiments manx shearwaters puffinus puffinus showed released clear sky far nests skokholm seabirds first oriented flew direct line skokholm making journey rapidly example one birds released boston airport arrived skokholm days later lockley calculated birds flew hours per day must travelled miles per hour full normal speed could deviated significantly straight line course searched random destination birds behaved like regardless whether direct heading took birds sea land sky overcast time release shearwaters flew around circles lost returned slowly lockley therefore concluded essential birds moment release sun visible day stars night lockley claim understand birds knew position relative destination merely observed behaved know study demonstrated monarch butterflies use sun compass guide southwesterly autumn migration canada mexico migrating butterflies captured held cycles hours light dark one groups light began day groups began hours earlier monarchs held captivity days released flight cage natural daylight conditions allowed fly direction wanted go keeping test arena butterflies biological clocks set natural fall cycle lights turned tried fly southwest whose clocks shifted hours earlier oriented degrees toward ability birds tune compensation mechanisms well true changes sun azimuth suggests respective processes preprogrammed learning generating sun azimuthtimedirection function reflects true sun azimuth curve closely suggests birds record sun direction rather short intervals store information together information time memory study performed testing sun compass orientation pigeons showed animals must compensate movement sun internal clocks sun azimuth plays important role azimuth allows birds tell time day ultimately determine direction go reasons migration possible sources animals sun form visual stimulus used tool navigation seen birds bees animal orient body certain angle relation sun time day external stimuli activates portion brain necessary navigation allows organism adjust orientation relation sun say animal leaves nest morning sun low sky plans head known direction animal travel certain direction sun position related body eg travel west sun could animals right side navigation form navigation simple observing stimulus acting accordingly studies shown animals may use tricks like length direction shadows determine sun time shifts calculate direction travel example tropic cancer sun always south zenith highest point short shadows point animals tend incorporate several types navigation techniques like magnetic orientation landmarks repertoire order perform normal navigation migrate animals use sun compass orientation must compensate apparent movement sun
