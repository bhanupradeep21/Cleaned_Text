important scholars younger lynn medievalist specializing history science magic older ashley english professor noted authority shakespeare harvard interested animals learn ethology worked william james afterwards became interested animal man study devoted edwards thesis sometimes thought essential document modern comparative psychology upon graduation thorndike returned initial interest educational psychology completed phd columbia university supervision james mckeen cattell one founding fathers psychometrics year unhappy initial employment college women case western reserve cleveland ohio became instructor psychology teachers college columbia university remained rest career studying human learning education mental testing thorndike became second president psychometric society following footsteps louis leon thurstone established society journal psychometrika previous year august wed elizabeth moulton four children among frances became early stages career purchased wide tract land hudson encouraged researchers settle around soon colony formed tribal thorndike pioneer behaviorism studying learning also using animals clinical thorndike able create theory learning based research doctoral dissertation animal intelligence experimental study associative processes animals first psychology subjects thorndike interested whether animals could learn tasks imitation test thorndike created puzzle boxes puzzle boxes approximately inches long inches wide inches box door pulled open weight attached string ran pulley attached string attached door led lever button inside animal pressed bar pulled lever string attached door would cause weight lift door thorndikes puzzle boxes arranged animal would required perform certain response pulling lever pushing button measured amount time took animal performed desired response allowed escape also given reward usually thorndike primarily used cats puzzle boxes cats put cages would wander restlessly meow know eventually cats would step switch floor chance door would see cats could learn observation observe animals escaping would compare times got observe others escaping found difference rate thorndike saw results animals observed improvement even placed animals paws correct levers buttons failures led fall back trial error explanation found accidentally stepping switch would press switch faster succeeding trial inside puzzle observing recording animals escapes escape times thorndike able graph times took animals trial escape resulting learning animals difficulty escaping first eventually caught escaped faster faster successive puzzle box trial eventually leveled quickened rate escape results sshape learning curve learning curve also suggested different species learned way different research puzzle boxes thorndike able create theory learning puzzle box experiments motivated part thorndikes dislike statements animals made use extraordinary faculties insight problem solving first place books give us psychology rather eulogy animals animal intelligence never animal thorndike meant distinguish clearly whether cats escaping puzzle boxes using insight thorndikes instruments answering question learning curves revealed plotting time took animal escape box time box reasoned animals showing insight time escape would suddenly drop negligible period would also shown learning curve abrupt drop animals using ordinary method trial error would show gradual curves finding cats consistently showed gradual learning thorndike put testing expertise work united states army world war participating development army beta test used evaluate illiterate unschooled nonenglish speaking recruits thorndike believed instruction pursue specified socially useful goals thorndike believed ability learn decline age rate percent per year thorndike also stated law effect says behaviors followed good consequences likely repeated future thorndike identified three main areas intellectual development first abstract intelligence ability process understand different concepts second mechanical intelligence ability handle physical objects lastly social intelligence ability handle human thorndikes research focused instrumental learning means learning developed organism something example placed cat inside wooden box cat would use various methods trying get nothing would work hit lever afterwards thorndike tried placing cat inside wooden box time cat able hit lever quickly succeeded getting box first thorndike emphasized importance dissatisfaction stemming failure equal reward satisfaction success though experiments trials humans came conclude reward much effective motivator punishment also emphasized satisfaction must come immediately success lesson would sink thorndike proponent eugenics argued selective breeding alter mans capacity learn keep sane cherish justice happy certain economical way improve mans environment improve thorndikes law effect puzzle box methodology subjected detailed criticism behaviorists many criticisms law effect mostly cover four aspects theory implied retroactive working effect philosophical implication law identification effective conditions cause learning comprehensive usefulness thorndikes educational psychology began trend toward behavioral psychology sought use empirical evidence scientific approach problem solving thorndike among first psychologists combine learning theory psychometrics applied research schoolrelated subjects form psychology education one influences education seen ideas mass marketing tests textbooks time thorndike opposed idea learning reflect nature main thought developmental scientists time instead thought schooling improve upon nature unlike many psychologist time thorndike took statistical approach education later years collecting qualitative information intended help teachers educators deal practical educational thorndikes theory association theory many time believed association stimulus response solidified reward confirmation also thought motivation important factor law effect introduced relation reinforcers punishers although thorndikes description relation reinforcers punishers incomplete work area would later become catalyst research bf thorndikes law effect states responses produce desired effect likely occur whereas responses produce unpleasant effect less likely occur terms desired effect unpleasant effect eventually became known reinforcers thorndikes contributions behavioral psychology society seen influences classroom particular focus praising ignoring behaviors praise used classroom encourage support occurrence desired behavior used classroom praise shown increase correct responses appropriate planned ignoring used decrease weaken eliminate occurrence target planned ignoring accomplished removing reinforcer maintaining behavior example teacher pay attention whining behavior student allows student realize whining succeed gaining attention unlike later behaviorists john watson placed strong emphasis impact environmental influences thorndike believed differences parental behavior men women due biological rather cultural conceding society could complicate deform believed inborn differences believed researchers keep environment boys girls absolutely similar instincts would produce sure important differences mental moral activities boys indeed watson overtly critiqued idea maternal instincts humans report observations firsttime mothers struggling breastfeed watson argued behaviors thorndike referred resulting nursing instinct stemming unreasoning tendencies pet coddle performed difficulty new mothers thus must learned instinctive factors practically thorndikes beliefs inborn differences thoughts behavior men women included outdated arguments role women society example along nursing instinct thorndike talked instinct submission mastery arguing men typically physically larger women women general thus original nature submissive men although opinions lack substantiating evidence beliefs commonplace era many cases served justify prejudice women academia including entrance doctoral programs

psychologists psychologists studying conditioned reflex behavioral psychologists studied thorndikes research starting thorndike contemporary john b watson ivan pavlov however unlike watson thorndike introduced concept thorndike first apply psychological principles area learning research led many theories laws learning theory learning especially law effect often considered greatest thorndike addressed early theory learning claimed research forced denounce law exercise completely found practice alone strengthen association time alone weaken also got rid half law effect finding satisfying state affairs strengthens association punishment effective modifying placed great emphasis consequences behavior setting foundation learned work represents transition school functionalism behaviorism enabled psychology focus learning thorndikes work would eventually major influence bf skinner clark hull skinner like thorndike put animals boxes observed see able learn learning theories thorndike pavlov later synthesized clark work motivation attitude formation directly affected studies human nature well social thorndikes research drove comparative psychology fifty years influenced countless
