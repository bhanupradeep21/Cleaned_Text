cetacean intelligence overall intelligence derived cognitive ability aquatic mammals belonging infraorder cetacea cetaceans including baleen whales porpoises dolphins brain size previously considered major indicator intelligence animal however many factors also affect intelligence recent discoveries concerning bird intelligence called question influence brain since brain used maintaining bodily functions greater ratios brain body mass may increase amount brain mass available complex cognitive allometric analysis indicates general mammalian brain size scales approximately exponent body comparison actual brain size size expected allometry provides encephalization quotient eq used accurate indicator animals intelligence spindle cells neurons without extensive branching discovered brains humpback whale fin whale sperm whale bottlenose dolphins rissos dolphins beluga humans great apes elephants species well known high intelligence others known spindle spindle neurons appear play central role development intelligent behavior discovery may suggest convergent evolution elephant brains also show complexity similar dolphin brains also convoluted cortex thicker generally agreed growth neocortex absolutely relative rest brain human evolution responsible evolution human intelligence however defined complex neocortex usually indicates high intelligence exceptions example echidna highly developed brain yet widely considered though preliminary investigations intelligence suggest echidnas capable advanced cognitive tasks previously shown first time species dolphin longfinned pilot whale neocortical neurons mammal studied date including unlike terrestrial mammals dolphin brains contain paralimbic lobe may possibly used sensory processing dolphin voluntary breather even sleep result veterinary anaesthesia dolphins would result ridgway reports eegs show alternating hemispheric asymmetry slow waves sleep occasional sleeplike waves result interpreted mean dolphins sleep one hemisphere brain time possibly control voluntary respiration system vigilant predators dolphins greater dependence sound processing evident structure brain neural area devoted visual imaging onetenth human brain area devoted acoustical imaging times sensory experiments suggest great degree crossmodal integration processing shapes echolocative visual areas brain evolution encephalization cetaceans similar though general trend evolutionary history increased brain mass body mass encephalization quotient lineages actually underwent decephalization although selective pressures caused still among cetaceans odontoceti tend higher encephalization quotients mysticeti least partially due fact mysticeti much larger body masses without compensating increase brain far selective pressures drove encephalization decephalization cetacean brains current research espouses main theories promising suggests cetacean brain size complexity increased support complex social could also driven changes diet emergence echolocation increase territorial research shows dolphins among animals understand concepts numerical continuity though necessarily dolphins may able discriminate several researchers observing animals ability learn set formation tend rank dolphins level elephants show dolphins surpass highly intelligent animals problem survey studies showed learning set formation dolphins rank highly high dolphin group sizes vary quite dramatically river dolphins usually congregate fairly small groups number species singly pairs individuals small groups

things producing stable underwater toroidal aircore vortex rings bubble two main methods bubble ring production rapid puffing burst air water allowing rise surface forming ring swimming repeatedly circle stopping inject air helical vortex currents thus formed dolphin often examine creation visually sonar also appear enjoy biting vortexrings created burst many separate normal bubbles rise quickly certain whales also known produce bubble rings bubble nets purpose foraging many dolphin species also play riding waves whether natural waves near shoreline method akin human bodysurfing

alongside resident fish eating orca whales limited amounts timecitation needed dolphins also known aid human swimmers need least one instance distressed dolphin approached human divers seeking aside exhibited ability learn complex tricks dolphins also demonstrated ability produce creative responses studied karen pryor sea life park hawaii published creative porpoise training novel behavior two test subjects two roughtoothed dolphins steno bredanensis named malia regular show performer sea life park hou research subject adjacent oceanic institute experiment tested whether dolphins would identify rewarded fish originality behavior successful however since two dolphins involved experiment study difficult generalize starting dolphin named malia method experiment choose particular behavior exhibited day reward display behavior throughout days session start new day malia would present prior days behavior new behavior exhibited reward given behaviors exhibited least time known behaviors dolphins approximately two weeks malia apparently exhausted normal behaviors began repeat performances according pryor dolphin became almost despondent however sixteenth session without novel behavior researchers presented flip never seen related pryor new display instead offering offered tail swipe wed never seen reinforced began offering us kinds behavior hadnt seen mad flurry finally could hardly choose throw fish second test subject hou took thirtythree sessions reach stage occasion experiment stopped variability dolphin behavior became complex make positive reinforcement meaningful experiment repeated humans took volunteers length time figure asked initial period frustration anger humans realised rewarded novel behavior dolphins realisation produced excitement novel behaviors humans mostly produced captive orcas displayed responses indicating get bored activities instance paul spong worked orca skana researched visual skills however performing favorably trials per day skana suddenly began consistently getting every answer wrong spong concluded fish enough motivation began playing music seemed provide skana much motivationcitation needed institute marine mammal studies mississippi also observed resident dolphins seem show awareness future dolphins trained keep tank clean retrieving rubbish bringing keeper rewarded fish however one dolphin named kelly apparently learned way get fish hoarding rubbish rock bottom pool bringing one small piece scientists observed wild bottlenose dolphins shark bay western australia using basic tool searching food sea floor many dolphins seen tearing pieces sponge wrapping around rostra presumably prevent abrasions facilitate whale song sounds made whales used different kinds communication dolphins emit two distinct kinds acoustic signals called whistles clicks strong evidence specific whistles called signature whistles used dolphins identify andor call dolphins observed emitting specimens signature
