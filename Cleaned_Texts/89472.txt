august friedrich leopold weismann frs honfrse lld january november german evolutionary biologist fellow german ernst mayr ranked second notable evolutionary theorist century charles darwin weismann became director zoological institute first professor zoology freiburg main contribution involved germ plasm theory one time also known according inheritance multicellular animal takes place means germ gametes egg cells sperm cells cells function agents heredity effect oneway germ cells produce somatic cells affected anything somatic cells learn therefore ability individual acquires life genetic information pass soma germ plasm next generation biologists refer concept weismann idea true rules inheritance acquired characteristics proposed jeanbaptiste however careful reading weismanns work span entire career shows nuanced views insisting like darwin variable environment necessary cause variation hereditary idea weismann barrier central modern synthesis early century though scholars express today terms weismanns opinion largely random process mutation must occur gametes stem cells make source change natural selection work weismann became one first biologists deny lamarckism weismanns ideas preceded rediscovery gregor mendels work though weismann cagey accepting mendelism younger workers soon made connection weismann much admired today ernst mayr judged important evolutionary thinker darwin evolutionary synthesis around one great biologists weismann born son high school teacher johann jean konrad weismann graduate ancient languages theology wife elise née

zoological institute albert ludwig university freiburg breisgau retired earlier work largely concerned purely zoological investigations one earliest works dealing development diptera microscopical work however became impossible owing impaired eyesight turned attention wider problems biological married mary dorothea gruber son julius weismann composer beginning weismanns preoccupation evolutionary theory grappling christian creationism possible alternative work über die berechtigung der darwinschen theorie justification darwinian theory compared creationism evolutionary theory concluded many biological facts seamlessly accommodated within evolutionary theory remain puzzling considered result acts creation work weismann accepted evolution fact par fundamental assumptions astronomy eg heliocentrism weismanns position towards mechanism inheritance role evolution changed life three periods distinguished weismanns work demarcation germline soma scarcely appreciated without considering work mostly german biologists second half century time mechanisms cell division began understood eduard strasburger walther flemming heinrich von waldeyer belgian edouard van beneden laid basis cytology cytogenetics century strasburger outstanding botanical physiologist century coined terms nucleoplasm cytoplasm said new cell nuclei arise division cell nuclei van beneden discovered chromosomes combined meiosis production gametes discovered named chromatin walther flemming founder cytogenetics named mitosis pronounced omnis nucleus e nucleo means strasburgers dictum discovery mitosis meiosis chromosomes regarded one important scientific discoveries one important discoveries cell meiosis discovered described first time sea urchin eggs oscar hertwig described level chromosomes van beneden ascaris eggs significance meiosis reproduction inheritance however first described weismann noted two cell divisions necessary transform one diploid cell four haploid cells number chromosomes maintained thus work earlier cytologists laid ground weismann turned mind consequences evolution aspect cytologists took place work mendel rediscovered weismann started believing like many century scientists among charles darwin observed variability individuals one species due inheritance sports darwins term believed written transmutation species directly due influence environment also wrote every variation regarded reaction organism external conditions deviation inherited line development follows evolution occur without change environment close modern use concept changes environment mediate selective pressures population leading evolutionary change weismann also used classic lamarckian metaphor use disuse organ weismanns first rejection inheritance acquired traits lecture titled inheritance über die vererbung treatise creation vs evolution attempts explain individual examples either theory instance existence nonreproductive castes ants workers soldiers explained inheritance acquired characters germ plasm theory hand effortlessly weismann used theory explain lamarks original examples use disuse tendency degenerate wings stronger feet domesticated waterfowl weismann worked embryology sea urchin eggs course observed different kinds cell division namely equatorial division reductional division terms coined äquatorialteilung reduktionsteilung respectively germ plasm theory states multicellular organisms consist germ cells containing heritable information somatic cells carry ordinary bodily functions germ cells influenced neither environmental influences learning morphological changes happen lifetime organism information lost generation concept proposed referred weismannism day example book examination weismannism george idea illuminated explained rediscovery gregor mendels work early years century see mendelian inheritance idea germline cells contain information passes generation unaffected experience independent somatic body cells came referred weismann barrier frequently quoted putting final end theory lamarck inheritance acquired characteristics lamarck claimed inheritance characteristics acquired effort weismann conducted experiment removing tails white mice repeatedly generations reporting mice born consequence without tail even shorter tail stated young produced five generations artificially mutilated parents yet single example rudimentary tail abnormality weismann aware limitations experiment made clear embarked experiment precisely time many claims animals inheriting mutilations refers claim regarding cat lost tail numerous tailless offspring also claims jews born without foreskins none claims said backed reliable evidence parent fact mutilated leaving perfectly plausible possibility modified offspring result mutated gene purpose experiment lay claims inherited mutilation rest results consistent weismanns germ plasm theory awarded linnean society londons darwinwallace medal
