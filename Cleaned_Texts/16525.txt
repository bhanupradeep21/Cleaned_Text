kin recognition also called kin detection organisms ability distinguish close genetic kin nonkin evolutionary biology psychology ability presumed evolved inbreeding though animals typically avoid additional adaptive function sometimes posited kin recognition role kin selection debate since strict theoretical terms kin recognition necessary kin selection cooperation associated rather social behaviour emerge kin selection demographic conditions viscous populations organisms interacting natal context without active kin discrimination since social participants default typically share recent common origin since kin selection theory emerged much research produced investigating possible role kin recognition mechanisms mediating altruism taken whole research suggests active powers recognition play negligible role mediating social cooperation relative less elaborate cuebased contextbased mechanisms familiarity imprinting phenotype matching cuebased recognition predominates social mammals outcomes nondeterministic relation actual genetic kinship instead outcomes simply reliably correlate genetic kinship organisms typical conditions wellknown human example inbreeding avoidance mechanism westermarck effect unrelated individuals happen spend childhood household find sexually unattractive similarly due cuebased mechanisms mediate social bonding cooperation unrelated individuals grow together way also likely demonstrate strong social emotional ties enduring altruism english evolutionary biologist w hamiltons theory inclusive fitness related theory kin selection formalized explain evolution social behaviours hamiltons early papers well giving mathematical account selection pressure discussed possible implications behavioural manifestations hamilton considered potential roles cuebased mechanisms mediating altruism versus positive powers kin discrimination selective advantage makes behaviour conditional right sense discrimination factors correlate relationship individual concerned therefore obvious may instance respect certain social action performed towards neighbours indiscriminately individual breaking even terms inclusive fitness could learn recognise neighbours really close relatives could devote beneficial actions alone advantage inclusive fitness would appear thus mutation causing discriminatory behaviour benefits inclusive fitness would selected fact individual may need perform discrimination sophisticated suggest difference generosity behaviour according whether situations evoking encountered near far home might occasion advantage similar kind two possibilities altruism mediated via passive situation via sophisticated discrimination stimulated generation researchers look evidence sophisticated kin discrimination however hamilton later developed thinking consider innate kin recognition adaptation unlikely play role mediating altruistic behaviours expect anything describable innate kin recognition adaptation used social behaviour mating reasons already given hypothetical case treeshamilton implication inclusive fitness criterion met mediating mechanisms cooperative behaviour context locationbased clarified recent work west et al original papers inclusive fitness theory hamilton pointed sufficiently high relatedness favour altruistic behaviours could accrue two discrimination limited dispersal hamilton huge theoretical literature possible role limited dispersal reviewed platt bever west et al well experimental evolution tests models diggle et al griffin et al k√ºmmerli et al however despite still sometimes claimed kin selection requires kin discrimination oates wilson silk furthermore large number authors appear implicitly explicitly assumed kin discrimination mechanism altruistic behaviours directed towards relatives huge industry papers reinventing limited dispersal explanation cooperation mistakes areas seem stem incorrect assumption kin selection indirect fitness benefits require kin discrimination misconception despite fact hamilton pointed potential role limited dispersal earliest papers inclusive fitness theory hamilton hamilton hamilton hamilton west et al p recent review debates around kin recognition role wider debates interpret inclusive fitness theory including compatibility ethnographic data human kinship see holland leading inclusive fitness theorists alan grafen argued whole research program around kin recognition somewhat misguided animals really recognise kin way different way recognise mates neighbours organisms objects certainly animals use recognition systems recognise offspring siblings parents extent way recognise mates neighbours feel unhelpful say kin recognition system grafen others cast similar doubts enterprise fact animals benefit engaging spatially mediated behaviors evidence animals recognize kin support conclusion spatially based differential behaviors represent kin recognition mechanism see also discussions blaustein waldman halpin words evolutionary perspective may well advantageous kin aggregate individuals behave preferentially towards nearby kin whether behaviour result kin

species well within species study bierdrzycki et al shows root secretions necessary arabidopsis thaliana recognize kin vs strangers necessary recognize self vs nonself roots study performed using

another mechanism recently proposed involves competition light kin recognition takes place leaves study crepy casal conducted multiple experiments different accessions thaliana experiments showed arabidopsis accessions distinct rfr blue light signatures signatures detected photoreceptors allows plant recognize neighbor relative nonrelative much known pathway arabidopsis uses associate light

downstream photoreceptors performing similar experiments using knockout mutants mechanism leads altered leaf direction prevent shading related neighbors reduce competition mice inbreed close relatives natural habitat significant detrimental effect progeny since inbreeding detrimental tends avoided many species house mouse major urinary protein mup gene cluster provides highly polymorphic scent signal genetic identity appears underlie kin recognition inbreeding avoidance thus fewer matings mice sharing mup haplotypes would expected random another mechanism avoiding inbreeding evident female house mouse mates multiple males case appears eggdriven sperm selection sperm related toads male advertisement vocalizations may serve cues females recognize kin thus avoid dioecious plants stigma may receive pollen several different potential donors multiple pollen tubes different donors grow stigma reach ovary receiving maternal plant may carry pollen selection favoring pollen less related donor thus kin recognition level pollen tube apparently leads postpollination selection avoid inbreeding depression also seeds may aborted selectively depending httpsenwikipediaorgwikikinrecognition
