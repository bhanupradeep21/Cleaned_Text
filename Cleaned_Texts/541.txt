pediatrictype follicular lymphoma ptfl disease malignant bcells ie lymphocyte subtype originating bone marrow accumulate overcrowd cause expansion lymphoid follicles thereby enlargement lymph nodes head neck less commonly groin armpit disease accounts lymphomas occur pediatric age initially ptfl found children adolescents termed pediatric follicular lymphoma recently however disease found occur also lead world health organization rename disorder pediatrictype follicular disease also referred pediatrictype nodular follicular time world health organization also recognized ptfl clinical entity distinct follicular lymphoma disorders previously classified reclassification based fundamental differences two ptfl differs follicular lymphoma clinical manifestations pathophysiology including genomic alterations ie chromosome abnormalities gene mutations occur diseases malignant cells clinical course relative last point ptfl often presents histologically highgrade malignancy unlike small percentage follicular lymphoma cases similarly present high grade malignancy almost invariably takes indolent relapsing remitting course without progressing aggressive incurable recognition ptfl distinct disease separate follicular lymphoma critical avoid mistaking aggressive lymphoma requires potentially toxic chemotherapy appears particularly case ptfl occurs children adolescents perhaps young significant percentage cases diagnosed ptfl regarded large bcell lymphoma rearrangements rare disease provisionally defined world health organization distinctly separate ptfl described based recently formulated important distinction ptfl occurs male male female ratio children adolescents ages years median age less frequently young adults ages years occasionally older cases diseases diagnosed early stage ie stage ii localized one two adjacent lymph node historically ptfl described commonly presenting swollen lymph nodes andor tonsils head neck less commonly swollen lymph nodes axillary andor inguinal andor rarely swollen lymph nodes abdomen andor infiltrations malignant cells testes bone marrow andor central nervous however many latter rare cases well cases exhibit tonsil involvement regarded world health organization due provisional entity termed large bcell lymphoma rearrangement diseases folliculartype large bcell lymphoma also afflicts children adolescents young adults otherwise distinguished ptfl lack strong predominance males common occurrence extranodal sites histology clinical course genomic alterations carried malignant bcells particularly hallmark translocation interferon regulatory factor gene also termed melanoma associated antigen mutated gene short ie p arm chromosome position near igh immunoglobulin heavy locus long ie q arm chromosome position acquired genomic abnormality forces overexpression interferon regulatory factor excluding cases regarded large bcell lymphomas rearrangement ptfl presents almost exclusively enlargement lymph nodes head neck axilla ptfl proliferation clone ie group genetically identical cells share common ancestry bcells act nonphysiologically invading disrupting structure function lymphoid tissues cell

individuals disease alterations thought promote survival malignant cells inhibiting programmed cell death blocking maturation increasing ability evade immune system andor creating conditions favorable development genomic alterations promalignancy effects common chromosome deletion deletion occurs ptfl cases alteration deletion q arm chromosome position results lose gene encodes tumor necrosis

cells lack translocation characteristic malignant cells follicular lymphoma small percentage cases still overexpress gene product consequence translocation exact cause overexpression following lymphocyte disorders may confused distinguished ptfl based following points virtually cases ptfl even treated minimal interventions surgical removal watchandwait approach relatively benign sometimes remitting relapsing course thus past recommendations patients need evaluated bone marrow biopsy lumbar puncture invasive andor expensive procedures requires revaluation evaluation therapeutic regimens used treat ptfl complicated purely retrospective nature inclusion cases retrospect likely cases large bcell lymphoma event many cases treated chemotherapeutic regimens principally chop ie cyclophosphamide hydroxydaunorubicin vincristine prednisone rchop ie chop plus others likely excluded large bcell lymphoma rearrangement treated surgical removal localized radiation therapy andor watchandwait treatments yielded pediatric patients overall survival rates relapse rates observed variable observation periods years among group pediatric patients treated surgical resection alone followed observation patients surviving one adults ptfl treated vigorously regimens consisting immunochemotherapy eg rchop andor radiation therapy vigorous approach used distinction ptfl aggressive follicular lymphoma clear adults younger thus current recommendations treatment pediatric ptfl patients watchandwait following radiation therapy complete surgical resection cases surgical resection incomplete immunechemotherapy added recommended treatment adults ptfl less clear currently used regimens rely immunochemotherapy might change issue discriminating ptfl follicular lymphoma
