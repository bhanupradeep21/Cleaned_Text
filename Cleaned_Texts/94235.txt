automatic controlled processes acp two categories cognitive processing cognitive processes fall one two categories amounts processing power attention effort process requires primary factor used determine whether controlled automatic process automatic process capable occurring without need attention awareness initiation operation process without drawing upon general processing resources interfering concurrent thought put simply automatic process unintentional involuntary effortless consumptive limited processing capacity occurring outside awareness controlled processes defined process flexible intentional control individual individual consciously aware effortful constrained amount attentional resources available examining label automatic social psychology find processes intended others require recent conscious intentional processing related information automatic processes complicated people may examples automatic processes include motor skills implicit biases procedural tasks tasks listed done without need conscious attention said automatic effects fall three classes occur prior conscious awareness preconscious require form conscious processing produce unintended outcome postconscious require specific type intentional goal directed processing goaldependent preconscious automaticity requires triggering proximal stimulus event occur prior absence conscious awareness occur without conscious awareness unnoticeable uncontrollable nearly effortless postconscious automaticity depends recent conscious experience postconscious influence processing defined nonconscious consequences conscious conscious experience may intentional may unintentional important material things aware driven environment one intend control flood perceptual experiences yet still result postconscious effects words need consciously engage something depending experience unconsciously think behave certain way classic bobo doll experiment child watches video adult acting aggressive towards bobo doll later child put room doll child likely also engage act versus children didnt watch video study participants primed stereotype professors told imagine typical professor min list conscious act behaviors lifestyle appearance attributes typical primed perform general knowledge task results participants professor condition outperformed control conditions primed goaldependent automaticity concerns skill thought processes require goal engage process much similar postconscious requires conscious awareness initiated guided outside awareness unconscious mind good example would driving car order drive car one needs consciously goal drive somewhere engaged driving enough practice one operate car almost entirely without conscious however attentional control decision making needed introduced novel reference situations like driving unfamiliar town process needs learned enough automatic requiring little conscious thought one definition controlled process intentionallyinitiated sequence cognitive words attention required task consciously aware control controlled processes require us think situations evaluate make decisions example would reading article required read understand concepts processes takes effort think conceptually controlled processes thought slower since definition require effortful control therefore generally conducted simultaneously controlled processes without taskswitching impaired performance drawback controlled processes humans thought limited capacity overtly controlling behavior tightly capacitylimited controlled processing imposes considerable limitations speed ability divided attention divided attention ability switch tasks tasks easier perform tasks like talking holding conversation however becomes difficult traffic increases need focus driving talking forster lavie found ability focus task influenced processing capacity perceptual processing capacity amount incoming information person process handle one time perceptual load difficult task low load task one think less task involved high load task one needs devote focus task become distracted wont able accomplish task study participants randomly assigned two conditions one requiring one task small cognitive load one requiring two tasks heavy cognitive load onetask condition participants told would hear anti proabortion speech would diagnose speakers attitude toward abortion twotask condition first assignment required switch spots speaker take place even specifically told would given instructions next step cognitive load affected study participants twotask condition performed poorly onetask condition simply next task mind extra cognitive load basically tasks someone tries manage time performance suffer actions utilize combination automatic controlled processes one example brushing teeth point could think tooth individually scrub part action another example playing musical instrument learning fingers placed play certain notes longer think fingers controlled process engaged thinking dynamics intonation processes even start controlled become automatic cognitive processes difficult categorize distinctly automatic controlled either contain components types process phenomena difficult define observe example former driving car example latter flow process breathing automatic controlled easily observed flow described involving highly focused attention task hand loss selfconsciousness distorted time perception among cognitive characteristics people report flow states less aware autonomic responses hunger fatigue discomfort researchers hypothesize challenging tasks counterintuitively require less effort flow difficult study however difficult produce controlled laboratory setting experiments relied heavily correlating presence flow various attributes task subjects reported experiences correlations subjects experiencing flow generally report perceive good match task requirements skills eg professional basketball player professional basketball game task structure clarity goal task also thought related flow aspects flow imply must opportunity suppress controlled processes well inhibit certain types automatic processes study involving video game performance showed flow participants determined based selfreport survey flow characteristics strongly correlated performance game related study attempted inhibit induce flow biasing moods participants experimenters found flow could inhibited negative mood could induced positive person need told pay attention stimulus captures attention quickly many cases explicitly directing ones anothers attention necessary due presence another stimulus easily captures attention case flow however action would normally grab ones attention ignored many automatic processes either suppressed stimulusdriven attention changes ignored discomfort hand situations autonomy encroached upon example individual must always control hisher actions abide rules imposed task thought inhibit implies another requirement flow free constraints force controlled processes used additionally several areas research indicate state flow otherwisecontrolled process becomes automatic
