epiploic appendagitis ea uncommon benign selflimiting inflammatory process epiploic appendices older terms process include appendicitis epiploica appendagitis terms used less order avoid confusion acute appendicitis epiploic appendices small fatfilled sacs fingerlike projections along surface upper lower colon rectum may become acutely inflamed result torsion twisting venous thrombosis inflammation causes pain often described sharp stabbing located left right central regions abdomen sometimes nausea vomiting symptoms may mimic acute appendicitis diverticulitis cholecystitis pain characteristically intense duringafter defecation micturition espec sigmoid type due effect traction pedicle lesion caused straining emptying bowel bladder initial lab studies usually normal ea usually diagnosed incidentally ct scan performed exclude serious conditions although selflimiting epiploic appendagitis cause severe pain discomfort usually thought best treated antiinflammatory
