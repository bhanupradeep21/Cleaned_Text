long arm human chromosome erbb family consists four individual plasma membranebound receptor tyrosine kinases one members neuregulinbinding lacks kinase domain four contain extracellular ligand binding domain transmembrane domain intracellular domain interact multitude signaling molecules exhibit liganddependent ligandindependent activity notably ligands yet heterodimerise three receptors considered preferred dimerisation partner erbb dimerisation results autophosphorylation tyrosine residues within cytoplasmic domain receptors initiates variety signaling pathways signaling pathways activated summary signaling erbb family receptors promotes cell proliferation opposes apoptosis therefore must tightly regulated prevent uncontrolled cell growth occurring amplification also known overexpression gene occurs approximately breast breast cancers well established associated increased disease recurrence poor prognosis compared identifiably genetically distinct breast cancers known lack thereof genetic markers thought associated breast cancers however drug agents targeting breast cancer significantly positively altered otherwise poor prognosis historically problematic
