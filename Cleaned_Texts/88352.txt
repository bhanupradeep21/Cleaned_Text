modulation depth associated loss intelligibility alternative impulse response method also known indirect method assumes channel linear requires stricter synchronization sound source measurement instrument main benefit indirect method direct method based modulated test signals full mtf matrix measured covering relevant modulation frequencies octave bands large spaces cathedrals echoes likely occur indirect method usually preferred direct method eg using modulated stipa signals general indirect method often best option studying speech intelligibility based pure room acoustics electroacoustic components present within transmission path however requirement channel must linear implies indirect method used reliably many reallife applications whenever transmission chain features components might exhibit nonlinear behaviour loudspeakers indirect measurements may yield incorrect results also depending type impulse response measurement used influence background noise present measurements may dealt correctly means indirect method used great care measuring public address systems voice evacuation systems rev disallow indirect method applications issues following
