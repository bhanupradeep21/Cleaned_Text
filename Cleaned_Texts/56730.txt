gtype mainsequence star located light years away constellation one known exoplanet found orbiting star planet may potentially habitable superearth january farthest star known potentially habitable b exoplanet orbit star located constellation cygnus confirmed part study statistically validating hundreds kepler planets based parameters discovery paper planet superearth radius predicted mass earths orbit days systems habitable zone orbits au star distant known exoplanet considered potentially however parameters estimated first measurement host stars parallax published part gaia gaia parallax suggests distance parsecs much farther pregaia estimate parsecs revised distance results significantly larger estimate radius star thus planet study finding planetary radius would make planet ice giant like neptune thus potentially habitable earthlike
