ctcl tcell lymphoma develops lymph nodes commonly causes symptoms swollen lymph swelling normally cause pain felt seen lumps surface skin nodal tcell lymphoma subtypes peripheral tcell lymphoma often develop symptomcitation needed tcell lymphoma cause eczema rashlike symptoms small red patches appear around skin patches often irritated may appear slightly lighter colour compared rest skin

subtypes diagnosis often flawed due difficulty culture damaged lymphoma cells overall low frequency cases compared nonhodgkin current accurate diagnosis used across subtypes biopsy fresh tissue suspected affected lymphoma collected patient closely examined pathology diagnostic methods specific type tcell lymphoma physical examination skin lymph nodes common cutaneous subtypes tcell lymphoma whilst others may diagnosed using blood tests series scans ct scan mri ultrasounds even xrays may also used diagnostic treatment tcell lymphoma varies widely due large variability subtypes due lack research performed understanding nature tcell lymphoma pathogenesis majority cases often poor outcomes treatment however new research new therapy methods made help reduce mortality rates risk chemotherapy drug treatment involves use one anticancer drugs currently common treatment method used across cell lymphoma typically treated using chop regimen four anticancer drugs cyclophosphamide doxorubicin vincristine prednisone used combination relatively high dosage however outcomes chop regimen often poor high relapse less common chemotherapy regime also used include dhap dexamethasone highdose cytarabine cisplatin ice ifosfamide carboplatin etoposide however outcomes treatments often similar worse chop order improve outcomes chemotherapy often used conjunction radiotherapy followed stem cell radiotherapy use radiation eradicate electron beams radiotherapy penetrate level dermis common method treatment skin lymphoma may occur locally cutaneous tcell lymphoma however recommended patients systemic lymphoma stem cell transplants common method treatment either used conjunction chemotherapy improve remission effectiveness used relapsed lymphoma stem cell transplants either autologous stem cell transplant asct patient donates stem cells allogeneic stem cell transplant allohct related unrelated healthy donor donate stem cells stem cells collected bone marrow type cell capable selfrenewal differentiate types utilised patients tcell lymphoma seen effective results treating subtypes especially angioimmunoblastic tcell allogenic stem cell transplants mainly used patient lacks adequate healthy stem cells autologous stem cell transplant relapsed prior autologous stem cell transplant however allogenic transplants pose risk may toxic patient proposed solution include improved donor selection use conditioning regime high dose myeloablative treatment given alongside stem cell transplants reduce immune monoclonal antibodies mab utilizes antibodies target tumours induces apoptosis tumour obstruction survival monoclonal antibodies used single treatment agent however effective used concurrently chemotherapy improve survival commonly used monoclonal antibody used treat cell lymphoma include alemtuzumab denileukin nucleoside analogs type antiviral cytotoxic drug used treat various cancer related diseases possesses highly immunosuppressive abilities acts inhibiting viral replication prevent spread cancerous nucleoside analogs one active class drug used treat tcell lymphoma nontradition new treatment options include targeted protease
