living fossil extant taxon cosmetically resembles related species known fossil record considered living fossil fossil species must old relative time origin extant clade living fossils commonly speciespoor lineages need body plan living fossil remains superficially similar never species remote relatives resembles genetic drift would inevitably change chromosomal structure living fossils exhibit stasis also called bradytely geologically long time scales popular literature may wrongly claim living fossil undergone significant evolution since fossil times practically molecular evolution morphological changes scientific investigations repeatedly discredited minimal superficial changes living fossils mistakenly declared absence evolution examples stabilizing selection evolutionary perhaps dominant process morphological living fossils two main characteristics although third first two required recognition living fossil authors also require third others merely note frequent trait criteria neither welldefined clearly quantifiable modern methods analyzing evolutionary dynamics document distinctive tempo lineages exhibit stasis short time scales considered living fossils poorlydefined time scale morphology must persist lineage recognized living fossil term living fossil much misunderstood popular media particular often used meaninglessly professional literature expression seldom appears must used far caution although used one example concept could confused living fossil lazarus taxon two equivalent lazarus taxon whether single species group related species one suddenly reappears either fossil record nature fossil come life contrast lazarus taxa living fossil senses species lineage undergone exceptionally little change throughout long fossil record giving impression extant taxon remained identical entire fossil modern period mathematical inevitability genetic drift though dna modern species necessarily different distant similarlooking ancestor

living taxon long thought extinct could called lazarus taxon discovered still extant dramatic example order coelacanthiformes genus latimeria found extant little debate however whether latimeria resembles early members lineage sufficiently closely considered living fossil well lazarus taxon denied authors recent coelacanths disappeared fossil record million years ago upper cretaceous period extent exhibit low rates morphological evolution extant species qualify living fossils must emphasised criterion reflects fossil evidence totally independent whether taxa subject selection living populations continuously whether remain genetically unchanged apparent stasis turn gives rise great deal confusion one thing fossil record seldom preserves much general morphology specimen determine much physiology seldom possible even dramatic examples living fossils expected without changes matter persistently constant fossils extant specimens might seem determine much noncoding dna hardly ever possible even species hypothetically unchanged physiology expected nature reproductive processes nonfunctional genomic changes would continue moreorless standard rates hence fossil lineage apparently constant morphology need imply equally constant physiology certainly neither implies cessation basic evolutionary processes natural selection reduction usual rate change noncoding living fossils taxa
