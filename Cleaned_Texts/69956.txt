favre since dutch outbreak many additional cases reported leading greater soon initial dutch report national international health authorities launched warning initiatives multiple lgv cases identified several european countries belgium france germany sweden italy switzerland us canada cases reported amsterdam france considerable percentage lgv infections uk germany caused newly discovered chlamydia

lymph nodes lymphatic drainage pathways frequent presenting clinical manifestation lgv among males whose primary exposure genital unilateral twothirds cases lymphadenitis lymphangitis often tender

signs appear include fever decreased appetite malaise diagnosis difficult women men sex men msm may inguinal symptomscitation needed course disease lymph nodes enlarge may occur infection areas well enlarged nodes called buboes buboes commonly painful nodes commonly become inflamed thinning fixation overlying skin changes may progress necrosis fluctuant suppurative lymph nodes abscesses fistulas
