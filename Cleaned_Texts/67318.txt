mosquito bite typical reaction mosquito bites involves development itchy wheal may contain central red dot surrounded splotchy redness immediate reaction occurs time first minutes following bite within hours bite delayed reaction wheal evolves papule develops dissipates next days however wide variability type reaction individuals mount response bites initial mosquito bites previously unexposed individuals cause skin reaction initiate development antibodies andor lymphocytes directed allergens mosquitos saliva individuals thereby become sensitized reactive subsequent mosquito bites repetitive mosquito bites individuals may become less sensitive completely insensitive bites natural process allergen desensitization individuals therefore progress stages type reaction mosquito bite
