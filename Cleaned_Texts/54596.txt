transcriptional architecture circadian clock drosophila mice models determined role clock protein serves activate transcription circadian clock weitz lab also accredited discovering direct transcription termination per complex regulates expression genes involved producing circadian rhythm currently weitzs work focuses using cryoelectron microscopy study endogenous circadian protein
