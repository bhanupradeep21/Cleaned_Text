pseudoexfoliation syndrome often abbreviated sometimes pes pxs agingrelated systemic disease manifesting primarily eyes characterized accumulation microscopic granular amyloidlike protein cause unknown although speculation may genetic basis prevalent women men persons past age seventy prevalence different human populations varies example prevalent buildup protein clumps block normal drainage eye fluid called aqueous humor cause turn buildup pressure leading glaucoma loss pseudoexfoliation glaucoma exfoliation glaucoma worldwide populations become older shifts demography pex may become matter greater patients may specific cases patients may complain lessened visual acuity changes perceived visual field changes may secondary different symptoms normally associated cataracts pex characterized tiny microscopic granular clumps proteins within eye look somewhat like dandruff seen microscope released flakes sometimes compared amyloidlike visible examination lens eye ophthalmologist optometrist usual white fluffy material seen many tissues ocular anterior chamber trabecular meshwork central disc zonular fibres anterior hyaloid membrane pupillary anterior iris trabecula occasionally flakes one report suggested granular flakes abnormalities basement membrane epithelial cells distributed widely throughout body within structures research suggesting material may produced iris pigment epithelium ciliary epithelium peripheral anterior lens similar report suggests proteins come lens iris parts report found indications abnormal ocular surface pex patients discovered eye staining method known rose pex become problematic flakes become enmeshed spongy area known trabecular meshwork block normal may interact degenerative changes schlemms canal juxtacanalicular blockage leads greaterthannormal elevated intraocular turn damage optic eye produces clear fluid called aqueous humor subsequently drains constant level safe pressure within eye glaucoma result normal outflow fluid glaucoma umbrella term indicating ailments damage neural cable eye brain called optic nerve lead loss cases glaucoma typically called primary openangle glaucoma outflow happen normally doctors see causing blockage pex however flakes believed cause pex flakes directly cause glaucoma cause glaucoma indirectly blocking outflow aqueous humor leads higher intraocular pressure cause pex known cause weakening structures within eye help hold eyes lens place called lens cause pseudoexfoliation glaucoma generally pex generally believed systemic possibly basement membrane researchers noticed deposits pex material various parts body including skin heart lungs liver kidneys nevertheless puzzling pex tends happen one eye first scientists call cases gradually affects eye termed according reasoning pex systemic disorder eyes affected time contrasting reports extent speed pex moves one eye eyes according one report pex develops second eye contrasting report pex found eyes almost situations electron microscope used examine second eye biopsy conjunctiva done extent pex second eye much less first different report suggested two thirds pex patients flakes one one longterm study patients pex one eye studied found time progressed eyes affected scientists believe elevated levels plasma homocysteine risk factor cardiovascular two studies found higher levels plasma homocysteine pex elevated homocysteine concentrations tear fluids produced speculation pex may caused oxidative damage presence free radicals although exact nature might happen still studies pex patients found decrease concentrations ascorbic increase concentrations increase concentrations speculation genetics may play role predisposition develop pex later life may inherited characteristic according one one report suggested genetic component one study performed iceland sweden associated pex polymorphisms gene report suggested specific gene named member family enzymes play role linking collagen elastin inside cells responsible heritability pex according one two distinct mutations single nucleotide changed called single nucleotide polymorphism snp discovered scandinavian populations confirmed populations may involved onset gene called pseudoexfoliation syndrome associated abnormalities extracellular matrix basement membrane gene could reasonably play role pathophysiology condition researchers investigating whether factors exposure ultraviolet light living northern latitudes altitude influence onset one report suggested climate factor related another report suggested possible link sunlight well possible autoimmune response possibly pex usually diagnosed eye doctor examines eye using microscope method termed slit lamp examination done sensitivity rate specificity since symptom increased pressure within eye generally painless condition becomes rather advanced possible people affected glaucoma danger yet aware result recommended persons regular eye examinations levels intraocular pressure measured treatments prescribed serious damage optic nerve subsequent loss pex untreatable possible doctors minimize damage vision optic nerves medical techniques used prevent glaucoma patients continue regular eye examinations physicians monitor pressure levels check whether medicines working scientists studying different populations relationships try learn disease found associations different groups yet clear underlying factors affect different peoples around world pseudoexfoliation syndrome pex first described ophthalmologist finland named john g lindberg built slit lamp study condition reported grey flakes lens capsule well glaucoma eyes increasing prevalence condition several decades later ocular pathologist named georgiana dvoraktheobald suggested term pseudoexfoliation distinguish similar ailment sometimes affected glassblowers called true exfoliation syndrome described anton elschnig latter ailment caused heat infraredrelated changes anterior lens capsule characterized lamellar delamination lens sometimes two terms pseudoexfoliation true exfoliation used precise usage treat case separately scientists doctors actively exploring pex happens causes might prevented mitigated research activity explore causes glaucoma characterized research genetic basis pex one researcher speculated possible twohit
