medial knee injuries inside knee common type knee medial ligament complex knee consists complex major stabilizer medial knee injuries medial side knee commonly isolated thorough understanding anatomy function medial knee structures along detailed history physical exam imperative diagnosing treating injuries patients often complain pain swelling medial aspect knee joint may also report instability sidetoside movement athletic performance involves cutting jacobson previously described common problems medial knee stressed adequate diagnosis imperative possible injuries evaluated addressed intraoperatively damage saphenous nerve infrapatellar branch possible medial knee surgery potentially causing numbness pain medial knee surgeries risk bleeding wound problems deep vein thrombosis infection complicate outcome rehabilitation process long term complication arthrofibrosis heterotopic ossification pellegrinistieda syndrome problems best addressed early range motion following defined rehabilitation failure graft due intrinsic mechanical forces prevented preoperative alignment assessment osteotomy treatment proper medial knee injury usually caused valgus knee force tibial external rotation force combination thereof mechanism often seen sports involve aggressive knee flexion like ice hockey skiing structures medial side knee include tibia femur vastus medialis obliquus muscle semitendinosus tendon gracilis tendon sartorius tendon adductor magnus tendon medial head gastrocnemius muscle semimembranosus tendon medial meniscus medial patellofemoral ligament mpfl smcl dmcl pol found important structures stabilization area knee ligaments smcl dmcl bones knee femur patella tibia fibula fibula lateral side knee patella little effect medial side knee bony congruity medial knee consists opposing surfaces medial femoral condyle medial tibial plateau medial femoral condyle three bony landmarks important medial epicondyle adductor tubercle gastrocnemius tubercle medial epicondyle distal anterior prominence adductor tubercle proximal posterior medial epicondyle gastrocnemius tubercle distal posterior adductor smcl connects femur tibia originates proximal posterior medial epicondyle directly epicondyle splits two distinct one tibial section attaches soft tissue cm distal joint line tibial section attaches directly tibia anterior posteromedial tibial crest cm distal joint distal attachment stronger two makes floor pes anserine bursa proximal tibial attachment smcl primary stabilizer valgus force knee whereas distal tibial attachment primary stabilizer external rotation knee dmcl thickening medial aspect capsule surrounding knee originates femur cm distal smcl origin inserts mm distal joint line runs parallel underneath dmcl connects directly medial meniscus therefore divided meniscofemoral meniscotibial ligament components meniscofemoral ligament longer meniscotibial ligament shorter thicker meniscofemoral ligament primary internal rotation stabilizer secondary external rotation stabilizer activated smcl meniscotibial ligament acts secondarily stabilize internal rotation pol called older texts oblique portion smcl fascial expansion three main components superficial central tibial capsular central arm strongest arises semimembranosus tendon connects anterior distal gastrocnemius tubercle via posterior joint capsule pol therefore standalone structure thickening posteromedial joint capsule stabilizes internal rotation knee degrees flexion bears load internally rotated full extension also acts secondary external rotation mpfl arises fibers vastus medialis obliquus muscle attaches distally superior medial aspect ligament acts keep patella within trochlear groove flexion rarely injured medial knee injury unless concurrent lateral patellar subluxation dislocation adductor magnus tendon attaches distal medial femoral condyle posterior proximal adductor fascial expansion distalmedial aspect attaches medial gastrocnemius tendon capsular arm pol posteromedial joint capsule thick distal lateral aspect attaches medial supracondylar ridge adductor magnus tendon excellent consistent landmark rarely injured vastus medialis obliquus muscle courses anteromedial thigh attaching along adductor magnus anterior border quadratus femoris tendon medial gastrocnemius tendon arises proximal posterior gastrocnemius tubercle medial femoral another important landmark rarely injured attaches close capsular arm pol thus helping surgeon locate femoral attachment majority medial knee injuries isolated ligamentous injuries patients relate history traumatic blow lateral aspect knee causing valgus force noncontact valgus force acute injuries much easier diagnose clinically chronic injuries may less apparent due difficulty differentiating lateral knee injury possibly requiring valgus stress physical exam always begin visual inspection joint outward signs trauma palpation follow paying close

nonsuccessful results functional rehabilitation treatment medial knee injuries varies depending location classification consensus many studies isolated grade ii iii injuries usually well suited nonoperative treatment protocols acute grade iii injuries concomitant multiligament injuries knee dislocation involving medial side injury undergo surgical treatment chronic grade iii injuries also undergo surgical treatment patient experiencing rotational instability sidetoside conservative treatment isolated medial knee injuries grades iiii begins controlling swelling protecting knee swelling managed well rest ice elevation compression protection performed using hinged brace stabilizes varus valgus stress allows full flexion extension brace worn first four six weeks rehabilitation especially physical exercise prevent trauma healing ligament stationary bike exercises recommended exercise active range motion increased tolerated patient sidetoside movements knee avoided patient allowed bear weight tolerated perform quadriceps strengthening exercises along range motion exercises typical returntoplay time frame athletes grade iii medial knee injury undergoing rehabilitation
