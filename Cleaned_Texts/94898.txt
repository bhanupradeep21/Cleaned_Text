simulations run via webbased version aida diabetes simulator aida software intended serve educational support tool used anyone person diabetes relative patient health care professional doctor nurse clinical diabetes educator dietician pharmacist etc student even may minimal knowledge pathophysiology diabetes mellitus aida described detail medical scientific computing diabetes incorporates compartmental model describes glucoseinsulin interaction people completely lacking endogenous insulin secretion ie insulindependent patients type diabetes mellitus aida model contains single extracellular glucose compartment glucose enters via absorption intestine glucose production liver model also contains separate compartments plasma active insulin latter responsible glycemic control insulin removed former liver degradation full details aida model accessible within aida software viewed printed separately via aida website important note aida like modelbased approaches sufficiently accurate used individual patient simulation glycemic therefore program makes clear intended insulin therapy planning used teaching selflearning demonstration research purposes aida software simulate wide variety insulin dosage diet nutrition adjustments stressed purpose aida create learning environment communicating training intuitive thinking dealing adjustments respect aida appears use recreating clinical situations diabetes care rather trying predict best outcome aida diabetes simulator comes two forms aida software comes forty educational case scenarios standard represents snapshot metabolic status typical person respect insulindependent type diabetes mellitus easy users add create case scenarios required examples application aida educational tool found various published journal glycated hemoglobin levels widely regarded marker mediumterm blood glucose control extensively applied clinically indicator persons average integrated glycemic control preceding months diabetologists endocrinologists diabetes specialist nurses diabetes educators use assessments levels confirm overall blood glucose control test advantage dependent patient selfreported blood glucose data since year estimate simulation levels incorporated within aida offers people diabetes relatives students healthcare professionals users indication level might simulated blood glucose profile maintained months aida developers stress level estimations like aidas main blood glucose simulations intended educational teaching selflearning demonstration purposes meant individual patient prediction therapy user comments aida highlighted many ways people applied simulations particular great deal attention focused understandably use individuals diabetes relatives well healthcare professionals diabetologists endocrinologists diabetes educators however important group healthcarers involved provision daytoday care many people diabetes primary care physicians general practitioners gps workshop held september italy independent diabetologist endocrinologist unconnected aida simulators development gain experience application aida diabetes simulation approach teaching

care many people diabetes nurses separate workshop held june italy independent diabetologist endocrinologist gain experience application aida diabetes simulation approach teaching tool student nurses feedback obtained participants attending workshop generally positive student nurses also reporting simulation approach interest lifetime risk developing diabetes students born since year united states estimated many students need learn diabetes personal care care relatives desire learn diabetes develop career healthcare teenagers adept learning webbased computer tools background students entering grades aged years old enrolled biotechnology summer camp june organized independently georgia institute technology atlanta georgia usa focusing diabetes mellitus lectures pathophysiology clinical aspects diabetes followed simulated cases using aida online diabetes software simulator two cases demonstrated glycemic effects pharmacokinetics insulin administration diet exercise insulindependent type diabetes mellitus noninsulindependent type diabetes mellitus students filled standardized evaluations end session assess receptiveness type learning opinions utility information ease use perceived risks using online simulator understand diabetes students receptive simulatorbased educational approach majority found aida online useful educational worthy wider distribution would recommend program others diabetes wanting learn diabetes minority found program risky regarding information given students positive comments included ability visualize concepts taught earlier lectures recognized rigors required manage diabetes fewer negative comments reflected frustration webbased user interface course materials difficulty achieving good simulated glycemic control study authors concluded teaching pathophysiology diabetes pharmacology insulin middle school students enhanced aida online diabetes simulator future versions program development similar programs could useful teaching adolescents diabetes might help stimulate interested students learn care people aida diabetes simulator tested pilot randomised controlled trial rct protocol used rct described priori medical
