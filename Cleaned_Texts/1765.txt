rifamycins group antibiotics synthesized either naturally bacterium amycolatopsis rifamycinica artificially subclass larger family ansamycins rifamycins particularly effective mycobacteria therefore used treat tuberculosis leprosy mycobacterium avium complex mac infections rifamycin group includes classic rifamycin drugs well rifamycin derivatives rifampicin rifampin rifabutin rifapentine rifalazil rifaximin rifamycin sold trade name aemcolo approved united states treatment travelers diarrhea streptomyces mediterranei first isolated soil sample collected near beachside town st raphael southern france name originally given two microbiologists working italian drug company group lepetit spa milan italian grazia beretta pinhas margalith bacterium renamed nocardia mediterranei another scientist named thiemann found cell wall typical nocardia species bacterium renamed amycolatopsis mediterranei first species new genus scientist named lechevalier discovered cell wall lacks mycolic acid able infected nocardia rhodococcus phages based ribosomal rna sequences bala et al renamed species amycolatopsis rifamycinica rifamycins first isolated fermentation culture streptomyces mediterranei laboratory gruppo lepetit spa milan two scientist named piero sensi maria teresa timbal working israeli scientist pinhas margalith initially family closely related antibiotics discovered referred rifamycin b c e component mixture sufficiently stable isolate pure form rifamycin b unfortunately poorly active however studies showed rifamycin b essentially inactive spontaneously oxidized hydrolyzed aqueous solutions yield highly active rifamycin simple reduction rifamycin yielded hydroquinone form called rifamycin sv became first member class enter clinical use intravenous antibiotic chemical modification rifamycin sv yielded improved analog rifamide also introduced clinical practice similarly limited intravenous use extensive modification program rifampin eventually produced orally available become mainstay tuberculosis lepetit filed patent protection rifamycin b uk august us march british patent granted march us patent granted september drug widely regarded helped conquer issue drugresistant tuberculosis rifamycins used treatment many diseases important one hivrelated tuberculosis systematic review clinical trials alternative regimens prevention active tuberculosis hivnegative individuals latent tb found weekly directly observed regimen rifapentine isoniazid three months effective daily selfadministered regimen isoniazid nine months rifapentineisoniazid regimen higher rates treatment completion lower rates hepatotoxicity however rate treatmentlimiting adverse events higher rifapentineisoniazid rifamycins unique mechanism action selectively inhibiting bacterial dnadependent rna polymerase show crossresistance antibiotics clinical use however despite activity bacteria resistant antibiotics rifamycins suffer rather high frequency resistance rifampin rifamycins typically used combination antibacterial drugs routinely practiced tb therapy serves prevent formation mutants resistant drugs combination rifampin rapidly kills fastdividing bacilli strains well persisters cells remain biologically inactive long periods time allow evade antibiotic addition rifabutin rifapentine used tuberculosis acquired hivpositive patients although tuberculosis therapy remains important use rifampin increasing problem serious multiple drug resistant bacterial infections led use antibiotic combinations containing rifampin treat antibacterial activity rifamycins relies inhibition bacterial dnadependent rna due high affinity rifamycins prokaryotic rna polymerase selectivity rifamycins depends fact poor affinity analogous mammalian enzyme crystal structure data antibiotic bound rna polymerase indicates rifamycin blocks synthesis causing strong steric clashes growing oligonucleotide stericocclusion rifamycin binds polymerase chain extension process started inhibition observed biosynthesis consistent stericocclusion mechanism single step high level resistance rifamycins occurs result single amino acid change bacterial dna dependent rna polymerase first information biosynthesis rifamycins came studies using stable isotope nmr spectroscopy establish origin carbon skeleton studies showed ansa chain derived acetate propionate common polyketide antibiotics naphthalenic chromophore shown derive propionate unit coupled seven carbon amino moiety unknown origin general scheme biosynthesis starts uncommon starting unit acid ahba via type polyketide pathway pks chain extension performed using acetate propionate ahba believed originated shikimate pathway however incorporated biosynthetic mechanism due observation aminoacid analogues converted ahba cellfree extracts rif cluster responsible biosynthesis rifamycins contains genes rifg rifn shown biosynthesize rifk rifl rifm rifn believed act transaminases order form ahba precursor rifh encodes aminodahp synthase catalyzes condensation rifa rife encode type polyketide synthase module loading module nonribosomal peptide synthetase rifae
