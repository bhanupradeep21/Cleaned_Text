fibrothorax medical condition characterised severe scarring fibrosis fusion layers pleural space surrounding lungs resulting decreased movement lung main symptom fibrothorax shortness breath also may recurrent fluid collections surrounding lungs fibrothorax may occur complication many diseases including infection pleural space known empyema bleeding pleural space known fibrosis pleura may produced intentionally using technique called pleurodesis prevent recurrent punctured lung pneumothorax usually limited fibrosis produces rarely extensive enough lead condition often diagnosed using xray ct scan latter readily detecting mild cases fibrothorax often treated conservatively watchful waiting may require surgery outlook usually good long underlying pulmonary fibrosis complications following surgery disease highly uncommon reduced movement ribcage breathing reduced breath sounds affected sides dull feeling chest pressed common signs observed examination sharp chest pain deep breaths coughing may seen severe cases fibrothorax lead respiratory failure due inadequate ventilation cause abnormally high levels carbon dioxide condition causes symptoms visceral pleura although fibrothorax may cause symptoms people affected disorder may report shortness persistent recurrent pleural effusions possible symptom caused persistent cavity formed hardening pleura around original fluid shortness breath tends develop gradually may worsen time less commonly fibrothorax may cause chest discomfort dry fibrothorax may occur complication diseases symptoms underlying problem sometimes seen example fever cases empyema fibrothorax often complication diseases cause inflammation pleura include infections empyema tuberculosis bleeding within pleural space known haemothorax exposure certain substances asbestos cause generalised fibrosis lungs may involve pleura lead less common causes fibrothorax include collagen vascular diseases systemic lupus erythematosus sarcoidosis rheumatoid arthritis kidney failure leading uraemia side effects certain medications commonly associated pleural fibrosis ergot alkaloids bromocriptine pergolide fibrothorax may also occur without clear underlying cause case known idiopathic fibrothorax technique called pleurodesis used intentionally create scar tissue within pleural space usually treatment repeated episodes punctured lung known pneumothorax pleural effusions caused cancer procedure usually generates limited scar tissue rare cases fibrothorax fibrosis affect one two layers tissue forming visceral pleura adjacent lung parietal pleura adjacent ribcage term fibrothorax implies severe fibrosis affecting visceral outer parietal pleura fusing lung chest condition starts undrained pleural effusion time undrained pleural effusion causes sustained inflammation pleura lead deposition fibrin pleura development fibrotic scar eventually peel rich collagen forms around fluid collection point illness longer treated thoracentesis since fluid return cavity maintained time generally years fibrotic scar tissue slowly tightens thickens contracting contents one halves chest reducing mobility ribs peel become deeper within chest lung compressed unable expand trapped lung making vulnerable collapse causing restrictive lung disease fibrothorax may occur pleural fibrosis severe involves diaphragm ribcage results primarily decreased rib microscopic level collagen fibres deposit basket weave pattern form scar usually underlying condition cause intense inflammation pleura though unclear exactly results fibrosis precise mechanisms producing fibrosis entirely clear however research indicates protein called transforming growth factor beta tgfβ plays central role producing antitgfβ antibodies prevent fibrothorax empyema animal fibrothorax typically diagnosed taking appropriate medical history combination use appropriate imaging techniques plain chest xray ct imaging techniques detect fibrothorax pleural thickening surround presence thickened peel without calcification common features fibrothorax ct scans readily differentiate whether pleural thickening due extra fat deposition true pleural thickening fibrothorax severe thickening may restrict lung affected side causing loss lung additionally mediastinum may physically shifted toward affected reduction size one side chest hemithorax xray ct scan chest suggests chronic signs underlying disease causing fibrothorax also occasionally seen ct scan may show features similar seen plain lung function testing typically demonstrates findings consistent restrictive lung extensive leftsided fibrothorax chest radiograph displaying inhomogeneous opacification left half chest fibrothorax chest xray left ct scan right demonstrating fibrothorax autopsy specimen showing extensive pleural fibrosis conservative nonsurgical treatment fibrothorax generally done treating underlying cause reserved milder cases tobacco smoking cessation strongly recommended since tobacco smoke exposure worsen severe cases fibrothorax may require supportive mechanical ventilation affected person unable breathe adequately cases fibrothorax caused medication recommended offending medications stopped ergot alkaloid medications worsen pleural fibrosis typically cases fibrothorax attributable medication typically stop worsening provoking medication situations medicationinduced fibrothorax improves stopping causative medication fibrothorax usually completely watchful waiting appropriate milder cases fibrothorax certain situations fibrothorax caused tuberculosis empyema haemothorax often improves spontaneously months precipitating illness corticosteroids commonly used treat fibrothorax wellsupported available severe cases fibrothorax compromising persons ability breathe scar tissue fibrous peel causing fibrothorax surgically removed using technique called however surgical decortication invasive procedure carries risk complications including small risk therefore generally considered severe symptoms present many surgical decortication generally considered people fibrothoraces severe causing significant shortness breath otherwise relatively healthy lungs since enhances likelihood better surgical removal pleura pleurectomy may performed refractory cases often happens asbestosis fibrothorax complicating another condition tuberculous pleuritis empyema acute haemothorax often spontaneously resolves prognosis surgical decortication variable depends health underlying lung procedure takes lung otherwise healthy certain aspects lung function vital capacity may improve however lung significant disease lung function often improve may even deteriorate duration fibrothorax affect mortality surgery less overall rises elderly factors predicting poorer surgical outcomes include intraoperative complications incomplete surgery lung disease beyond fibrothorax treated specific causes fibrothorax sporadic cases rarely reported medical literature example due iatrogenic postoperative complications fibrothorax rare developed countries mainly due lower incidence tuberculosis condition far common workers exposed asbestos exposed
