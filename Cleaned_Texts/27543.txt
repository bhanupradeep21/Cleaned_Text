apparent deatha behavior animals take appearance dead immobile state often triggered predatory attack found wide range animals insects crustaceans mammals birds reptiles amphibians apparent death separate freezing behavior seen apparent death form animal deception considered antipredator strategy also used form aggressive mimicry induced humans state sometimes colloquially known animal hypnosis earliest written record animal hypnosis dates back year report athanasius kircher subdued tonic immobility also known act feigning death exhibiting thanatosis behaviour animals become apparently temporarily paralysed unresponsive external stimuli tonic immobility generally considered antipredator behavior occurs often response extreme threat captured perceived predator animals use attract prey facilitate reproduction example sharks exhibiting behaviour scientists relate mating arguing biting male immobilizes female thus facilitates despite appearances animals remain conscious throughout tonic evidence includes occasional responsive movement scanning environment animals tonic immobility often taking advantage escape opportunities tonic immobility preferred literature neutral connotations compared thanatosis strong association tonic immobility different freezing behavior deer headlights opossum playing dead common examples animal freezing playing dead respectively freezing occurs early predatorprey interaction prey detects identifies threat predator yet seen freezing occurs detection used better camouflage prey prevent predator attacking considered primary defense tonic immobility occurs predator detected made contact prey likely used prevent attack predator consumption tonic immobility occurs later predator attack sequence considered secondary defense mechanism therefore distinct although freezing animals become rigid often stay upright change posture frozen whereas tonic immobility animals often become rigid change freezing behavior tonic immobility similar may induce bradycardia slowing heart rate freezing response may instead accompanied rapid increased breathing rate increased heart rate increased blood pressure inhibition digestion depending whether sympathetic parasympathetic nervous system contrast along bradycardia vertebrates tonic immobility often reduce breathing rate protrude tongue distinguishing behavior freezing defensive purposes thanatosis hinges pursuers becoming unresponsive victim predators catch live beetles artificial selection experiments shown heritable variation length deathfeigning selected longer

adaptions exploit reaction newly hatched young also instinctively show behaviour rats try eat mammals virginia opossum commonly known simply possums perhaps best known example defensive thanatosis playing possum idiomatic phrase means pretending comes characteristic virginia opossum famous reacting deathlike posture instinct always pay modern world example opossums scavenging roadkill may react deathlike posture threat posed oncoming traffic subsequently end roadkill playing possum also mean simply pretending injured unconscious asleep otherwise vulnerable often lure opponent vulnerable usual advice humans attempting survive attack brown bear lie face cover face ones handsarmselbows play dead done hope bear get bored wander away thanatosis also observed many invertebrates wasp
