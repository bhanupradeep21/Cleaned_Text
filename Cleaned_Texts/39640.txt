internal medicine relapse recidivism recurrence past typically medical condition example multiple sclerosis malaria often exhibit peaks activity sometimes long periods dormancy followed relapse recrudescence psychiatry relapse reinstatement drugseeking behavior recurrence pathological drug use self harm symptoms period recovery relapse often observed individuals developed drug addiction form drug dependence well mental disorder availability dopamine receptor plays role selfadministration reinforcing effects cocaine stimulants receptor availability inverse relationship vulnerability reinforcing effects drug receptors becoming limited user becomes susceptible reinforcing effects cocaine currently unknown predisposition low receptor availability possible however studies support idea changes receptor availability result rather precursor cocaine use also noted receptors may return level existing prior drug exposure long periods abstinence fact may implications relapse social interactions formation linear dominance hierarchies also play role vulnerability substance use animal studies suggest exists difference receptor availability dominant subordinate animals within social hierarchy well difference function cocaine reinforce selfadministration animal groups socially dominant animals exhibit higher availability receptors fail maintain drug taking relapse heavily influenced number factors including pharmacokinetics dose neurochemistry drug well drug taker environment drugrelated history reinstatement drug use period nonuse abstinence typically initiated one combination three main triggers stress reexposure drug drugpriming environmental cues factors may induce neurochemical response drug taker mimics drug thus triggers cues may lead strong desire intention use drug feeling termed craving abraham wikler propensity craving heavily influenced three triggers relapse accepted hallmark substance stress one powerful stimuli reinstating drug use stress cues stimulate craving drugseeking behavior abstinence stressinduced craving also predictive time relapse comparably addicted individuals show increased susceptibility stressors nonaddicted controls examples stressors may induce reinstatement include emotions fear sadness anger physical stressor footshock elevated sound level social drugpriming exposing abstinent user addictive substances induce reinstatement drugseeking behavior drug stimuli preexisting association given drug use drug trigger craving reinstatement cues include items places people associated relapse treatment somewhat misnomer relapse treatment failure however exist three main approaches currently used reduce likelihood drug relapse include pharmacotherapy cognitive behavioral techniques contingency management main goals treating substance dependence preventing relapse identify needs previously met use drug develop skills needed meet needs alternative various medications used stabilize addicted user reduce initial drug use prevent reinstatement drug medications normalize longterm changes occur brain nervous system result prolonged drug use method therapy complex multifaceted brain target desire use drug may different target induced drug availability various neurotransmitter receptors dopamine receptor changes medial prefrontal cortex prominent targets pharmacotherapy prevent relapse heavily linked druginduced stressinduced cueinduced relapse receptor recovery upregulated administration receptor antagonists pharmacotherapeutic treatments neruoadaptations medial prefrontal cortex still relatively ineffective due lacking knowledge adaptations molecular cellular various behavioral approaches treating relapse focus precursors consequences drugtaking reinstatement cognitivebehavioral techniques cbt incorporate pavlovian conditioning operant conditioning characterized positive reinforcement negative reinforcement order alter cognitions thoughts emotions associated drugtaking behavior main approach cbt cue exposure abstinent user repeatedly exposed salient triggers without exposure substance hopes substance gradually lose ability induce drugseeking behavior approach likely reduce severity relapse prevent one occurring altogether another method teaches addicts basic coping mechanisms avoid using illicit drug important address deficits coping skills identify needs likely induce drugseeking develop another way meet relapse prevention attempts group factors contribute relapse two broad categories immediate determinants covert antecedents immediate determinants environmental emotional situations associated relapse including highrisk situations threaten individual sense control coping strategies outcome expectancies covert antecedents less obvious factors influencing relapse include lifestyle factors stress level balance urges cravings relapse prevention model teaches addicts anticipate relapse recognizing coping various immediate determinants covert antecedents rp model shows greatest success treatment alcoholism proven superior treatment relapse may also likely occur certain times holiday season stress levels typically emphasizing relapse prevention strategies times ideal contrast behavioral approaches contingency management concentrates consequences drug use opposed precursors addict behavior

much higher resolution eliminates exposure although reinstatement protocols used frequently laboratory settings limitations validity procedures model craving relapse humans primary limiting factor humans relapse rarely follows strict extinction drugseeking behavior additionally human selfreports show drugassociated stimuli play lesser role craving humans laboratory models validity model examined three ways formal equivalence correlational models functional equivalence moderate formal equivalence face validity meaning model somewhat resembles relapse occurs outside laboratory setting however little face validity procedures model craving predictive validity assessed correlational models yet determined procedures sound functional equivalence model suggests relapse laboratory
