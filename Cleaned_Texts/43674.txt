tadpole larval stage biological life cycle amphibian tadpoles fully aquatic though species amphibians tadpoles terrestrial tadpoles fishlike features may found adult amphibians lateral line gills swimming tails undergo metamorphosis start develop functional lungs breathing air diet tadpoles changes drastically amphibians members frog family brevicipitidae undergo direct development ie undergo freeliving larval stage tadpoles instead emerging eggs fully formed froglet miniatures adult morphology species hatch tadpoles underneath skin female adult kept pouch metamorphosis hard skeletons might expected tadpole fossils would exist however traces biofilms preserved fossil tadpoles found dating back miocene tadpoles eaten human food parts world mentioned various folk tales around world name tadpole middle english taddepol made elements tadde toad pol head modern english poll similarly pollywog polliwog middle english polwygle made pol head wiglen life cycle amphibians involves larval stage intermediate embryo adult cases larval stage limbless freeliving organism tail referred tadpole although cases eg breviceps probreviceps genera frogs direct development occurs larval stage confined within egg tadpoles frogs mostly herbivorous tadpoles salamanders caecilians carnivorous tadpoles frogs toads usually globular laterally compressed tail swim lateral undulation first hatched anuran tadpoles external gills eventually covered skin forming opercular chamber internal gills vented spiracles depending species two spiracles sides body single spiracle underside near vent single spiracle left side newly hatched tadpoles also equipped cement gland allows attach objects tadpoles cartilaginous skeleton notochord eventually develops proper spinal cord anuran tadpoles usually herbivorous feeding soft decaying plant matter gut tadpoles long spiralshaped efficiently digest organic matter seen bellies many species though many tadpoles feed dead animals available species frog strictly carnivorous tadpoles example frogs family ceratophryidae cannibalistic tadpoles wide gaping mouths devour organisms including tadpoles another example tadpoles new mexico spadefoot toad spea multiplicata develop carnivorous diet along broader head larger jaw muscles shorter gut food scarce allowing consume fairy shrimp smaller herbivorous genera pipidae microhylidae species whose tadpoles filter feeders swim water column feeding plankton megophrys tadpoles feed water surface using unusual funnelshaped frog tadpole matures gradually develops limbs back legs growing first front legs second tail absorbed body using apoptosis lungs develop around time legs start growing tadpoles stage often swim surface gulp air final stages metamorphosis tadpoles mouth changes small enclosed mouth front head large mouth width head intestines shorten transition herbivorous diet carnivorous diet adult frogs tadpoles vary greatly size development species example single family megophryidae length latestage tadpoles varies centimetres centimetres tadpoles paradoxical frog pseudis paradoxa reach centimetres longest shrinking mere snouttovent length cm anuran tadpoles inhabit wetlands ponds vernal pools small bodies water slow moving water species adapted different environments frogs terrestrial tadpoles family ranixalidae whose tadpoles found wet crevices near streams tadpoles micrixalus herrei adapted fossorial lifestyle muscular body tail eyes covered layer skin reduced several frogs stream dwelling tadpoles equipped strong oral sucker allows hold onto rocks fast flowing water two examples indian purple frog nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis tailed frogs ascaphus western north america although marine tadpoles tadpoles crabeating frog cope brackish anurans provide parental care towards tadpoles frogs genus afrixalus lay eggs leaves water folding leaves around eggs protection female pipa frogs embed eggs backs get covered thin layer skin eggs hatch underneath skin grow eventually leaving either large tadpoles pipa parva fully formed froglets pipa pipa female marsupial frogs hemiphractidae carry eggs back various amounts time going far letting tadpoles develop tiny froglets pouch male african bullfrogs pyxicephalus adspersus keep watch tadpoles attacking anything might potential threat even though may eat tadpoles males emei mustache toads leptobrachium boringii construct nests along riverbanks breed females keep watch eggs losing much body mass time spend protecting male midwife toads alytes carry eggs legs protect predators eventually releasing body water ready hatch poison dart frogs dendrobatidae carry tadpoles various locations usually phytotelma remain metamorphosis female dart frogs strawberry poison dart frog oophaga pumilio regularly lay unfertilized eggs developing tadpoles feed despite softbodied nature lack mineralised hard parts fossil tadpoles around cm length recovered upper miocene preserved
