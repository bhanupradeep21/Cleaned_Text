preposterously false skeptic boldly asserts sentence x know nothing whatsoever sentence asserts nothing contrary sentence asserts something seems patently sentence uttered perfectly meaningful nonsensical meaningless fact person skeptic uttered put matter another way make sense sentence x know asserts make sense man uttering understand would utter thus use terms like nonsense meaningless epistemic sense correct use requires uttered seem absurdly false course seem preposterously false sentence must assert something thus either true false ppa keith lehrer makes similar argument part vi
