bone conduction conduction sound inner ear primarily bones skull allowing hearer perceive audio content even ear canal blocked bone conduction transmission occurs constantly sound waves vibrate bone specifically bones skull although hard average individual distinguish sound conveyed bone opposed sound conveyed air via ear canal intentional transmission sound bone used individuals normal hearing boneconduction headphones treatment option certain types hearing impairment bones generally effective transmitting lowerfrequency sounds compared higherfrequency sounds bone conduction one reason persons voice sounds different recorded played back skull conducts lower frequencies better air people perceive voices lower fuller others recording ones voice frequently sounds higher one expects see voice musicians may use bone conduction using tuning fork tuning stringed instruments fork starts vibrating placing mouth stem back teeth ensures one continues hear note via bone conduction hands free ludwig van beethoven famously rumored using bone conduction losing hearing placing one end rod mouth resting end rim also observed animals perceive sound even communicate sending receiving vibration comparison hearing sensitivity bone conduction directly ear canal aid audiologists identifying pathologies middle area tympanic membrane ear drum cochlea inner ear hearing markedly better bone conduction ear canal airbone problems ear canal eg ear wax accumulation tympanic membrane ossicles method first discovered italian physician hieronymus first bone conduction hearing aids invented century italian physician girolamo cardano realized rod placed someones teeth attached end musical instrument person could hear music despite hearing method used beethoven hearing deteriorated towards

energy supply transducer generates vibrations microphone hearing aid picks sound signals environment signal optimized transmitted transducer generates vibrations depending specific bone conduction hearing aid system vibrations either sent directly skull bone skin towards inner ear finally inner ear picks vibrations sends auditory cortex brain different bone conduction devices contain different
