georgiacetus extinct genus ancient whale known eocene period united states fossils known georgia alabama mississippi protocetid fossils right time frame yet confirmed georgiacetus found texas kellogg south carolina albright uhen created new clade pelagiceti common ancestor basilosauridae descendants including neoceti living cetaceans placed georgiacetus near base clade together eocetus perhaps babiacetus assumed presence fluke compressed posterior caudal vertebrae georgiacetus extinct protocetid early whale lived million years ago hunted rich suwannee current powered coastal sea covered southeastern united states earliest bartonian stage eocene epoch million years ago current research puts georgiacetus link protocetids modern making georgia whale scientifically important ancestor modern whales articulated completed cast find currently display georgia southern university museum statesboro georgia georgia southern university also houses actual georgiacetus fossils animal fossilized hip bones display georgiacetus discovered construction nuclear power plant plant vogtle burke county georgia lutetian blue bluff formation paleocoordinates find consisted three individuals identified belonging species two individuals represented isolated bones recovered separately included vertebrae ribs tooth crowns main find discovered cutting drainage channel plants river water intake structure savannah depth ft surface complete individual consisting bones teeth including wellpreserved skull mandible fortunately georgia power halted construction activities area assisted

represented adult animal fully erupted wellworn molars apparent cause death main mass bones first reviewed field geologist e shapiro georgia geologic survey abolished shapiro recommendation georgia southern university called richard petkewich gale bishop led effort recover dr richard hulbert also georgia southern university time led research team described find new genus species skull mm long mm wide mm deep fleshed would decidedly larger structure inner ear bones confirms georgiacetus belonging whales throughout long history whales terrestrial ancestors possessed identifiable unique inner ear bone structure hard know total length animal legs tail vertebrae found researchers estimate length ft considering head would nearly three feet long living animal georgiacetus equipped active predator capable taking processing large prey prominent crest top rear skull would anchored powerful jaw muscles front teeth curved bananashaped though life banana shape would deep jaw tip exposed peglike teeth adapted seize hold struggling prey moving back jaws deeply rooted triangular edged teeth shearing back sharp molars crushing large fish birds turtles could caught processed manageable chunks tooth skull arrangement shows clear direct relationship basilosauridae family georgiacetus basilosaurids possessed teeth skull remarkably similar function structure nostrils blowholes located halfway back snout front eyes basilosaurid tooth arrangement appears efficient specialized version georgiacetus arrangement georgiacetus predated basilosaurids nearly three million years georgia whale likely source basilosaurids uhen described new georgiacetus material alabama mississippi finds included several tail vertebrae teeth partial mandible important find single endoftail vertebra one would occupied end vertebral column endoftail vertebra possessed two distinct muscle supporting flanges show simplified compressed endoftail arrangement seen modern whales basilosaurus show fluke supporting adaptations single vertebra showed georgiacetus apparently lacked fluke likely swam hind legs georgiacetus tail lacked fluke present slightly younger fossils probably swam using hindlimbs wiggling hips moving trunk locomotor behaviour abandoned modern whales whales evolved south asia previously thought fluke helped early whales spread across earth georgiacetus presence america legs tail contradicts uhen also established clade show relationship georgiacetus basilosaurids modern whales clade begins georgiacetus includes basilosaurids baleen toothed whales shows georgiacetus led basilosaurids turn led modern whales right left hip bones georgiacetus recovered though hind leg tail material preserved hip bones relatively large showed well developed sockets indicates georgiacetus well developed hind legs hip bones much larger known basilosaurus basilosaurus dramatically larger animal georgiacetus cautiously assumedby hind legs georgiacetus much larger relative body size tiny hind legs basilosaurus yet hip bones fused spine neither basilosaurus suggests georgia whale probably could support weight watercitation needed global sea levels ft higher modern levels whales lived fossils discovered mi km inland modern coastline invertebrate fossils recovered along main mass bones showed whale died well offshore shallow open water environment approximately mi km coastline today georgias fall invertebrate fossils also allowed accurate dating remains georgiacetus held earliest north american whale geisler sanders luo published paper carolinacetus slightly older primitive whale georgiacetus based partial skull mandible several teeth ribs vertebra important find one interesting questions authors asked whales get north america whales emerged million years ago tethys ocean presentday india asia warm fertile shallow sea much like one covered southeastern united states million years ago whales georgiacetus carolinacetus already present america two schools thought got one involves direct deep water atlantic crossing involves polar route northwards european coastline across greenland southward along north american coastline polar route would cold water trip climate much warmer greenland likely green routes would require long deepwater crossings also sea levels much higher time journey would longer whichever route taken fact journey occurred shows time carolinacetus georgiacetus lived whales yet possess flukes already capable extended deep water activity httpsenwikipediaorgwikigeorgiacetus
