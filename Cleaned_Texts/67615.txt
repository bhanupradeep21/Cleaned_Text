cochlear nuclear cn complex comprises two cranial nerve nuclei human brainstem ventral cochlear nucleus vcn dorsal cochlear nucleus dcn ventral cochlear nucleus unlayered whereas dorsal cochlear nucleus layered auditory nerve fibers fibers travel auditory nerve also known cochlear nerve eighth cranial nerve carry information inner ear cochlea side head nerve root ventral cochlear nucleus nerve root fibers branch innervate ventral cochlear nucleus deep layer dorsal cochlear nucleus acoustic information thus enters brain cochlear nuclei processing acoustic information begins outputs

contralateral ear via contralateral also somatosensory parts three major fiber bundles axons cochlear nuclear neurons carry information cochlear nuclei targets mainly opposite side brain medulla one projection goes contralateral superior olivary complex soc via trapezoid body whilst half shoots ipsilateral soc pathway called ventral acoustic stria vas commonly trapezoid body another pathway called dorsal acoustic stria das also known stria von monakow rises medulla pons hits nuclei lateral lemniscus along kin intermediate acoustic stria ias also known stria held ias decussates across medulla joining ascending fibers contralateral lateral lemniscus lateral lemniscus contains cells nuclei lateral lemniscus turn projects inferior colliculus inferior colliculus receives direct monosynaptic projections superior olivary complex contralateral dorsal acoustic stria classes stellate neurons vcn well different nuclei lateral lemniscus inputs terminate inferior colliculus although small projections bypass inferior colliculus project medial geniculate forebrain structures three types principal cells convey information ventral cochlear nucleus bushy cells stellate cells octopus cells two types principal cells convey information dorsal cochlear nucleus dcn contralateral inferior colliculus principal cells receive two systems inputs acoustic input comes deep layer several paths excitatory acoustic input comes auditory nerve fibers also stellate cells vcn acoustic input also conveyed inhibitory interneurons tuberculoventral cells dcn wide band inhibitors vcn outermost molecular layer dcn receives types sensory information importantly information location head ears parallel fibers information distributed cerebellar like circuit also includes inhibitory interneurons cochlear nuclear complex first integrative processing stage auditory system information brought nuclei ipsilateral cochlea via cochlear nerve several tasks performed cochlear nuclei distributing
