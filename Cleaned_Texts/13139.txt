normality behavior normal individual intrapersonal normality consistent common behavior person normal also used describe individual behavior conforms common behavior society known conformity however normal behavior often recognized contrast abnormality many cases normality used make moral judgements normality seen good abnormality seen conversely normality seen boring uninteresting someone seen normal normal social ramifications included excluded stigmatized wider society many difficulties arise measuring normal come across parallel issues defining normality one complication arises regards whether normality used correctly everyday people say heart abnormal portion working correctly yet may inaccurate include entirety heart description abnormal difference normality body parts structure function similarly behavioral pattern may conform social norms still effective nonproblematic individual dichotomy appearance function behavior may difficult measure normality applicable trying diagnose pathology addressed diagnostic statistical manual mental disorders general normal refers lack significant deviation average word normal used narrow sense mathematics normal distribution describes population whose characteristics center around average norm looking specific behavior frequency lying researcher may use gaussian bell curve plot reactions normal reaction would within one standard deviation average however mathematical model holds one particular trait time since example probability single individual within one standard deviation independent variables would one

normality explains frequent general behaviors thus normal behaviors persist transition periods society crime instance considered normal exists every society every time twofold version normality behaviors considered normal societal level may still considered pathological individual level individual level people violate social norms criminals invite punishment others society individuals

behavior cases pluralistic ignorance people wrongly believe social norm one thing fact people hold viewcitation needed people made aware social norm particularly descriptive norm ie norm describing done behavior changes become closer norm power norms harnessed social norms marketing social norm advertised people attempt stop extreme behavior binge drinking however people extreme little alcohol consumption equally likely change behavior become closer norm case increasing alcohol consumption instead using descriptive norms effective social norms marketing may use injunctive norms instead describing common behavior outline approved disapproved society individuals become aware injunctive norm extremes change behavior decreasing alcohol consumption without boomerang effect underindulgers increasing social norms guide people always normal everyone behaviors abnormal people may considered normal subgroup subculture example normal college student behavior may party drink alcohol

additionally abnormality may make others uncomfortable separating abnormally labelled individualcitation needed since normal generally considered ideal often pressure external sources conform normality well pressure peoples intrinsic desire feel included example families medical community try help disabled people live normal life however pressure appear normal actually deviation creates someone appear normal actually experiencing world differently struggling abnormality makes society feel uncomfortable exceptional person laugh relieve social tension disabled person given normal freedoms may able show negative emotions lastly societys rejection deviance pressure normalize may cause shame individuals abnormalities may included individuals sense identity especially unwelcome abnormalitiescitation needed individuals abnormality labelled pathology possible person take elements sick role stigmatization follows illnesses mental illness particular largely misunderstood population often overwhelms others impression patientcitation needed definitions normality consider interpersonal normality comparison many different individuals behaviors distinguish normality

taking sample many different occurrences behavior one person time also like interpersonal normality intrapersonal normality may change time due changes individual age due changes society since societys view normality influences individual peoples behavior comfortable people engage behavior conforms personal habitual norms things go wrong people likely attribute negative outcome abnormal
