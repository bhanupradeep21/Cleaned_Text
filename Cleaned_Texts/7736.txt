display behaviour set ritualized behaviours enable animal communicate animals typically species specific ritualized behaviours visual many animals depend mixture visual audio tactical chemical evolution tailored stereotyped behaviours allow animals communicate conspecifically interspecifically allows broader connection different niches ecosystem connected sexual selection survival species various ways typically display behaviour used courtship two animals signal female viable male ready instances species may make territorial displays order preserve foraging hunting territory family group third form exhibited tournament species males fight order gain right breed animals broad range evolutionary hierarchies avail display behaviours invertebrates simple jumping complex vertebrates like harbour communication important animals throughout animal kingdom example since female praying mantids sexually cannibalistic male typically uses cryptic form series creeping movements executed male approaches female freezing whenever female looks towards male however according laboratory studies conducted loxton one type mantis ephestiasula arnoena shows male female counterparts performing overt ritualized behaviour displayed semaphore behaviour meaning waving front legs boxing fashion slow approach male behind semaphore display communicates ready flies belonging genus megaselia also show contrary typically femaleselected mating occurs organisms flies females show display behaviour males choose mate females bright orange colouring attracts male also perform series fluttering wing movements make insect appear dance make openings abdomens swell order attract experimental evidence implies female may also release pheromones attract male instance chemical display behaviour plays large role animal auditory courtship behavior seen fruit flies like suspensa perform calling precopulatory songs mating sounds created rapid flapping males many arachnids show ritualized displays example arachnid family salticidae consists jumping spiders keen vision results clear display behaviours courting salticids similar appearance ants live area therefore use appearance avoid predators since similarity appearance obvious salticid spiders use display behaviours communicate members species also members ants birds commonly use displays courtship manakin birds family pipridae amazon undergo large demonstrations display behaviour order court females since males provide immediate benefit females must undergo ritualized behaviours order show fitness possible mates female uses information gathers interaction make decision mate display behaviour consists various flight patterns wing colour displays particular along invertebrates birds vertebrates like harbour seal also show display behaviour since harbour seal resides aquatic environment display behaviours expressed slightly different seen terrestrial mammal species male harbour seals show specific vocalization diving behaviours demonstrating behaviours possible seals distributed large area display behaviours slightly change geographically males try appeal largest number females possible large geographical range dive displays head flicks various vocalizations work together display behaviour signifies females colony males ready display set conspicuous behaviours allows attraction mates also result attraction predators result animals certain environmental social cues use decide beneficial time show behaviours use triggers minimize cost predator avoidance maximize gain mate first factor temporal depending time season animals specifically tropical frogs study show strong seasonal trends display behaviour favouring times closer beginning mating plausible allows time attraction mate decline calling end season also valid organisms mate need continue display behaviour depending upon species evolutionary histories environmental factors temperature elevation precipitation affect presence along environmental cues social cues also play role demonstration display behaviour example aggressive display behaviour crayfish orconectes virilistends triggered impositions crayfish previously established displays consist preliminary raising claws times sufficient warn encroach territory tactile engagement occur case display behaviour preliminary step engagement aggressive tactile behaviour whereas many cases display behaviour result engagement mating rituals human men advertise suitability mates signalling status social hierarchy often acquiring wealth fame papuan big men new guinea staged elaborate feasts show extent influence power potlatches pacific northwest held much effectcitation needed tournament species zoology species members one sex usually males compete order tournament species reproductive success small group competition winners predominantly higher large group losers tournament species characterized fierce samesex fighting significantly larger betterarmed individuals species advantage competing sex thus tournament species high sexual examples tournament species include grouse peafowl lions mountain gorillas elephant seals species members competing sex come together special display areas called leks species competition direct form fighting males small number species females compete males include species jacana species phalarope spotted
