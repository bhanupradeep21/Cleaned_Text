needed pursue career concert violinist decided go medical research attended public schools new york graduating john adams high going college pennsylvania graduated magna cum laude bs ursinus college received md university pennsylvania school medicine year johnson foundation medical physics edelman became resident massachusetts general hospital practiced medicine france serving us army medical edelman joined rockefeller institute medical research graduate fellow working laboratory henry kunkel receiving phd institute made assistant later associate dean graduate studies became professor school moved california became professor neurobiology scripps research nobel prize award edelman began research regulation primary cellular processes particularly control cell growth development multicelled organisms focusing celltocell interactions early embryonic development formation function nervous system studies led discovery cell adhesion molecules cams guide fundamental processes help animal achieve shape form nervous systems built one significant discoveries made research precursor gene neural cell adhesion molecule gave rise evolution entire molecular system adaptive efforts edelman elected member american academy arts sciences american philosophical society paris serving army edelman read book sparked interest decided since book said little antibodies would investigate upon returning united states led study physical chemistry research edelman colleagues rodney robert porter early produced fundamental breakthroughs understanding antibodys chemical structure opening door work edelman porter shared nobel prize physiology medicine nobel prize press release karolinska institutet lauded edelman porters work major breakthrough impact edelmans porters discoveries explained fact provided clear picture structure mode action group biologically particularly important substances laid firm foundation truly rational research something previously largely lacking immunology discoveries represent clearly breakthrough immediately incited fervent research activity whole world fields immunological science yielding results practical value clinical diagnostics edelmans early research structure antibody proteins revealed disulfide bonds link together protein protein subunits antibodies two types larger heavy chains smaller light chains two light two heavy chains linked together disulfide bonds form functional antibody using experimental data research work others edelman developed molecular models antibody key feature models included idea antigen binding domains antibodies fab include amino acids light heavy protein subunits interchain disulfide bonds help bring together two parts antigen binding domain edelman colleagues used cyanogen bromide proteases fragment antibody protein subunits smaller pieces could analyzed determination amino acid time first complete antibody sequence determined largest complete protein sequence ever determined availability amino acid sequences antibody proteins allowed recognition fact body produce many different antibody proteins similar antibody constant regions divergent antibody variable regions topobiology edelmans theory asserts morphogenesis driven differential adhesive interactions among heterogeneous cell populations explains single cell give rise complex multicellular organism proposed edelman topobiology process sculpts maintains differentiated tissues acquired energetically favored segregation cells heterologous cellular interactions later career edelman noted theory consciousness documented trilogy technical books several subsequent books written general audience including bright air brilliant fire universe consciousness giulio tononi wider sky second nature brain science human knowledge second nature edelman defines human consciousness first edelmans technical books mindful brain develops theory neural darwinism built around idea plasticity neural network response environment second book topobiology proposes theory original neuronal network newborns brain established development embryo remembered present contains extended exposition theory consciousness books edelman proposed biological theory consciousness based studies immune system explicitly roots theory within charles darwins theory natural selection citing key tenets darwins population theory postulates individual variation within species provides basis natural selection eventually leads evolution new explicitly rejected dualism also dismissed newer hypotheses socalled computational model consciousness liken brains functions operations computer edelman argued mind consciousness purely biological phenomena arising complex cellular processes within brain development consciousness intelligence explained darwinian theory edelmans theory seeks explain consciousness terms morphology brain brain comprises massive population neurons approx billion cells enormous number synaptic connections neurons development subset connections survive initial phases growth development make approximately trillion connections sample brain tissue size match head contains billion connections consider neuronal connections might variously combined number possible permutations becomes hyperastronomical order ten followed millions young brain contains many neural connections ultimately survive maturity edelman argued redundant capacity needed neurons cells body renewed networks best adapted ultimate purpose selected organize neuronal groups edelmans theory neuronal group selection
