microinvasive glaucoma surgery migs latest advance surgical treatment glaucoma aims reduce intraocular pressure either increasing outflow aqueous humor reducing production migs comprises group surgical procedures share common migs procedures involve minimally invasive approach often small cuts microincisions cornea causes least amount trauma surrounding scleral conjunctival tissues techniques minimize tissue scarring allowing possibility traditional glaucoma procedures trabeculectomy glaucoma valve implantation also known glaucoma drainage device performed future traditional glaucoma surgery generally involves external ab externo approach conjunctiva sclera however migs procedures reach surgical target internal ab interno route typically selfsealing corneal incision performing procedure internal approach migs procedures often reduce discomfort lead rapid recovery migs procedures offer fewer side effects procedures tend result less intraocular pressure iop
