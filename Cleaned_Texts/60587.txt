telson peculiar ornamentation loaned american princeton university paleontology professor benjamin franklin howell american paleontologist erik norman found fossil unique enough despite little material consisted argued telson one diagnostic parts eurypterid considered comparison eurypterids superfluous length telson ornamentation sufficient identification thus named new genus species dorfopterus angusticollis based fossil first part generic name dorfopterus honors american geologist princeton university professor erling dorf discovered beartooth butte formation second part

repeated opisthosomal opisthosoma abdomen tergites dorsal halves segments eurypterid abdomens divided year discovery specimens explanation later studies never mentioned position dorfopterus stylonuridae would accepted future researchers would first refer dorfopterus another eurypterid family called later classify uncertain animal unknown position within researchers even doubted dorfopterus eurypterid dorfopterus currently classified incertae sedis taxon unclear relationships genus within order eurypterida includes one single species dorfopterus originally dorfopterus classified part time family consisted genera brachyopterus campylocephalus ctenopterus drepanopterus melbournopterus stylonurus family since revised new genera assigned genera moved clades taxonomic genera even completely removed order dorfopterus would exception changes assigned stylonuridae due long narrow telson even though member family eurypterida whole known time ornamentation similar dorfopterus kjellesvigwaering genus classification within family would rendered tentative kjellesvigwaering although would continued norwegian paleontologist leif størmer revision british geologist

paleontologist victor p tollerton jr considering dorfopterus fragmentary inclusion specific eurypterid norwegian paleontologist odd erik tetlie unpublished phd thesis despite previously stated paper dorfopterus could provisionally kept parastylonuridae time due similarities similarities would also lead tetlie suggest dorfopterus parastylonurus could synonymous genera although act upon tetlie proposed fossil dorfopterus could represent telson strobilopterus princetonii unknown latter except juvenile specimen poorly fragmentarily two eurypterids found locality beartooth butte already suggested back unpublished determine whether case studied known specimen dorfopterus scanning electron microscope sem energy dispersive xray analysis edax way tetlie able confirm organism plant vertebrate animal erroneously labelled eurypterid manage reliably ensure classification dorfopterus within eurypterida thus tentatively formally synonymized angusticollis princetonii due lack information regarding telson however american british palaeontologists james c lamsdell paul antony selden doubted conclusion noting preservation style specimen dorfopterus different arthropods
