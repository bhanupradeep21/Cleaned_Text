periodic fever also refer periodic fever syndromes seven types attacks ninety percent patients first attack years old develop hours last anywhere hours days attacks involve various diagnostic criteria set telhashomer clinical criteria widely recognized diagnosis fmf sensitivity specificity criteria typical attacks consist following recurrent three episodes febrile rectal painful inflammation short duration hours incomplete attacks must recurrent differing typical attacks least one feature follows temperature attack duration longer shorter specified less hours days localized abdominal attacks

factors remains virtually cases due mutation mediterranean fever mefv gene chromosome codes protein called pyrin marenostrin various mutations gene lead fmf although mutations cause severe picture others mutations occur mainly exons function pyrin completely elucidated short protein binds adaptor asc pro form enzyme generate multiprotein complexes called inflammasomes response certain infections healthy individuals pyrinmediated inflammasome assembly leads caspase dependent processing secretion proinflammatory cytokines response enterotoxins certain gainoffunction mutations mefv gene render pyrin hyperactive subsequently formation inflammasomes becomes pathophysiology familial mediterranean fever recently undergone significant advances basal state pyrin kept inactive chaperone protein belonging family proteins linked pyrin phosphorylated serine dephosphoration pyrin essential prerequisite activation pyrin inflammasome inactivation rhoa gtpases bacterial toxins

milder fmf attack within hours mpt specific sensitive identify cases fmf although positive mpt attacks selflimiting require analgesia nsaids colchicine drug otherwise mainly used gout decreases attack frequency fmf patients exact way colchicine suppresses attacks unclear agent without side effects abdominal pain muscle pains may markedly improve quality life patients dosage typically mg day
