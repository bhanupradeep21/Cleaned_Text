abdomen colloquially called belly tummy midriff tucky stomach part body thorax chest pelvis humans vertebrates abdomen front part abdominal segment torso area occupied abdomen called abdominal cavity arthropods posterior tagma body follows thorax humans abdomen stretches thorax thoracic diaphragm pelvis pelvic brim pelvic brim stretches lumbosacral joint intervertebral disc pubic symphysis edge pelvic inlet space inlet thoracic diaphragm termed abdominal cavity boundary abdominal cavity abdominal wall front peritoneal surface rear vertebrates abdomen large body cavity enclosed abdominal muscles front sides part vertebral column back lower ribs also enclose ventral lateral walls abdominal cavity continuous pelvic cavity attached thoracic cavity diaphragm structures aorta inferior vena cava esophagus pass diaphragm abdominal pelvic cavities lined serous membrane known parietal peritoneum membrane continuous visceral peritoneum lining abdomen vertebrates contains number organs belonging instance digestive system urinary system muscular system abdominal cavity contains organs digestive system including stomach small intestine colon attached appendix digestive organs known accessory digestive organs include liver attached gallbladder pancreas communicate rest system via various ducts spleen organs urinary system including kidneys adrenal glands also lie within abdomen along many blood vessels including aorta inferior vena cava urinary bladder uterus fallopian tubes ovaries may seen either abdominal organs pelvic organs finally abdomen contains extensive membrane called peritoneum fold peritoneum may completely cover certain organs whereas may cover one side organs usually lie closer abdominal wall called retroperitoneum kidneys ureters known retroperitoneal organs abdominal organs highly specialized animals example stomach ruminants suborder mammals includes cattle sheep divided four chambers rumen reticulum omasum view various organs bloodvessels proximity liver relations viscera large vessels abdomen seen behind three layers muscles abdominal wall outside inside external oblique internal oblique transverse first three layers extend vertebral column lower ribs iliac crest pubis hip fibers merge towards midline surround rectus abdominis sheath joining opposite side linea alba strength gained crisscrossing fibers external oblique runs downward forward internal oblique upward forward transverse abdominal horizontally transverse abdominal muscle flat triangular fibers running horizontally lies internal oblique underlying transverse fascia originates inguinal ligament costal cartilages iliac crest thoracolumbar fascia inserts conjoint tendon xiphoid process linea alba pubic crest rectus abdominis muscles long flat muscle crossed three fibrous bands called tendinous intersections rectus abdominis enclosed thick sheath formed described fibers three muscles lateral abdominal wall originate pubis bone run abdomen either side linea alba insert cartilages fifth sixth seventh ribs region groin inguinal canal passage layers gap testes drop wall fibrous cord uterus female runs also weakness form cause inguinal pyramidalis muscle small triangular located lower abdomen front rectus abdominis originates pubic bone inserted linea alba halfway navel functionally human abdomen digestive tract placed absorption digestion food occurs alimentary tract abdomen consists lower esophagus stomach duodenum jejunum ileum cecum appendix ascending transverse descending colons sigmoid colon rectum vital organs inside abdomen include liver kidneys pancreas spleen abdominal wall split posterior back lateral sides anterior front walls abdominal muscles different important functions assist muscles exhalation breathing process forceful exhalation moreover muscles serve protection inner organs furthermore together back muscles provide postural support important defining form glottis closed thorax pelvis fixed integral cough urination defecation childbirth vomit singing pelvis fixed initiate movement trunk forward motion also prevent hyperextension thorax fixed pull pelvis finally bend vertebral column sideways assist trunks transverse abdominis muscle deepest muscle therefore touched outside greatly affect bodys posture internal obliques also deep also affect body posture involved rotation lateral flexion spine used bend support spine front external obliques superficial also involved rotation lateral flexion spine also stabilize spine upright rectus abdominis muscle superficial abdominal muscle tendonous sheath extending external obliques cover rectus abdominis rectus abdominis muscle fit people develop ab look although really pack vertical sections side bottom sections pubic bone usually visible hence pack abs rectus abdominals function bend ones back forward flexion main work abdominal muscles bend spine forward contracting social cultural perceptions outward appearance abdomen varying significance around world depending type society excess weight perceived indicator wealth prestige due excess food sign poor health due lack exercise many cultures bare abdomens distinctly sexualized perceived similarly breast cleavage key elements spinal support contributors good posture important properly exercise abdominal muscles together back muscles weak overly tight suffer painful spasms injuries properly exercised abdominal muscles contribute improved posture balance reduce likelihood back pain episodes reduce severity back pain protect injury responding efficiently stresses help avoid back surgeries help healing back problems spine surgery strengthened abdominal muscles provide flexibility well abdominal muscles worked practicing disciplines general body strength pilates yoga tai chi jogging also specific routines target muscles abdominal obesity condition abdominal fat visceral fat built excessively abdominal organs associated higher risk heart disease asthma type diabetes abdominal trauma injury abdomen involve damage abdominal organs associated risk severe blood loss injury lower chest cause injuries spleen scaphoid abdomen abdomen sucked newborn may represent diaphragmatic general indicative many gastrointestinal diseases affect abdominal organs include stomach disease liver disease pancreatic disease gallbladder bile duct disease intestinal diseases include enteritis coeliac disease diverticulitis ibs different medical procedures used examine organs gastrointestinal tract include endoscopy colonoscopy sigmoidoscopy enteroscopy oesophagogastroduodenoscopy virtual colonoscopy also number medical imaging techniques used surface landmarks important examination abdomen midline slight furrow extends xiphoid process pubic symphysis representing linea alba abdominal wall midpoint sits umbilicus navel rectus abdominis side linea alba stands muscular people outline muscles interrupted three transverse depressions indicating tendinous intersections usually one xiphoid process one navel one combination linea alba tendinous intersections form abdominal sixpack sought many people upper lateral limit abdomen

lower right upper right lowercitation needed quadrants also often used describing site abdominal abdomen also divided nine regions terms stem hypo meaning epi means chondron means cartilage case cartilage rib gaster means stomach reversal left right intentional anatomical designations reflect patients right left right iliac fossa rif common site pain tenderness patients appendicitis fossa named underlying iliac fossa hip bone thus somewhat imprecise anatomical structures produce pain tenderness region fact concavity ileum however term common usage arthropods abdomen built series upper plates known tergites lower plates known sternites whole held together tough yet stretchable membrane insects abdomen contains insects digestive tract reproductive organs consists eleven segments orders insects though eleventh segment absent adult higher orders number segments vary species species number segments visible reduced seven common honey bee collembola springtails abdomen six segments abdomen sometimes highly modified apocrita bees ants wasps first segment abdomen fused thorax called propodeum ants second segment forms narrow petiole ants additional postpetiole segment remaining segments form bulbous petiole gaster abdominal segments onward collectively called metasoma unlike arthropods insects possess legs abdomen adult form though protura rudimentary leglike appendages first three abdominal segments archaeognatha possess small articulated styli sometimes considered rudimentary appendages many larval insects including lepidoptera symphyta sawflies fleshy appendages called prolegs abdominal segments well familiar thoracic legs allow grip onto edges plant leaves walk around arachnids spiders scorpions relatives term abdomen used interchangeably
