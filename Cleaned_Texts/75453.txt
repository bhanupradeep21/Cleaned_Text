scenarios require emergent consultation cardiothoracic surgery heart failure due acute aortic regurgitation surgical emergency associated high mortality heart failure may occur rupture ventricular aneurysm form myocardial infarction ruptures free wall cause cardiac tamponade ruptures intraventricular septum create ventricular septal defect causes cardiac tamponade may also require surgical
