pressure iap direct influence discernible tone voice example person feeling confident breathing pattern deepen iap increase tone voice sound fuller stronger feeling anxious breathing become shallow iap decrease voice sound thinner weaker thus based upon persons mood reflected breathing pattern fundamental influencing factor tone voice body language tone voice tend convey sense mood body language vice versa notably handsfree devices use digital voice amazons alexa tend omit limit sound iap digital voice voice therefore lacks humanlike fullness tone sounds robotic certain body postures significantly influence tone voice instance someone speaking sitting chair hunched back obstructs breathing system including throat may muffle tone voice convey impression deenergised unhappy bored
