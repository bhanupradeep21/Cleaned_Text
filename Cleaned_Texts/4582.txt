obstructive shock one four types shock caused physical obstruction flow obstruction occur level great vessels heart causes include pulmonary embolism cardiac tamponade tension lifethreatening symptoms may include shortness breath weakness altered mental status low blood pressure tachycardia often seen shock symptoms depend underlying physiology obstructive shock similar cardiogenic shock types hearts output blood cardiac output decreased causes backup blood veins entering right jugular venous distension observed neck finding seen obstructive cardiogenic shock decrease cardiac output blood flow vital tissues decreased poor perfusion organs leads shock due similarities sources place obstructive shock category cardiogenic however important distinguish two types treatment cardiogenic shock problem function heart obstructive shock underlying problem pump rather input heart venous return decreased pressure heart pumping afterload higher treating underlying cause reverse example tension pneumothorax needs rapid needle decompression decreases pressure chest blood flow heart restored shock types shock low blood pressure key finding patients obstructive response low blood pressure heart rate increases shortness breath tachypnea hypoxia may present poor blood flow tissues patients may cold extremities less blood kidneys brain cause decreased urine output altered mental status signs may seen depending underlying cause example jugular venous distension significant finding evaluating shock occurs cardiogenic obstructive shock observed two types shock hypovolemic particular clinical findings described classic finding cardiac tamponade becks triad triad includes hypotension jugular vein distension muffled heart sounds kussmauls sign pulsus paradoxus may also lowvoltage qrs complexes electrical alternans signs ekg however ekg may show findings often shows tension pneumothorax would decreased breath sounds affected side tracheal deviation may also present shifted away affected side thus lung exam important findings may include decreased chest mobility air underneath skin subcutaneous pulmonary embolism similarly presents shortness breath hypoxia chest pain worse inspiration frequently seen chest pain also similar heart attack due right ventricular stress ischemia occur symptoms syncope dvt common cause thus symptoms including leg pain redness swelling likelihood pulmonary embolism evaluated various criteria wells score often calculated gives points based symptoms patient risk causes include obstruction blood flow heart multiple including pulmonary embolism cardiac tamponade tension pneumothorax causes include abdominal compartment syndrome severe aortic valve stenosis disorders aorta constrictive pericarditis rare cause masses grow press major blood vessels causing pneumothorax occurs air collects pleural space around lungs normally space negative pressure allow lung fill pressure increases air enters lung collapses impairing normal breathing surrounding structures may also shift severe enough cause shifts hypotension called tension pneumothorax lifethreatening increased pressure inside chest compress heart lead collapse blood vessels drain heart veins supplying heart compressed turn decreasing venous heart unable fill cardiac output drops hypotension shock ensue rapidly treated lead cardiac arrest pulmonary embolism pe obstruction pulmonary deaths pe estimated per year united states however may higher recent often obstruction blood clot traveled elsewhere body commonly deep vein thrombosis dvt legs risk factors conditions increase risk clotting includes genetic factor v leiden acquired conditions trauma surgery prolonged bedrest common risks recent risk obstruction increases pulmonary vascular resistance large enough clot increases load right side heart right ventricle must work harder pump blood lungs backup blood right ventricle begin dilate right heart failure ensue leading shock pe considered massive causes hypotension shock submassive pe causes right heart dysfunction without pericardial effusion fluid pericardial sac large enough pressure compresses heart causes shock preventing heart filling blood called cardiac tamponade chambers heart collapse pressure right heart thinner walls collapses easily less venous return cardiac output decreases lack blood flow vital organs cause various conditions cause pericardial effusion inflammation pericardium called caused renal autoimmune trauma cause blood fill pericardium cancer also cause whether effusion causes tamponade depends amount fluid long took accumulate fluid collects slowly pericardium stretch thus chronic effusion large acute effusions cause tamponade small tissue time rapid evaluation shock essential given lifethreatening nature diagnosis requires thorough history physical exam additional tests one must also consider possibility multiple types shock present example trauma patient may hypovolemic blood loss patient could also tension pneumothorax due trauma vital signs obstructive shock may show hypotension tachycardia andor hypoxia physical exam include thorough including jugular vein exam cardiac lung exams assessing skin tone response fluids may aid labs including metabolic panel assess electrolytes kidney liver function lactic acid rises due poor tissue perfusion may even initial sign shock rise blood pressure lactic acid lower appropriate treatment ekg also performed tachycardia often present specific findings may present based underlying bedside pointofcare echocardiography noninvasive help diagnose four types echocardiography look ventricular dysfunction effusions valve measurement vena cava breathing cycle help assess volume pointofcare echocardiogram also assess causes obstructive shock vena cava would dilated due obstruction pulmonary embolism right ventricle dilated findings include paradoxical septal motion clots right heart pulmonary artery echocardiography assess pericardial effusion tamponade collapse right atrium ventricle would seen due pressure pericardial chest xray rapidly identify pneumothorax seen absence lung markings ultrasound show lack lung sliding however imaging delay ct angiography standard diagnosis pulmonary embolism clots appear vasculature filling type shock rapid treatment essential delays therapy increase risk mortality often done diagnostic assessment still resuscitation addresses abcs airway breathing circulation supplemental oxygen given intubation performed indicated intravenous fluids increase blood pressure maintain blood flow however fluids given caution much fluid cause overload pulmonary cases fluids may beneficial fluids improve venous example tamponade prevents normal cardiac filling due pressure compressing heart case giving fluids improve right heart however causes obstructive shock much fluid worsen cardiac output thus fluid therapy monitored stabilizing measures treatment depends cause treatment underlying condition quickly resolve shock tension pneumothorax needle decompression done immediately chest tube also cardiac tamponade treated needle surgical needle pericardiocentesis done bedside often preferred therapy catheter may placed continued methods effective surgery may needed pericardial window surgery particularly cases massive pulmonary embolism requires thrombolysis embolectomy thrombolysis systemic via iv alteplase tpa catheterdirected tpa works break clot major risk tpa bleeding thus patients must assessed risk bleeding contraindications catheterdirected therapy involves giving tpa locally pulmonary artery also fragment remove clot embolectomy local therapy lower risk bleeding surgical embolectomy invasive treatment associated surgical mortality
