mutation genetic operator used maintain genetic diversity chromosomes population genetic generally evolutionary algorithm ea analogous biological mutation classic example mutation operator binary coded genetic algorithm ga involves probability arbitrary bit genetic sequence flipped original state common method implementing mutation operator involves generating random variable bit sequence random variable tells whether particular bit flipped mutation procedure based biological point mutation called single point mutation types mutation operators commonly used representations binary floatingpoint encodings representations combinatorial problems purpose mutation eas introduce diversity sampled population mutation operators used attempt avoid local minima preventing population chromosomes becoming similar thus slowing even stopping convergence global optimum reasoning also leads eas avoid taking fittest population generating next generation rather selecting random semirandom set weighting toward following requirements apply mutation operators used different genome types different mutation types suitable mutations gaussian uniform zigzag scramble insertion
