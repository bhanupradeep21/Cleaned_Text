iguanodontia basal member euiguanodontia turn formed clade ornithopods patagonia antarctica particularly trinisaura gasparinisaura anabisetia notohypsilophodon talenkauen macrogryphosaurus group called elasmaria whose members distinguished adaptation running lifestyle would reflected narrow foot thin fourth metatarsal indicates high speed running subsequently expanded chevrons feature associated greater surface area attachment lateral muscles tail would give good control movements curved humerus demonstrates absence deltopectoral ridge therefore front leg used walking determined however morrosaurus possessed characteristics due limited remains existence clade may indicate patagonia antarctica australia shared type fauna exact phylogenetic relationships within clade could identified except gasparinisaura proved basal member cladogram based phylogenetic analysis rozadilla et al hypsilophodon thescelosaurus gasparinisaura morrosaurus trinisaura macrogryphosaurus notohypsilophodon talenkauen anabisetia parksosaurus kangnasaurus rhabdodontidae tenontosaurus dryomorpha based hindlimb anatomy morrosaurus elasmarians notably slim metatarsus thought capable runners distinguishing herbivorous dinosaurs lived alongside elements relatives preserved morrosaurus expanded chevrons distinctive bony intercostal plates along torso wouldve aided cursorial abilities improving tail balance musculature control well breathing developed tail musculature running ability elasmarians noted developed elasmarian taxa ornithopods study conducted growth rate morrosaurus relative trinisaura use histological study thin samples holotype fibula fourth metatarsal ornithischian dinosaurs living polar regions northern hemisphere edmontosaurus pachyrhinosaurus typically show different growth rates relatives lower latitutes owing extreme temperatures environments studies failed find signs antarctic animals study confirmed pattern elasmarians comparison south american elasmarian gasparinisaura finding incredibly similar histology antarctic genera three show rapid growth periodic interruptions variation growth marks changes growth rate across life cycle growing slower aged similar growth strategies reported ornithopods much lower latitudes indicates rather adapting growth physiology response cold southern environments lived elasmarians able succeed ecosystems due existing possession necessary adaptations thrive higher growth rate noted morrosaurus compared trinisaura consistent larger species additionally found animals reached sexual maturity well skeletal maturity ceased growth later point consistent neonatal fossils elasmarians australia offer strong evidence elasmarians living year round highlatitude conditions rather migratory nature
