schön scandal concerns german physicist jan hendrik schön born august verden der aller lower saxony west germany briefly rose prominence series apparent breakthroughs semiconductors later discovered exposed schön received ottoklungweberbank prize physics braunschweig prize well outstanding young investigator award materials research society later scandal provoked discussion scientific community degree responsibility coauthors reviewers scientific articles debate centered whether peer review traditionally designed find errors determine relevance originality articles also required detect deliberate fraud schöns field research condensed matter physics received phd university konstanz late hired bell labs worked electronics conventional semiconducting elements silicon replaced crystalline organic meaning carbonbased materials schön however claimed spectacular ability changing conductivity organic materials far beyond anything achieved thus far measurements cases confirmed various theoretical predictions notably organic materials could made display superconductivity used lasers findings published prominent scientific publications including journals science nature gained worldwide attention however research group anywhere world succeeded reproducing results claimed listed author average one newly published research paper every eight year announced nature produced transistor molecular scale schön claimed used thin layer organic dye molecules assemble electric circuit acted electric current behaved transistor implications work significant would beginning move away siliconbased electronics toward organic electronics would allowed transistors continue shrinking past point silicon breaks therefore continue moores law much longer predicted also would drastically reduced cost electronics key element schöns work claimed successful observation various physical phenomena organic materials dependent transistor setup specifically schön claimed use thin layer aluminium oxide incorporated transistors using lab facilities university konstanz however equipment materials used common laboratories world none succeeded preparing aluminium oxide layers similar quality ones claimed soon schön published work singlemolecule semiconductors others physics community alleged data contained anomalies julia hsu lynn loo originally noticed problems schöns paper describing assembly molecular transistors attempting patent research lithography realizing schön duplicated hsu loo attempted initial experiments gather evidence patent relied scientific outcomes schöns work april loo hsu meeting patent lawyer john mccabe noticed duplicated lydia sohn princeton university noticed two experiments carried different temperatures identical editors nature pointed schön claimed accidentally submitted graph twice paul mceuen cornell university found noise paper describing third experiment research mceuen sohn loo physicists uncovered number examples duplicate data schöns work triggered series reactions quickly led lucent technologies ran bell labs start formal may bell labs set committee investigate malcolm beasley stanford university committee obtained information schöns coauthors interviewed three principal ones zhenan bao bertram batlogg christian examined electronic drafts disputed articles included processed numeric data committee requested copies raw data found schön kept laboratory notebooks raw data files erased computer according schön files erased computer limited hard drive space addition experimental samples discarded damaged beyond september committee publicly released report contained details allegations misconduct schöns part found evidence scientific misconduct least remaining unrelated publications troubling lacked compelling evidence misconduct found whole data sets reused number different experiments also found graphs purportedly plotted experimental data instead produced using mathematical report found misdeeds performed schön alone coauthors including bertram batlogg head team exonerated scientific misconduct sparked widespread scientific community blame misconduct distributed among coauthors particularly share significant part schön acknowledged data incorrect many claimed substitutions could occurred honest mistake omitted data stated show convincing evidence behavior observed researchers delft university technology thomas j watson research center since performed experiments similar schöns without achieving similar even allegations become public several research groups tried reproduce spectacular results field physics organic molecular materials without june university konstanz issued press release stating schöns doctoral degree revoked due dishonourable conduct department physics spokesman wolfgang dieterich called affair biggest fraud physics last years said credibility science brought schön appealed ruling october upheld response schön sued university appeared court testify september court overturned universitys decision september however november university moved appeal courts state court ruled september university correct revoking federal administrative court upheld state courts decision july federal constitutional court confirmed september october deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft dfg german research foundation joint committee announced sanctions former dfg postdoctorate fellow deprived active right vote dfg elections serve dfg committees eightyear period period schön also unable serve peer reviewer apply dfg schön returned germany took job engineering october science withdrew eight articles written december physical review withdrew six articles written february applied physics letters withdrew four articles written march nature withdrew seven articles written march advanced materials withdrew two articles written may science withdrew another article written retraction notices february applied physics letters relayed concerns seven articles written schön published applied physics retraction notice march advanced materials mentions concerns another article written
