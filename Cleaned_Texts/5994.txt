sir richard timothy hunt frs fmedsci frse mae born february british biochemist molecular physiologist awarded nobel prize physiology medicine paul nurse leland h hartwell discoveries protein molecules control division cells studying fertilized sea urchin eggs early hunt discovered cyclin protein cyclically aggregates depleted cell division cycles hunt born february neston cheshire richard william hunt lecturer palaeography liverpool kit rowland daughter timber death parents hunt found father worked bush house headquarters bbc world service radio likely intelligence although known actually richard became keeper western manuscripts bodleian library family relocated oxford age eight hunt accepted dragon first developed interest biology thanks german teacher gerd fourteen moved magdalen college school oxford science prizes bear name becoming even interested science studying subjects chemistry accepted clare college cambridge study natural sciences graduating immediately beginning work university department biochemistry asher worked scientists louis reichardt tony talk vernon ingram interested haemoglobin synthesis greek conference subject persuaded haematologist geneticist irving london allow work laboratory albert einstein college medicine new york staying july october phd supervised asher focused haemoglobin synthesis intact rabbit reticulocytes immature red blood cells awarded following phd hunt returned new york work london collaboration nechama kosower husband edward kosower ellie ehrenfeld discovered tiny amounts glutathione inhibited protein synthesis reticulocytes tiny amounts rna killed synthesis altogether returning cambridge began work tony hunter richard jackson discovered rna strand used start haemoglobin synthesis years team discovered least two chemicals acting hunt regularly spent summers working marine biological laboratory woods hole massachusetts popular scientists advanced summer courses particular interested study mitosis location provided ready supply surf clams sea urchins amongst reefs fishing docks invertebrates particularly useful study synthesis proteins embryogenesis embryos simply generated application filtered sea water transparency embryo cells well suited microscopic woods hole summer using sea urchin arbacia punctulata egg model organism discovered cyclin hunt keen cyclist named protein based observation cyclical changes cyclins proteins play key role regulating celldivision hunt found cyclins begin synthesised eggs fertilised increase levels interphase drop quickly middle mitosis cell division also found cyclins present vertebrate cells also regulate cell cycle others subsequently showed cyclins bind activate family protein kinases called cyclindependent kinases one identified crucial cell cycle regulator paul nurse cyclin mechanism cell division fundamental living organisms excluding bacteria thus study process simple organisms helps shed light growth tumours began work imperial cancer research fund later known cancer research uk london research institute united kingdom work focused understanding makes cell go cancerous proliferate uncontrollably ordinary inhibitory signals switched hunt laboratory clare hall laboratories end remains emeritus group leader francis crick member advisory council campaign science served selection committee shaw prize life science hunt joined academic advisory board austrian think tank academia superior institute future hunt highly regarded colleague mentor research career supervised numerous phd students including hugh jonathon addition scientific contributions hunt lifelong advocate scientific research winning nobel prize spent much time traveling world talking popular specialist audiences talks offered characteristic perspective inquiry emphasizes importance fun also believes science benefits power given young june hunt became target online shaming campaign remarks made science journalism controversy forced resignation several key research policy positions including european research council temporary withdrawal public life professional hunt elected member european molecular biology organization embo serving member organisations fellowship committee meeting committee governing body council elected fellow royal society frs certificate election distinguished studies control protein synthesis animal cells discovery cyclin protein regulates eukaryotic cell cycle together jackson students defined steps formation initiation complex protein synthesis showing ribosomal subunit binds initiator trna binds mrna step target inhibitors doublestranded rna haem deficiency showed inhibition protein synthesis mediated reversible phosphorylation initiation factor two distinct protein kinases elucidated unexpected roles thioredoxin thioredoxin reductase protein synthesis ruderman rosenthal demonstrated selective translational control mrna early clam embryos led hunts discovery cyclin protein selectively destroyed mitosis subsequently cloned sequenced cyclin cdna sea urchins frogs showed elegant mrna ablation experiments cyclin translation necessary mitosis frog embryos also shown cyclin subunit mitosispromoting factor regulates entry mitosis discovery characterization cyclin major contributions knowledge cell cycle regulation eukaryotic cells hunt elected fellow uks academy medical sciences fmedsci foreign associate us national academy sciences awarded nobel prize physiology medicine leland hartwell paul nurse discoveries regarding cell cycle regulation cyclin cyclindependent kinases three laureates cited discoveries key regulators cell cycle hunt particular awarded discovery cyclins proteins regulate cdk function showed cyclins degraded periodically cell division mechanism proved general importance cell cycle hunt made honorary fellow royal society edinburgh awarded royal societys royal medal two presented annually important contributions advancement natural knowledge case discovering key aspect cell cycle control protein cyclin component cyclin dependent kinases demonstrating ability grasp significance result outside immediate sphere hunt knighted birthday honours
