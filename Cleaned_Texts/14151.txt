hydrocele accumulation serous fluid body cavity hydrocele testis common form hydrocele accumulation fluids around testicle often caused fluid collecting within layer wrapped around testicle called tunica vaginalis derived peritoneum provided hernia present goes away without treatment first year although hydroceles usually develop males rare instances described females canal primary hydroceles may develop adulthood particularly elderly hot countries slow accumulation serous fluid presumably caused impaired reabsorption appears explanation primary hydroceles although reason remains obscurecitation needed hydrocele also result plugged inguinal lymphatic system caused repeated chronic infection wuchereria bancrofti brugia malayi two mosquitoborne parasites africa southeast asia respectively condition would part diffuse sequelae commonly referred elephantiasis also affects lymphatic system parts body among complications hydrocele arecitation needed complications often diagnosed postoperatively differentiated duplex ultrasound scanning bit observed hours early complications drainage infection formation haematocele rupture etc also weeks followup outpatient basiscitation needed hydrocele produced four ways swelling soft nontender large size examination testis usually felt presence fluid demonstrated transillumination hydroceles reach huge size containing large amount fluid painless often ignored otherwise asymptomatic size weight causing inconvenience however long continued presence large hydroceles causes atrophy testis due compression obstructing blood supply cases hydrocele diagnosed early complete physical examination small testis easily palpated within lax hydrocele however ultrasound imaging necessary visualize testis hydrocele sac dense reveal primary abnormality become large cases left unattended hydroceles usually painless testicular tumors common method diagnosing hydrocele attempting shine strong light transillumination enlarged scrotum hydrocele usually pass light tumor except case malignancy reactive hydrocelecitation needed secondary hydroceles due testicular diseases result cancer trauma hernia orchitis inflammation testis also occur infants undergoing peritoneal dialysis hydrocele cancer excluded clinically presence testicular tumor suspected however publications world literature report hydrocele association testicular cancer secondary hydrocele frequently associated acute chronic epididymoorchitis also seen torsion testis testicular tumors secondary hydrocele usually lax moderate size underlying testis palpable secondary hydrocele subsides primary lesion resolvescitation needed occur infants occurs adults also hydrocele usually expression patent processus vaginalis ppv tunica processus vaginalis distended inguinal ring connection peritoneal cavitycitation needed processus vaginalis patent connects general peritoneal cavity communication usually small allow herniation intraabdominal contents digital pressure hydrocele usually empty hydrocele fluid may drain peritoneal cavity child lying ascites even ascitic tuberculous peritonitis considered swellings bilateralcitation needed smooth oval swelling near spermatic cord liable mistaken inguinal hernia swelling moves downwards becomes less mobile testis pulled gently downwards rarely hydrocele develops remnant processus vaginalis somewhere along course spermatic cord hydrocele also transilluminates known encysted hydrocele cord females related region females multicystic hydrocele canal sometimes presents swelling groin probably results cystic degeneration round ligament unlike hydrocele cord hydrocele canal nuck always least partially within inguinal canalcitation needed accuracy diagnosis must ascertained great care must taken differentiate hydrocele scrotal hernia tumor testicle ultrasound imaging useful cases hernia usually reduced transmits cough impulse translucent hydrocele reduced inguinal canal gives impulse coughing unless hernia also present young children hydrocele often associated complete congenital type hernial saccitation needed primary hydrocele described following characteristicscitation needed hydroceles appearing first year life resolve without hydroceles persist first year occur later life require treatment selected cases patients symptomatic pain pressure sensation scrotal skin integrity compromised chronic irritation treatment choice surgery operation conducted via open access technique aiming excise hydrocele anesthesia required operation general anesthesia choice children spinal anesthesia usually sufficient adults local infiltration anesthesia satisfactory abolish abdominal pain due traction spermatic longstanding cases hydrocele fluid may opalescent cholesterol may contain crystals aspiration primary hydrocele fluid reaccumulates following months periodic aspiration operation needed younger patients operation usually preferredcitation needed sclerotherapy alternative aspiration aqueous phenol ml together lidocaine analgesia injected often inhibits reaccumulation alternative treatments generally regarded unsatisfactory high incidence recurrences frequent necessity
