silkworms produce one brood season generally found around europe univoltine eggs must hibernate winter ultimately crossfertilizing spring bivoltine varieties normally found east asia accelerated breeding process made possible slightly warmer climates addition polyvoltine silkworms found tropics eggs typically hatch within days meaning eight generations larvae throughout eggs take days hatch larvae eat continuously preference white mulberry attraction mulberry odorant cisjasmone monophagous since eat species morus well moraceae mostly osage orange covered tiny black hairs color heads
