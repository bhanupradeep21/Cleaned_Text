bacteriology grampositive bacteria bacteria give positive result gram stain test traditionally used quickly classify bacteria two broad categories according type cell wall grampositive bacteria take crystal violet stain used test appear purplecoloured seen optical microscope thick layer peptidoglycan bacterial cell wall retains stain washed away rest sample decolorization stage test conversely gramnegative bacteria retain violet stain decolorization step alcohol used stage degrades outer membrane gramnegative cells making cell wall porous incapable retaining crystal violet stain peptidoglycan layer much thinner sandwiched inner cell membrane bacterial outer membrane causing take counterstain safranin fuchsine appear red pink despite thicker peptidoglycan layer grampositive bacteria receptive certain cell antibiotics gramnegative bacteria due absence outer general following characteristics present grampositive species capsule usually consisting polysaccharides also species flagellates flagella two basal body rings support whereas gramnegative four grampositive gramnegative bacteria commonly surface layer called slayer grampositive bacteria slayer attached peptidoglycan layer gramnegative bacterias slayer attached directly outer membrane specific grampositive bacteria presence teichoic acids cell wall lipoteichoic acids lipid component cell membrane assist anchoring peptidoglycancitation needed along cell shape gram staining rapid method used differentiate bacterial species staining together growth requirement antibiotic susceptibility testing macroscopic physiologic tests forms basis practical classification subdivision bacteria eg see figure versions bergeys manual systematic bacteriology historically kingdom monera divided four divisions

carl woese collaborators colleagues university illinois monophyly grampositive bacteria major implications therapeutic general study organisms based molecular studies sequences woese recognised twelve bacterial phyla two grampositive divided proportion guanine cytosine content dna high g c phylum made actinobacteria low g c phylum contained actinomycetota include corynebacterium mycobacterium nocardia streptomyces genera low g c bacillota gc content lower although bacteria traditionally divided two main groups grampositive gramnegative based gram stain retention property classification system ambiguous refers three distinct aspects staining result envelope organization taxonomic group necessarily coalesce bacterial grampositive gramnegative staining response also reliable characteristic two kinds bacteria form phylogenetic coherent however although gram staining response empirical criterion basis lies marked differences ultrastructure chemical composition bacterial cell wall marked absence presence outer lipid grampositive bacteria bounded singleunit lipid membrane general contain thick layer nm peptidoglycan responsible retaining gram stain number bounded single membrane stain gramnegative due either lack peptidoglycan layer mycoplasmas inability retain gram stain cell wall show close relationship grampositive bacteria bacterial cells bounded single cell membrane term monoderm bacteria contrast grampositive bacteria typical gramnegative bacteria bounded cytoplasmic membrane outer cell membrane contain thin layer peptidoglycan nm membranes presence inner outer cell membranes defines new compartment cells periplasmic space periplasmic compartment bacteria designated diderm distinction monoderm diderm bacteria supported conserved signature indels number important proteins viz dnak two structurally distinct groups bacteria monoderms indicated ancestral based upon number observations including grampositive bacteria major producers antibiotics general gramnegative bacteria resistant proposed outer cell membrane gramnegative bacteria diderms evolved protective mechanism antibiotic selection bacteria deinococcus stain grampositive due presence thick peptidoglycan layer also possess outer cell membrane suggested intermediates transition monoderm grampositive diderm gramnegative diderm bacteria also differentiated simple diderms lacking lipopolysaccharide archetypical diderm bacteria outer cell membrane contains lipopolysaccharide diderm bacteria outer cell membrane made mycolic general grampositive bacteria monoderms single lipid bilayer whereas gramnegative bacteria diderms two bilayers exceptions include bacillota species grampositive class negativicutes includes selenomonas diderm stain additionally

protein distinguishes traditional phyla gramnegative bacteria eg pseudomonadota aquificota chlamydiota bacteroidota chlorobiota cyanobacteria fibrobacterota verrucomicrobiota planctomycetota spirochaetota acidobacteriota etc atypical diderm bacteria well phyla monoderm bacteria eg actinomycetota bacillota thermotogota chloroflexota presence csi sequenced species conventional lps
