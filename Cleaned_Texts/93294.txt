pachagnathus earth jaw extinct genus nonpterodactyloid pterosaur late rhaetianaged quebrada del barro formation argentina lived late triassic period million years one known definitive triassic pterosaurs southern hemisphere along contemporaneous related yelaphomte also one known continental triassic pterosaurs indicating absence early pterosaurs southern hemisphere terrestrial environments likely sampling bias true absence type known specimen pachagnathus pvsj collected fieldwork museo de ciencias naturales universidad nacional de san juan consists broken portion front end lower jaw

formation within carrizal basin northwestern argentina part caucete department san juan province quebrada del puma locality occurs upper layers quebrada del barro formation southern outcrops roughly dated around late norian rhaetian based faunal assemblages pvsj discovered horizon reddish muddy sandstone top formation beneath unconformably overlying cretaceous aged el gigante pvsj described new genus species pachagnathus benitoi ricardo n martínez colleagues generic name combination aymara language aymara people indigenous andes latinised greek aymara pacha earth referring inland environment inhabited gnathos meaning jaw specific name named benito leyes inhabitant town balde de leyes first found fossils balde de leyes locality guided martínez team known part pachagnathus portion front lower jaws consisting mandibular symphysis fused portion tips lower jaw although jaw tip missing symphysis notably long including least five pairs teeth likely even longer symphysis narrow laterally compressed much edges jaw tips parallel preserved length mm maximum width mm unusual feature symphysis ridge along surface mandible running teeth uniquely pterosaurs repeatedly alternates single midline ridge gaps along toothrow splitting pair pairs teeth leaving elliptical depressions ridge likely created occlusal ridges along tooth row greatly emarginated compressed single midline ridge combination midline keel series fossae known margins dentary slope inwards form sharp keel along bottom giving jaw subtriangular crosssection roughly two times deep wide jaw deepest level second preserved tooth symphyseal ridge drawn high eminence similar raeticodactylus lesser extent lower eminence tooth sockets bulge prominently jaw separated deep bowlshaped concavities jaw bone teeth dental margin highly invaginated bowllike depressions unknown pterosaurs although comparable similar cupshaped structures reported raeticodactylus caviramus differ size position orientation teeth front spaced apart twice width tooth comparable rhamphorhynchids teeth poorly preserved present indicate elliptical crosssection almost twice long fronttoback sidetoside enamel striated running top bottom welldefined unserrated keels front back edges partially preserved tooth crown teeth estimated slightly backwardcurving spikes roughly five times taller base width similar condition various rhamphorhynchid pterosaurs eg rhamphorhynchus angustinaripterus first two teeth preserved jaw noticeably larger teeth behind wider bases first three teeth also angled forwards procumbent sides remaining teeth vertical leaving wide angle third fourth preserved tooth positions determine relationships pachagnathus pterosaurs martínez performed phylogenetic analysis using updated version pterosaur data matrix published andres et al analysis recovered pachagnathus member raeticodactylidae could resolve relationships raeticodactylus yelaphomte beyond polytomy three species due lack overlapping material simplified version results focused eopterosauria shown cladogram macronychoptera austriadactylus cristatus preondactylus buffarinii peteinosaurus zambellii caviramus schesaplanensis pachagnathus benitoi raeticodactylus filisurensis yelaphomte praderioi seazzadactylus venieri eudimorphodon cromptonellus eudimorphodon rosenfeldi eudimorphodon ranzii additional analysis using diapsid reptile data matrix ezcurra et al also used confirm inclusion pachagnathus within pterosaurs broadly notably analysis pachagnathus recovered parsimoniously two times much derived position closer rhamphorhynchids raising possibility one earliest members clade however pachagnathus share similarities rhamphorhynchids size spacing teeth martínez colleagues considered unlikely pachagnathus shares several traits diagnostic raeticodactylidae namely high mandibular eminence deep fused symphysis cupshaped structures ridged occlusal margins anterior well eudimorphodontoid synapomorphy anterior teeth pachagnathus lived continental environment long distance nearest coast therefore almost certainly terrestrial animal compared various coastal triassic pterosaurs found northern hemisphere corroborates hypotheses significant parts early pterosaur evolution may taken place terrestrial quebrada del barro formation also produced remains smaller related
