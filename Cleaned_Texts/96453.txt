rectal discharge intermittent continuous expression liquid anus per rectum normal rectal mucus needed proper excretion waste otherwise closely related types fecal incontinence eg fecal leakage term rectal discharge necessarily imply degrees incontinence types fecal incontinence produce liquid leakage could thought type rectal discharge different types discharge described generally rectal discharge refers either mucous purulent discharge depending upon definition rectal discharge used following could included many different types rectal discharge common presentation discharge passage mucus pus wrapped around otherwise normal bowel rectal discharge many causes may present pus usually indicates infection frequently medical sources differentiate two types discharge instead using general term mucopurulent discharge strictly speaking used refer discharge contains mucus pus purulent discharges may bloodstreakedcitation needed mucus coats walls colon health functioning protective barrier also aid peristalsis lubrication stool mucous discharges thought three broad categories mucous rectal discharge may bloodstreaked conditions blood homogenously mixed mucus creating pink goo example could socalled red currant jelly stools intussusception appearance refers mixture sloughed mucosa mucus note mucus noun used name substance mucous adjective used describe discharge mucoid also adjective means mucuslike mucinous strictly speaking refers something mucinlike attribute often used interchangeably word mucous mucus usually contains high percentage mucin differential diagnosis rectal discharge extensive general etiological themes infection lesions cause discharge mechanically interfering preventing complete closure anal canal type lesion may cause discharge intrinsically instead allow transit liquid stool components mucus perianal crohns disease associated fistulizing fissuring perianal abscess colostomy distal section bowel continues produce mucus despite fecal diversion often resulting mucinous occasionally intestinal parasitic infection present discharge example several pathologies present perianal discharge although exactly rectal discharge perianal discharge misinterpreted given anatomical proximitycitation needed fistulae draining perianal region well pilonidal diseases main entities fall within category perianal tumours also discharge fungate otherwise become cystic necroticcitation needed proctitis inflammation lining including distal cm rectumcitation needed proctitis many causes common infection causes include sexual intercourse someone sexually transmitted disease std infection foodborne illness strep throat proctitis may also caused types inflammatory bowel disease radiation therapy injury rectum anus types neededcitation needed tuberculosis proctitis create mucous anal warts irregular verrucous lesions caused human papilloma virus anal warts usually transmitted unprotected anoreceptive intercourse anal warts may may cause rectal discharge anal wetness rectal bleeding pruritus lesions also occur within anal canal likely create symptomscitation needed bacterium chlamydia trachomatis cause conditions humans viz trachoma lymphogranuloma venereum trachoma cause asymptomatic proctitis symptoms lymphogranuloma venereum usually severe including pruritus ani purulent rectal discharge hematochezia rectal pain diarrhea lymphogranuloma venereum cause fistulas strictures anorectal abscesses left untreated hence confused crohns rectal gonorrhea caused neisseria condition usually asymptomatic symptoms include rectal discharge creamy purulent bloody pruritus ani tenesmus possibly constipation symptomatic usually appear days discharge common symptom usually brownish mucopurulent anorectal syphilis caused treponema pallidum contracted anoreceptive intercourse symptoms usually minimal mucous discharge bleeding tenesmus may fecal stream diverted part colostomy condition called diversion colitis may develop section bowel longer contact stool mucosal lining nourished shortchain fatty acids produced result bacterial fermentation gut longterm lack exposure nutrients cause inflammation colon symptoms include rectal bleeding mucous discharge tenesmus abdominal anal carcinoma much less common colorectal cancer common form squamous cell carcinoma followed adenocarcinoma scc usually occurs anal canal rarely anal margin anal margin scc presents lesion rolled everted edges central symptoms include painful lump bleeding pruritus ani tenesmus discharge possibly fecal incontinence ssc anal canal commonly causes bleeding may also cause anal pain lump pruritus ani discharge tenesmus change bowel habits fecal incontinence symptoms unspecific symptoms anal carcinoma may always typical lead delays rare neoplasms site give rise discharge include pagets disease possibly type adenocarcinoma verrucous adenoma common colorectal polyp adenomas malignant rarely adenocarcinoma develop large adenomas cause rectal bleeding mucus discharge tenesmus sensation urgency mucus production may great cause electrolyte disturbances juvenile polyps may cause rectal discharge httpsenwikipediaorgwikirectaldischarge
