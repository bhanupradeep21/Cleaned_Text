symbiotic prokaryotes eukaryotic cells symbiotic adaptation protozoan host undergone alterations reduced paraflagellar rod required full motility bacterial flagella yet paraflagellar rod gene fully

protozoan separate mitochondria provide electron transport system production cellular energy atp molecules produced bacterium known provide essential nutrients host synthesises amino nitrogenous bases protozoan haem necessary growth development bacterium also provides enzymes urea cycle absent host return protozoan offers enzymes complete metabolic pathways biosynthesis amino acids lipids

divides first followed protozoan organelles lastly nucleus result daughter protozoans contains exactly copies organelles bacterial entire reproduction takes hours ideal culture medium thus single protozoan able produce daughter cells day though differ slightly natural symbiotic bacteria trypanosomatid protozoa descended deanei bacteria ca kinetoplastibacterium crithidii coevolved mutualistic

bacterium belongs βproteobacterium family alcaligenaceae based rrna gene sequences known originated common ancestor one strigomonas culicis two groups assumed enter two different host protozoans evolve different species hence scientific name candidatus kinetoplastibacterium crithidii given although initially proposed bacterium evolved common ancestor members however detailed phylogenomic
