prebiotics compounds food foster growth activity beneficial microorganisms bacteria common environment considered gastrointestinal tract prebiotics alter composition organisms gut microbiome dietary prebiotics typically nondigestible fiber compounds pass undigested upper part gastrointestinal tract help growth activity advantageous bacteria colon acting substrates first identified named marcel

recent years current prebiotic targets expanded wider range microbes including roseburia spp eubacterium spp akkermansia spp christensenella spp propionibacterium spp faecalibacterium bacteria highlighted key probiotics beneficial gut bacteria may several beneficial effects host terms improving digestion including limited enhancing mineral effectiveness intrinsic strength immune bifidobacteria lactobacillus shown differing prebiotic specificity selectively ferment prebiotic fiber based enzymes characteristic bacterial thus lactobacilli prefer inulin fructooligosaccharides bifidobacteria display specificity inulin fructooligosaccharides xylooligosaccharides studies also shown prebiotics besides helping growth beneficial gut bacteria also inhibit detrimental potentially pathogenic microbes fermentation main mechanism action prebiotics used beneficial bacteria bifidobacteria lactobacillus bacterial populations use saccharolytic metabolism break bifidobacterial genome contains many genes encode carbohydratemodifying enzymes well genes encode carbohydrate uptake proteins presence genes indicates bifidobacteria contain specific metabolic pathways specialized
