imitative learning type social learning whereby new behaviors acquired via imitation aids communication social interaction ability modulate ones emotions account emotions others essential healthy sensorimotor development social ability match ones actions observed others occurs humans imitative learning plays important role humans cultural imitative learning different observational learning requires duplication behaviour exhibited model whereas observational learning occur learner observes unwanted behaviour subsequent consequences result learns avoid behaviour basic level research performed al saggerson david n george rc honey showed pigeons able learn basic process would lead delivery reward watching demonstrator demonstrator pigeon trained peck panel response one stimulus eg red light hop panel response second stimulus eg green light proficiency task established demonstrator pigeon learner pigeons placed videomonitored observation chamber every second observed trial learner pigeons individually placed demonstrator pigeons box presented test learner pigeons displayed competent performance task thus concluded learner pigeons formed responseoutcome association observing however researchers noted alternative interpretation results could learner pigeons instead acquired outcomeresponse associations guided behavior testing needed establish valid alternative similar study conducted chesler compared kittens learning press lever food seeing mother kittens stimulus form flickering light presented kitten press lever order obtain food reward experiment tested responses three groups kittens observed mothers performance first attempting task observed strange females performance demonstrator complete trial error control group study found kittens observed mother attempting task acquired leverpressing response faster kittens observed strange females response kittens conducting task trial error never acquired response result suggests kittens learned imitating model study also speculates whether primacy imitative learning opposed trial end error due social biological response mother type learning bias whether true imitation occurs animals debated topic action instance imitative learning animal must observe reproduce specific pattern movements produced model researchers proposed evidence true imitation occur nonprimates observational learning exhibited involves less cognitively complex means stimulus chimpanzees apt learning emulation rather true imitation exception encultured chimpanzees chimpanzees raised children one study buttelman et al encultured chimpanzees found behave similarly young children imitate even actions non instrumental achieving desired studies true imitation encultered chimpanzees even imitated behaviour model time initially observing imitative learning well documented humans often used comparison group studies imitative learning study horner whiten compared actions nonencultured chimpanzees human children found children overimitated actions beyond study children chimpanzees ages shown series actions open opaque puzzle box reward inside two actions necessary open box one however known subjects demonstrator performed three actions open box chimpanzees children attempted task children chimpanzees copied three behaviours received reward inside box next phase study involved transparent box instead opaque box due transparency box could clearly seen one three actions necessary receive reward chimpanzees perform unnecessary action performed two actions necessary achieve desired goal young children imitated three actions despite fact could selectively ignored irrelevant actions one explanation humans follow conventions study clegg legare tested demonstrating method making necklace young demonstrations model added step necessary achievement final goal completing necklace one demonstration model used language cue inform children making necklace instrumental eg going make necklace lets watch going make another demonstration model used language cues imply making necklace according convention eg always way everyone always way lets watch everyone always conventional condition children copied model fidelity including unnecessary step instrumental condition copy unnecessary step study suggests children discern imitate viewing convention salient reason copying behaviour order fit convention taking cues proper behaviour actions others rather using independent judgement called conformity bias recent research shown humans also subject biases selecting whose behaviour imitate humans imitate individuals deem successful field also wish successful success bias well respected prestigious individuals others preferentially learn prestige study chudek et al attentional cue used indicate children particular model experiment two models playing toy different ways prestige indicated two observers watching prestigious model seconds study found children picked cue signified prestige preferentially imitated prestigious model study suggests biases help humans pick direct indirect cues individual possesses knowledge worth learning cues lead humans imitating harmful behaviours copycat suicides occur person attempting suicide copies method suicide attempt heard seen media significant rise attempts seen celebrity suicides see werther effect suicides spread social networks like epidemic due large groups people imitating behaviour model group models see blue whale challenge initiative learning used robotics alternative traditional reinforcement learning traditional reinforcement learning algorithms start essentially taking random actions left figure correct sequence actions achieve goal however approach fail robotics reward function may extremely sparse eg robot either succeeds fails inbetween success requires robot complete complex sequence actions reinforcement learning algorithm may struggle make progress training imitative learning used create set successful examples reinforcement learning algorithm learn human researcher manually pilot robot record actions taken successful examples guide reinforcement learning algorithm right path
