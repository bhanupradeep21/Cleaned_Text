biology optimality models tool used evaluate costs benefits different organismal features traits characteristics including behavior natural world evaluation allows researchers make predictions organisms optimal behavior aspects phenotype optimality modeling modeling aspect optimization theory allows calculation visualization costs benefits influence outcome decision contributes understanding adaptations approach based optimality models biology sometimes called optimality optimal behavior defined action maximizes difference costs benefits decision three primary variables used optimality models behavior decisions currency decision involves evolutionary considerations costs benefits actions currency defined variable intended maximized ex food per unit energy expenditure driving factor behind action usually involves food items essential organisms survival constraints refer limitations placed behavior time energy used conduct behavior possibly limitations inherent sensory abilities optimality models used predict optimal behavior ex time spent foraging make predictions optimal behavior costbenefit graphs used visualize optimality model see fig optimality occurs point difference benefits costs obtaining currency via particular behavior maximized construct optimality model behavior must first clearly defined descriptions costs benefits vary way behavior performed must examples benefits costs include direct fitness measures like offspring produced change lifespan time spent gained energy spent gained time organism displays certain behavior must weigh costs benefits make decision example given x amount time traveling catching one bug would better bird continue foraging quickly return nest feed better understanding relationships values model leads better predictions organism behavior determine optimum time spent behavior one make graph showing benefits costs change behavior optimality defined point difference benefits costs behavior maximized

value theorem discovered cases two male dung flies copulate female relatively rapid succession second male fertilize eggs first male fertilize creates dilemma male dung flies longer remain female copulation better able guard copulating males hence increasing likelihood passing genes offspring however longer male remains individual female smaller chance finding mates geoff parker predicted optimality model comparing two behaviors would affected travel time two example short distances cowpats widen pool available mates specific geographic location parker predicted condition dung flies would likely leave current mate sooner find additional mates cowpats far would benefit male dung fly spend time guarding mate ensuring genes passed may difficulty finding additional mate results parkers experiment agree model one common use optimality model optimal foraging theory example foraging behavior starlings predicted using optimality model specifically marginal value theorem model researchers compared amount time bird forages distance bird travels foraging birds try maximize amount food take back offspring starlings mostly feed offspring leatherjacketscitation needed starlings gather leatherjackets becomes increasingly difficult timeconsuming find subsequent leatherjackets additional prey mouths thus point benefits stop expending extra energy find additional food return nests instead graph phenomenon called loading curve compares foraging time number prey captured alex kacelnik predicted curve would fluctuate depending starlings travel time predicted starlings traveling would spend time foraging site achieve optimal foraging behavior important starlings spend extra time foraging ground takes lot energy travel back forth nest hand predicted starlings traveling shorter distances foraging grounds spend less time foraging making frequent trips order optimize behavior since starlings shorter distance travel need put much energy searching leatherjackets easier return foraging ground results consistent predictions authors argued optimality models may insufficient explaining organisms degree optimization response natural selection
