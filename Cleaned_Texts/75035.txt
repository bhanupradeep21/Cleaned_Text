lindsley prize behavioral neuroscience functioning circadian pacemaker system cellular level bulla gouldiana blocks students conducted continuous intracellular recording constant darkness demonstrated basal retinal neurons brn bulla eye exhibit clear circadian rhythms rhythms also shown correlated oneforone compound action potentials produced optic change membrane potential brns electrically coupled shown precede occur simultaneously increased compound action potential frequency increase firing frequency depolarization brns seen day reverse night results demonstrated brns minimum output pacemaker pathway provided evidence good candidates circadian pacemaker neurons research expanded several years later breakthrough study published science dr stephan michel others working blocks laboratory demonstrated circadian rhythms brn membrane conductance could persist spontaneously isolated spontaneous circadian rhythms shown brns isolation retinal cells isolation showed circadian rhythms membrane conductance caused primarily potassium ion current brns isolation demonstrated patterns shown blocks previous work membrane conductance decreased dawn increased dusk similar patterns seen isolated cells previous multiple cell cultures provided first strong evidence individual neurons possessed capacity generate circadian rhythms research definitively concluded brns necessary sufficient photoentrainment bulla block colleagues hypothesized ion movement across cell membranes plays role generation circadian rhythms lab measured rhythms rat suprachiasmatic nuclei scn various concentrations calcium ions block found calcium concentration decreased thus lowering transmembrane ion movement amplitude circadian rhythmicity also calcium added circadian rhythm blocks lab repeated experiment rat liver tissue mouse scn tissue found results case demonstrated across species tissues transmembrane calcium flux necessary generation circadian rhythms however still questions function calcium flux experiment block also tried adding calcium channel blockers tissues rhythmicity disappear took several cycles unknown rhythmicity immediately abolished addition block suspects calcium flux plays role entrainment mammalian clock environment similar role mollusk entrainment block also studied effect aging circadian system collaborating leading chronobiologists including michael menaker studied rhythmicity rats various ages found aging affected rhythmicity differently different tissues scn intrinsic period shortened age lung tissue often became arrhythmic showing sporadic activity pineal kidney tissues became phase block exposed rats various ages different light cycles found phase advances took longer scn old rats young rats pineal tissues advanced faster older rats liver tissues phase shift light cycle studies together shown complex aging process circadian system block notes though changes likely influenced diminishing synchronizing signals scn block observed jetlag significantly increased death rate older mice highlights medical importance understanding aging process circadian block served numerous advisory boards committees including block married carol
