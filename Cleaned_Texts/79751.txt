plant reproductive morphology study physical form structure morphology parts plants directly indirectly concerned sexual reproduction among living organisms flowers reproductive structures angiosperms varied physically show correspondingly great diversity methods plants flowering plants green algae mosses liverworts hornworts ferns gymnosperms conifers also complex interplays morphological adaptation environmental factors sexual reproduction breeding system sperm one plant fertilizes ovum another depends reproductive morphology single important determinant genetic structure nonclonal plant populations christian konrad sprengel studied reproduction flowering plants first time understood pollination process involved biotic abiotic interactions charles darwins theories natural selection utilized work build theory evolution includes analysis coevolution flowers insect pollinators plants complex lifecycles involving alternation generations one generation sporophyte gives rise next generation gametophyte asexually via spores spores may identical isospores come different sizes microspores megaspores strictly speaking spores sporophytes neither male female produce gametes alternate generation gametophyte produces gametes eggs andor sperm gametophyte monoicous bisexual producing eggs sperm dioicous unisexual either female producing eggs male producing sperm bryophytes liverworts mosses hornworts sexual gametophyte dominant generation ferns seed plants including cycads conifers flowering plants etc sporophyte dominant generation obvious visible plant whether small herb large tree sporophyte gametophyte small bryophytes ferns gametophytes independent freeliving plants seed plants female megagametophyte megaspore gives rise hidden within sporophyte entirely dependent nutrition male gametophyte typically consists two four cells enclosed within protective wall pollen grain sporophyte flowering plant often described using sexual terms eg female male based sexuality gametophyte gives rise example sporophyte produces spores give rise male gametophytes may described male even though sporophyte asexual producing spores similarly flowers produced sporophyte may described unisexual bisexual meaning give rise either one sex gametophyte sexes needed flower characteristic structure concerned sexual reproduction flowering plants angiosperms flowers vary enormously structure morphology perfect flower like ranunculus glaberrimus shown figure calyx outer sepals corolla inner petals male female sex organs sepals petals together form perianth next inwards numerous stamens produce pollen grains containing microscopic male gametophyte stamens may called male parts flower collectively form androecium finally middle carpels maturity contain one ovules within ovule tiny female carpels may called female parts flower collectively form gynoecium carpel ranunculus species achene produces one fertilized becomes seed carpel contains one seed eranthis hyemalis called follicle two carpels may fused together varying degrees entire structure including fused styles stigmas may called pistil lower part pistil ovules produced called ovary may divided chambers locules corresponding separate perfect flower stamens carpels described bisexual hermaphroditic unisexual flower one either stamens carpels missing vestigial otherwise nonfunctional flower either staminate functional stamens thus male carpellate pistillate functional carpels thus female separate staminate carpellate flowers always found plant species described monoecious separate staminate carpellate flowers always found different plants species described study found angiosperm species dioecious genera contain dioecious members birch family betulaceae examples monoecious plants unisexual flowers mature alder tree alnus species produces long catkins containing male flowers four stamens minute perianth separate stalked groups female flowers without see illustration alnus serrulata hollies members genus ilex dioecious plant produces either functionally male flowers functionally female flowers ilex aquifolium see illustration common european holly kinds flower four sepals four white petals male flowers four stamens female flowers usually four nonfunctional reduced stamens fourcelled since female plants able set fruit produce berries consequences gardeners amborella represents first known group flowering plants separate common ancestor dioecious one time plant produces either flowers functional stamens carpels flowers nonfunctional stamens number fully functional carpels however amborella plants may change sex time one study five cuttings male plant produced male flowers first flowered second flowering three switched producing female extreme cases almost parts present complete flower may missing long least one carpel one stamen present situation reached female flowers duckweeds lemna consist single carpel male flowers spurges euphorbia consist single species fraxinus excelsior common ash europe demonstrates one possible kind variation ash flowers windpollinated lack petals sepals structurally flowers may bisexual consisting two stamens ovary may male staminate lacking functional ovary female carpellate lacking functional stamens different forms may occur tree different asteraceae sunflower family close species worldwide highly modified inflorescences made flowers florets collected together tightly packed heads heads may florets one sexual morphology bisexual carpellate staminate called homogamous may mixtures two sexual forms thus goatsbeards tragopogon species heads bisexual florets like members tribe whereas marigolds calendula species generally heads outer florets bisexual inner florets staminate like amborella plants undergo sexswitching example arisaema triphyllum jackinthepulpit expresses sexual differences different stages growth smaller plants produce mostly male flowers plants grow larger years male flowers replaced female flowers plant arisaema triphyllum thus covers multitude sexual conditions lifetime nonsexual juvenile plants young plants male larger plants mix male female flowers large plants mostly female plant populations plants produce male flowers early year plants bloom later growing season produce female flowerscitation needed complexity morphology flowers variation within populations led rich terminology outcrossing crossfertilization allogamy offspring formed fusion gametes two different plants common mode reproduction among higher plants higher plant species reproduce way additional partially crossfertilizing partially selffertilizing autogamy produce gametes principally selffertilizing significant outcrossing lacking higher plant species reproduce exclusively nonsexual means include plants reproduce vegetatively runners bulbils produce seeds without embryo fertilization apomixis selective advantage outcrossing appears masking deleterious recessive primary mechanism used flowering plants ensure outcrossing involves genetic mechanism known selfincompatibility various aspects floral morphology promote allogamy plants bisexual flowers anthers carpels may mature different times plants protandrous anthers maturing first protogynous carpels mature firstcitation needed monoecious species unisexual flowers plant may produce male female flowers different timescitation needed dioecy condition unisexual flowers different plants necessarily results outcrossing probably evolved purpose however dioecy proven difficult explain simply outbreeding mechanism plants lack resourceallocation constraints may important evolution dioecy example windpollination separate male flowers arranged catkin vibrates wind may provide better pollen climbing plants rapid upward growth may essential resource allocation fruit production may incompatible rapid growth thus giving advantage delayed production female dioecy evolved separately many different lineages monoecy plant lineage correlates evolution dioecy suggesting dioecy evolve readily plants already produce separate male female httpsenwikipediaorgwikiplantreproductivemorphology
