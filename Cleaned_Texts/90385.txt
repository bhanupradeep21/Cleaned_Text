mental representation cognitive representation philosophy mind cognitive psychology neuroscience cognitive science hypothetical internal cognitive symbol represents external reality mental representation mental imagery things actually present contemporary philosophy specifically fields metaphysics philosophy mind ontology mental representation one prevailing ways explaining describing nature ideas concepts mental representations mental imagery enable representing things never experienced well things think traveling place never visited third arm things either never happened impossible exist yet brain mental imagery allows us imagine although visual imagery likely recalled mental imagery may involve representations sensory modalities hearing smell taste stephen kosslyn proposes images used help solve certain types problems able visualize objects question mentally represent images solve mental representations also allow people experience things right front process brain interprets stores representational content representationalism also known indirect realism view representations main way access external reality representational theory mind attempts explain nature ideas concepts mental content contemporary philosophy mind cognitive science experimental psychology contrast theories na√Øve direct realism representational theory mind postulates actual existence mental representations act intermediaries observing subject objects processes entities observed external world intermediaries stand represent mind objects world example someone arrives belief floor needs sweeping representational theory mind states form mental representation represents floor state cleanliness original classical representational theory probably traced back thomas hobbes dominant theme classical empiricism general according version theory mental representations images often called ideas objects states affairs represented modern adherents jerry fodor steven pinker many others representational system consists rather internal language thought ie mentalese contents thoughts represented symbolic structures formulas mentalese analogously natural languages much abstract level possess syntax semantics much like natural languages portuguese logician cognitive scientist luis augusto abstract formal level syntax thought set symbol rules ie operations processes etc symbol structures semantics thought set symbol structures concepts propositions content ie thought emerges meaningful cooccurrence sets symbols instance x meaningful cooccurrence whereas cat x x symbol rule called symbol structures cat canadian philosopher p thagard noted work introduction cognitive science cognitive scientists agree knowledge human mind consists mental representations cognitive science asserts people mental procedures operate means mental representations implementation thinking two types representationalism strong weak strong representationalism attempts reduce phenomenal character intentional content hand weak representationalism claims phenomenal character supervenes intentional content strong representationalism aims provide theory nature phenomenal character offers solution hard problem consciousness contrast weak representationalism aim provide theory consciousness offer solution hard problem consciousness strong representationalism broken restricted unrestricted versions restricted version deals certain kinds phenomenal states eg visual perception representationalists endorse unrestricted version representationalism according unrestricted version state phenomenal character states phenomenal character reduces intentional content unrestricted version representationalism able provide general theory nature phenomenal character well offer potential solution hard problem consciousness successful reduction phenomenal character state intentional content would provide solution hard problem consciousness physicalist account intentionality worked arguing unrestricted version representationalism people often bring phenomenal mental states appear lack intentional content unrestricted version seeks account phenomenal states thus true states phenomenal character must intentional content character reduced phenomenal states without intentional content therefore serve counterexample unrestricted version state intentional content phenomenal character reducible states intentional content none begin common example kind state moods moods states phenomenal character generally thought directed anything particular moods thought lack directedness unlike emotions typically thought directed particular things eg mad sibling afraid dangerous animal people conclude moods undirected also nonintentional ie lack intentionality aboutness directed anything anything lack intentionality lack intentional content lacking intentional content phenomenal character reducible intentional content refuting representational doctrine though emotions typically considered directedness intentionality idea also called question one might point emotions person sudden experiences appear directed anything particular emotions elicited listening music another potential example undirected nonintentional emotions emotions aroused way seem necessarily anything including music arouses response objection proponent representationalism might reject undirected nonintentionality moods attempt identify intentional content might plausibly thought possess proponent representationalism might also reject narrow conception intentionality directed particular thing arguing instead broader kind intentionality three alternative kinds directednessintentionality one might posit case outward directedness moods might directed either world whole changing series objects world unbound emotion properties projected people onto things world case inward directedness moods directed overall state persons body case hybrid directedness moods directed combination inward outward things even one identify possible intentional content moods might still question whether content able sufficiently capture phenomenal character mood states part amy kind contends case previously mentioned kinds directedness outward inward hybrid intentional content supplied mood state capable sufficiently capturing phenomenal aspects mood case inward directedness phenomenology mood seem tied state ones body even ones mood reflected overall state ones body person necessarily aware demonstrating insufficiency intentional content adequately capture phenomenal aspects mood case outward directedness phenomenology mood intentional content seem share corresponding relation given phenomenal character supposed reduce intentional content hybrid directedness even get ground faces objection wide debate kinds representations exist several philosophers bring different aspects debate philosophers include alex morgan gualtiero piccinini uriah kriegel others job description representations represent intentionality special represented object need exist content plays causal role gets represented eg saying hello friend giving glare enemy structural representations also types representations basically mental maps minds correspond exactly objects world intentional content according morgan structural representations mental nothing mental plants structural representations also internal types representations include involve future decisions episodic memories type projection future gualtiero piccininis forthcoming work discusses topics natural nonnatural mental representations relies natural definition mental representations given grice p entails p eg spots mean measles entails patient measles nonnatural representations p entail p eg rings bell bus mean bus rings bell independent fullness could assigned something else arbitrary signify bus full also objective subjective mental objective representations closest tracking brain simply tracks environment blue bird outside window objective representation blue bird subjective representations vary persontoperson example colorblind blue bird outside window appear blue since represent blueness blue ie see color blue relationship two types representation vary eliminativists think subjective representations dont exist reductivists
