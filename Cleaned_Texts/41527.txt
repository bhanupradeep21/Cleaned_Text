behavioral health outcome management bhom involves use behavioral health outcome measurement data help guide inform treatment individual patient like blood pressure cholesterol routine lab work helps guide inform general medical practice use routine measurement behavioral health proving invaluable assisting therapists deliver better quality care behavioral healthcare mental health substance abuse treatment routine health outcomes measurement expanded beyond aggregating measurements quality improvement studies placed equal emphasis therapeutic gain delivered realtime patientlevel outcome billion behavioral health marketplace state public health crisis defined us surgeon patients receiving substandard care outcome management helping provide quality controls data structure large subsection us population almost definition psychotherapy rather unstructured process leaving many people going process guided selfdiscovery behavioral change wonder whether therapy helping tracking progress repeated administrations selfreport questionnaire allows therapist client know getting better perspective matters patients data collected formal typically selfreport measurement like used enhance accuracy clinical assessments provide basis treatment planning deliver objective methodology tracking treatment progress alert therapists clinically proven guidelines get refractory cases back track help prevent hospitalizations warning guidance provide primary care physicians referral sources outcomebased referrals linking new patients therapists proven track record delivering exceptional care patients similar behavioral health needs powerful use bhom documented healthcares first randomized clinical trial referral process using outcome data behavioral healthcare rarely uses genetic markers blood tests assist diagnosing major depression behavioral health disorders like schizophrenia substance abuse instead field relies careful assessment symptoms like changes mood behavior make formal diagnosis however half behavioral healthcare delivered primary care rarely sufficient time expertise conduct formal interview standardized assessment screening process using formal questionnaires administered waiting room internet invaluable even behavioral health specialists like psychologists psychiatrists social workers trained interview diagnose behavioral health problems efforts hampered patients willingness lack thereof honestly report relevant symptoms example initial interview half patients honestly disclose previous suicide greatly hampering therapists efforts keep patients safe contrast six controlled studies document patients like completing paperandpencil webbased questionnaires patients accurate giving therapists primary care physicians accurate assessments clients symptoms issues new potentially different perspective seen facetoface interviews formal assessments patient needs clinician devise individualized treatment plan incorporates needs evidencebased practices health plans require integration bhom routine care treatment well designed bhom system provides clinician feedback guidance keep evidencebased obviously fundamental use bhom use data track treatment progress patientbypatient basis especially sessionbysession assessments realtime scoring report generation data provides clinicians patients excellent feedback course treatment whether adjustments need made treatment first second generation bhom tools hampered ability document reliable patient cases showing reliable advanced tools document reliable improvement cases single domain multidimensional documenting patient improvement payers purchasers important statistics may vitally important evaluate building deploying bhom system see researchers brigham young universities clinically proven bhom helps therapists deliver better care identifying cases likely improve current treatment refractory cases negative responders account approximately treatment cases bhom system used well designed bhom system reduce population negative responders less increasing effectiveness psychotherapy least since clinicians abysmal predicating patients negatively respond bhom system known way facilitate level effectiveness uses bhom also emerging systems evolve simple singledomain alert systems like complex multidimensional systems singledomain alert systems effective identifying negative responders single global measure distress capture full complexity issues seen behavioral healthcare eg depression psychosis mania anxiety substance abuse etc elaborate measurement bhoms shown facilitate identification highrisk cases clients highrisk behavioral health hospitalization due suicide violence etc highcosthighrisk services allowing health plan clinician collaborate flexing treatment benefits prevent loss life increased healthcare therapists experience better treating alcohol disorders others experience effectiveness treating depression psychosis researchers effectively argued differences seen controlled studies comparing different treatments cognitive behavioral therapy interpersonalpsychodynamic therapy medication management etc really documenting relative differences therapists involved fact shown excellent psychiatrist using placebo get better results poor psychiatrist using welldocumented patented bhom treatment outcome package top system helps large organizations health plans community mental health centers child welfare organizations hospitals identify therapists getting excellent outcomes specific diagnostic domainspecific problems refer incoming patients screened initial evaluation top effective clinicians behavioral health outcomes management requires host interconnected components order create benefit patients reviewed unless clinicians time score record chart client administration need create infrastructure process data real time patients typically complete questionnaires session questionnaires useful results available session starts computerbased applications great appeal process data quickly reduce staff involvement patients feel comfortable interacting computer pda may require paperbased backup system paper questionnaires scanned faxed central processing system dedicated staff verify process data hybrid systems also available allow users flexibility using types processing approaches one application printondemand paper forms bar coded necessary patient forofficeuseonly information eliminating need handwriting recognition interactive voice recognition ivr systems attempted little success remembering press one time two time etc rather cumbersome complex question wording may require system repeat questions answers several times confused psychotic patient effectively answer single question american psychological association largest international society psychotherapy researchers society psychotherapy ken howard grandfather behavioral health outcomes management research held core battery conference cbc develop minimum requirements outcome according cbc across diagnostic groups core battery assess three distinct domains typically welldesigned bhom system need integrate multiple questionnaires measure areas one currently identified outcome battery literature meets cbc defined criteria one short questionnaires domain key psychometric qualities especially important bhom applications include measuring symptom reduction functional improvement enough clinical cases difficult treat others example patients multiple hospitalizations comorbid medical conditions extensive life stress challenging treat none complicating issues order evaluate relative effectiveness clinicians treatments variables need identified measured within bhom system order make accurate first generation computers aweinspiring taking several floors academic buildings however power memory speed dwarfed everyday laptops meaning nothing relative value standing bhom data must taken context comparison something understanding therapists strengths weaknesses done comparing work others size comparison database matters allowing researchers users find matching comparative samples disaggregation statistical techniques currently two sources massive comparative datasets managed care providerbased systems managed care systems responding purchaser regulatory demands outcome accountability data managed care companies begun collect data network therapists pacificares development use life status questionnaire largest known effort date data reported patients least one datasets massive significant limitations including providerbased systems source massive datasets comes providercentric bhom help providers measure patients confidentially benchmark results peers datasets already exceeding million cases limitations approaches include cost critical factor considering integrating already existing bhom system building one scratch building system take ten years design studies develop refine outcome tools program necessary hardware software process data seed benchmarking database sufficient volume provide comparison data however wanting control process powerful motivator purchasing licensing rights existing systems also expensive need carefully evaluated hidden costs associated critical components listed fortunately competition driving prices well developed bhom system free include questionnaires data processing systems realtime client bhom clinically proven improve treatment mental health system state crisis patients typically welcome efforts
