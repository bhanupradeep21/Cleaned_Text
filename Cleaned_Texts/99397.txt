calumma benovskyi extinct species chameleon calumma genus species genus found madagascar today c benovskyi discovered miocene sediments kenya indicates genus even chameleons whole originate madagascar often held previously continental africa matches several prior studies favor african origin group based phylogenetic results ocean currents present africa madagascar much paleogene neogene additionally since c benovskyi found rather derived member genus would necessitate much greater yet unknown diversity chameleons oligocene miocene africa fossil material calumma benovskyi discovered alan walker miocene sediments kenyan hiwegi formation rusinga island type specimen knmru complete skull attached mandible first three neck vertebrae preliminarily described rieppel walker odhiambo basis cast photographs although already noting similarities calumma researchers assigned material early species genus nearly years later skull subjected xray microcomputed tomography order reveal hidden detail virtually prepare material still filled matrix course study authors reevaluated taxonomic position material instead finding placed calumnm establishing new species named maurice benyovszky military officer traveler born vrbové slovakia benyovszky made several travels madagascar čerňanský colleagues liken fact calumma represents genus born abroad later traveled c bnovskyi differentiated calumma species shape frontal bone forms welldeveloped triangular processes towards back element differs combination various anatomical details skull like fact frontal contacts nasal bone prefrontal fenestra present connected external nares forming single skull opening prefrontal contacts postorbitofrontal preventing frontal bone contributing margins orbits skull viewed prefrontals incline towards side parietal bone shows characteristic hourglass shape protuberances located parietal arranged pattern resembling greek letter ψ psi protuberances continue onto frontal evenly distributed jugal lined single line protuberances sculpting surface back third parietal additionally fully pierced pineal eye inwardfacing edge orbits concave rather straight back postorbitofrontal elevated eyes putting supratemporal fenestrae horizontal position rendering invisible profile view continuing towards squamosal bone element relatively horizontal rather vertical general skull reaches greatest width area frontal parietal bones meet skull narrows giving oval shape profile view skull roughly triangular tapering snout flat casque later confined region behind large traits variable among species within genus calumma instance jugal calumma ambreense parsons chameleon feature two rows protuberances shorthorned chameleon shares single row c bnovskyi connection prefrontal fenestra naris also varies species genera present bignosed chameleon deceptive chameleon giant onehorned chameleon absent flatcasqued chameleon shorthorned chameleon genera chamaeleo furcifer applies many features observed calumma bnovskyi rendering specific combination diagnostic multiple phylogenetic analysis performed using data gathered holotype calumma bnovskyi finding species nested deep within genus calumma initial two analysis recovered topology placing miocene species sister taxon shorthorned chameleon finding bignosed chameleon sister taxon calumma bradypodion possibly due small size affecting skull morphology third analysis utilized prior molecular phylogeny recovered tolley et constrain ingroup producing slightly different results c bnovskyi still found

chameleons due fact first known member calumma found outside madagascar separated mainland africa early cretaceous makes calumma one several groups animals endemic island today appear origin mainland later disperse across mozambique channel sometime oligocene miocene animals origin include tenrecs ayeaye relatives mainland arrived single dispersal continental origin calumma consistent works tolley et al suggest rather originated madagascar spread chameleons originated mainland colonized islands indian ocean across multiple waves regarding madagascar particular tolley colleagues suggest least two dispersal events occurred first taking place paleocene would introduced brookesia lineage island later event proposed taken place oligocene dispersal would possible use natural rafts like trees mode transport especially favorable arboreal animals like chameleons presence eastward currents would transport rafts africa shores besides mere presence c bnoskyi factors also support genus originated mainland instance phylogenetic analysis finds calumma furcifer nest clade otherwise contains genera found mainland however complications also introduced presence calumma miocene africa tolley colleagues proposed calumma furcifer sister taxa split one another eocene long appearance calumma bnoskyi sister relationship two genera holds true would mean must origin continent rather splitting diversifying dispersal madagascar problem lies precise phylogenetic placement species although oldest member calumma c bnoskyi appears derived member genus part ancestral lineage indicates large gap knowledge regarding diversity chameleons oligocene miocene regardless precise details dispersal čerňanský colleagues agree tolley supporting continental origin chameleons regard older madagascar hypothesis unlikely given early separation two landmasses lack evidence significant landbridge fact currents time dispersal unfavorable animal travel mainland changing direction middle
