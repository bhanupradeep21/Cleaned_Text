gibbons ˈɡɪbənz apes family hylobatidae ˌhaɪləˈbætɪdiː family historically contained one genus split four extant genera species gibbons live subtropical tropical rainforests eastern bangladesh northeast india southern china indonesia including islands sumatra borneo java also called lesser apes gibbons differ great apes bonobos chimpanzees gorillas orangutans humans smaller exhibiting low sexual dimorphism making like apes gibbons tailless unlike great apes gibbons frequently form longterm pair bonds primary mode locomotion brachiation involves swinging branch branch distances ft speeds fast kmh mph also make leaps ft walk bipedally arms raised balance fastest treedwelling nonflying depending species sex gibbons fur coloration varies dark lightbrown shades shade black white

inflates serves resonating chamber animals call structure become quite large species sometimes equaling size animals head voices much powerful human singer although best half humans gibbon skulls teeth resemble great apes noses similar catarrhine primates dental formula siamang largest species distinguished two fingers foot stuck together hence generic species names symphalangus like primates gibbons social animals strongly territorial defend boundaries vigorous visual vocal displays vocal element often heard distances km mi consists duet mated pair young sometimes joining species males females sing solos attract mates well advertise song used identify species gibbon singing also area gibbons often retain mate life although always remain sexually monogamous addition extrapair copulations pairbonded gibbons occasionally gibbons among natures best brachiators ballandsocket wrist joints allow unmatched speed accuracy swinging trees nonetheless mode transportation lead hazards
