renal angina clinical methodology risk stratify patients development persistent severe acute kidney injury composite risk factors early signs injury aki renal angina used clinical adjunct help optimize use novel aki biomarker testing term angina latin infection throat greek ankhone strangling utilized context aki denote development injury choking kidney function unlike angina pectoris commonly caused due ischemia heart muscle secondary coronary artery occlusion vasospasm renal angina carries obvious physical symptomatology ie flank tenderness suprapubic tenderness pain voiding micturition renal angina derived conceptual framework identify evolving aki like acute coronary syndrome precedes sign heart attack renal angina used herald sign kidney detection renal angina performed calculating renal angina acute kidney injury aki extensively associated worsened morbidity independent risk factor mortality adult pediatric aki developed world occurs commonly secondary injury numerous disease processes sepsis cardiopulmonary bypass cpb oft recognized reported causative injuries leading aki pathophysiology aki broadly categorized four main categories ischemic injury manifest low glomerular blood flow perfusion pressure renal capillary system hypoxic injury renal interstitium inflammation renal tubules necrosis apoptosis renal parenchyma increasing recognition people dying aki epidemiology aki changed dramatically past years advances made treatment diseases eg sepsis bone marrow transplant bmt placed patients risk nephrotoxic therapies medication leading spike secondary aki mentioned additionally diagnostic criteria become standardized mentioned discharge coding data sample united states medicare beneficiaries demonstrated increase aki prevalence aki cases per patient discharges increase per hospitalized children patients two recent cohorts critically ill children reported incidence incidence data aki also commonly reported association inciting disease processes use continuous renal replacement therapy crrt otherwise known continuous dialysis estimated patients sepsis develop aki patients cpb develop populations high incidence aki include burn patients trauma patients patients bmt mortality patients crrt exceeds adults unfortunately singular therapy aki exists trials crrt aki even varying doses proven ineffective reducing aki associated morbidity diagnosis aki encompasses tests blood urine imaging kidneys glomerular filtration rate gfr used index kidney function frequently used diagnostic test calculate gfr serum creatinine level gfr also factors urine plasma solute concentration unfortunately serum creatinine highly variable depending age sex metabolic state body composition muscle mass rate excretion kidney rate urine production ie urine output also interpreted marker kidney function definitions low urine output oliguria also vary age urinalysis often provides clues kidney health hematuria tubular casts proteinuria used markers injury unfortunately multiple ways used different practitioners diagnose aki made large scale population analysis difficultcitation needed table previous diagnostic tests aki acute dialysis quality initiative group standardized definition aki using rifle based gfr serum creatinine values urine output plotted time admission rifle mnemonic three levels severity risk injury

creatinine increase percentage increase documented oliguria broadening window time aki diagnosis creating automatic failure designation patient placed renal replacement pediatric rifle prifle stratification system established weight based pediatric specific cutoffs estimated gfr urine recently kidney diseases improving global outcomes kdigo collaborative issued newer severity based aki stages table staging criteria since numerous studies adult pediatric patient populations demonstrated retrospectively escalating severity aki stratified criteria associated increased inhospital morbidity hospital length stay persistence kidney disease chronic kidney disease mortalitycitation needed aki researchers sought novel early sensitive specific biomarkers aki number biochemical markers currently study established aki early detection aki prognosis aki frequently studied new biomarkers include cystatin c cysc neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin ngal liverfatty acid binding protein lfabp kidney injury children following cardiopulmonary bypass often used derive biomarker performance validate optimal cutoff values given known timing duration insult relative homogeneity freedom comorbidities unfortunately biomarkers applied heterogeneous patient population general intensive care unit noncritically ill patients patients emergency department demonstrate less robust predictive inability detect aki early stages injury may reason poor outcomes associated disease processes quest ideal biomarkers early detection injury dubbed search renal troponin apt analogy diagnosis heart attack myocardial infarction discovery serum troponin confirmatory biomarker injury patients known risk factors signs injury eg pain chest tightness revolutionized survival acute coronary syndrome acs without correct context performance troponin detection heart attack marginal renal angina proposed empiric concept create threshold aki risk identify patients would benefit
