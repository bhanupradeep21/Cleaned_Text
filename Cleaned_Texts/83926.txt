hereditary angioedema hae disorder results recurrent attacks severe swelling commonly affects arms legs face intestinal tract intestinal tract affected abdominal pain vomiting may swelling airway result obstruction trouble without preventive treatment attacks typically occur every two weeks last three main types types ii caused mutation gene encodes inhibitor protein type iii often due

activation bradykinin receptor bradykinin receptor endothelial cells cells lining blood activation leads vascular endothelial cadherin type cell adhesion molecule phosphorylation internalization

endothelial growth factor vegf also activated degradation endothelial intercellular barrier junctions mediated histamine leads increased vascular permeability leading vascular leakage surrounding tissues thus causing characteristic swelling seen hereditary bradykinin receptor unlike receptor slowly partially desensitized binding bradykinin agonist thus remaining consituitively active long
