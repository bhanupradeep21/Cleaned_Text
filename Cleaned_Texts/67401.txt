calciphylaxis also known calcific uremic arteriolopathy cua grey scale rare syndrome characterized painful skin lesions pathogenesis calciphylaxis unclear believed involve calcification small blood vessels located within fatty tissue deeper layers skin blood clots eventual death skin cells due lack blood seen mostly people endstage kidney disease occur earlier stages chronic kidney disease rarely people normally functioning calciphylaxis rare serious disease believed affect dialysis results chronic nonhealing wounds indicates poor prognosis typical life expectancy less one calciphylaxis one type extraskeletal calcification similar extraskeletal calcifications observed people high levels calcium blood including people milkalkali syndrome sarcoidosis primary hyperparathyroidism hypervitaminosis rare cases certain medications warfarin also result first skin changes calciphylaxis lesions mottling skin induration livedo reticularis pattern tissue thrombosis infarction occurs black leathery eschar ulcer adherent black slough develops surrounding ulcers usually platelike area indurated lesions always extremely painful often occur lower extremities abdomen buttocks penis lesions also commonly multiple tissue infarcted wound healing seldom occurs ulcers likely become secondarily infected many cases calciphylaxis lead systemic bacterial infection calciphylaxis characterized following histologic findings severe forms calciphylaxis may cause diastolic heart failure cardiac calcification called heart stone widespread intravascular calcification typical calciphylaxis lesions occur myocardium prevent normal diastolic filling cause calciphylaxis unknown calciphylaxis hypersensitivity reaction ie allergic reaction leading sudden local calcification disease also known calcific uremic arteriolopathy however disease limited patients kidney failure current belief endstage kidney disease abnormal calcium phosphate homeostasis result deposition calcium vessels also known metastatic calcification calcium deposited thrombotic event occurs within lumen vessels resulting occlusion vessel subsequent tissue infarction specific triggers either thrombotic ischemic events adipocytes shown calcify vascular smooth muscle cells exposed high phosphate levels vitro mediated vascular endothelial growth factor vegfa leptin released adipocytes given calciphylaxis tends affect adipose tissue may contributing another hypothesis proposed vitamin k deficiency contributes development calciphylaxis vitamin k acts inhibitor calcification vessel walls activating matrix gla protein mgp turn inhibits calcification endstage kidney disease patients likely vitamin k deficiency due dietary restrictions meant limit potassium sodium many endstage kidney disease patients also medication called warfarin vitamin k antagonist limits vitamin k recycling reported risk factors include female sex obesity elevated calciumphosphate product medications warfarin vitamin derivatives eg calcitriol calciumbased binders systemic steroids protein c deficiency low blood albumin levels diabetes patients require undergone type vascular procedures also increased risk poor diagnostic test calciphylaxis diagnosis clinical one characteristic lesions ischemic skin lesions usually areas skin necrosis necrotic skin lesions ie dying already dead skin areas typically appear violaceous dark bluish purple lesions andor completely black leathery extensive found multiples suspected diagnosis supported skin biopsy usually punch biopsy shows arterial calcification occlusion absence vasculitis excisional biopsy done due increased risk ulceration bone scintigraphy performed cases skin biopsy contraindicated results study show increased tracer accumulation soft certain patients antinuclear antibody test may play role diagnosis plain radiography mammography may also show calcifications tests less laboratory studies phosphate levels calcium levels parathyroid levels nonspecific unhelpful diagnosis treatment calciphylaxis requires multidisciplinary approach using knowledge nephrologists plastic surgeons dermatologists wound care specialists working together manage disease key treating calciphylaxis prevention via rigorous control phosphate calcium balance management risk factors patients increased chances developing calciphylaxis specific treatment treatment recommendations lack significant data none internationally recognized standard care generally accepted apply multipronged approach patientcitation needed pain management choice analgesia challenging task managing calciphylaxis pain one severe pervasive symptoms disease unresponsive highdose opioids fentanyl methadone preferred analgesics morphine since morphine breakdown produces active metabolites accumulate body patients kidney adjunct medications gabapentin ketamine may also used analgesia refractory cases spinal anesthetics nerve blocks used comprehensive pain wound care calciphylaxis lesions involves using appropriate dressings wound debridement removal dead tissue prevention infection wound infections lead sepsis one leading causes death patients calciphylaxis surgical wound debridement carries increased risk infection considered therapy survival benefit outweighs chances continued wound nonhealing hyperbaric oxygen therapy may also considered smaller retrospective studies show use hyperbaric oxygen improving delivery oxygen wounds improves blood flow helps wound patients calciphylaxis already hemodialysis simply dialysis length frequency sessions may increased majority dialysis patients three times per week schedule indications increasing dialysis session length frequency include electrolyte mineral abnormalities hyperphosphatemia hypercalcemia hyperparathyroidism also risk factors development peritoneal dialysis patients also transition hemodialysis hemodialysis carries added benefit better phosphate calcium surgical parathyroidectomy also recommended difficulty managing phosphate calcium level balance however risks include development postoperative hungry bone syndrome hbs disease state causes low calcium requires use calcium supplementation calcitriol avoided patients endstage kidney disease sodium thiosulfate commonly prescribed treatment patients calciphylaxis actual mechanism drug unknown several explanations proposed including chelation calcium vasodilation antioxidant properties restoration endothelial function adverse effects sodium thiosulfate include high anion gap metabolic acidosis high sodium levels bisphosphonates popular choice treatment osteoporosis also used treat calciphylaxis even though exact mechanism calciphylaxis unknown beneficial patients genetic deficiency shown slow development calciphylaxis lesions small prospective cinacalcet medication parathyroidectomy oral medication used suppress parathyroid glands patients may able undergo surgical parathyroidectomy vitamin k supplementation also shown slow development calcification coronary arteries aortic valve older ability vitamin k supplementation slow calcification blood vessels calciphylaxis wellstudied warfarin vitamin k antagonist discussed discontinued acceptable treatments may include one following overall clinical prognosis calciphylaxis poor mortality rate patients endstage kidney disease
