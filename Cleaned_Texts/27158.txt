multiple endocrine neoplasia abbreviated men condition encompasses several distinct syndromes featuring tumors endocrine glands characteristic pattern cases tumors malignant others benign benign malignant tumors nonendocrine tissues occur components tumor syndromes men syndromes inherited autosomal dominant although officially categorized multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes von carney two autosomal dominant endocrine tumor syndromes features overlap clinical features men syndromes although transmitted germline syndrome genetic disorder characterized endocrine neoplastic features involving endocrine glands overlap involved percentages table refer percentage people men type develop neoplasia type patients gastrinoma fmtc familial medullary thyroid cancer men sometimes known men
