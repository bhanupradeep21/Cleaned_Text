learned helplessness behavior exhibited subject enduring repeated aversive stimuli beyond control initially thought caused subjects acceptance powerlessness way discontinuing attempts escape avoid aversive stimulus even alternatives unambiguously presented upon exhibiting behavior subject said acquired learned humans learned helplessness related concept selfefficacy individuals belief innate

research learned helplessness university pennsylvania extension interest research later expanded experiments seligman others one first experiment seligman overmier part study three groups dogs placed harnesses group dogs simply put harness period time later released groups consisted yoked pairs dogs group given electric shocks random times dog could end pressing lever dog group paired group dog whenever group dog got shock paired dog group got shock intensity duration lever stop shock dog group seemed shock ended random paired dog group causing stop thus group dogs shock inescapable part experiment three groups dogs tested shuttlebox apparatus chamber containing two rectangular compartments divided barrier inches high dogs could escape shocks one side box jumping low partition side dogs groups quickly learned task escaped shock group previously learned nothing effect lay passively whined second experiment later year new groups dogs maier seligman ruled possibility instead learned helplessness group dogs failed avert second part test learned behavior interfered escape prevent interfering behavior group dogs immobilized paralyzing drug curare underwent procedure similar
