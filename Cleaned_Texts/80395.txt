euparkeriidae named euparkeria family name first proposed german paleontologist friedrich von huene huene classified euparkeriids members pseudosuchia traditional name crocodilian relatives triassic pseudosuchia means false crocodiles early phylogenetic analyses created jacques gauthier provided alternative hypothesis euparkeria closer dinosaurs including birds rather many genera assigned euparkeriidae past two valid genera currently believed part family apart euparkeria halazhaisuchus recent analyses starting benton clark place euparkeria member archosauriformes position outside crocodilianline birdline avemetatarsalian although ancestor archosaurs likely shared several similarities euparkeria archosaurs probably directly descendants genus precise placement euparkeria euparkeriids within archosauriformes controversial analyses agree euparkeria closer relative archosaurs proterosuchids erythrosuchids one exception study dilkes sues found euparkeria less crownward nevertheless results widely still remains ambiguity whether euparkeriidae truly sister group archosaurs many phylogenetic analyses place longsnouted proterochampsians closely related archosaurs euparkeriids studies include sereno parrish juul various analyses michael j ezcurra hand several notable studies consider euparkeria closer archosaurs proterochampsians sterling nesbitts influential monograph archosaurian relationships found similar result although also placed phytosaurs sister group archosauria rather roland sookias paleontologist responsible many studies euparkeriids also
