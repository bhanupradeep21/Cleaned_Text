value cmc absence ftf cues leads fact receivers may sensitive subtle social personality cues occur cmc communication way cmc partners build impressions one another minimal cues fewer cues base perceptions receivers fill gaps understanding interactant often assume positive characteristics words without ftf cues mediate interaction participants may assume partner better person actually since cmc doesnt require copresence way ftf communication members take part activities convenience taking advantaged disentrained communication channels walther cites relaxation time constraints cmc often allowing asynchronous mode communication example group communication making temporal commitments becomes discretionary group members may attend group process independently time partners may attend groups convenience limitations amount partners mutual time available meetings less disentrained often asynchronous communication via email individuals way manage relationships within groups efficiently via ftf using asynchronous communication email individuals able manage group relationships way maximizes time spent group tasks process entrainment people synchronize activities meet requirements groups needs constrained individuals time attention entrainment make difficult groups complete tasks together since requires ftf thus synchronous communication may include offtopic discussions hinder productivity asynchronous communication may mitigate entrainment associated group interaction according walther asynchronous group interaction may constrained time andor competing group members using asynchronous communication devote full attention group opportunity greater attention spent focusing tasks related group rather spending time effort communication irrelevant goal according walther cmc removes temporal limitations thereby freeing time constraints taskoriented socially oriented exchanges may take place without one constraining time available walther argues behavioral confirmation reciprocal influence partners exert senderreceiver roles magnified minimalcue interaction like cmc words cmc communication behave based expectation social data occurring

environment last component hyperpersonal model conceptualized reciprocal interaction others strengthens ones online performance bringing together identity transforming potentials embedded within theoretical facetoface communication physical features appearance facial expressions gesture postures exposed others help convey nonverbal information help communication facetoface communication formed naturally emotional cognitive physical aspects nonverbal languages cues lack cmc argue lack nonverbal cues cmc may decrease ones capability fostering managing accurate impression additionally lack nonverbal cues leads fact cmc communication involves less emotional elements ftf communication contributes less richness interpersonal expressive cues may provide positive holds opposite opinions walther suggested research cmc actually improve interpersonal bond senders receivers lack nonverbal cues demographic walther argued nonverbal demographic cues occur ftf communication play distracting role cmc communication hyperpersonal interaction created senders pay attention strategy delivering message selfpresentation enhanced optimized eventually improve interpersonal walther developed alternate approach cuesfilteredout social informationprocessing sip viewpoint walther states people naturally want develop social sip idea rate social information exchanged introduced additionally sip looks verbal strategies used mediated individuals strategically use language convey myriad information sender enabling receiver make attributes sender yet cmc really impersonal many people adopting

processes integrated result walther called according walthers research study cmc went three phases impersonal interpersonal finally hyperpersonal first cmc reduces nonverbal communication cues argued cmc taskoriented ftf reasons early cmc group research suggested cmc groups better taskoriented interactions ftf counterparts taskoriented situations overly personal interpersonal interaction desired impersonal interaction appropriate kind interaction communication exchanges focused groups task example geographically dispersed technology team tasked solving software application bug may productive communication task focused rather interpersonal nature doesnt mean cmc impersonal points specific contexts may better suited impersonal interaction rather personal walther stated cmc always impersonal instead also develop social relationships although less social information exchange cmc absence nonverbal cues communication time increases exchange social information increasing accordingly anticipation future communication may make communicators look information mechanism leads similar immediacy similarity composure receptivity ftf communication however shortcoming since takes time cmc achieve consensus time cmc limited information exchanged much less ftf may impact efficiency group finally walther brought concept hyperpersonal communication demonstrates cmc socially desirable tend
