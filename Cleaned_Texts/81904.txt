ligation joining two nucleic acid fragments action enzyme essential laboratory procedure molecular cloning dna whereby dna fragments joined create recombinant dna molecules foreign dna fragment inserted plasmid ends dna fragments joined formation phosphodiester bonds one dna terminus another rna may also ligated similarly cofactor generally involved reaction usually atp nad eukaryotic cells ligases belong atp type nad dependent found bacteria eg e discovery dna ligase dates back important event field molecular ligation laboratory normally performed using dna ligase broadly used vitro molecular biology research tool due capability joining sticky blunt dna however procedures ligation without use standard dna ligase also popular human dna ligases abnormalities linked pathological

linked Îµamino group lysine active site ligase via phosphoramide bond adenylyl group transferred phosphate group end dna chain forming dnaadenylate complex finally phosphodiester bond two dna ends formed via nucleophilic attack end dna strand activated group nick dna ie break one strand doublestranded dna repaired efficiently ligase however complicating feature ligation presents ligating two separate dna ends two ends need come together ligation reaction proceed ligation dna sticky cohesive ends protruding strands dna may annealed together already therefore relatively efficient process equivalent repairing two nicks dna however ligation bluntends lack protruding ends dna anneal together process dependent random collision ends align together ligated consequently much less efficient dna ligase e coli ligate bluntended dna except conditions molecular crowding therefore normally used ligation laboratory instead dna ligase phage used ligate bluntended dna well singlestranded factors affect enzymemediated chemical reaction would naturally affect ligation reaction concentration enzyme reactants well temperature reaction length time incubation ligation complicated fact desired ligation products ligation reactions two different dna molecules reaction involves inter intramolecular reactions additional annealing step necessary efficient ligation three steps form new phosphodiester bond ligation enzyme adenylylation adenylyl transfer dna nick sealing cofactor catalysis therefore high concentration ligation efficiency high concentration limited nick sealing rate limiting reaction process adenylylated dna intermediate stays solution adenylylation enzyme restrains rebinding adenylylated dna intermediate comparison achilles heel represents risk concentration dna affect rate ligation whether ligation intermolecular intramolecular reaction ligation involves joining ends dna ends however dna fragment two ends ends compatible dna molecule circularize joining ends high dna concentration greater chance one end dna molecule meeting end another dna thereby forming intermolecular ligation lower dna concentration chance one end dna molecule would meet end molecule increases therefore intramolecular reaction circularizes dna likely transformation efficiency linear dna also much lower circular dna dna circularize dna concentration high general rule total dna concentration less relative concentration dna fragments length well buffer conditions also factors affect whether intermolecular intramolecular reactions favored concentration dna artificially increased adding condensing agents cobalt hexamine biogenic polyamines spermidine using crowding agents polyethylene glycol peg also increase effective concentration note however additives cobalt hexamine produce exclusively intermolecular resulting linear concatemers rather circular dna suitable transformation plasmid dna therefore undesirable plasmid ligation necessary use additives plasmid ligation use peg preferable promote intramolecular well intermolecular higher ligase concentration faster rate ligation bluntend ligation much less efficient sticky end ligation higher concentration ligase used bluntend ligations high dna ligase concentration may used conjunction peg faster ligation components often found commercial kits designed rapid two issues involved considering temperature ligation reaction first optimum temperature dna ligase activity second melting temperature tm dna ends ligated melting temperature dependent length base composition dna greater number g c higher tm since three hydrogen bonds formed gc base pair compared two base contribution stacking bases fragments ligation reaction proceed efficiently ends stably annealed ligation experiments tm dna ends generally much lower optimal temperature ligating cohesive ends therefore compromise best temperature dna ligase activity tm ends however different restriction enzymes generates different ends base composition ends produced enzymes may also differ melting temperature therefore optimal temperature vary widely depending restriction enzymes used optimum temperature ligation may depending ligations also often involve ligating ends generated different restriction enzymes reaction mixture therefore may practical select optimal temperature particular ligation reaction protocols simply choose room temperature ionic strength buffer used affect ligation kinds cations presence also influence ligation reaction example excess amount na cause dna become rigid increase likelihood intermolecular ligation high concentration monovalent cation mm ligation also almost completely standard buffer used ligation designed minimize ionic restriction enzymes generate wide variety ends dna digest cloning experiments commonlyused restriction enzymes generate singlestranded overhang called sticky cohesive end exceptions include ndei generates overhang generate blunt ends sticky ends anneal compatible ends become ligated stickyend cohesive end ligation ecori example generates aatt end since lower melting temperature c g melting temperature tm low around restriction enzymes overhangs generated tm around practical purposes sticky end ligations performed room temperature alternatively longer period insertion dna fragment plasmid vector preferable use two different restriction enzymes digest dna different ends generated two different ends prevent religation vector without insert also allows fragment inserted directional manner possible use two different sites vector dna may need dephosphorylated avoid high background recircularized vector dna insert without phosphate group ends vector ligate ligated insert phosphate group dephosphorylation commonly done using calfintestinal alkaline phosphatase ciap removes phosphate group end digested dna note ciap easy inactivate interfere ligation without additional step remove ciap thereby resulting failure ligation ciap used excessive amount used necessary shrimp alkaline phosphatase sap antarctic phosphatase ap suitable alternative easily inactivated blunt end ligation involve basepairing protruding ends blunt end may ligated another blunt end blunt ends may generated restriction enzymes smai ecorv major advantage bluntend cloning desired insert require restriction sites sequence bluntends usually generated pcr pcr generated bluntended dna fragment may ligated bluntended vector generated restriction digest bluntend ligation however much less efficient sticky end ligation typically reaction slower stickyend ligation since bluntend protruding ends ligation reaction depends random collisions bluntends consequently much less efficient compensate lower efficiency concentration ligase used higher sticky end ligation concentration dna used bluntend ligation also higher increase likelihood collisions ends longer incubation time may also used bluntend ligations ends needed ligated vector bluntended vector needs dephosphorylated minimize selfligation may done using ciap caution use necessary noted previously since vector dephosphorylated ligation requires presence insert must phosphorylated bluntended pcr product normally lacks therefore needs phosphorylated treatment polynucleotide bluntend ligation also reversibly inhibited high concentration pcr usually generates bluntended pcr products note pcr using taq polymerase add extra adenine end pcr product property may exploited ta cloning ends pcr product anneal end vector ta ligation therefore form sticky end ligation bluntended vectors may turned
