cell biology contact inhibition refers two different closely related phenomena contact inhibition locomotion cil contact inhibition proliferation cip cil refers avoidance behavior exhibited fibroblastlike cells contact one cases two cells contact attempt alter locomotion different direction avoid future collision collision unavoidable different phenomenon occurs whereby growth cells culture eventually stops celldensity dependent types contact inhibition wellknown properties normal cells contribute regulation proper tissue growth differentiation development worth noting types regulation normally negated overcome organogenesis embryonic development tissue wound healing however contact inhibition locomotion proliferation aberrantly absent cancer cells absence regulation contributes contact inhibition regulatory mechanism functions keep cells growing layer one cell thick monolayer cell plenty available substrate space replicates rapidly moves freely process continues cells occupy entire substratum point normal cells stop replicating motile cells come contact confluent cultures exhibit decreased mobility mitotic activity exponential growth shown occur colonies contact numerous days inhibition mitotic activity occurring far later delay cellcell contact onset proliferation inhibition shortened culture becomes confluent thus may reasonably concluded cellcell contact essential condition contact inhibition proliferation insufficient mitotic inhibition addition making contact cells contactinhibited cells must also forced reduce cell area mechanical stress constraints imposed surrounding indeed suggested mechanical tension acts inhibitory signal moreover important note inhibition mitotic activity local phenomenon occurs select cells likely heterogeneous culture untransformed human cells exhibit normal cellular behavior mediate growth proliferation via interplay environmental nutrients growth factor signaling cell density cell density increases culture becomes confluent initiate cell cycle arrest downregulate proliferation mitogen signaling pathways regardless external factors cellular property known contact inhibition proliferation essential proper embryonic development well tissue repair differentiation morphogenesis cancerous cells typically lose property thus divide grow uncontrolled manner even contact neighbouring cells

hippoyap pathway inhibits cell importantly hippoyap pathway uses upstream elements act response cellcell contact controls densitydependent inhibition proliferation example cadherins transmembrane

activate α βcatenin stimulate downstream components hippoyap pathway ultimately downregulate cell consistent finding ecadherin overexpression hinders metastasis yap shown associated mitogenic growth factor signaling thus cell proliferation likely future studies focus hippoyap pathways role cancer cells however important note contactinhibited cells undergo cell cycle arrest senesce fact shown contactinhibited cells resume normal proliferation mitogen signaling upon replated less confluent culture thus contact inhibition proliferation may viewed reversible form cell cycle arrest furthermore transition cell cycle arrest senescence contactinhibited cells must activate growthactivating pathways cells highdensity cultures become confluent enough cell area falls critical adhesion formations trigger pathways downregulate mitogen signaling cell growthpromoting mtor pathway therefore inhibited consequently contactinhibited cells transition cell cycle arrest senescence crucial implications cancer therapy even though cancer cells contactinhibited confluent cancer cell cultures still suppress senescence machinery therefore may plausible explanation senescenceinducing cancer therapy drugs cases two cells collide attempt move different direction avoid future collisions behavior known contact inhibition two cells come contact locomotive process paralyzed accomplished via multistep multifaceted mechanism involves formation cellcell adhesion complex upon collision disassembly complex thought driven largely tension cells ultimately results colliding cells changing directions first motile cells collide touch via respective lamellae whose actin exhibit high retrograde flow cellular adhesion forms lamellae reducing actins retrograde flow rate area immediately surrounding adhesion consequently cells velocity motility reduced allows actin stress fibers microtubules form align colliding partners alignment stress fibers locally accumulates elastic tension lamellae eventually tension buildup becomes great cell adhesion complex dissociates collapses lamellae protrusions releases cells different directions effort alleviate elastic tension possible alternate event also leads assembly dissociation upon stress fiber alignment cells leading edges repolarize away contiguous lamellae produces significant elastic tension across entire cell bodies local site contact likewise causes adhesion complexs elastic tension thought primary driving force protrusion collapse complex disassembly cells though hypothetical tension characterized tension builds lamellae cell repolarization contributes tension buildup remain open investigation furthermore replication increases amount cells number directions cells move without touching another cells also attempt move away another cell stick better area around structure called substratum cells two cells colliding different types cells one may respond immortalised cell lines despite able proliferate indefinitely still
