including cardiovascular disease stroke aspiration elderly people residential care facilities considered poorest oral health vulnerable disadvantaged population elderly people functionally dependant

via dental implants known fixed people living longer retaining teeth longer due preventive focused approach dentistry although rates edentulism rapidly declining resulting number natural teeth retained dentition impact especially apparent residential care setting personal care assistant staff often time poor high resident pca ratio oral care often adequately attended residential care
