empirical evidence causal impact social relationships health social support theory suggests relationships might promote health especially promoting adaptive behavior regulating stress troubled relationships well loneliness social exclusion may negative consequences neurosciences health investigate neuronal circuits implicated context social connection poor relationships negative impact health outcomes cohen wills presented two models employed describe connection main effect model stressbuffering main effect model postulates social networks influence psychology affect physiology biological responses three variables thought influence health described figure model predicts increasing social networks may enhance general health possible mechanism social networks improve health behaviors social network influences us behave certain way enhances health argued social network influences health example demonstrated higher social support improves level physical activity turn positive effect unclear effect social support threshold gradient difference two threshold effect necessary amount social support required positive effect health opposite gradient effect described linear effect amount social support health meaning increase x amount social support result increase level health second model proposed cohen wills stressbuffering model explains effect social networks health individual facing stressful event predicts facing stressful event individual high perceived social support network better strategies resources face event hence resulting better physical mental health stress adaptive response facing stressful events stressful event lifethreatening event eg disease encountering dangerous wildanimal sociallife event eg deadline loss job conflict friend stress generates physiological behavioral responses depending event however stress always negative stress also positive stress hans selye distinguishes distress eustress described figure social support precisely perceived social support impact appraisal processes physiological behavioral responses according stressbuffering model appraisal processes refer way evaluate event stressful perceived stress benign appraisal respectively physiological behavioral responses refer call coping strategies strategies meant help individual deal stressful event prove successful among different studies model used understand social support protective infectious also link social support health outcomes specific case homeless studies demonstrate social support positive impact health outcomes even two contexts seem highly different main effect social support based structural aspects social relationships like social network size stressbuffering effect social support based functional aspects social relationships like quality social support assumption quite well supported literature remains unclear mechanisms social relationships impact health studies observed exist differences effect males specific domain depression shown differences type social support used face depression different male female participants difference results different coping strategies indeed men seem need social network supports selfcontrol women seem need social network helps recognize problems thus seems important theoretical models include factors gender explain links social networks health outcomes despite kind criticism models supported many evidence social integration negatively linked suicide marital status negatively linked mortality rates hibbard explored link social ties health status conducting series household indeed found people social ties perception control trustful others tend better physical health thoits investigated social ties improve mental physical results showed social ties might influence emotional sustenance promote active coping assistance significant point research define two types supporters able provide different types social support significant others ie family friends spouse etc tend provide instrumental support emotional sustaining whereas experientially similar others ie people experienced life events us tend provide empathy role model similar person looked like model person imitate active coping assistance furthermore social support help us regulate emotions facing stressful event probably one famous studies field investigation conducted coan schaefer study told married couples go together laboratory couples reported high level marital satisfaction study aimed evaluate effect handholding neural response threat create stressful event informed woman participant couple receive moderate electric shocks three experimental conditions hand holding stranger hand holding spouse handholding findings suggested spouse stranger hand holding attenuated neural response threat spousal handholding particularly efficient moreover even within sample married couples high satisfaction levels benefits spousal hand holding threat even important couples reported highest quality marital relationship mentioned social contact help regulate emotional responses cope life stressors people benefit high social support tend perceive stressful situation less threatening consequently produce less intense behavioral response deal people social support must engage less cognitive effort regulate emotions people experience kind social support relationships provide social support allows us engage fewer resources regulate emotions especially must cope stressful situations social relationships shortterm longterm effects health mental physical lifespan perspective recent research suggests early life experiences still consequences health behavior adulthood indeed either positive negative effects relationships tend foster cumulative advantage disadvantage health lowquality relationships well lack social support negative consequences health moreover consequences cumulative lifespan studies marriage found one important relationships many adults may beneficial effects health depending perception marital relationship lowquality marital relationships negative effects physical health thus unfortunate marriages might associated morbidity mortality moreover physiological responses elevations heart rate changes hormone levels related stress alterations immunity function emerge conflict discussions married couples lowquality marital relationships increase probability developing chronic stress tend longterm implications however lack relationships social isolation loneliness social exclusion also negative consequences mental physical health first important distinguish two similar expressions social isolation loneliness social isolation refers objective lack relationships whereas loneliness subjective feeling isolation distress study conducted united states among older adults examine relationship social isolation loneliness health outcomes results gave evidence feeling loneliness always correlated social isolation indeed feeling loneliness strongly related mental health problems objective social younger people also affected social isolation hefner eisenberg conducted study among college students evaluate relationship social support mental study reveals two interesting results first students greater risk social isolation characteristics differ classmates ie minority race ethnicity international status low socioeconomic status etc second students report lower quality social support tend experience mental health problems ie depression symptoms report higher quality social support development research methods neuroimaging hormone studies clinical neuropsychology opened expanded study understanding link health social relationships even animal studies also helped progress new field called neuroscience neuroscientific perspective could considered social experiences involve specific neural systems research managed differentiate two brain response systems based type social experience sense social experiences considered negative would activate brain structures destined threat process social experiences perceived positive pleasant would involve structures corresponding reward system whether threat response system reward system would trigger series certain psychophysiological responses linked health adaptive behaviors heart rate hormone production blood pressure respiratory rate etc similarly argued involvement reward system would inhibitory effect alarm empirical evidence supporting ideas obtained based research animals humans neuroimaging hormonal studies concerning threat response system observed dorsal anterior cingulate cortex dacc anterior insula periaqueductal gray play important role areas impaired animals show reduction distress vein humans presented photos deceased loved ones structures show significant hand reward system linked social experience ventromedial prefrontal cortex vmpfc seems important implication study conducted eisenberger colleagues participants saw picture highly supportive romantic relationship partner experience physical results showed increased activation vmpfc time decrease dacc similarly supportive messages social exclusion show activity finally regarding hormonal studies uchino colleagues suggest link hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis inflammatory markers may predict health problems cardiovascular disease diabetes frailty furthermore social stimuli touch massage production oxytocin hormone antistress effects associated decrease cortisol levels blood pleasure thus although neuroscientific approach still development neurological evidence link social relationships health based described important elaborate interventions improve physical mental health enhancing social relationships interventions could target different contexts work friendship etc different populations young aged people married single etc identifying context population targeted important individuals risk others overall specific contexts instance well described students population categorized risk health problems among students black students concerned mental health example important design intervention specific black students slightly different one designed students general according kawachi berkman interventions proposed success improve social ties support group interventions onetoone support interventions interventions enhance natural due variability intervention even category intervention proposed literature feasible draw generalized conclusions however targeting specific contexts specific populations studies found kinds interventions effective improve physical mental health instance leung orrell orgeta reviewed literature testing positive effect social support group interventions people diagnosed dementia found small benefits depression quality life however trials included review limited two studies fit inclusion criteria heterogeneous meaning difficult conclude effect social support group interventions context randomized controlled trials needed four interventions identified masi collaborators reduce loneliness improving social skills enhancing social support increasing opportunities social interaction addressing abnormal social increasing opportunities social interaction enhancing social skills could bigger impact social isolation whereas improving social skills addressing abnormal social cognition focus loneliness improving social skills refers giving methods better interact others among lonely college students kind intervention positively associated less loneliness goal interventions address abnormal social cognition lonely individuals learn automatic negative thoughts facts hypotheses seniors interventions could homevisit telephone contacts group interventionsactivities etc effective ones might group interventions one intervention aims increase opportunities social interaction befriending seems reduce social isolation interventions seem effective one interventions enhance opportunities social interaction via group activities groupbased interventions men tend receptive interventions women potentially women tend selfreliant men interventions enhance social support seem least effective interventions address abnormal social cognition seem biggest impact loneliness compared interventions another aspect important mention social policies effect relationship health also preventive implementation social ties policies may effective enhance health wellbeing health outcomes obesity happiness etc may widely expanded social networks social policies use natural effect interventions one major issue policies must face relation social ties health vary across social groups need careful whose implement interventions reduce social isolation policies enhance education system improve socialemotional skills instance improve interventions health policies future research still needed identify populations high risk social isolation understand types interventions prevention campaigns effective public health issue sample size related studies generally low impacts statistical robustness another criticism lack representativeness samples studies conducted western societies adams glenn point personal relationships various effects among different thus possible studying populations western countries highlight different results studying lowincome countries assumption reinforced findings de silva colleagues suggest effect relationships health might differ depending hence important explore effect larger samples fit better populations countries explore link different cultures reviewing link social support depression symptoms gariépy et al found measurement social support problematic indeed tools used measure social support heterogeneous studies reviewed consequence heterogeneity sure studies measure thing furthermore stated half studies reviewed used measurement tools statistically valid meaning unsure whether tools truly measure social support based research easily guessed problem also found research studies link social relationships health digging issue dambi colleagues compared translation one used scales assess perceived social support multidimensional perceived social support scale mspss found equally one major issues described different translated scales rigorously translated hence possible compare different studies different countries used mspss evaluate effect relationships health assumed problem also found international scales given critics presented field psychology needs explore links relationships health using reliable methods bigger sample size representative samples causality design valid measurement tools utilization reliable methods useful generalize findings broader population enhance statistical power studies summarized quality studies reassuring observe development new ways science like crowdsourced science encourages use better methods enhance quality
