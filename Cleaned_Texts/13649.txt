menopausal hormone therapy menopausal symptoms like hot flashes osteoporosis low sexual desire women treat breast cancer taken mouth held cheek side effects methyltestosterone include symptoms masculinization like acne increased hair growth voice changes increased sexual also cause estrogenic effects like fluid retention breast tenderness breast enlargement men liver drug synthetic androgen anabolic steroid hence agonist androgen receptor ar biological target androgens like testosterone dihydrotestosterone moderate androgenic effects moderate anabolic effects make useful producing methyltestosterone discovered introduced medical use made shortly discovery testosterone one first synthetic aas addition medical use methyltestosterone used improve physique performance although commonly used aas purposes due androgenic effects estrogenic effects risk liver drug controlled substance many countries nonmedical use generally methyltestosterone used treatment delayed puberty hypogonadism cryptorchidism erectile dysfunction males low doses treat menopausal symptoms specifically osteoporosis hot flashes increase libido energy postpartum breast pain engorgement breast cancer specifically approved united states treatment hypogonadism delayed puberty males treatment advanced inoperable breast cancer also approved low doses combination esterified estrogens treatment moderate severe vasomotor symptoms associated menopause women united states formulation discontinued hence longer methyltestosterone less effective inducing masculinization testosterone useful maintaining established masculinization dosages methyltestosterone used mgday men common medical uses like hypogonadism delayed puberty well physique performanceenhancing purposes mgday women menopausal higher

caution women children cause irreversible due estrogenicity methyltestosterone also accelerate epiphyseal closure thereby produce short stature children worsen symptoms men benign prostatic methyltestosterone used men prostate cancer androgens accelerate tumor drug used caution patients preexisting hepatotoxicity due potential adverse effects methyltestosterone include androgenic side effects like oily skin acne seborrhea increased facialbody hair growth scalp hair loss increased aggressiveness sex drive spontaneous erections well estrogenic side effects like breast tenderness gynecomastia fluid retention women methyltestosterone cause partially irreversible virilization instance voice deepening hirsutism clitoromegaly breast atrophy muscle hypertrophy well menstrual disturbances reversible men drug may also cause hypogonadism testicular atrophy reversible infertility sufficiently high methyltestosterone sometimes cause hepatotoxicity instance elevated liver enzymes cholestatic jaundice peliosis hepatis hepatomas hepatocellular carcinoma extended also adverse effects cardiovascular aas like methyltestosterone stimulate erythropoiesis red blood cell production increase hematocrit levels high dosages cause polycythemia overproduction red blood cells greatly increase risk thrombic events embolism longterm treatment aas increase risk benign prostatic hyperplasia prostate violent even homicidal behavior hypomaniamania depression suicidality delusions psychosis associated high dosages aromatase inhibitors used reduce prevent estrogenic effects methyltestosterone inhibitors used prevent potentiation socalled androgenic tissues thereby improve ratio anabolic androgenic activity reduce rate androgenic side antiandrogens like bicalutamide cyproterone acetate block anabolic androgenic effects aas like methyltestosterone aas methyltestosterone agonist androgen receptor ar similarly androgens like testosterone dihydrotestosterone substrate like testosterone potentiated analogously socalled androgenic tissues like skin hair follicles prostate gland via transformation potent ar agonist mestanolone methyltestosterone relatively low ratio anabolic androgenic activity similar ratio testosterone close makes among androgenic due efficient aromatization potent metabolismresistant estrogen methylestradiol methyltestosterone relatively high estrogenicity hence potential estrogenic side effects gynecomastia fluid drug possesses negligible progestogenic due combined disadvantages relatively poor ratio anabolic androgenic activity unusually high estrogenicity potential hepatotoxicity aas methyltestosterone used commonly many aas either medicine physique performanceenhancing methyltestosterone dramatically improved oral bioavailability metabolic stability relative difference due methyl group results steric hindrance prevents oral bioavailability methyltestosterone wellabsorbed gastrointestinal methyltestosterone also taken buccally although effective orally methyltestosterone effective nonoral routes said approximately double bioavailability require half oral circulating levels methyltestosterone administration mgday oral methyltestosterone women range comparison testosterone methyltestosterone least potent however due large decrease sex hormonebinding
