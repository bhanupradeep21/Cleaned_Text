ambush predators sitandwait predators carnivorous animals capture trap prey via stealth luring typically instinctive strategies utilizing element surprise unlike pursuit predators chase capture prey using sheer speed endurance ambush predators avoid fatigue staying concealment waiting patiently prey get near launching sudden overwhelming attack quickly incapacitates captures prey ambush often opportunistic may set hiding burrow camouflage aggressive mimicry use trap eg web predator uses combination senses detect assess prey time strike nocturnal ambush predators cats snakes vertical slit pupils helping judge distance prey dim light different ambush predators use variety means capture prey long sticky tongues chameleons expanding mouths frogfishes ambush predation widely distributed animal kingdom spanning members numerous groups starfish cephalopods crustaceans spiders insects mantises vertebrates many snakes fishes ambush predators usually remain motionless sometimes hidden wait prey come within ambush distance pouncing ambush predators often camouflaged may solitary pursuit predation becomes better strategy ambush predation predator faster ambush predators use many intermediate strategies example pursuit predator faster prey short distance long chase either stalking ambush becomes necessary part ambush often relies concealment whether staying sight means camouflage ambush predators trapdoor spiders australian crab spiders land mantis shrimps sea rely concealment constructing hiding burrows provide effective concealment price restricted field trapdoor spiders excavate burrow seal entrance web trapdoor hinged one side silk bestknown thick bevelled cork type neatly fits burrows opening wafer type basic sheet silk earth doors upper side often effectively camouflaged local materials pebbles sticks spider spins silk fishing lines trip wires radiate burrow entrance spider using trap capture prey chelicerae protruding mouthparts hold door shut end furthest hinge prey make silk vibrate alert spider open door ambush many ambush predators make use camouflage prey come within striking range without detecting presence among insects coloration ambush bugs closely matches flower heads wait among fishes warteye stargazer buries nearly completely sand waits devil scorpionfish typically lies partially buried sea floor coral head day covering sand debris camouflage tasselled wobbegong shark whose adaptations ambush predator include strongly flattened camouflaged body fringe breaks among amphibians pipa pipas brown coloration blends murky waters amazon rainforest allows species lie wait ambush many ambush predators actively attract prey towards ambushing strategy called aggressive mimicry using false promise nourishment lure prey alligator snapping turtle wellcamouflaged ambush predator tongue bears conspicuous pink extension resembles worm wriggled fish try eat worm eaten turtle similarly reptiles elaphe rat snakes employ caudal luring tail luring entice small vertebrates striking zonetailed hawk resembles turkey vulture flies among flocks turkey vultures suddenly breaks formation ambushes one however controversy whether true case wolf sheeps clothing flower mantises aggressive mimics resembling flowers convincingly enough attract prey come collect pollen nectar orchid mantis actually attracts prey pollinator insects effectively flowers crab spiders similarly coloured like flowers habitually rest lure prey even away ambush predators build traps help capture prey lacewings flying insect order neuroptera species larval form known antlion ambush predator eggs laid earth often caves rocky ledge juvenile creates small crater shaped trap antlion hides light cover sand earth ant beetle prey slides trap antlion grabs prey powerful webspinning spiders sitandwait ambush predators sheetweb spiders linyphiidae tend stay webs long periods resemble sitandwait predators whereas orbweaving spiders araneidae tend move frequently one patch another thus resemble active ambush predators must time strike carefully need detect prey assess worth attacking strike exactly right place evolved variety adaptations facilitate assessment example pit vipers prey small birds choosing targets right size mouth gape larger snakes choose larger prey prefer strike prey warm pit organs eye nostril contain infrared heat receptors enabling find perhaps judge size small warmblooded addition assessment aspect sometimes predator fit prey mouth put prey back leave alone defined gape limitation typically make predators seen generalists deepsea tripodfish bathypterois grallator uses tactile mechanosensory cues identify food lowlight fish faces current waiting prey drift several species felidae cats snakes vertically elongated slit pupils advantageous nocturnal ambush predators helps estimate distance prey dim light diurnal pursuit predators contrast round ambush tactic done wolves lions considered tactic cooperative hunters flock particular species hunts prey group obtain much larger prey ambush predators often adaptations seizing prey rapidly securely capturing movement rapid trap prey given attack modifiable zebra mantis shrimp capture agile prey fish primarily night hidden burrows striking hard fast mean peak speed ms mph mean duration chameleons family chamaeleonidae highly adapted ambush change colour match surroundings often climb trees swaying motion probably mimic movement leaves branches surrounded chameleons primarily insectivores feed ballistically projecting tongues often twice length bodies capture tongue projected little launched acceleration power tongue launched w muscle produce indicating energy stored elastic tissue sudden fishes face basic problem trying swallow prey opening mouth may pull food closing push food frogfishes capture prey suddenly opening jaws mechanism enlarges volume mouth cavity pulls prey crustaceans molluscs whole fishes mouth along water jaws close without reducing volume mouth cavity attack fast ambush predation widely distributed across animal kingdom found many vertebrates including fishes frogfishes anglerfishes sea bottom pikes
