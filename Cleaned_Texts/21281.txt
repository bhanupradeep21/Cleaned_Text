legs held water column four hind legs resting aquatic allows detect vibrational stimuli produced swimming prey thus orient towards clutch courtship males actively search swimmingwalking male finds female slowly circles around whilst trembling first second leg near males females directly copulate sexual reproduction involves male depositing six eighteen spermatophores onto substrate front female female sexually receptive rubs ventral front surface abdomen venter spermatophore later transfers genital dr heather proctor formerly university toronto university alberta studied courtship behaviour neumania papillator noticed male leg trembling caused females net stance orient towards often clutch damage male deter courtship male deposited spermatophores began vigorously fan jerk fourth pair legs spermatophore generating current water passed spermatophores towards female sperm packet uptake female would sometimes proctor hypothesised vibrations trembling male legs made done mimic vibrations females detect swimming prey would trigger females preydetection response causing females orient clutch males mediating true males exploiting female predation responses hungry females receptive male trembling proctor found unfed captive females orient clutch males significantly fed captive females consistent sensory exploitation evidence sensory exploitation hypothesis resulted cladistic analysis comparing characters water mites family unionicolidae identified likely evolutionary scenario fewest reversal character states fewer parallel evolution character states homoplasies origin trembling behaviour net male courtship trembling behaviour ever evolved net stance evolved species analyzed support idea trembling exploitation preexisting female sensory cladograms generated showed two equally plausible evolutionary histories net stance trembling either evolved concomitantly common ancestor neumania unionicola closely related mite family confamilial net stance evolved trembling evolved twice former scenario ambiguous evidence sensory exploitation hypothesis whilst latter supports water mite eyes form images proctor suggests males benefit females reorientation clutching detect directly front female deposit spermatophores may also prevent males depositing spermatophores responding residual chemical stimuli left female empty perch trembling observed recently deserted perches never spermatophore fanning water spermatophores towards female probably serves move pheromones male female phenomenon known many noncopulating arthropods proctor observed females cease predatory behaviours initiate courtship behaviours receiving chemical evidence males deposited spermatophores preferentially based female virginity female hunger level though virgin females remain courting males longer nonvirgin multiple males one female antagonism displayed males trembling stage courtship soon one male deposits spermatophores often second male tramples spermatophores attempts interfere males fanning latter attempt stop pheromones fanning males spermatophore reaching water mite sex ratios often biased towards females proctor found disharmony sex ratios neumania
