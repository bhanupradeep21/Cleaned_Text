google flu trends gft web service operated google provided estimates influenza activity countries aggregating google search queries attempted make accurate predictions flu activity project first launched googleorg help predict outbreaks google flu trends stopped publishing current estimates august historical estimates still available download current data offered declared research idea behind google flu trends monitoring millions users health tracking behaviors online large number google search queries gathered analyzed reveal presence flulike illness population google flu trends compared findings historic baseline level influenza activity corresponding region reports activity level either minimal low moderate high intense estimates generally consistent conventional surveillance data collected health agencies nationally regionally roni zeiger helped develop google flu google flu trends described using following method gather information flu first time series computed million common queries entered weekly within united states querys time series computed separately state normalized fraction dividing number query number queries state identifying ip address associated search state query entered determined linear model used compute logodds influenzalike illness ili physician visit logodds ilirelated search query p percentage ili physician visit q ilirelated query fraction computed previous steps intercept coefficient ε error termcitation needed million queries tested q see result computed single query could match actual history ili data obtained us centers disease control prevention cdc process produces list top queries gives accurate predictions cdc ili data using linear model top queries chosen aggregated together queries fit history data accurately using sum top ilirelated queries linear model fitted weekly ili data coefficient gained finally trained model used predict flu outbreak across regions united states algorithm subsequently revised google partially response concerns accuracy attempts replicate results suggested algorithm developers felt unarticulated need cloak actual search terms google flu trends tries avoid privacy violations aggregating millions anonymous search queries without identifying individuals performed search log contains ip address user could used trace back region search query originally submitted google runs programs computers access calculate data human involved process google also implemented policy anonymize ip address search logs however google flu trends raised privacy concerns among privacy groups electronic privacy information center patient privacy rights sent letter eric schmidt ceo conceded use usergenerated data could support public health effort significant ways expressed worries userspecific investigations could compelled even googles objection court order presidential authority initial motivation gft able identify disease activity early respond quickly could reduce impact seasonal pandemic influenza one report google flu trends able predict regional outbreaks flu days reported cdc centers disease control flu pandemic google flu trends tracked information flu united february cdc identified influenza cases spiking midatlantic region united states however googles data search queries flu symptoms able show spike two weeks prior cdc report releasedcitation needed earlier warning earlier prevention control measures put place could prevent cases influenza said dr lyn finelli lead surveillance influenza division cdc percent nations population contract flu year leading roughly deaths average google flu trends example collective intelligence used identify trends calculate predictions data amassed search engines significantly insightful search queries represent peoples unfiltered wants needs seems like really clever way using data created unintentionally users google see patterns world would otherwise invisible said thomas w malone professor sloan school management mit think scratching surface whats possible collective intelligence initial google paper stated google flu trends predictions accurate comparing cdc however subsequent reports asserted google flu trends predictions sometimes interval consistently overestimated relative flu one interval flu season predicted twice many doctors visits cdc study published commentaries international journal found google flu trends outperformed recency heuristic instance socalled naive forecasting predicted flu incidence equals recently observed flu incidence weeks march august horizon google flu trends predictions available mean absolute error google flu trends recency heuristic percentage points linear regression single predictor recently observed flu incidence mean absolute error also benchmark random prediction one source problems people making flurelated google searches may know little diagnose flu searches flu flu symptoms may well researching disease symptoms similar flu actually furthermore analysis search terms reportedly tracked google fever cough well effects changes search algorithm time raised concerns meaning fall google began attempting compensate increases searches due prominence flu news found previously skewed however one analysis concluded combining gft lagged cdc data well dynamically recalibrating gft substantially improve performance gft cdc later study also demonstrates google search data indeed used improve estimates reducing errors seen model using cdc data alone per reassessing original gft model researchers uncovered model aggregating queries different health conditions something could lead overprediction ili rates work series advanced linear nonlinear betterperforming approaches ili modelling however followup work able substantially improve accuracy gft use random forest regression model trained incidence influenzalike illness output original gft similar projects fluprediction institute cognitive science osnabrück carry basic idea forward combining social media data eg twitter cdc data structural models infer spatial temporal spreading disease httpsenwikipediaorgwikigoogleflutrends
