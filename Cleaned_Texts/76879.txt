following infection rate clinical disease progression varies individuals factors host susceptibility genetics immune health care well viral genetic may affect rate progression point needing take medication order develop aids small percentage hivinfected individuals rapidly progress aids fail take medication within four years primary hivinfection termed rapid progressors indeed individuals known progress aids death within year primoinfection rapid progression originally thought continent specific studies reported disease progression rapid others contested another subset individuals persistently infected show signs disease progression years remain asymptomatic classified long term nonprogressors ltnp individuals seems hivinfection halted regard disease progression extended period however term ltnp misnomer progression towards aids occur even years stable ltnp homogeneous group regarding viral load specific immune responses ltnps infected hiv inefficiently whilst others infected hiv virally fit replicates normally infected individual strong broad set hivspecific humoral cellmediated responses seems delay progression aids cohorts individuals experience signs progression whose clinical laboratory parameters remain stable long periods time classified long term survivors another smaller percentage individuals recently identified called highly exposed persistently seronegative heps small group individuals observed group uninfected hivnegative sex workers kenya gambia individuals pbmcs stimulated peptides lymphoproliferative activity specific ctl activity suggesting transient infection may occur unexposed individuals interesting ctl epitope specificity differs heps hiv positive individuals heps maintenance responses appears dependent upon persistent exposure initial weeks hiv infection qualitative differences cellmediated immune response observed correlate different disease progression rates ie rapid progression stage rapid loss cell levels versus normal slow progression stage maintenance cell counts appearance cytotoxic cells ctls early primoinfection correlated control virus escapes ctl response found mutations specific ctl individuals broad expansion vbeta chain cell receptor cells primoinfection appear low levels virus six twelve months later predictive relatively slow disease progression contrast individuals expansion single subset vbeta chain cells able control hiv levels time thus high viral loads six twelve months ltnp also shown vigorous proliferation circulating activated ctl multiple epitopes detectable broadly crossreactive neutralizing antibodies setting extremely low viral however reports correlated presence antibodies tat ltnp statuscitation needed subtype individual becomes infected major factor rate progression seroconversion aids individuals infected subtypes c g times likely develop aids individuals infected subtype uganda subtypes subtype associated faster disease progression compared subtype age also shown major factor determining survival rate disease progression individuals years age seroconversion associated rapid centers disease control prevention cdc released findings genes influence susceptibility hiv infection progression aids hiv enters cells interaction chemokine receptor transmembrane family first reviewed role genes encoding chemokine receptors chemokines multiple variants coding region deletion segment results nonfunctional receptor thus preventing hiv entry two copies gene provide strong protection hiv infection although protection absolute allele found around europeans rare africans asians multiple studies hivinfected persons shown presence one copy mutation named delta delays progression condition aids yearscitation needed national institute health nih funded research studies learn genetic mutation research nih found exist genetic tests determine person mutation implications genetic test may future allow clinicians change treatment hiv infection according genetic makeup currently exist several athome tests mutation individuals however diagnostic testscitation needed relatively new class drugs hiv treatment relies genetic makeup individual entry inhibitors bind protein block hiv binding cellcitation needed coinfections immunizations may enhance viral replication inducing response activation immune system activation facilitates three key stages viral life cycle entry cell reverse transcription proviral chemokine receptors vital entry hiv cells expression receptors inducible immune activation caused infection immunization thus augmenting number cells infected reverse transcription genome rate transcription proviral dna rely upon activation state cell less likely successful quiescent cells activated cells increase cytoplasmic concentrations mediators required reverse transcription hiv activated cells also release ifnalpha acts autocrine paracrine loop upregulates levels physiologically active nfkappa b activates host cell genes well impact coinfections microorganisms mycobacterium tuberculosis important disease progression particularly high prevalence chronic recurrent acute infections poor access medical often survival depends upon initial aidsdefining coinfection dna viruses herpes simplex varicella zoster virus cytomegalovirus may enhance proviral dna transcription thus viral load may encode proteins transactivate expression proviral frequent exposure helminth infections endemic africa activates individual immune systems thereby shifting cytokine balance away initial cell response viruses bacteria would occur uninfected person less protective helper also promotes shift replicates preferentially makes host susceptible less able cope infection viruses types bacteria ironically exposure
