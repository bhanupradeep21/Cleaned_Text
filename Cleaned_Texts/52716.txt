fertilization sperm must first fuse plasma membrane penetrate female egg cell fertilize fusing egg cell usually causes little problem whereas penetrating eggs hard shell extracellular matrix difficult therefore sperm cells go process known acrosome reaction reaction occurs acrosome sperm approaches egg acrosome membranebound organelle golgi apparatus origin commonly located tip head mature spermatozoon called apical body location perforatorium assumption might assist spermatozoon boring sperm approaches zona pellucida egg necessary initiating acrosome reaction membrane surrounding acrosome fuses plasma membrane sperms head exposing contents acrosome contents include surface antigens necessary binding eggs cell membrane numerous enzymes responsible breaking eggs tough coating allowing fertilization considerable species variations morphology consequences acrosome reaction several species trigger acrosome reaction identified layer surrounds egg lower animal species protuberance acrosomal process forms apex sperm head supported core actin microfilaments membrane tip acrosomal process fuses eggs plasma membrane echinoderms including starfish sea urchins significant portion exposed acrosomal content contains protein temporarily holds sperm eggs surface mammals acrosome reaction releases hyaluronidase acrosin role fertilization yet clear acrosomal reaction begin sperm comes contact oocytes zona pellucida upon coming contact zona pellucida acrosomal enzymes begin dissolve actin filament comes contact zona pellucida two meet calcium influx occurs causing signaling cascade cortical granules inside oocyte fuse outer membrane quick fast block reaction occurs also alters patch preexisting sperm plasma membrane fuse egg plasma membrane sperm penetration assay includes acrosome reaction test assesses well sperm perform fertilization process sperm unable go acrosome reaction properly able fertilize egg however problem occurs men test done test rather expensive provides limited information mans cases wood mouse apodemus sylvaticus premature acrosome reactions found cause increased motility aggregates spermatozoa promoting acrosomal reaction usually takes place ampulla fallopian tube site fertilization sperm penetrates secondary oocyte events precede actual acrosome reaction sperm cell acquires hyperactive motility pattern flagellum produces vigorous whiplike movements propel sperm cervical canal uterine cavity reaches isthmus fallopian tube sperm approaches ovum ampulla fallopian tube help various mechanisms including chemotaxis glycoproteins outer surface sperm bind glycoproteins zona pellucida ovum sperm initiate acrosome reaction prior reaching zona pellucida unable penetrate zona pellucida since acrosome reaction already occurred sperm able penetrate zona pellucida due mechanical action tail acrosome reaction first stage penetration corona radiata releasing hyaluronidase acrosome digest cumulus cells surrounding oocyte exposing acrosin attached inner membrane sperm cumulus cells embedded gellike substance made primarily hyaluronic acid developed ovary egg support grows acrosome reaction must occur sperm cell reaches zona acrosin digests zona pellucida membrane oocyte part sperms cell membrane fuses egg cells membrane contents head sink egg mouse demonstrated one proteins make zona pellucida binds partner molecule transferase receptors sperm lockandkey type mechanism speciesspecific prevents sperm egg different species fusing zona pellucida also releases ca granules prevent sperm binding evidence binding triggers acrosome release enzymes allow sperm fuse egg similar mechanism likely occurs mammals diversity zona proteins across species means relevant protein receptor may differ recent scientific evidence demonstrates acrosomal reaction necessary expose protein called sperm without reaction sperm still penetrate zona pellucida egg membrane seen mouse studies binds oocyte protein juno bound together sperm egg fuse together form two pronuclei supply zygote genetic material necessary formation embryo additionally fusion sperm oocyte complete phospholipase c zeta released sperm upon penetration normally occurring process eggactivation occurs oocyte said become activated thought induced specific protein phospholipase c zeta undergoes secondary meiotic division two haploid nuclei paternal maternal fuse form zygote prevent polyspermy minimize possibility producing triploid zygote several changes eggs cell membranes render impenetrable shortly first sperm enters egg rapid loss spermatozoa initiate acrosomal reaction well advance reaching zona pellucida well vitro appropriate culture medium referred spontaneous acrosome reaction sar known certain sense phenomenon physiologically normal across mammalian species acrosome reaction induced passage cumulus oophorus cells mediated hormones secrete progesterone lpa however physiological role truly spontaneous acrosomal reaction occurring well point female reproductive tract vitro separate phenomenon mice well established physiologically normal common mouse sperm undergone fully spontaneous acrosome reaction still able fertilize furthermore rate spontaneous acrosome reaction higher promiscuous species apodemus sylvaticus face high level sperm humans hand remains disputed exactly acrosome reaction initiated physiological fertilization due experimental constraints example animal studies may make use transgenic mice fluorescent sperm human studies studies done intent linking vitro sar rate human sperm sperm quality fertilization rate overall results mixed seem clinically useful using intracytoplasmic sperm injection icsi ivf implantation rate higher oocytes injected spermatozoa undergone acrosome reaction vs injected nonreacted spermatozoa implantation rate injected reacted nonreacted spermatozoa delivery rate per cycle follows acrosome reaction stimulated vitro substances sperm cell
