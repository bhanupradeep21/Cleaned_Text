objective periodontal scaling root planing remove dental plaque calculus tartar house bacteria release toxins cause inflammation gum tissue surrounding bone planing often removes cementum dentine removal adherent plaque calculus hand instruments also performed prophylactically patients without periodontal disease prophylaxis refers scaling polishing teeth order prevent oral diseases polishing remove calculus plaque stains therefore done conjunction scaling often electric device known ultrasonic scaler sonic scaler power scaler may used scaling root planing ultrasonic scalers vibrate high frequency help removing stain plaque calculus addition ultrasonic scalers create tiny air bubbles process known cavitation bubbles serve important function periodontal cleanings since bacteria living periodontically involved pockets mainly obligate anaerobes meaning unable survive presence oxygen bubbles help destroy oxygen helps break bacterial cell membranes causes lyse burst since utmost importance remove entirety deposit periodontal pocket attention detail procedure crucial therefore depending depth pocket amount calculus deposit versus soft biofilm deposit hand instruments may used complete fine hand scaling removes anything ultrasonic scaler left behind alternatively power scalers may used following hand scaling order dispel deposits removed tooth root structure remain within periodontal pocket sonic ultrasonic scalers powered system causes tip vibrate sonic scalers powered airdriven turbine ultrasonic scalers use either magnetostrictive piezoelectric systems create

faster less irritating client ultrasonic scalers create aerosols spread pathogens client carries infectious disease research differs whether difference effectiveness ultrasonic scalers hand particular importance dentists use ultrasonic scaler may reduce risk repetitive stress injury ultrasonic scalers require less pressure repetition compared hand new addition tools used treat periodontal disease dental laser lasers differing strengths used many procedures modern dentistry including fillings periodontal setting laser may used following scaling root planing order promote healing following scaling additional steps may taken disinfect periodontal tissues oral irrigation periodontal tissues may done using chlorhexidine gluconate solution high substantivity oral tissues means unlike mouthwashes whose benefits end upon expectorating active antibacterial ingredients chlorhexidine gluconate infiltrate tissue remain active period time however effective chlorhexidine gluconate meant longterm use recent european study suggests link longterm use mouthrinse high blood pressure may lead higher incidence cardiovascular events united states available doctors prescription small infrequent doses shown aid tissue healing surgery current research indicates irrigation chx scrp may inhibit reattachment periodontal tissues specifically preventing formation fibroblasts alternate irrigation povidoneiodine may used contraindications exist site specific antibiotics may also placed periodontal pocket following scaling root planing order provide additional healing infected tissues unlike antibiotics taken orally achieve systemic effect site specific antibiotics placed specifically area infection antibiotics placed directly periodontal pockets release slowly period time allows

scaling scaling root planing procedure considered effective patient subsequently able maintain periodontal health without bone attachment loss prevents recurrent infection periodontal long term effectiveness scaling root planing depends upon number factors factors include patient compliance disease progress time intervention probing depth anatomical factors like grooves roots teeth concavities furcation involvement may limit visibility underlying deep calculus debris first foremost periodontal scaling root planing procedure must done thoroughly attention detail order ensure complete removal calculus plaque involved sites causative agents removed disease continue progress damage result cases mild moderate periodontitis scaling root planing achieve excellent results procedure thorough periodontitis increases severity greater amount supporting bone destroyed infection illustrated clinically deepening periodontal pockets targeted cleaning disinfection procedure periodontal pockets exceed mm depth effectiveness deposit removal begins decrease likelihood complete healing one procedure begins decline well severe infection prior intervention greater effort required arrest progress return patient health diseased pockets mm resolved periodontal flap surgery performed dental specialist known although healing soft tissues begin immediately following removal microbial biofilm calculus cause disease scaling root planing first step arresting disease process following initial cleaning disinfection affected sites necessary prevent infection recurring therefore patient compliance far important factor greatest influence success failure periodontal intervention immediately following treatment patient need maintain excellent oral care home proper homecare includes means limited brushing twice daily minutes flossing daily use mouthrinse potential effective healing following scaling root planing increases commitment diligence thorough completion daily oral hygiene practices essential success patient fails change factors allowed disease set example flossing brushing day infection likely recur process allows formation deep periodontal pockets occur overnight therefore unrealistic expect tissue heal completely similarly short time period gains gingival attachment may occur slowly time ongoing periodontal maintenance visits usually recommended every three four months sustain frequency later appointments key maintaining results initial scaling root planing especially first year immediately following treatment since patient may still pockets surpass effective cleaning ability brush floss longterm success treatment return every days order ensure pockets remain free deposit patients counseled days arbitrary interval days healing made possible scaling root planing complete allow practitioner remeasure pocket depths determine whether intervention successful appointment progress discussed well refractory periodontitis
