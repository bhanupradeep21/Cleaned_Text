fairness machine learning refers various attempts correcting algorithmic bias automated decision processes based machine learning models decisions made computers machinelearning process may considered unfair based variables considered sensitive examples kinds variable include gender ethnicity sexual orientation disability case many ethical concepts definitions fairness bias always controversial general fairness bias considered relevant decision process impacts peoples lives machine learning problem algorithmic bias well known well studied outcomes may skewed range factors thus might
