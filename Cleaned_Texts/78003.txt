evolutionary neuroandrogenic ena theory conceptual framework seeks explain trends violent criminal behavior evolutionary biological perspective first proposed sociologist lee ellis paper theory explaining biological correlates criminality published european journal since expanded interdisciplinary field intersects biology psychology sociology theory rests two propositions first human mating behavior females prefer males appear competent providers resources males exhibit increased competitive behavior females obtain access resources second biological mechanisms namely increased presence androgens lead differential development male brain mediates increased competitive behaviors cause criminality though originally intended explain high rates criminality young men since used framework explain gang behavior terrorism rise criminal justice called question validity ena theory citing mixed literature effect prenatal androgen exposure later aggressive various sociological theories theory differential association edwin sutherland theory anomie Ã©mile durkheim sought explain criminal behavior lens however theories inadequate explaining two trends rapid increase criminality pubertyyoung adulthood gender disparity criminal behavior cases trends conserved variety different societies suggesting trends cause thus researchers began looking biological explanation trends modern field evolutionary psychology took form landmark studies david buss sex differences human mate preferences evolutionary hypotheses tested scientific knowledge developments evolutionary psychology allowed lee ellis formulate known evolutionary neuroandrogenic theory first ena theory posits women value social position resources prospective partner men therefore large evolutionary incentive men compete obtain aforementioned social status resources thus males evolved greater competitive behavior could manifest criminality depending behaviors position crudesophistication ellis hypothesized aforementioned selective pressures led changes male brain mediated substantial increase presence androgens male sex hormones particularly testosterone puberty testosterone levels spike producing three changes identified ena theory play crucial role competitive behavior first change lowering sensitivity male brain adverse environmental stimuli change dual role decreasing sensitivity pain keeping brain suboptimally aroused state thus men tend seek sensory stimulation resistant pain behavior might elicit second change caused testosterone alterations limbic system increasing likelihood episodic dyscontrol person experiences sudden often violent negative outburst finally ellis believed testosterone led change lateralization brain left right sides brain implicated different mental processes left functioning language moral reasoning right functioned calculation risk reward ellis suggests testosterone shifted neocortical activity right hemisphere brain thus decreasing moral reasoning competitive behavior necessarily constitute criminal behavior distinguish behaviors likely criminal versus benign behaviors ellis proposed crudesophisticated spectrum crude behaviors obviously purposefully harmful eg rape murder etc sophisticated behaviors still compete status resources generally considered acceptable society eg competing promotion political position many behaviors lie two extremes example whitecollar crimes embezzlement fraud cause physical harm people also accepted onset puberty early adulthood males males experience sudden inclination competitive behavior yet learned manifest acceptable way therefore competitive behavior age range tends crude explaining disproportionate amount criminality among young men however men age gradually learn socially accepted behavior behavior transitions crude sophisticated ellis predicts means higher intelligence people go transition faster exhibit less criminality less intelligent several lines evidence point females selecting males greater access economic resources ellis points crosscultural study different cultures found women universally preferred men greater financial prospects men trend also reflected personality traits women prefer women preferring ambitious industrious men cultures sampled study done mate selection primitive tanzanian huntergatherer society showed women valued mens foraging society indicating women also valued mates access evidence also shows preferences translate actual mating behavior recent studies showing women tend date marry men higher various studies found salivary blood testosterone levels correlated criminal behavior one study prisoner inmates found salivary testosterone higher prison inmates convicted violent crimes violated prison study performed ellis ratio used indirectly measure fetal testosterone levels researchers used correlate criminality study found increased fetal testosterone levels moderately correlated likelihood committing variety different types crimes men ena theory predicts males transition adolescence adulthood learn manifest competitive behavior sophisticated fashion thereby decreasing criminality therefore ena theory would predict greater learning ability would able make crudesophisticated transition faster exhibit less criminal behavior ellis points evidence moderate inverse correlation iq probability looks research shows learning disabilities directly correlated juvenile however notes research required understand effects different types intelligence criminality existing research largely correlational one central pillars ena theory fetal testosterone levels cause permanent changes male brains lead increased criminality later life however individual studies provided strong results effect size fetal testosterone aggressive violent behavior metaanalyses remained less conclusive metaanalysis fetal testosterone levels found fetal testosterone levels measured digit ratio small effect size aggressive violent behavior authors concluded digit ratio neither strongly reliably related aggressive violent researchers also pointed fact digit ratio method often used relate prenatal testosterone future behaviors rough unreliable measure prenatal testosterone analysis failed replicate previous findings lower digit ratio correlates increased androgen production authors analysis hypothesized androgens slight effect digit ratio variation ratio could arise number genetic nongenetic lee ellis responded criticisms commentary published journal aggression violent behavior first agrees digit ratio crude measure fetal testosterone levels still useful one offers alternate methods fetal testosterone measurement could used future studies regarding metaanalyses questioning relationship fetal testosterone levels criminality ellis argued metaanalyses included traits known sex differences therefore diluting actual effect size relationship traits related fetal testosterone
