repeated implantation failure rif repeated failure embryo implant onto side uterus wall following ivf implantation happens days conception involves embedding growing embryo mothers uterus connection successful implantation determined using ultrasound view sac baby grows inside however exact definition rif debated recently commonly accepted definition woman gone three unsuccessful cycles ivf cycle four good quality eggs repeated implantation failure confused recurrent ivf failure recurrent ivf failure much broad term includes repeated failures get pregnant ivf repeated implantation failure specifically refers failures due unsuccessful implanting uterus unsuccessful implantation result problems mother embryo essential mother embryo able communicate stages pregnancy absence communication

tissue within uterus cause closure part uterus adhesions prevent embryos implanting reducing surface area decreasing intrauterine adhesions normally occur damage caused endometrium either removal unwanted pregnancies miscarriage infection surgical thrombophilia condition makes blood likely clot increases cardiovascular risk meaning individual higher risk heart attacks strokes pregnancy lead disruption flow blood placenta uterus wall lead decreased receptivity uterus wall pregnancy lead miscarriage however significantly contributes rif fully known case assessed personal basis clinician successful implantation embryo relies receptive uterine environment mother also quality embryo embryo quality probability implantation affected maternal paternal genetic abnormalities well zona pellucida dysfunction poor embryo transfer quality sperm fertilizes egg key contributor overall quality embryo abnormalities dna fragmentation chromosomal arrangements main source genetic deviation males affect embryo dna fragmentation occurs strands dna separated form two separate strands disrupts genetic information coded genes depending severity fragmentation lead dysfunction specific genes may may essential embryo survival case initiation implantation dna fragmentation happen spontaneously cells undergo programmed cell death apoptosis dna broken apart enzymes called endonucleases however since male dna isnt activated around day fertilisation often difficult diagnose sperm genetic abnormalities morphological studies could identify good quality oocyte initial transfer occurs due dna fragmentation sperm embryo die day oocyte quality also main contributor overall embryo quality since dna oocyte mainly involved first days embryo growth following fertilization major source genetic abnormalities balanced translocations figure translocation involves exchange segments chromosomes homologous pair cases leads balanced translocations dna lost therefore usually asymptomatic however female gametes formed probable embryos produced unbalanced translocations within dna fertilised sperm balanced translocation translocation mutations occur point fertilization even first meiotic division oocyte undergoes foetal female egg oocyte surrounded layer glycoproteins called zona pellucida fertilisation occurred layer harden prevent sperm entering maintain shape fertilized egg zygote divides form blastocyst figure inner cell mass group cells within blastocyst go form embryo starts expand lysin enzymes secreted inner cell mass act zona pellucida weaken hardened structure eventually cause rupture zona pellucida allowing blastocyst hatch begin implant uterine zona pellucida fails thin preparation rupture prevent blastocyst hatching therefore unable implant therefore probable cause repeated implantation failure rif supported study showed implantation rates women received assisted zona pellucida hatching use synthetic chemical artificially weaken zona pellucida
