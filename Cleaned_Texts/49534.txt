ventricle falling pressure aorta aortic valve able completely close causes leaking blood aorta left ventricle means blood already ejected heart regurgitating back heart percentage blood regurgitates back aortic valve due ar known regurgitant fraction regurgitant flow causes decrease diastolic blood pressure aorta therefore increase pulse pressure since blood ejected systole regurgitates back left ventricle diastole decreased effective forward flow diastolic blood pressure diminished pulse pressure widens systolic blood pressure generally remains normal even slightly elevated sympathetic nervous system reninangiotensinaldosterone axis kidneys compensate decreased cardiac catecholamines increase heart rate increase strength ventricular contraction directly increasing cardiac output catecholamines also cause peripheral vasoconstriction causes increased systemic vascular resistance ensures organs adequately renin proteolytic enzyme cleaves angiotensinogen angiotensin converted angiotensin case chronic aortic resultant cardiac remodeling heart failure develop possible see systolic pressures aortic regurgitation causes volume overload elevated preload pressure overload
