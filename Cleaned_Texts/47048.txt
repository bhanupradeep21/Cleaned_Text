social epidemiology focuses patterns morbidity mortality rates emerge result social characteristics individuals lifestyle choices family history may place increased risk developing certain illnesses social inequalities health explained individual variations health outcomes united states attributed several social characteristics gender race socioeconomic status environment educational attainment inequalities social categories contribute health disparities groups placed increased risk acquiring chronic diseases others example cardiovascular disease leading cause death united followed closely cancer fifth deadly diabetes general risk factors associated diseases include obesity poor diet tobacco alcohol use physical inactivity access medical care health although may seem many risk factors arise solely individual health choices view neglects structural patterns choices individuals make consequently persons likelihood developing heart disease cancer diabetes part correlated social factors among racial groups individuals impoverished low income lower levels educational attainment andor live lowerincome neighborhoods likely develop chronic diseases heart united states europe century women tended die earlier age men largely due risks involved pregnancy childbirth however late century shift life expectancy women started live longer men notably partly explained biological factors instance crosscultural trend male fetal mortality rates higher female fetal mortality additionally estrogen decreases risk females acquiring heart disease lowering amount cholesterol blood testosterone suppresses immune system males puts risk acquiring serious illnesses however biological differences fully account large gender gap health outcomes men women social factors play large role gender disparities one main factors contributes decreased life expectancy males propensity engage risktaking behaviors commonly cited examples include heavy drinking illicit drug use violence drunk driving wearing helmets behaviors contribute injuries may lead premature death males particular effect risktaking behavior health especially visible case smoking smoking rates fallen united states overall less men engage behavior life expectancy gap men women slightly decreased behaviour men women also vary regards diet exercise leading differential health outcomes average men exercise women diet less nutritious consequently men likely overweight women greater risk exposure violence another social factor influence health general women higher likelihood experiencing sexual intimate partner violence men twice likely die suicide markedly impact gender health becomes especially salient different socioeconomic contexts united states large economic gender inequality many economically disadvantaged women occupying much fewer positions power men according panel study income dynamics among adults strongest attachment labor force women earned annually compared gendered economic inequality partly responsible genderhealth paradox general trend women live longer men experience greater degree nonlifethreatening chronic illnesses course low socioeconomic status women contributes feelings lack personal control events lives increased stress low perpetual states stress inflict damage bodies minds women placing risk physical ailments heart disease arthritis well mental health disorders another significant social factor men women deal illnesses different ways women generally strong support networks able rely others emotional support potential improve states health contrast men less likely strong support networks fewer doctor visits often cope illnesses also men women express pain different ways researchers observed women openly express feelings pain men reserved regard prefer appear tough even experience severe mental physical finding suggests due socialization processes women taught submissive emotional men taught strong powerful figures show emotions social stigma associated expressions pain prevents men admitting suffering others making difficult overcome moreover neighborhood effects greater influence women men instance research findings suggest women living impoverished neighborhoods likely experience obesity effect strong physical environment also generally impacts womans selfrated health effect explained fact women spend time home male counterparts result higher unemployment rates therefore may exposed negative environmental characteristics take toll finally gender effects also vary race ethnicity nativity status notably christy erving conducted study examined gender differences health profiles african americans caribbean blacks immigrants us born one findings research average african american women report lower selfrated measures health worse physical health likely experience severe chronic illnesses men finding contradicts genderhealth paradox sense researchers would expect morbidity rates higher women less illnesses acquire contrast opposite trend observed us born caribbean blacks men likely experience chronic lifethreatening illnesses health outcomes caribbean black immigrants somewhere inbetween health outcomes us born caribbean blacks african americans wherein females lower value selfreported health experience equal rates lifethreatening chronic disease data illustrates even within one racial category stark gender differences health basis social differences within groups compose race studies shown individuals racially ethnically stigmatized us globally well experience health issues mental physical illness cases even death higher rates average controversy around race determinant disease health issues since unmeasured forms background history potential factors research geographical origins types environments

transitioning environmental aspect race disease direct correlation race socioeconomic status contributes racial disparities health comes death rates heart disease rate twice high black men vs white men death rates heart disease lower black white women compared male counterparts patterns racial disparities education disparities women similar men death heart disease three times higher black women white women black men women racial differences deaths heart disease every level education evident racial gap larger higher levels education lowest number reasons race matters terms health socioeconomic status accounted one health affected adversity early ones life traumatic stress poverty abuse factors affect physical mental health individual know people living poverty united states minorities specifically african americans unfortunately surprise individuals many health continuously race relevant health issues nonequivalence socioeconomic status indicators across racial groups level education minorities black people nonwhite hispanic people receive less income anglowhite counterparts well less wealth purchasing namely one biggest reasons race matters terms health due racism personal institutionalized racism prominent todays society maybe blunt easy notice comparison past still exists certain residential segregation race redlining created distinct racial differences terms education employment opportunities opportunities access good healthcaremedical institutional cultural racism even harm minorities health stereotypes prejudices contributes socioeconomic mobility reduce limit resources opportunities required healthy socioeconomic status one part racial disparities health reflect larger social inequalities society racism system combines sometimes changes socioeconomic status influence health race still matters health socioeconomic status considered socioeconomic status multidimensional classification often defined using individuals income level needed related metrics round definition example study authors cox mckevitt rudd wolfe categories included occupation home goods ownership areabased deprivation determination status income inequality risen rapidly united states pushing greater amounts population positions lower socioeconomic needed study published examined americans died may august paired mortality information income education occupation data work found inverse correlation socioeconomic status mortality rate well increasing strength pattern reflection growth income inequality united findings although concerned total mortality cause reflect similar relationship socioeconomic status disease incidence death united states disease composes significant portion us mortality may leading causes death america noncommunicable diseases including heart disease cancer lower respiratory diseases cerebrovascular diseases indeed diseases seen disproportionately affect socioeconomically disadvantaged albeit different degrees differing mortality rates associated cardiovascular disease cvd including coronary heart disease chd stroke assessed individuals across areas differing income income authors found mortality rates three respective diseases greater factor areas higher inequality compared lower inequality areas similar across areas differing income constant income inequality rate death due cvd chd stroke increased factor lower income trends across two measures variation socioeconomic status reflect complexity depth relationship disease economic standing authors careful state patterns exist sufficiently described related cause effect correlating health status arisen us interrelated forces may intricately accumulate negate one another due specific historical lack cause effect simplicity indicates exactly diseaserelated health inequality arises murky multiple factors likely contribute important examination disease health context complicated classification like socioeconomic status degree measures tied mechanisms dependent upon individual regionally aforementioned study authors define individualized factors within three categories material eg income possessions environment behavioural eg diet smoking exercise psychosocial eg perceived inequality provide two categories external regionally varying factors environmental influences provision access services psychosocial influences social interactive compounding nature forces shape shaped socioeconomic status presenting challenge researchers tease apart intersecting factors health status study authors examined specific drivers correlation stroke occurrence socioeconomic status identifying nuanced interlocking factors cited risk behaviors early life influences access care tied socioeconomic status thus health inequality disease intricately tangled stratification social class economic status united states correlations often health socioeconomic attainment demonstrated numerous studies numerous causes correlations interlocking often related factors varying regions individuals design future studies concerning inequality disease require careful thought multifaceted driving mechanisms social inequality neighbourhood areas people live well occupation make environment exist people living poverty stricken neighborhoods greater risk heart disease possibly supermarkets area sell healthy foods increased availability stores selling alcohol tobacco affluent parts needed people living rural areas also susceptible heart disease well agriculturally based diet rich fat cholesterol combined

dollars respectively means average bachelors degree earner receive approximately working life individual high school source furthermore authors montez hummer hayward explained unemployment percent among adults graduate high school compared percent among adults high school diploma percent among college relationship socioeconomic status prevalence disease already well established education indirectly responsible increased prevalence disease among impoverished directly educational attainment great predictor likely individual engage risky possibly disease causing behaviors terms smoking directly correlates increased risk diseases like lung cancer education important determining factor likelihood individual smoke percent adults graduate high school smokers compared percent high school graduates percent college high school graduates also smoked packs average year smokers graduated furthermore individuals high school degree less less likely abstain smoking least months time regular studies found binge drinking higher among college degrees implying binge drinking habitat developed many college unhealthy dietary habits also directly lead diseases heart disease hypertension diabetes one leading causes unhealthy eating habits lack access grocery stores creating called food deserts studies found immediate access grocery store within mile radius times less likely areas less population college negative effects food deserts exacerbated fact impoverished neighborhoods also oversupply liquor store fast food restaurants convenience one significant risk sexually active individuals sexually transmitted diseases infections studies found correlation education carrying relatively low average even less certain subsets black women strong correlation education risky sexual high school degree less significantly likely engage risky practices early sexual initiation sexual activity use shooting street drugs heroin even prostitution addition less education also less likely practice safe sex practices condom studies also found adults higher educational achievement likely lead healthier lives intake key nutrients vitamins c potassium calcium positively correlated education critical statistic nutrients vitamin c critical helping body fight diseases also correlation education exercise habits study found college graduates stated exercised last month high school graduates nonhigh school graduates said exercise crucial preventing diseases like hypertension type diabetes stark distinction exercise habitats significant effects high school less graduates diabetes compared college arguably best way seeing true effects education inequality disease examine mortality levels heart disease cancer lower respiratory diseases top three killers respectively americans every age individual least high school degree die average years earlier otherwise similar college different national study found individuals bachelors degrees likely die next years individuals age professional degrees masters even stark americans without high school degree almost twice likely die professional degree studys year followup httpsenwikipediaorgwikiinequalityindisease
