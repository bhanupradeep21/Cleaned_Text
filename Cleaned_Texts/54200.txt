ability discriminate produce facial expressions develop independently gap childs capacity discriminate emotion anothers face capacity produce certain emotions anger fear anger difficult expressions produce happiness possible explanation children socialized produce considered socially undesirable research required fully explore idea facial expressions produced express reaction situation event evoke response another individual individuals signals emotion social intent people make faces response direct audience watching sports discussing politics eating smelling pain see hear something humorous one may emotional reaction particular situation likely express emotion via facial expression social situation smiles particular evolved signaling displays result selective pressures conspicuous stereotyped redundant smiling visual signal requires eye contact recipient one intended communicate feeling happiness joy experiment alan fridlund smiling occurred least one watching video alone often person alone watching video believed friend performing another task even often person believed friend simultaneously watching video somewhere else often one watching movie friend physically present evidence shows even someone internal reaction stimulus like movie likely externalize feelings surrounded peers assumption peers engaged production facial expressions however solely limited interpersonal situations since humans largely social beings often imagine social situations even alone phenomenon occurs variety different contexts treating oneself social interactant talking oneself imagining others present either currently existent died envisioning future social interactions personifying animals inanimate objects talking solitary facial expressions generated imagined according role impression management theories perceived audience whether real imaginary causes one assume role consistent audience example young girl may smile mirror imagining talking boy class may grimace imagining responding mothers scolding thus solitary faces occur reasons public ones alone create social interactions imaginations suggest possibility sociality may play major role mediation solitary developmental differences solitary facial expression beginning instinctive expressions infancy developing complex ones childs concept sociality emotion matures concept sociality acquired time various social interactions long theorized children expand ability regulate facial expressions course development expressions become socialized grow soon socialization start big role play infancy infants use words tell us emotional states facial expressions particular importance infancy difficult elicit discrete negative expressions like anger distress perhaps unsurprisingly common infant facial expression cryface cryface thought integrate aspects anger distress expressions may indicate shared basis negative smiling hand easily recognized expression happiness even distinction cheekraising duchenne smiles nonemotional smiles thought used mainly social even infants duchenne smiles found occur often reaction infants according ekman friesen display rules influenced ones culture gender family background govern way modulate emotional expression studies investigating motherinfant interaction suggest infants exposed display rules first facetoface play mom study performed malatesta haviland researchers found evidence changes emotional expression infancy greatly influenced type interaction differences among infants months age based gender family background suggests infancy display rules already taking effect following infancy discrimination production facial expressions improves toddlers grow early childhood young ages children know common facial expressions look like expressions happiness sadness mean kinds situations typically elicit children develop skills early stages life continue improve facial recognition discrimination imitation ages one study showed toddlers spontaneous facial expressions reflect emotions shown toddlers called indicates facial expressions affected social environment important aspect creating relationships others social groups one study researchers found facial expressions sadness may beneficial toddlers expressions eliciting support social environment ability regulate expressions sadness order provoke comforting behavior caregivers develop young age months suggests emphasis presence others elicit certain facial expressions stages early childhood differential emotions theory suggests different distress emotions distinct adaptive social functions reactions social environment example distress call anger toddler likely elicit reaction discipline caregiver expression fear would elicit reaction comfort social situations induce facial expressions toddlers children early childhood although enough evidence indicate understand expressions emotions example young child could express sadness mother room order elicit nurturing reaction though stage adolescence childs discrimination facial expressions develops different rate production facial therefore young children readily able discriminate expressions sadness anger production negative expressions much many studies show toddlers children early childhood showing facial expression social context however enough research solitary facial expressions remains general gap literature regarding production facial expressions processes underlie production middle childhood adolescence ages research done assess overall production capabilities children ranging ages results generally indicate ability produce facial emotion increases age slightly correlated ability discriminate facial expressions odom lemond created study test potential developmental lag perception production facial expressions meaning looking uncover relationship previously created schemas mental representations different expressions ability transform representations facial expression operated using logical assumption coding perceptions expressions comes discrimination expressions precedes production upon assessing two differing age groups one kindergarten fifth grade discovered lag perception production facial expressions however lag decrease age production discrimination develop rate odom lemond arrived far conclusion production facial expressions never level discrimination facial expressions supports findings another study izard found even adults difficulty producing requested expressions despite increased accurate productions older kids found due discrimination abilities yet older children still made many errors leading researchers believe full discrimination abilities full potential middle childhood adolescence stage development ekman roper hager researched different means producing facial expressions could influenced age found studies completed charlesworth kreutzer ekman oster classified two methods facial expression categorized deliberate action imitation observed expression making face relates memory generating emotion complex process individual focuses experience attempts relive experience order create emotional expression suggested age impact ability utilize processes considering developmental requirements might met order use one aforementioned skills study completed ekman roper hager consisted three groups children first group mean age years second years third years results include significantly larger increase ability produce facial movements ages rather ages additionally ekman roper hager odom lemond found expressions fear sadness anger difficult produce odom lemond give potential explanation using suggestion made izard expression production may inhibited socialization training significance expressions anger sadness socially undesirable therefore socializing agents may discourage expressions leading smaller chance older children produce expressions spontaneously
