doswellia extinct genus archosauriform late triassic north america notable member family doswelliidae related proterochampsids doswellia low heavily built carnivore lived carnian stage late possesses many unusual features including wide flattened head narrow jaws boxlike rib cage surrounded many rows bony plates type species doswellia kaltenbachi named fossils found within vinita member doswell formation formerly known falling creek formation virginia formation found taylorsville basin part larger newark supergroup doswellia named doswell town much taxons remains found second species sixmilensis described bluewater creek formation chinle group new however species subsequently transferred separate doswelliid genus bonafide doswellia kaltenbachi fossils also known chinle formation complete specimens doswellia discovered construction sewage treatment plant doswell virginia party led james kaltenbach namesake doswellia kaltenbachi unearthed large block containing partial skeleton including numerous vertebrae ribs osteoderms bony plates bones block usnm designated holotype kaltenbachi two additional slabs later unearthed site almost certainly pertained individual one slabs contained additional vertebrae ribs contained partial skull mandible additional slabs collectively termed paratype usnm isolated right jugal found site usnm also referred several additional bones including vertebrae osteoderms dentary femur unearthed near ashland little south doswell specimens initially believed belonged phytosaurs recognized pertaining doswellia doswell specimens found ashland specimens cataloged usnm usnm assorted osteoderms vertebrae otis chalk colorado city formation texas well monitor butte formation utah also assigned fossils referable doswellia cf kaltenbachi known petrified forest national park arizona found blue mesa member chinle formation making arizona remains among youngest new species archosauriform described referred doswellia second species doswellia sixmilensis holotype species nmmnh incomplete skeleton including skull fragments osteoderms vertebrae possible limb fragments found strata bluewater creek formation exposed sixmile canyon mckinley county new redescription doswellia sixmilensis determined supposed snout fragments represented entire skull related doswelliid major anatomical differences discovered species given genus rugarhynchos doswellia possesses many highly derived features skeleton skull low elongated narrow snout wide temporal region behind eye sockets temporal region unusual euryapsid means lower two temporal holes either side skull closed jugal bone expanded region lower temporal opening would normally occupy paired squamosal bones extend beyond skulls back margin form small hornlike projections skull doswellia lacks several bones found archosauriforms including postfrontals tabulars body doswellia also distinctive neck elongated partially covered fused collection bony scutes called nuchal plate ribs front part torso project horizontally spine bend nearly angles give body doswellia boxlike shape bladelike ilium bone hip also projects horizontally rows osteoderms stretched nuchal plate tail least ten rows covered widest part doswellias quadratojugal surangular bones cranium lower jaw respectively incorporated jaw joint reinforcing joint preventing sidetoside frontto back movement result jaws doswellia would incapable notable form movement vertical scissorlike snapping addition expanded back skull deep rear part lower jaw likely housed muscles could let jaw open close high amount force contrasts modern crocodilians powerful bite much weaker ability open jaws nevertheless high amount sculpturing skull doswellia similar skulls modern crocodilians likely adaptation minimize stresses skull powerful pointed teeth long snout upwardpointing eyes doswellia support idea aquatic carnivore addition relatively compact osteoderms also evidence aquatic however may necessarily strictly aquatic features also found animals parasuchus phytosaur known preyed terrestrial reptiles malerisaurus possible food sources include crustaceans bivalves speculatively large flying hopping insects also conceivable capable limited burrowing either shelter alligators defense partially burying keep armor exposed yet protect soft underside technique used modern armadillos echidnas cordylus lizards front limbs unknown doswellia direct evidence burrowing neck doswellia long flexible although also heavily armored likely incapable bending horizontal instead probably used downwards lateral sidetoside movement body also probably incapable moving much extent due extensive overlapping armor plating characterizes genus chest would much likely flexed laterally like living reptiles amphibians animal walking first tail vertebrae similar body vertebrae front tail would probably held level body rest tail would capable bending downward lacked many adaptations lateral movement means doswellia aquatic predator probably would used tail swimming modern crocodilians although limb material well known doswellia material preserved suggests front rear legs strongly built although bizarre downward pointing hip could given doswellia upright posture dinosaurs including armored ankylosaurs various primitive features suggest likely sprawling semisprawling osteoderm doswellia holotype given histological analysis study growth patterns analysis concluded osteoderm formed intramembraneous ossification due lack structural fibers within means bone osteoderm formed soft layer periosteal tissue rather fibrous tendons cartilage growth marks within bone indicate holotype specimen doswellia died years age perhaps unique aspect doswellias osteoderm development lies fact ridges formed bone instead pits prehistoric armored animals pitted ostoderms pitting pattern formed due specific spots bone reabsorbed creating pits even holds true doswelliids jaxtasuchus however studied osteoderm doswellia shows evidence reabsorption specific areas instead showing increased amounts bone growth web ridges surround pits although certain rauisuchians noncrocodylomorph paracrocodylomorph archosaurs also osteoderms form bone growth specific areas osteoderms relatively smooth rather pitted vancleavea supposed relative doswellia also osteoderms analyzed differed genus multiple type species doswellia kaltenbachi described weems weems placed doswellia within thecodontia group archosaurs traditionally included many triassic archosaurs placed genus within family doswelliidae suborder dosweliina parrish placed doswellia among primitive crurotarsans group includes crocodilians extinct relatives recently dilkes sues proposed close relationship doswellia early archosauriform family proterochampsidae desojo et al added south american archosauriforms tarjadia archeopelta doswelliidae found support dilkes sues classification phylogenetic although tarjadia archeopelta considered erpetosuchids distantly related doswellia family doswelliidae still considered valid due taxa jaxtasuchus germany ankylosuchus texas considered close relatives doswellia
