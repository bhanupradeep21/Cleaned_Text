hemiparesis unilateral paresis weakness one entire side body hemi means half hemiplegia severe form complete paralysis half body hemiparesis hemiplegia caused different medical conditions including congenital causes trauma tumors depending type hemiparesis diagnosed different bodily functions affected effects expected eg partial paralysis limb affected side impairments though first seem completely nonrelated limb weakness fact direct result damage affected side people hemiparesis often difficulties maintaining balance due limb paralysis leading inability properly shift body weight makes performing everyday activities dressing eating grabbing objects using bathroom difficult hemiparesis origin lower section brain creates condition known ataxia loss gross fine motor skills often manifesting staggering stumbling pure motor hemiparesis form hemiparesis characterized sided weakness leg arm face commonly diagnosed form pusher syndrome clinical disorder following left right brain damage patients actively push weight away nonhemiparetic side hemiparetic side contrast stroke patients typically prefer weightbearing nonhemiparetic side abnormal condition vary severity leads loss postural lesion involved syndrome thought posterior thalamus either side multiple areas right cerebral diagnosis pusher behaviour three important variables seen obvious spontaneous body posture longitudinal tilt torso toward paretic side body occurring regular basis occasion use nonparetic extremities create pathological lateral tilt body axis another sign noted diagnosing pusher behaviour includes abduction extension extremities nonaffected side help push toward affected paretic side third variable seen attempts therapist correct pusher posture aiming realign upright posture resisted patients acute stroke hemiparesis disorder present rehabilitation may take longer patients display pusher behaviour copenhagen stroke study found patients presented ipsilateral pushing used weeks reach functional outcome level barthel index patients without ipsilateral pushing behavior shown perception body posture relation gravity altered patients experience body oriented upright body actually tilted side brain lesion addition patients seem show disturbed processing visual vestibular inputs determining subjective visual vertical sitting push presents strong lateral lean toward affected side standing creates highly unstable situation patient unable support body weight weakened lower extremity increased risk falls must addressed therapy correct altered perception pusher syndrome sometimes confused used interchangeably term hemispatial neglect previous theories suggest neglect leads pusher however another study observed pusher syndrome also present patients left hemisphere lesions leading aphasia providing stark contrast previously believed regarding hemispatial neglect mostly occurs right hemisphere although neglect aphasia highly correlated pusher syndrome possibly due close proximity relevant brain structures associated two respective syndromes underlying causes pusher physical therapists focus motor learning strategies treating patients verbal cues consistent feedback practicing correct orientation weight shifting effective strategies used reduce effects patient sit stronger side next wall instructing lean towards wall example possible treatment pusher new physical therapy approach patients pusher syndrome suggests visual control vertical upright orientation undisturbed patients central element intervention treatment sequential order treatment designed patients realize altered perception vertical use visual aids feedback body orientation learn movements necessary reach proper vertical position maintain vertical body position performing individuals present pusher syndrome lateropulsion defined davies vary degree severity condition therefore appropriate measures need implemented order evaluate level pushing shift towards early diagnosis evaluation functional status individuals stroke presenting pusher syndrome order decrease time spent inpatient hospitals promote return function early moreover order assist therapists classification pusher syndrome specific scales developed validity coincides criteria set davies definition pusher study babyar et al examination scales helped determine relevance practical aspects clinimetric properties three specific scales existing today three scales examined clinical scale contraversive pushing modified scale contraversive pushing burke lateropulsion results study show reliability scale good moreover scale contraversive pushing determined acceptable clinimetric properties two scales addressed functional positions help therapists clinical decisions common cause

recovering strokes brain health care professionals physical therapists occupational therapists play large role assisting patients recovery treatment focused improving sensation motor abilities allowing patient better manage activities daily living strategies used treatment include promoting use hemiparetic limb functional tasks maintaining range motion using neuromuscular electrical stimulation decrease spasticity increase awareness advanced level using constraintinduced movement therapy encourage overall function use affected mirror therapy mt also used early stroke
