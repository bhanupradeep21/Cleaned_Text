ennatosaurus extinct genus caseid synapsid lived middle permian late roadian early wordian northern european genus represented type species ennatosaurus tecton named ivan antonovich species known least six skulls associated lower jaws two preserved hyoid apparatus well postcranial bones several juvenile ennatosaurus typical caseid skull short snout tilted forward large external nares however differs derived caseids postcranial skeleton smaller proportions compared size advanced caseids teeth ennatosaurus well suited slicing cutting presence highly developed hyoid apparatus indicates presence massive mobile tongue work collaboration palatal teeth late roadian early wordian age ennatosaurus one last known lalieudorhynchus southern france ennatosaurus tecton means ninth carpenter lizard strangeness name synapsid related unusual origin since genus species names correspond translation greek meaning russian names discoverers first fossils animal genus name dedicated tatyana devyataya feminine form devyatyi whose name means ninth ennatos greek saurus meaning lizard species honors mikhail alekseevich plotnikov russian plotnik meaning carpenter tecton ennatosaurus known several adult skulls pin holotype well juvenile skull pin associated many postcranial elements several elements allowed reconstruction composite skeleton unlike derived caseids tiny skull relative body size ennatosaurus peculiar small size postcranial skeleton compared skull however almost postcranial material ennatosaurus belongs juvenile individuals unusual proportions composite skeleton could explained mounting adult skull juvenile skeleton however existence bones subadult adult individuals suggests ennatosaurus indeed proportionally smaller body derived largest adult skull ennatosaurus holotype pin approximately cm long size similar skull cotylorhynchus romeri adult bones ennatosaurus half size corresponding adult elements c caseids ennatosaurus short skull snout sharply sloping forward large external nares ennatosaurus distinguished however proportionally longer facial region casea euromycter dorsal ramus premaxilla contributes narrow intranarial bar narrower euromycter width similar cotylorhynchus romeri skull roof distinguished large contribution frontal dorsal margin orbit occupies length latter euromycter c romeri frontal represents less margin orbit jugal characteristic thick elongated anterior ramus creating area extended contact lacrimal caseids anterior ramus thin ends narrow vertical contact lacrimal ennatosaurus also differs caseid temporal fenestrae significantly larger nostrils orbits palate narrower parasphenoid upper dentition reduced number ennatosaurus premaxilla maxilla two eight teeth respectively teeth respectively euromycter
