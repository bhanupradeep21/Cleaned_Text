alveolar capillary dysplasia acd rare congenital diffuse lung disease characterized abnormal blood vessels lungs cause highly elevated pulmonary blood pressure inability effectively oxygenate remove carbon dioxide blood acd typically presents newborn babies within hours birth rapid labored breathing bluecolored lips skin quickly leading respiratory failure death atypical forms acd reported initially milder symptoms survival many months onset respiratory failure lung transplantation cases acd caused mutations affecting gene nearby enhancer exactly mutations lead abnormal lung development unknown abnormal lung development characterized thickened alveolar interstitium misplacement pulmonary capillaries away alveolar surface fewer capillaries overall results poor gas exchange pulmonary evidence connections pulmonary arteries systemic vessels would additionally contribute poor blood acd typically diagnosed examination lung tissue microscope either lung biopsy autopsy characteristic findings misplaced pulmonary veins adjacent pulmonary arteries abnormal alveolar capillary development confirm genetic testing also available confirm diagnosis without invasive effective treatments severe acd standard therapy includes mechanical ventilation pulmonary vasodilators possibly ecmo provide temporary improvement symptoms disease progression returning within hours babies atypical acd response medical therapy sustained lasting several months stabilized definitive treatment bilateral lung acd rare disease cases first case reported acd congenital disease whose symptoms appear within hours days birth babies acd usually symptoms time birth soon begin breathe rapidly showing increased work breathing may blue discoloration around lips arms legs especially feeding crying echocardiogram performed marked thickening right ventricle seen resulting highly elevated pulmonary blood pressure acd generally resistant treatment babies persistent symptoms poorly relieved standard therapies neonatal pulmonary hypertension commonly observed atypical forms acd reported mildly rapid breathing shortly birth may present symptoms acd several months age symptoms may improve standard pulmonary hypertension therapies weeks months symptoms babies born acd usually congenital abnormalities affecting heart intestines urinary system cases acd caused deletions point mutations involving gene chromosome area near gene regulates expression acd autosomal dominant disorder meaning one diseasecausing mutation affecting regulator region needed cause acd evidence strongly suggests regulatory region imprinted might affect disease severity may permit carry disease mutations affecting regulatory region cause acd unknown acdcausing mutations result abnormal development lung vasculature alveoli acd interstitium alveoli thickened capillaries located alveolar surface perform gas exchange lower capillary density overall reduction capillaries misplacement away alveolar surface result poor oxygenation retention carbon dioxide blood high pulmonary blood also evidence direct connections pulmonary arteries systemic vessels would deliver deoxygenated blood body also contributing low blood another characteristic histologic finding presence pulmonary vein located next pulmonary artery bronchus bronchovascular bundle normal lung pulmonary vein courses lymphatic vessels lung septacitation needed gold standard acd diagnosis examination lung tissue microscope diagnosis made pathologist sees characteristic findings acd misplaced pulmonary veins adjacent pulmonary arteries abnormal alveoli thickened interstitia abnormal capillary development due rapidly progressive course acd diagnosis frequently made autopsy acd suspected early examination tissue lung biopsy results quickest genetic testing available allow slower noninvasive diagnosis diseasecausing mutations known false negatives results uncertain significance possible genetic characteristic pattern routine lab results imaging findings allow definitive diagnosis initial treatments attempt improve low blood oxygenation high pulmonary blood pressures blood oxygen content usually low babies acd often intubated sedated mechanically ventilated pure oxygen pulmonary vasodilators like sildenafil inhaled nitric oxide used reduce pulmonary blood severe acd measures offer momentary improvement symptoms worsen ecmo used also offers brief improvement effective treatments severe infants atypical acd initially milder symptoms present months life better response therapy reports infants acd surviving months without lung transplantation bilateral lung transplantation may definitive treatmentcitation needed acd rare disease cases reported likely underrecognized cause death shortly birth
