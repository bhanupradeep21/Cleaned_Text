tremor somewhat rhythmic muscle contraction relaxation involving oscillations twitching movements one body parts common involuntary movements affect hands arms eyes face head vocal folds trunk legs tremors occur hands people tremor symptom another neurological disorder tremor commonly classified clinical features cause origin betterknown forms tremor symptoms include following tremor result conditions well tremor symptom associated disorders parts brain control muscles throughout body particular areas hands neurological disorders conditions produce tremor include multiple sclerosis stroke traumatic brain injury chronic kidney disease number neurodegenerative diseases damage destroy parts brainstem cerebellum parkinsons disease one often associated tremor lesions guillainmollaret triangle also called myoclonic triangle dentatorubroolivary pathway impair predictions performed cerebellum causing repetitive muscle discharges triggering oscillatory activity central nervous causes include use drugs amphetamines cocaine caffeine corticosteroids ssris alcohol mercury poisoning withdrawal drugs alcohol benzodiazepine tremors also seen infants phenylketonuria pku overactive thyroid liver failure tremors indication hypoglycemia along palpitations sweating anxiety tremor also caused lack sleep lack vitamins increased deficiencies magnesium also known cause tremor shaking resolves deficiency tremors animals also caused spider bites eg redback spider physical exam doctor determine whether tremor occurs primarily action rest doctor also check tremor symmetry sensory loss weakness muscle atrophy decreased reflexes detailed family history may indicate tremor inherited blood urine tests detect thyroid malfunction metabolic causes abnormal levels certain chemicals cause tremor tests may also help identify contributing causes drug interaction chronic alcoholism another condition disease diagnostic imaging using ct mri imaging may help determine tremor result structural defect degeneration doctor perform neurological examination assess nerve function motor sensory skills tests designed determine functional limitations difficulty handwriting ability hold utensil cup patient may asked place finger tip nose draw spiral perform tasks exercisescitation needed doctor may order electromyogram diagnose muscle nerve problems test measures involuntary muscle activity muscle response nerve stimulation selection sensors used important addition studies muscle activity tremor assessed accuracy using accelerometers degree tremor assessed four positions tremor classified position accentuates cure tremors appropriate treatment depends accurate diagnosis cause tremors respond treatment underlying condition example cases psychogenic tremor treating patients underlying psychological problem may cause tremor disappear medications help relieve symptoms temporarilycitation needed medications remain basis therapy many cases symptomatic drug therapy available several forms tremorcitation eliminating tremor triggers caffeine stimulants diet often recommended essential tremor may benefit slight doses ethanol potential negative consequences regular ethanol intake need taken account beta blockers used alternative alcohol sports competitive dart playing carry less potential addictioncitation needed physical therapy occupational therapy may help reduce tremor improve coordination muscle control patients physical therapist occupational therapist evaluate patient tremor positioning muscle control muscle strength functional skills teaching patient brace affected limb tremor hold affected arm close body sometimes useful gaining motion control coordination balancing exercises may help patients occupational therapists recommend use weights splints adaptive equipment special plates utensils eatingcitation needed surgical intervention thalamotomy deep brain stimulation may ease certain tremors surgeries usually performed tremor severe respond drugs response excellentcitation needed thalamotomy involving creation lesions brain region called thalamus quite effective treating patients essential cerebellar parkinsonian tremor inhospital procedure performed local anesthesia patient awake patients head secured metal frame surgeon maps patients brain locate thalamus small hole drilled skull temperaturecontrolled electrode inserted thalamus lowfrequency current passed electrode activate tremor confirm proper placement site confirmed electrode heated create temporary lesion testing done examine speech language coordination tremor activation problems occur probe heated create permanent lesion probe cooled body temperature withdrawn skull hole covered lesion causes tremor permanently disappear without disrupting sensory motor control deep brain stimulation dbs uses implantable electrodes send highfrequency electrical signals thalamus electrodes implanted described patient uses handheld magnet turn turn pulse generator surgically implanted skin electrical stimulation temporarily disables tremor reversed necessary turning implanted electrode batteries generator last years replaced surgically dbs currently used treat parkinsonian tremor essential tremor also applied successfully rare causes tremor common side effects tremor surgery include dysarthria problems motor control speech temporary permanent cognitive impairment including visual learning difficulties problems balance well medication rehabilitation programmes surgical interventions application biomechanical loading tremor movement shown technique
