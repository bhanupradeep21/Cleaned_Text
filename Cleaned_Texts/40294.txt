humans commitment jobs society ones employment schedule often dictates sleep schedule bidirectional relationship stress sleep also scientifically supported terms employment employee get quality sleep often leads poor performance work greater chance experiencing stress related work similarly person experiencing occupational stress sleep almost immediately negatively individuals experience high levels stress insufficient amounts sleep mental physical health jeopardized many factors contribute development occupational stress ones life factors include job scheduling time commitment lack support conflicts within workplace depending field people employed demands job vary greatly occupations demand least hours week employee commitment combined personal responsibilities often leaves individuals little time elevates stress levels individuals irregular work schedules working different times week week regular daytoday schedule interrupted adds stress daily life also influences individuals circadian rhythm circadian rhythm especially interrupted individuals work night faced challenge body stressed must also adapt new environmental factors instance would require body alert late night hours opposed entering relaxed state average circadian rhythm would support another main contributor development occupational stress employees feeling lack support recognition superiors employees supported superiors employees likely experience stress related work responsibilities often employees dedicate extra time perfect work achieve desired validation seek superiors employees recognized supported superiors feelings uncertainty begin grow overwhelm individual additionally responsibilities expectations employee clearly understood often leaves employee questioning place work environment finally conflicts within workplace named major stressor comes employment conflicts arise workplace unsafe environment raises employees stress level often produces extreme emotional response furthermore anxietyinducing conflicts lead employees dread coming work day matters distract individuals influence overall productivity important note conflicts often revolve around difference power parties involved instances sexual harassment within work environment prevalent cause unnecessary amounts stress combining high levels stress lack sleep affects daytoday life humans example work performance often suffers conditions individuals suffering stress sleep deprivation also tend higher levels absenteeism take greater number sick days compared peers adequate amounts sleep obtained individuals greater risk developing heart disease diabetes hypertension muscle pain headaches series mental health problems strong association lack sleep increased irritability depression anxiety disorders working memory individuals experiencing sleep deprivation also affected various methods practices individuals engage lower levels stress optimize sleep employers address possible stressors within work environment employers need monitor workloads schedules employees minimize burnout importantly prioritize health workers providing training clearly stating expectations employee help employees better understand role workplace building positive work environment employees feel supported superiors experience less stress daily life essential first step employees acknowledge stressor life individual basis employees experiencing high levels stress restlessness engage cognitivebehavioral interventions manage stress practicing simple selfcare routines setting aside time things one enjoys aid minimizing levels stress employees experience stress sleep greatly impact effect permeates many aspects daily life one specific concern harmful effects cognitive performance attention span addition sleep deprivation cause change perceptions well sleepdeprived hours leads dramatic decrease cognitive performance tests similar college exams causes individuals false perceptions performance hence sleepdeprived individuals cognitively performing worse aware addition cognitive performance sleep deprivation cause decreased attention span specific tasks hand implications making mistakes efficient become cycle high stress poor sleep lack attention three things intermixed excessive stress sleep deprivation cause physical health impacts may affect person shortterm longterm impacts range severity important aware increased risk health issues may arise due stresssleep cycle many physical impacts stress overlap physical impacts sleep deprivation including shortterm impacts like fatigue headaches longterm impacts like high blood pressure heart disease diabetes fatigue clear side effect sleep deprivation however combined excessive stress feeling fatigue become overwhelming ones body work harder pressure causes person feel fatigued headaches another shortterm impact occurs often feeling excessive levels stress since stress often triggers fight flight response create tension lack sleep excessive stress combine impacts fatigue headaches greatly increase although impacts shortterm last days weeks even months stress continues overwhelm person cause struggle fall stay asleep longterm effects result years persistent feelings excessive levels stress consequently getting consistent lack sleep excessive stress sleep deprivation cause cardiovascular issues high blood pressure heart disease study focusing impacts chronic stress heart found times chronic stress body hyperactivates sympathetic nervous system leads changes heart rate due changes heart rate variability harm capabilities strength heart risk heart disease greatly increases due elevated blood sugar blood pressure levels prolongation stress body cause plaque buildup artery walls impedes blood flow results much higher likelihood major cardiovascular events including heart attack sleep also adds cardiovascular impacts blood pressure normally decreases sleep result someone consistent lack sleep higher blood pressure levels longer periods time study conducted find correlation sleep deprivation cardiovascular issues found one hour less sleep night increased risk calcium buildup arteries calcium buildup arteries major cause plaque buildup also mentioned highly affected increased stress levels combined excessive stress sleep deprivation cause much larger increase plaque buildup lead increased risk heart disease stroke high blood pressure someone constantly feeling stressed throughout day struggles fall stay asleep due stress anxiety creates continued cycle strain heart another longterm effect creates combined risk effect excessive stress sleep deprivation obesity shortterm stress may cause people lose appetite chronic stress causes release cortisol increases persons appetite many effects stress cause people overeat including lack selfregulation stressful times want comfort food often high sugar fat calories cortisols promotion eating fat deposition cause stressful times many physiological behavioral impacts ones furthermore sleep deprivation shown decrease glucose tolerance insulin sensitivity increase hunger appetite impact ones diet foods prefer hormonal changes often cause increase caloric intake decrease energy many physical activities combine increase likelihood many impacts increasing stress levels sleep deprivation show many factors cause overall weight gain may lead obesity important note many effects impactful longterm chronic stress sleep deprivation however since sleep deprivation stress often coincide leads much greater chance developing harmful physical health impacts since sleep deprivation stress similar impacts ones body overall likelihood serious health issues increases httpsenwikipediaorgwikipsychologicalstressandsleep
