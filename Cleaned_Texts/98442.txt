medicine also called burner nerve pinch injury neurological injury suffered athletes mostly highcontact sports ice hockey rugby american football wrestling spine injury characterized shooting stinging pain travels one arm followed numbness weakness parts arms including biceps deltoid spinati muscles many athletes contact sports suffered stingers often unreported medical professionals anyone experiences significant trauma head neck needs immediate medical evaluation possibility spinal injury fact safest assume trauma victims spinal injury proven otherwise three main mechanisms stinger include receiving direct blows extension compression brachial plexus brachial plexus injuries extensioncompression mechanism stinger injury caused restriction nerve supply upper extremity via brachial plexus brachial plexus formed anterior rami nerves cervical level spinal cord way nerves thoracic level spinal cord brachial plexus innervates upper extremity well muscles neck damage brachial plexus occur nerves stretched far head neck specifically upper trunk plexus roots cervical level primarily affected upper trunk provides part nerve supply upper extremity via musculocutaneous axillary radial median reason stingers affect arms simultaneously however possible arms accrue injuries repeated nerve trauma cause recurring stingers chronic pain muscle weakness recovery take weeks months severe since stingers nerve injury stinger fall two different categories peripheral nerve injury physiological differences grade neurapraxia involves focal damage myelin fibers around axon axon connective tissue sheath remaining intact disruption nerve function involves demyelination axonal integrity preserved remyelination occurs within days grade ii categorized axonotmesis severe case nerve injury context stingers involves injury grade iii classified neurotmesis complete disruption axon unlikely recovery happen considered stinger usually highenergy injury stingers best diagnosed medical professional person assess athletes pain range head neck motion arm numbness muscle strength often affected athlete allowed return play within short time persistent symptoms result removal athletes also advised receive regular evaluations symptoms ceased specifically restoration painfree two weeks increase additional tests magnetic resonance imaging mri performed detect serious injury herniated disc order treatments applied depends whether athletes main complaint pain weakness treated analgesic antiinflammatory medication ice heat restriction movement necessary cervical collar traction surgery necessary severe cases returning injury depends number burners occurs stinger occurs athletes usually return play restore full strength asymptomatic pain persists painless range motion cervical spine low frequencies stingers like much lower risk symptoms reoccurring three stingers occur one season one higher increased risk symptoms one returning play contact sports important adopt strict exercise regimen neck muscles player ability handle trauma associated stingers prevented several following factors first crucial identify severity stinger treatment usually depends factor strengthening treatment starts early severe case prevent one healing dysfunctions caused peripheral nerve injury must identified treat prevent future flexibility strength neck shoulder upper extremity essential stiffness weakness predisposing factors burner well consequences injury factors could help prevention stingers could include strengthening muscles increasing range motion improving technique simple measures taken help recovery stingers chestout posture adapted prevent neck extending far brings head shoulders chestout posture emphasized due commonly adopted athletes due developed shoulders perpetuated brachial plexus irritation chestout posture also reduces pressure brachial plexus opening thoracic finally stingers prevented wearing protective gear butterfly restrictors designed protect head neck forced unnatural positions equipment feasible positions unrestricted head neck movement required american football lineman positions like quarterback movement integral regardless equipment important report even minor symptoms athletic trainer team physician allow appropriate recovery timecitation needed stingers commonly occur contact sports like wrestling hockey basketball boxing rugby weightlifting notably football one study found college football players suffered least one stinger however difficult ping exact number athletes suffer stingers stingers historically underreported could due players fear removed play injury viewed following study found different frequencies number stingers occur incidence stingers sixyear study period stingers per team season stingers reported either competitions preseason exactly stingers due player contact specifically occurring tackling occurring major american football leagues banned technique spearing sport due risk injury player makes headdown contact player much chance significant spinal cord injury initial rule change many cervical spine injuries therefore prompted new tackling technique adopted headup tackling technique technique prevent catastrophic spine injuries result brachial plexus injuries rule change estimated stingers gone
