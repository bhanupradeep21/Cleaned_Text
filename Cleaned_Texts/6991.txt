motivation internal state propels individuals engage goaldirected behavior often understood force explains people animals initiate continue terminate certain behavior particular time complex phenomenon precise definition disputed contrasts amotivation state apathy listlessness motivation studied fields like psychology motivation science philosophy motivational states characterized direction intensity persistence direction motivational state shaped goal aims achieve intensity strength state affects whether state translated action much effort employed persistence refers long individual willing engage activity motivation often divided two phases first phase individual establishes goal second phase attempt reach goal many types motivation discussed academic literature intrinsic motivation comes internal factors like enjoyment curiosity contrasts extrinsic motivation driven external factors like obtaining rewards avoiding punishment conscious motivation individual

influence motivation contrasts amotivation lack interest certain activity resistance slightly different sense word motivation also refer act motivating someone reason goal comes latin term movere traditional discipline studying motivation psychology investigates motivation arises factors influence effects motivation science recent field inquiry focused integrative approach tries link insights different neurology interested underlying neurological mechanisms involved brain areas philosophy aims clarify nature motivation understand relation motivation directly observable inferred different ways measure common approach rely selfreports use questionnaires include direct questions like motivated may also inquire additional factors relation goals feelings effort invested particular another approach based external observation individual concern studying behavioral changes may also include additional methods like measuring brain activity skin many academic definitions motivation proposed little consensus precise partly motivation complex phenomenon many aspects different definitions often focus different definitions emphasize internal factors involve psychological aspects relation desires volitions physiological aspects regarding physical example john dewey abraham maslow use psychological perspective understand motivation form jackson beatty charles ransom gallistel see physical process akin hunger definitions stress continuity human animal motivation others draw clear distinction two often emphasized idea human agents act reasons mechanistically driven follow strongest closely related disagreement concerns role awareness rationality definitions emphasizing aspect understand motivation mostly conscious process rationally considering appropriate behavior another perspective emphasizes multitude unconscious subconscious factors definitions characterize motivation form arousal provides energy direct maintain instance k b madsen sees motivation driving force behind behavior elliott vatenstein roderick wong emphasize motivation leads goaloriented behavior interested role goals motivation sometimes paired claim leads flexible behavior contrast blind reflexes fixed stimulusresponse patterns based idea individuals use means bring goal flexible regard means according view feeding behavior rats based motivation since learn traverse complicated mazes satisfy hunger case stimulusbound feeding behavior psychologists define motivation temporary reversible example robert hinde john alcock see transitory state affects responsiveness approach makes possible contrast motivation phenomena like learning bring permanent behavioral another approach provide broad characterization cover many different aspects motivation often results long definitions including many factors listed multitude definitions lack consensus prompted theorists like psychologists b n bunnell donald dewsbury doubt concept motivation theoretically useful see instead mere hypothetical term motivation closely related term motive two terms often used however theorists distinguish precise meanings technical terms example psychologist andrea fuchs understands motivation sum separate according psychologist ruth kanfer motives stable dispositional tendencies contrast dynamic nature motivation fluctuating internal motivation closely related ability effort ability power perform action like ability walk write individuals abilities without exercising likely motivated something ability ability requirement possible motivated lacking corresponding effort physical mental energy invested exercising depends motivation high motivation associated high quality resulting performance depends ability effort motivation perform action present even action executed case instance stronger motivation engage different action motivation complex phenomenon often analyzed terms different components stages components aspects different motivational states common oftendiscussed components direction intensity persistence stages phases temporal parts motivation unfolds time like initial goalsetting stage contrast following goalstriving closely related issue concerns different types mental phenomena responsible motivation like desires beliefs rational deliberation theorists hold desire something essential part motivational states view based idea desire something justifies effort engage however view generally accepted suggested least cases actions motivated mental phenomena like beliefs rational example person may motivated undergo painful root canal treatment conclude necessary thing even though actively desire motivation sometimes discussed terms three main components direction intensity persistence direction refers goal people choose objective decide invest energy example one roommate decides go movies visits party motivation motivational states differ regard direction pursued objective often forms part hierarchy meansend relationships implies several steps lowerlevel goals may fulfilled reach higherlevel goal example achieve higherlevel goal writing complete article one needs realize different lowerlevel goals like writing different sections goal belongs individuals motivational reason explains favor action engage motivational reasons contrast normative reasons facts determine done course action objectively good motivational reasons tune normative reasons always example cake poisoned normative reason host offer guests aware poison politeness may motivating reason offer intensity motivation corresponds much energy someone willing invest particular task instance two athletes engaging drill direction differ concerning motivational intensity one gives best puts minimal effort theorists use term effort rather intensity strength motivational state also affects whether translated action one theory states different motivational states compete behavior highest net force motivation put however controversial whether always true example suggested cases rational deliberation may possible act ones strongest another problem view may lead form determinism denies existence free persistence longterm component motivation refers long individual engages activity high level motivational persistence manifests sustained dedication motivational persistence relation chosen goal contrasts flexibility level means individuals may adjust approach try different strategies level means reach pursued end way individuals adapt changes physical social environment affect effectiveness previously chosen components motivation understood analogy allocation limited resources direction intensity persistence determine allocate energy much effective action usually relevant right form motivation three levels pursue appropriate goal required intensity process motivation commonly divided two stages goalsetting goalsetting phase direction motivation determined involves considering reasons different courses action committing oneself goal one aims achieve goalsetting process ensure plan carried happens goalstriving stage individual tries implement plan starts initiation action includes putting effort trying different strategies various difficulties arise phase individual muster initiative get started goaldirected behavior stay committed even faced obstacles without giving distractions also need ensure chosen means effective overexert goalsetting goalstriving usually understood distinct stages intertwined various ways depending performance striving phase individual may adjust goal example performance worse expected may lower goals go hand hand adjusting effort invested theorists suggested phases example psychologist barry j zimmerman includes additional selfreflection phase performance approach distinguish two parts planning first part consists choosing goal second part planning realize many different types motivation discussed academic literature differ based underlying mechanisms responsible manifestation goals pursued temporal horizon encompass intended distinction intrinsic extrinsic motivation based source origin motivation intrinsic motivation comes within individual driven internal factors like enjoyment curiosity sense fulfillment occurs people pursue activity sake due affective factors person engages behavior feels good cognitive factors see something good example intrinsic motivation person plays basketball lunch break enjoy extrinsic motivation arises external factors rewards punishments recognition others occurs people engage activity interested effects outcome activity rather activity instance student homework afraid punished parents extrinsic motivation intrinsic motivation often highly regarded extrinsic motivation associated genuine passion creativity sense purpose personal autonomy also tends come stronger commitment persistence intrinsic motivation key factor cognitive social physical field education intrinsic motivation tends result highquality however also certain advantages extrinsic motivation provide people motivation engage useful necessary tasks naturally find interesting theorists understand difference intrinsic extrinsic motivation spectrum rather clear dichotomy linked idea autonomous activity associated intrinsic behavior motivated intrinsic motives extrinsic motives combination latter case internal external reasons person engages behavior present may work example presence strong extrinsic motivation like high monetary reward decrease intrinsic motivation individual may less likely engage activity result external reward anymore however always case right circumstances combined effects intrinsic extrinsic motivation leads higher conscious motivation involves motives person aware includes explicit recognition goals underlying values conscious motivation associated formulation goal plan realize well controlled stepbystep execution theorists emphasize role self process entity plans initiates regulates evaluates example conscious motivation person clothing store states want buy shirt goes buy unconscious motivation involves motives person aware guided deeprooted beliefs desires feelings operating beneath level consciousness examples include unacknowledged influences past experiences unresolved conflicts hidden fears defense mechanisms influences affect decisions impact behavior shape example unconscious motivation scientist believes research effort pure expression altruistic desire benefit science true motive unacknowledged need external circumstances also impact motivation underlying unconscious behavior example effect priming earlier stimulus influences response later stimulus without persons awareness unconscious motivation central topic sigmund freuds early theories motivation often assumed conscious motivation primary form motivation however view challenged subsequent literature academic consensus relative extent influence closely related contrast conscious unconscious motivation distinction rational irrational motivation motivational state rational based good reason implies motive behavior explains person engage behavior case person insight behavior considered valuable example person saves drowning child value childs life motivation rational motivation contrasts irrational motivation person good reason explains behavior case person lacks clear understanding deeper source motivation sense behavior tune case impulsive behavior example person spontaneously acts anger without reflecting consequences rational irrational motivation play key role field economics order predict behavior economic actors often assumed act rationally field rational behavior understood behavior tune selfinterest irrational behavior goes example based assumption selfinterest firms maximize profit actions lead outcome considered rational actions impede profit maximization considered however understood wider sense rational motivation broader term also includes behavior motivated desire benefit others form rational biological motivation concerns motives arise due physiological needs examples hunger thirst sex need sleep also referred primary physiological organic biological motivation associated states arousal emotional source lies innate mechanisms govern stimulusresponse cognitive motivation concerns motives arise psychological level include affiliation competition personal interests selfactualization well desires perfection justice beauty truth also called secondary psychological social personal motives often seen higher refined form processing interpretation information play key role cognitive motivation cognitively motivated behavior innate reflex flexible response available information based past experiences expected associated explicit formulation desired outcomes engagement goaldirected behavior realize theories human motivation see biological causes source motivation tend conceptualize human behavior analogy animal behavior theories allow biological cognitive motivation put main emphasis cognitive shortterm longterm motivation differ regard temporal horizon duration underlying motivational mechanism shortterm motivation focused achieving rewards immediately near future associated impulsive behavior transient fluctuating phenomenon may arise subside longterm motivation involves sustained commitment goals distant future encompasses willingness invest time effort extended period intended goal reached often deliberative process requires goalsetting shortterm longterm motivation relevant achieving ones example shortterm motivation central responding urgent problems longterm motivation key factor pursuing farreaching however sometimes conflict supporting opposing courses example married person tempted onenight stand case may clash shortterm motivation seek immediate physical gratification longterm motivation preserve nurture successful marriage built trust another example longterm motivation stay healthy contrast shortterm motivation smoke difference egoistic altruistic motivation concerns intended benefit anticipated course action egoistic motivation driven selfinterest person acting benefit fulfill needs desires selfinterest take various forms including immediate pleasure career advancement financial rewards gaining respect altruistic motivation marked selfless intentions involves genuine concern wellbeing others associated desire assist help others nontransactional manner without goal obtaining personal gain rewards according controversial thesis psychological egoism altruistic motivation motivation egoistic proponents view hold even apparently altruistic behavior caused egoistic motives example may claim people feel good helping people egoistic desire feel good true internal motivation behind externally altruistic many religions emphasize importance altruistic motivation component religious example christianity sees selfless love compassion way realizing gods bringing better buddhists emphasize practice lovingkindness toward sentient beings means eliminate many types motivation discussed academic literature moral motivation closely related altruistic motivation motive act tune moral judgments characterized willingness right desire visit sick friend keep promise example moral motivation conflict forms motivation like desire go movies influential debate moral philosophy centers around question whether moral judgments directly provide moral motivation internalists claim externalists provide alternative explanation holding additional mental states like desires emotions needed externalists hold additional states always accompany moral judgments meaning would possible moral judgments without moral motivation follow certain forms psychopathy brain damage inhibit moral selfdetermination theorists edward deci richard ryan distinguish autonomous controlled motivation autonomous motivation associated acting according ones free
