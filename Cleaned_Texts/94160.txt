pudendal nerve main nerve mixed motor sensory nerve also conveys sympathetic autonomic fibers carries sensation external genitalia sexes skin around anus perineum well motor supply various pelvic muscles including male female external urethral sphincter external anal sphincter damaged commonly childbirth loss sensation fecal incontinence may result nerve may temporarily anesthetized called pudendal anesthesia pudendal block pudendal canal carries pudendal nerve also known eponymous term alcocks canal benjamin alcock irish anatomist documented canal pudendal nerve paired meaning two nerves one left one right side body formed three roots immediately converge upper border sacrotuberous ligament coccygeus three roots become two cords middle lower root join form lower cord turn unite form pudendal nerve proper proximal sacrospinous three roots derived ventral rami sacral spinal nerves primary contribution coming pudendal nerve passes piriformis muscle coccygeus ischiococcygeus muscles leaves pelvis lower part greater sciatic crosses lateral part sacrospinous ligament reenters pelvis lesser sciatic foramen reentering pelvis accompanies internal pudendal artery internal pudendal vein upwards forwards along lateral wall ischiorectal fossa contained sheath obturator fascia termed pudendal canal along internal pudendal blood inside pudendal canal nerve divides branches first giving inferior rectal nerve perineal nerve continuing dorsal nerve penis males dorsal nerve clitoris nerve major branch sacral fibers originating onufs nucleus sacral region spinal pudendal nerve may vary origins example pudendal nerve may actually originate sciatic consequently damage sciatic nerve affect pudendal nerve well sometimes dorsal rami first sacral nerve contribute fibers pudendal nerve even rarely pudendal nerve motor control muscles sensory functions also carres sympathetic autonomic fibers parasympathetic pudendal nerve supplies sensation penis males clitoris females travels branches dorsal nerve penis dorsal nerve posterior scrotum males labia females also supplied via posterior scrotal nerves males posterior labial nerves females pudendal nerve one several nerves supplying sensation branches also supply sensation anal providing sensation penis clitoris pudendal nerve responsible afferent component penile erection clitoral branches innervate muscles perineum pelvic floor namely bulbospongiosus ischiocavernosus muscles levator ani muscle including iliococcygeus pubococcygeus puborectalis either pubovaginalis females puboprostaticus external anal sphincter via inferior anal male female external urethral functions innervate external urethral sphincter responsible tone sphincter mediated via acetylcholine release means periods increased acetylcholine release skeletal muscle external urethral sphincter contracts causing urinary retention whereas periods decreased acetylcholine release skeletal muscle external urethral sphincter relaxes allowing voiding bladder unlike internal sphincter muscle external sphincter made skeletal muscle therefore voluntary control somatic nervous system also responsible pudendal nerve block also known saddle nerve block local anesthesia technique used obstetric procedure anesthetize perineum procedure anesthetic agent lidocaine injected inner wall vagina pudendal abnormal loss sensation region medical symptom also sometimes termed saddle anesthesia pudendal nerve compressed stretched resulting temporary permanent neuropathy injury pudendal nerve manifests sensory problems pain alterationloss sensation rather loss muscle irreversible nerve injury may occur nerves stretched normal pelvic floor overstretched acutely eg prolonged difficult childbirth chronically eg chronic straining defecation caused constipation pudendal nerve vulnerable stretchinduced repeated traction pudendal nerve starts replaced fibrous tissue subsequent loss pudendal nerve entrapment also known alcock canal syndrome rare associated professional systemic diseases diabetes multiple sclerosis damage pudendal nerve via demyelination pelvic tumor notably large sacrococcygeal teratoma surgery remove tumor also cause permanent unilateral pudendal nerve neuropathy inconsistently causes fecal incontinence others crossover innervation external anal sphincter occurs significant overlap innervation external anal sphincter pudendal nerves allows partial reinnervation opposite side nerve pudendal nerve difficult visualize routine ct mr imaging however ct guidance needle may placed adjacent pudendal neurovascular bundle ischial spine easily identifiable structure ct used level injection spinal needle advanced via gluteal muscles advanced within several millimeters ischial spine
