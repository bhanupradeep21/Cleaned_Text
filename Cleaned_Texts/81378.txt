sleep debt sleep deficit cumulative effect getting enough sleep large sleep debt may lead mental physical fatigue adversely affect ones mood energy ability think clearly two kinds sleep debt result partial sleep deprivation total sleep deprivation partial sleep deprivation occurs person lab animal sleeps little several days weeks total sleep deprivation hand occurs subject kept awake least hours

result shorter sleeping comparison adults children exhibit consistent association sleep debt several studies shown sleep duration specifically sleep deficit shorter sleep duration predicts mortality whether weekdays people aged years younger daily sleep duration hours less amounting sleep deficit hours per day weekends correlated higher mortality compared control group slept consistent weekday sleep debt exhibited detrimental association mortality morbidity effect negated compensated long sleep however harmful consequences sleep debt weekdays weekends seen individuals aged years debate
