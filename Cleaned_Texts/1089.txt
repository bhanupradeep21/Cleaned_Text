description baur recognized mixosaurids primitive group boulenger considered ichthyosauria splittable three divisions mixosaurus early member group leading widefinned merriam remarked difficult reconstruct interrelationships ichthyosaurs confidence however considered wellknown triassic ichthyosaurs time specialized ancestral later species pointing anatomy ribs particular therefore proposed early split triassic ichthyosaurs posttriassic von huene proposed classification scheme ichthyosaurs divided two different groups latipinnates longipinnates split triassic persisted divisions based primarily structure forelimb though mcgowan argued two groups could differentiated skull proportions classification scheme mixosaurids classified early latipinnates von huene believing direct ancestors classification ichthyosaurs latipinnates longipinnates persisted many however appleby reassessed mixosaurid anatomy found specialized specializations suggest mixosaurids ancestral later latipinnates often features differed markedly mixosaurids specialized supposed descendants consequently named new monotypic order mixosaurids mixosauroidea instead argued posttriassic latipinnates evolved longipinnate despite initially supporting dichotomy mcgowan would go even appleby overturning latipinnatelongipinnate classification considering differences separating two groups ambiguous

nature however motani sander considered relationships genus provisional sander instead considering maisch colleagues noted toretocnemids shared multiple features mixosaurids suggested two groups might

species making among smallest typically around metres ft long fragmentary fossils suggest mixosaurids could grown long metres though poor quality preservation makes larger sizes mixosaurids specialized possess many distinctive mixosaurids large making roughly one fourth one fifth animals total front region mixosaurid skull drawn long thin snout lengthened premaxillae upper jaw hind ends premaxillae taper points form much rims external nares openings housed nostrils external nares usually face towards sides though phalarodon callawayi instead angled upwards behind premaxillae maxillae toothbearing bones roughly triangular upper dorsal processes maxillae contact prefrontals inside outside blocks lacrimals borders external mixosaurids round large orbits result skull distorted
