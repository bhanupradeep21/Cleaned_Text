racial disparities socioeconomic status also play role infertility well reported use medical services infertility data national survey fertility growth nsfg showed infertility rates black percent

socioeconomic status also provides barriers women flexibility take work schedule appointments higher socioeconomic status women without public even insurance company funding arts suggest higher

remain even states mandated infertility insurance coverage suggesting issue stratified infertility options go beyond political policies adoption another infertility option hosts many barriers underrepresented populations cost one factor barrier people low ses status also devaluation children color within adoption system demand white children higher children color thus leading adoption agencies charge adopt white children practice suggests white children higher value children continual expansion reproductive technologies also increasing deficits access utilization technologies due stratified reproduction barriers achieving equal access reproductive technologies include high costs lack adequate healthcare healthcare restrictive policies lack transportation lack autonomy given women make reproductive sheoran uses shellee colens stratified reproduction conceptual framing propose contraception experienced hierarchically places like india sheoran writing emergency contraceptive pills india writes ecps india thus make visible reality stratified contraception even technologies make inviting claims eradicating stratification providing women access pills local
