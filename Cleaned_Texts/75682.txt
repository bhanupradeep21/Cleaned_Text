social preferences describe human tendency care ones material payoff also reference groups payoff orand intention leads social preferences studied extensively behavioral experimental economics social psychology types social preferences include altruism fairness reciprocity inequity field economics originally assumed humans rational economic actors became apparent case field began change research social preferences economics started lab experiments experimental economists found subjects behavior deviated systematically selfinterest behavior economic games ultimatum game dictator game experimental findings inspired various new economic models characterize agents altruism fairness reciprocity concern recently growing amounts field experiments study shaping social preference applications throughout social preferences thought come two different methods nature nurture whilst nature encompasses biological makeup genetics nurture refers social environment one develops majority literature would support nature influences social preferences strongly whereas still research support heavy influence sociocultural factors factors include social distance economic agents distribution economic resources social norms religion understanding social preferences disparity occurs across individuals groups help create models better represent reality within financial sector research supports existence positive relationship elements trust reciprocity economic growth observed reduction defaults lending programs well effectiveness government central banking wellfunctioning social preferences may assist society paving way new developments decrease likelihood market failures well reduction transaction costs society may also utilize social preferences increase flow information transparency biologists social psychologists economists proposed theories documented evidence formation social preferences long run short various theories explaining formation development social preferences may explained biological cognitive sociocultural perspective detailed follows kin selection evolutionary strategy specific behavioral traits favored benefit close relatives hence behavior appears altruistic align theory selfish kin selection explain altruistic behavior towards close relatives even cost owns survival long ones sacrifice help preserve greater amount genes close example worker bees die attacking predators order help preserve bees reciprocity selection suggests ones altruistic act may evolve anticipation future reciprocal altruistic behavior application reciprocity selection game theory titfortat strategy prisoners dilemma strategy player cooperate initial encounter follow opponents behavior previous robert axelrod w hamilton showed titfortat strategy evolutionary stable strategy population probability repeated encounters two persons population certain psychologist albert bandura proposed children learn prosocial moral behavior imitating prosocial models including parents adults peers also economic models proposing parents transmit social preferences children demonstrating prosocial bandura conducted extensive psychological experimentation extent children emulate aggressive behaviour exposing models displaying behaviour observing childs behaviour left however empirical support parents role fostering prosocial behavior example researchers found positive relation parents use induction childrens prosocial others found correlation parents adoption punitive techniques childrens prosocial regarding sources social learning recent field experiments provided causal evidences positive effects school program mentoring program forming social research suggested social interaction prosocial role well cultural transmission family potential mechanisms psychologist jean piaget among first propose cognitive development prerequisite moral judgment behavior argued importance social interaction others rather learning moral development requires understanding rules others behavior important cognitive skills fostering prosocial behavior include perspective taking moral supported empirical many initial evidences social preferences came lab experiments subjects play economic games others however many research found subjects behavior robustly systematically deviated prediction selfinterest hypothesis could explained social preferences including altruism inequity aversion ultimatum game dictator game trust game giftexchange game exercises used understand social preferences implications ultimatum game one first experiments shows selfinterest hypothesis fails predict peoples behavior game first mover proposes split fixed amount second mover decides accept reject offer second mover accepts offer final payoff exactly determined offer however second mover rejects offer subjects zero contrary selfinterest hypothesiss prediction first mover propose zero amount second mover accept offer experimenters found proposers typically offer fixed amount responders tend reject offer split relevant game dictator game one subject proposes split fixed amount subject allowed accept offer dictator game helps isolate pure altruism strategic concern first mover ie first mover proposes larger share second mover avoid second movers rejection ultimatum game average share decreases fixed amount however subjects still propose positive two games trust game also called investment game giftexchange game provide evidence reciprocal behavior trust game first mover endowed fixed amount c decides amount money b pass second mover amount multiplied factor k reaches second mover second mover decides much amount kb returned first selfinterest model predicts transfer return experimenters found first mover typically transfers roughly endowment responders return increases gift exchange game first mover proposes offer second mover asks certain effort level second mover second mover decides hisher effort costly increase first movers also contrary selfinterest prediction first movers offer experiments usually greater zero second movers effort level increases prisoners dilemma generalized game public goods game also provide indirect evidence social preference many evidences conditional cooperation among prisoners dilemma game illustrates fact process cooperation create incentives player may make contribution notional public good contributions summed distributed players selfish players given opportunity free ride game depicts way consumers tend free ride without active intervention yet also way consumers change behaviour experience many field evidences documented agents fairness reciprocal concern example daniel kahneman jack knetsch richard thaler found concern fairness constrains firms profit seeking behavior eg raise price increase many field experiments examine relative pay concerns reciprocity work settings example economists uri gneezy john list conducted field experiments subjects hired typing job doortodoor fundraising found subjects exerted larger effort level group higher however positive reciprocity short researchers also found positive reciprocity smaller negative reciprocity another job applicants hired catalog books hours pronounced wage applicants later informed either wage increase wage cut researchers found decrease effort wage cut group larger increase effort wage increase group however positive reciprocity extend activities volunteering work one existing models social preferences divided two types distributive preferences reciprocal preferences distributive preferences preferences distribution total magnitude payoff among reference groups including altruism spitefulness fairness inequity aversion efficiency concern reciprocal preferences reflect agents concern intention others pure altruism economic models represents agents concern others wellbeing person exhibits altruistic preference persons utility increases others related economic model impure altruism warmglow individuals feel good ie gain warmglow utility something good without caring others spitefulness envy preference opposite pure altruism instance agents utility decreases others fairness inequity aversion models capture agents concern fair distribution payoffs across agents especially aversion payoff fehrschmidt agent compares payoff opponents group however agents utility decreases positive negative payoff differences self opponent reference group moreover agent dislikes payoff disadvantage payoff advantage hence agent presents altruistic behavior towards others agent better others displays spiteful behavior agent worse economists gary charness matthew rabin found cases agents prefer efficient outcomes ie outcome larger social welfare equal developed model agents utility convex combination owns material payoff social welfare moreover assumed agents quasimaximin preferences meaning agents care social welfare includes minimum payoff among agents well total payoff agents group however agent care less others payoff better agent motivation reciprocate towards kind unfair behavior rabin model one earliest model characterizes reciprocal behavior model agents payoff depends opponent agent forms belief opponents kindness based difference actual payoff agent receives fair payoff agents reciprocate positively heshe perceives individuals behavior kind fair respond negatively heshe perceives researchers generalize rabin model studying repeated interactions nperson extensive form also including inequity aversion agents charness rabin also augmented quasimaximin preference reciprocity researchers argued failure recognizing social preference lead biased understanding much important economic three important ways social preferences applied real world economics explained research social preferences showed reciprocal inequity averse individuals cooperate sure others cooperate punish free riders implications designing proper social mechanisms solve freeriding example fischbacher gachter found public goods experimentation people contribute public goods selfinterest alone would suggest provides support notion voluntary accounting employees reciprocity fairness concerns help design better contracts eg trust contract bonus contract enhance employees effort solve firms agency problems moreover design relative pay workplace affect employees job satisfaction research social preference also facilitated understanding monetary incentives crowdingout distributive reciprocal preferences mentioned previously integral good government upholding ethical standards without existence preferences unlikely society would achieve desirable allocations economic goods due selfinterest free rider problem research experimentation social preferences assists design optimal incentives used public accounting individuals fairness concerns affect design social policies especially redistributive policies addition reciprocal preferences affect peoples evaluation different policies towards poor depending individuals belief whether poor deserving httpsenwikipediaorgwikisocialpreferences
