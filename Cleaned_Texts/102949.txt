scientific study vision smooth pursuit describes type eye movement eyes remain fixated moving object one two ways visual animals voluntarily shift gaze saccadic eye movements pursuit differs vestibuloocular reflex occurs movements head serves stabilize gaze stationary object people unable initiate pursuit without moving visual signal pursuit targets moving velocities greater tends require catchup saccades smooth pursuit asymmetric humans primates tend better horizontal vertical smooth pursuit defined ability pursue smoothly without making catchup saccades humans also better downward upward pursuit modified ongoing visual feedback two basic methods recording smooth pursuit eye movements eye movement general first search coil technique common primate research extremely accurate eye movement shifts orientation coil induce electric current translated horizontal vertical eye position second technique eye tracker device somewhat noisy noninvasive often used human psychophysics recently also instructional psychology relies infrared illumination pupil track eye position oculomotor experiments often important ensure saccades occurred subject supposed smoothly pursuing target eye movements called catchup saccades common pursuing high speeds researchers able discard portions eye movement recordings contain saccades order analyze two components separately saccadic eye movements differ smooth pursuit component high initial acceleration deceleration peak neural circuitry underlying smooth pursuit object debate first step towards initiation pursuit see moving target signals retina ascend lateral geniculate nucleus activate neurons primary visual cortex primary visual cortex sends information target middle temporal visual cortex responds selectively directions movement processing motion area necessary smooth pursuit sensory area provides motion signal may may smoothly pursued region cortex frontal lobe known frontal pursuit area responds particular vectors pursuit electrically stimulated induce pursuit recent evidence suggests superior colliculus also responds smooth pursuit eye two areas likely involved providing gosignal initiate pursuit well selecting target track gosignal cortex superior colliculus relayed several pontine nuclei including dorsolateral pontine nuclei nucleus reticularis tegmenti neurons pons tuned eye velocity directionally selective stimulated change velocity pursuit pontine nuclei project cerebellum specifically vermis paraflocculus neurons code target velocity responsible particular velocity profile pursuitcitation needed cerebellum especially vestibulocerebellum also involved online correction velocity cerebellum projects optic motoneurons control eye muscles cause eye move pursuit eye movement divided two stages openloop pursuit closedloop pursuit openloop pursuit visual systems first response moving object want track typically lasts ms therefore stage ballistic visual signals yet time correct ongoing pursuit velocity second stage pursuit closedloop pursuit lasts pursuit movement ceased stage characterized online correction pursuit velocity compensate retinal slip words pursuit system tries null retinal velocity object interest achieved end openloop phase closedloop phase eye angular velocity target angular velocity nearly equal various lines research suggests tight coupling closed loop pursuit spatial attention instance close loop phase selective attention coupled pursuit target untracked targets move direction target poorly processed visual recently loose coupling open loop pursuit attention suggested one possible moving difference pursuit saccades may accounted differences latency pursuit eye movements initiated within ms typical latencies voluntary saccades order ms performing smooth pursuit without moving visual stimulus typically results series saccades however pursuit without visible target possible particular conditions show importance highlevel functions smooth pursuit maintenance know way target move know target trajectory periodic instance initiate pursuit target motion actually starts especially know exactly motion also possible maintain pursuit target momentarily disappears especially target appears occluded larger conditions visual stimulation total darkness still perform smooth pursuit eye movements help proprioceptive motion signal eg moving bright light appears periphery fastest achieve smooth pursuit first fixes gaze peripheral light excess follow target equally movement higher velocities eye move smoothly requires corrective saccades unlike saccades process uses continuous feedback system based strictly although clearly separate smooth pursuit vestibuloocular reflex always draw clear separation smooth pursuit tracking eye movements like slow phase optokinetic nystagmus ocular following response ofr discovered miles kawano transient ocular tracking response fullfield motion latter slow eye movements response extended targets purpose stabilizing image therefore processing stages shared smooth pursuit different kinds eye movements may simply differentiated stimulus appropriate generate smooth pursuit eye movements generated track extended targets well main difference may lie voluntary nature pursuit eye smooth pursuit requires coordination many brain regions far away makes particularly susceptible impairment variety disorders conditionscitation needed significant evidence smooth pursuit deficient people schizophrenia relatives people schizophrenia tend trouble pursuing fast targets impairment correlated less activation areas known play role pursuit frontal eye however studies shown people schizophrenia show relatively normal pursuit compared controls tracking objects move unexpectedly greatest deficits patients track objects predictable velocity begin moving predictable study speculates smooth pursuit deficits schizophrenia function patients inability store motion vectors people autism show
