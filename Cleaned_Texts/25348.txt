adenovirus varieties explored extensively viral vector gene therapy also oncolytic many different viruses explored oncolytic potential adenovirus first approved regulatory agency genetically modified strain gained regulatory approval chinas state food drug administration sfda treatment head neck adenoviruses far three generations strategies modification adenoviruses described adenovirus replication occur host cell must induced phase viral proteins interfering cell cycle proteins adenoviral gene responsible inactivation several proteins including retinoblastoma allowing entry sphase adenovirus gene cooperates another adenoviral product inactivate thus preventing apoptosis initially proposed adenovirus mutant lacking gene could replicate selectively deficient cellscitation needed conditionally replicative adenovirus crad base pair deletion retinoblastomabinding domain protein unable silence retinoblastoma therefore unable induce sphase host restricts replication proliferating
