hybrid cardiac surgical procedure narrow sense defined procedure combines conventional invasive surgical part including skin incision interventional part using sort catheterbased procedure guided fluoroscopy eg ct mri imaging hybrid operating room without hybrid technique reduced risk surgical complications shown decreased recovery time used treat numerous heart diseases conditions increasing complexity case hybrid surgical technique becoming common hybrid cardiac surgery either onestage twostage procedure difference two extent time elapsed two components hybrid surgery onestage procedure done hybrid suite requires specialized operating room twostage procedure time gap catheter intervention surgical operation time vary minutes hours although unlikely days weeks twostage procedure typically done different locations beginning catheterization laboratory followed surgical operating room first uses technical hybrid cardiac surgical procedures done however descriptions procedures earlier absolute contraindications hybrid cardiac surgery precise circumstances indicate hybrid surgery would beneficial however several factors considered devising care plan regarding cardiovascular diseases highrisk reoperative patients ideal candidates hybrid crucial factors acknowledge complexity disease possible comorbidities advanced age obesity decreased pulmonary function cardiologists often use syntax score grading system determine complexity coronary artery disease possible surgical outcomes deciding factors may include patients suitable vessels grafting body mass index radiographic contrast allergies response antiplatelet components hybrid surgery multiple uses used independently restore cardiac functions component also risks complications associated cardiac catheterization insertion catheter heart blood vessel cardiac catheter used run tests perform procedures procedures stent placement angioplasty fractional flow reserve intravascular ultrasound ivus cardiac conditions indicating need cardiac catheter include following atherosclerosis cardiomyopathy congenital heart disease heart failure heart valve risks associated cardiac catheterization bleeding bruising pain blood clot blood vessel damage infection catheter inserted heart arrhythmia ischemia sudden blockage coronary artery tear lining artery kidney damage stroke many risks associated catheterization also risks invasive cardiac procedures done hybrid surgeries involve many risks applied often concern success antiplatelet therapy bleeding postoperative surgical bypass grafting percutaneous coronary artery revascularization traditionally considered isolated options simultaneous hybrid approach may allow opportunity match best strategy particular anatomic lesion thus hybrid coronary revascularization midcab minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass surgery developed revascularization left anterior descending artery left internal mammary artery far best treatment option terms longterm results integrating therapy percutaneous coronary angioplasty hybrid procedure offers multivessel revascularization minithoracotomy particularly high risk patients morbidity mortality decreases comparison conventional surgerymedical citation needed people undergo coronary artery bypass grafting coronary imaging completion angiography routine evaluation bypass grafts may reasonable hybrid procedure angiographs may used monitor confirm congenital cardiac malformations even though surgery remains treatment choice interventional cardiology approaches increasingly used however percutaneous approaches challenging even impossible difficult complex anatomies doubleoutlet right ventricle transposition great arteries acute turns kinks pulmonary arteries tetralogy fallot patients patient characteristics complications low weight poor vascular access induced rhythm disturbances hemodynamic nevertheless surgery limitations combining interventions surgery single therapeutic procedure potentially leads reduction complexity cardiopulmonary bypass time risk improved outcomes another important concept hybrid procedures completion angiography described case congenital heart disease surgery may detect residual structural lesions thus reduce postoperative complications imaging using rotational angiography concept completion angiography hybrid may even induce reduction contrast media ionizing radiation dose applied patient reduces need postoperative dose reduction achieved combination intraoperative rotational angiography intraoperative mri fixed carm mri system available surgical theatre mri adds functional conventional approach treatment aortic valve stenosis surgical replacement aortic valve procedure excellent outcomes particularly younger patients relatively lowrisk remain gold standard aortic valve replacement upcoming years however tavi transcatheter aortic valve implantation emerged valid alternative patients conventional surgical techniques considered invasive risky put approach practice hybrid operating room strongly recommended number professional associations including european society cardiology european association cardiothoracic german society cardiology german society cardiac thoracic vascular surgery repair defected mitral valve potential future hybrid procedure still dependent approval necessary devices us food drug administration devices also likely used procedures performed regular cath labs prostheses mitral und tricuspid valve replacement development certainly available within next years complex hybrid procedures may arise various parts mitral valve apparatus eg chordae leaflet ring repaired beating heart combination purely interventional techniques eg mitralclip imaging modality perspective fluoroscopy likely combined ultrasound fusion modalities may become helpful reason metal devices optimally imaged without artifacts fluoroscopy whereas valve better evaluated ultrasound alternative transesophageal echocardiography use intracardiac echo may prove useful would allow avoiding general anesthesia selected aneurysms thoracic aorta thoracic endovascular aortic repair tevar become valid alternative open repair method may even applied pathologies aortic arch distal descending common complication evar endoleaks may missed angiographic evaluation rotational angiography providing ctlike imaging angiographic carm enables surgeon diagnose complication intraoperatively correct right away indication hybrid technique would beneficial successful patient previous aortic repair patients chronic dissecting aneurysms good candidates hybrid approach hybrid onestage procedure graft check immediately placement stent hybrid twostage procedure total operation time much shorter decreases postoperative complications however risk aneurysm could rupture two cases hybrid technique used repair aortic aneurysm complications experiences permanent paraplegia stroke spinal cord ischemia neurological regards rhythm disturbances particular atrial fibrillation af hybrid procedure involves combination surgical epicardial approach interventional endocardial approachmedical citation needed many cases differing heart diseases conditions morbidity rates greatly decreased hybrid approach used hybrid cardiac procedures also shown decrease postoperative complications patients also shorter
