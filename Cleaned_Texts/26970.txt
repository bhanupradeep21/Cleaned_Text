uncombable hair syndrome uhs rare structural anomaly hair variable degree effect characterized hair silvery dry frizzy wiry impossible first reported early typically becomes apparent ages months uhs several names including pili trianguli et canaliculi latin cheveux incoiffables french spunglass disorder believed autosomal recessive instances documented cases multiple family members display trait autosomal dominant fashion based current scientific studies related disorder three genes causally linked uhs tchh genes encode proteins important hair shaft clinical symptoms disorder arise months years age quantity hair head change hair starts grow slowly becomes increasingly uncombable clinically apparent scalp hair shafts must affected syndrome affects hair shaft scalp influence hair growth terms quantity textural feel appearance rest hair normal quantity usually silveryblond strawcolored disorderly stands scalp combed flat controlled braiding methods caused mutations one three possible genes tgm tchh genes code proteins involved hair shaft formation improvement often occurs later uncombable hair syndrome mainly autosomal recessive also autosomal dominant involved genes yet early adulthood phenotypic symptoms uhs spontaneously improve hair people uhs may eventually lie flat appear near normal texture adolescence early adulthood unknown basmanav et al suggested either different nonmutated isoforms hairforming enzymes produced age agingrelated mechanistic changes hair greater diameter length help resolve one would expect name individuals affected disorder difficulty managing grooming hair affected individuals usually possess blonde silver hair may present birth develop hair wiry frizzy stands straight often dry fragile due several structural abnormalities hair shaft crosssection hair shaft affected individuals reveals kidney bean triangular oval diameter unlike circular shaft shape displayed straight hair irregularity diameter hair shaft prevents hair lying neatly adjacent hair fibers trichohyalin tchh structural protein responsible proper cylindrical fiber topology hair tchh binds tchh keratinintermediate filaments creating proper crosslinks cylindrical shape hair two enzymes responsible posttranslational modification tchh important crosslinking tchh within uncombable hair syndrome mutations tchh result improper crosslinking resulting irregular shape hair shaftcitation needed particular defect tchh structural component hair may defect deimination deimination converts amino acid arginine amino acid citrulline conversion done calciumdependent enzymes known peptidylarginine deiminases member enzyme class one study reported pad involvement skin skinrelated diseases particularly hair follicle alterations pad activity resulted development uncombable hair syndrome another study examined transglutaminase tg family enzymes involvement uhs family enzymes includes expressed epidermal cells mutations may therefore reduce alter intermolecular crosslinking important hair shaft formation leading uncombable hair another molecular mechanism uhs proposed ralph trueb suggested premature keratinization inner hair root forms rigid sheath alters shape hair strand grows uncombable hair syndrome caused defect trichohyalin gene tchh found hair follicles parts hair serves scaffold protein involucrin cell envelope organization trichohyalin gene produced changed proteins molecules keratin intermediate filaments form organized crosslinks networks provide hair shaft cylindrical turn leads frizzy hair resulting uncombable chromosomal location tchh gene located chromosome condition usually improves time better hair structure reaches adolescencecitation needed still decided whether tchh autosomal dominant autosomal experiment identified causative mutations uhs genes tchh children children carried homozygousheterozygous mutations genes resulted autosomal recessive inheritance identified autosomal recessive inheritance scanning electron microscopy performed order rule autosomal dominance since type gene also autosomal dominant certain uncombable hair syndrome caused defect transglutaminase gene gene helps provide instructions creating enzyme known transglutaminase gene found skin cells known keratinocytes corneocytes helps frame scalp root strands helps molecules bind crosslinks help provide strength structure cells skin hair chromosomal location transglutaminase located chromosome experiment done transglutaminase reduced esophageal used western blot analysis polymerase chain pairs tissues sampled confirmed transglutaminase closely related growth proliferation migration however overexpression gene induces cell proliferation migration invasion promotes programmed cell death came show transglutaminse candidate growth could function helpful biomarker therapeutic target esophageal cancer uncombable hair syndrome caused defect gene peptidylargininedeiminase located chromosome defect apparently common cause gene provides instructions creating enzyme called peptidylargine deiminase found within skins extreme external surface inside cells called protein also contributes hair follicles specialized structures within skin development happens hair follicles gene adjusts proteins giving structure hair gene also involves process called deimination process modifies proteins intuitive needed experiment performed found central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia mostly found african women suggests autosomal dominant trait occur experiment performed process called immunoblotting immunofluorescence immunoblotting appeared transfected cells marginally lower expression mutant compared immunofluorescence resulted irregular intracellular location therefore helped conclude reduction enzymatic action encodes protein hair shaft arrangement relates central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia syndromes hair abnormalities may also show features uncombable hair syndrome ectodermal dysplasia syndrome loose anagen syndrome eec syndrome ectodermal dysplasia ectrodactyly cleft lippalate familial trichoodontoonychial ectodermal dysplasia syndactyly however unlike conditions uncombable hair syndrome alone associated physical neurologic mental according us national institute health condition tends develop childhood age resolve another observation made detecting uncombable hair syndrome individuals observing hair shaft special microscope individual hair strands viewed hair triangular kidneyshaped longitudinal groove one two clinical diagnosis uhs confirmed molecularly performing highresolution microscopy hair shafts using scanning electron microscopy sem allows visualization hair shaft crosssections appear triangular heartshaped kidneyshaped flat longitudinally grooved interestingly multiple different cross sections appear single shaft alternative method confirming uhs diagnosis molecularly embedding uhs hairs due atypical shape hair shafts uhs uhs hair refract light differently typical hair causing glistening although tends regress naturally later childhood definitive treatment uncombable hair syndrome recommended treatment using soft brushes gentle conditioners also recommended avoid hair treatments harsh hair excessive brushing blow drying perms coloring hair biotin supplements also used treatment due historical utility controlling nail fragility improving hair growth months uhs thought extremely rare precise frequency prevalence case studies uhs scientific documented case uhs found patients also diseases ectodermal dysplasia loose anagen hair sometimes observed disorders believed uncombable hair syndrome isolated syndromes name comes directly abnormal frizzy appearance totally resists effort control brush
