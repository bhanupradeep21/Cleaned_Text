field neurology seizure types categories seizures defined seizure behavior symptoms diagnostic tests international league epilepsy ilae classification seizures internationally recognized standard identifying seizure ilae classification seizures revision prior ilae classification distinguishing seizure types important since different types seizures may different causes outcomes treatments bc sumerians provided first writings later bc babylonian scholars developed first seizure classification inscribing medical knowledge stone tablets called sakikku english early classification identified febrile seizures absence seizures generalized tonicclonic seizures focal seizures impaired awareness seizures status samuelauguste tissot authored traité de l epilepsie book describing grand état

seizures seizures mental emotional motor autonomic henri gastaut led effort develop ilae classification seizures based clinical seizure type electroencephalogram eeg anatomical substrate etiology age ilae classification seizure included information eegvideo seizure recordings excluded anatomical substrate etiology age factors factors historical speculative rather directly ilae classification seizures closely reflects clinical practice using observed seizure behavior additional data identify seizure seizure paroxysmal episode symptoms altered behavior arising abnormal excessive synchronous brain neuronal focal onset seizure arises biological neural network within one cerebral hemisphere generalized onset seizure arises within cerebral hemispheres rapidly involving seizure symptoms seizure behavior neuroimaging seizure etiology eeg video recordings help distinguish focal generalized onset unknown onset seizures occur available information insufficient distinguish focal generalized onset seizures textstyle geq focal bilateral tonicclonic seizure indicates seizure begins focal seizure later evolves bilateral tonicclonic classification distinguishes focal aware seizures focal impaired awareness aware means aware self surroundings seizure verified person recall events occurred impaired awareness occurs even recall events partially impaired awareness may occur time level awareness determined level awareness unspecified usually occurs atonic seizures epileptic spasm motor seizure prominent movement increased muscle contraction decreased muscle contraction initial predominant seizure atonic seizures brief second lapses muscle tone commonly leading specific enough verify epileptic spasm seizures brief second proximal limb truncal flexion extension movements often hyperkinetic seizures occur high amplitude truncal limb movements pedaling thrashing rocking myoclonic seizures brief jerks limbs body lasting tonic seizures abrupt increases muscle tone greater seconds clonic seizures occur rhythmic body myoclonicatonic seizures begins one jerks myoclonic phase followed loss muscle tone atonic myoclonictonicclonic seizures begin one jerks myoclonic phase body stiffening tonicphase rhythmic jerks clonic tonicclonic seizures begin symmetrical bilateral body stiffening tonic phase followed rhythmic jerks clonic myoclonic atonic tonic myoclonicatonic seizures may cause abrupt falls called drop attacks similar automatism seizures occur repetitive stereotyped behaviors nonmotor seizure may begin sensory cognitive autonomic emotional symptom behavioral arrest activity impaired awareness minor motor activity initial predominant seizure sensory seizures occur somatosensory olfactory visual gustatory vestibular thermal cognitive
