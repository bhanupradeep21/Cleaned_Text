experience child affects future mothers found display higher sensitivity towards children preschool first grade found higher achieving children displayed lower maternal sensitivity children maternally sensitive mothers scored higher math phoneme knowledge history lower maternal maternal sensitivity shown teach infants attentional skills necessary later life emotional control complex cognitive families one child twins triplets found maternal sensitivity lower needs taken care mother less time form unique bond turn results decreased cognitive development infants relative child raised furthermore newborn period women displayed high maternal sensitivity children able regulate emotions higher symbolic cognitive skills case triplets child received least maternal sensitivity one showed poorest outcomes cognitively medical maternal sensitivity shown effect childrens socialization skills particular research suggests children sensitive caregivers high levels effortful ie emotional behavioural control control proposed fostered infancy stage sensitive mothers quick appropriate responses babys distress teaches baby adjust hisher arousal speedy regulation arousal adapted childhood resulting ability regulate emotion behaviour caregiver sensitivity also found connection empathy children generally securely attached children found empathetic compared insecurely attached children reasoning suggested result securely attached children receive empathy caregivers times distressed likely show empathy situation someone else adults understanding maternal sensitivity affects
