eye movement reading involves visual processing written text described french ophthalmologist louis émile javal late century reported eyes move continuously along line text make short rapid movements saccades intermingled short stops fixations javals observations characterised reliance nakedeye observation eye movement absence technology late century investigators used early tracking technologies assist observation research climate emphasised measurement human behaviour skill educational ends basic knowledge eye movement obtained period since century three major changes development noninvasive

invented system recording eye movement directly onto rotating drum means stylus direct mechanical connection devices involving physical contact surface eyes developed used end century late included items rubber balloons eye caps mechanical systems suffered three serious disadvantages questionable accuracy due slippage physical connection considerable discomfort caused participants direct mechanical connection consequently great difficulty persuading people participate issues ecological validity since participants experience reading trials significantly different normal reading experience despite drawbacks mechanical devices used eye movement research well century attempts soon made overcome problems one solution use electromagnetic energy rather mechanical connection dodge
