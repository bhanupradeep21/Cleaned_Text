cosmopolitodus extinct genus mackerel shark lived thirty one million years ago late oligocene early pleistocene epochs type species cosmopolitodus hastalis broadtooth mako common names include extinct giant mako broadtooth white shark isurus planus reassigned genus thus became second species c teeth reach lengths cm found believed ancestor great white shark argument supported transitional species carcharodon phylogenetic analyses done cosmopolitodus derived ancient greek κοσμοπολίτης kosmopolítēs meaning citizen world ὀδών odṓn meaning tooth specific name hastalis may derived latin word hasta meaning spear disputed species xiphodon derived ancient greek ξίφος xíphos meaning sword ὀδών odṓn meaning tooth taxonomy c hastalis especially status genus long subject debate initial binomial name first given oxyrhina hastalis oxyrhina xiphodon narrow broadform variations respectively swiss naturalist louis agassiz paper recherches sur les poissons fossiles although indications show coined taxon early throughout early mid century different genera species lamniformes would clumped two taxa genus oxyrhina began used wastebasket taxon sharks previously identified variations oxyrhina hastalis oxyrhina xiphodon included two species extinct ancestral makos isurus desori isurus retroflexus serrated mako carcharomodus escheri falsetoothed mako parotodus eventually later studies would begin show much sharks within genus two species distinct discarding genus oxyrhina altogether creating another issue new taxa sharks placed genus still uncertain shortly discarding genus oxyrhina review holec et al placed species hastalis xiphodon species mako genus isurus citing similarities teeth two modern mako study ward bonavi considered isurus hastalis isurus xiphodon conspecific declared latter nomen although conclusion widely accepted scientists disagree study whitenack gottfried demonstrating geometrically morphological differences hastalis scientific name isurus hastalis considered traditional view debate regarding sharks isurus schoutedeni isurus praecursor isurus desori cosmopolitodus hastalis cosmopolitodus planus carcharomodus escheri carcharodon hubbelli carcharodon carcharias ward bonavi reexamined teeth hastalis noted strong morphological similarity extant great white shark study concluded hastalis direct ancestor great white related makos moved species genus cosmopolitodus move first proposed glikman long rejected later discoveries supports ward bonavis conclusion ancestry great white analysis newly discovered carcharodon hubbelli ehret et al cemented theory c hastaliss ancestry great white however also proposed cosmopolitodus moved carcharodon remarking two genera separated solely due lack serrations c hastalis lack lateral cusplets c carcharias pointing examples late miocene c hastalis teeth showing basal cione et al also noted possibility moving species genus cosmopolitodus genus carcharodon avoid possible paraphyly would occur one traditionally identified c xiphodon putative sister species c carcharias however study also noted would done putative sister species conspecific c hastalis study concluded indeed putative sister species c carcharias distinct c hastalis proposed taxon carcharodon plicatilis resolving paraphyly however yun argued tooth fossil remains cosmopolitodus great white documented deposits hence former chronospecific ancestor latter also criticized fact cosmopolitodus morphotype never tested phylogenetic analyses denoted argument carcharodon lineage narrow serrated teeth evolved cosmopolitodus broad unserrated teeth c hastalis teeth grow cm length suggesting large shark body probably similar modern great whites also believed cosmopolitan distribution c hastalis teeth found species divided two

hastalis desori teeth much heterodontic c planus roots uneven thickness shape narrow builds rounder lobes somewhat making appearance heart crowns lower teeth species described straight identical lower teeth c hooked teeth probably would efficient gripping prey would suggest diet smaller mediumsized animals broad form characterized broadshaped teeth often described identical modern great whites besides lack fossil evidence shows broadform direct ancestor genus carcharodon specimens pisco formation peru show evolutionary mosaic form also commonly labeled species synonym xiphodon reflect
