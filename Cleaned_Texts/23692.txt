positive behavior support pbs uses tools applied behaviour analysis values normalisation social role valorisation theory improve quality life usually schools pbs uses functional analysis understand maintains individuals challenging behavior support individual get needs met appropriate way instead using challenging behaviours peoples inappropriate behaviors difficult change functional serve purpose behaviors may supported reinforcement environment people may inadvertently reinforce undesired behaviors providing objects andor attention behavior positive behavior support process involves identifying goals undertaking functional behavior assessment fba fbas clearly describe behaviors identify contexts events times situation predict behavior occur consequences maintain behavior fba includes hypothesis behavior data baseline informs support plan design implementation monitoring plan positive behavior support increasingly recognized strategy feasible desirable effective example teachers parents need strategies able willing use affect childs ability participate community school activities changing stimulus reinforcement environment teaching person strengthen deficit skill areas behavior changes schools allow students included general education setting three areas deficit skills addressed pbs communication skills social skills selfmanagement skills redirective therapy positive behavior support especially effective relationship treatment plans failed redirective therapy allows positive interaction parents children positive behavior support successful school setting primarily teaching schools required conduct functional behavioral assessment fba use positive behavior support students identified disabled risk expulsion alternative school placement days suspension even though fba required limited circumstances good professional practice use problemsolving approach managing problem behaviors school use positive behavior interventions pbis schools part professional skill early special education programs opposed rogerian counseling program offers primary secondary tertiary level basic tenet pbis approach includes identifying students one three categories primary secondary interventions specifically developed levels goal reducing risk academic social interventions become focused complex primary prevention strategies focus interventions used schoolwide basis pbs use designated population group neither approved professions publicatlarge level prevention considered primary students exposed way level intervention approximately students risk behavior problems respond positive manner prevention primary prevention strategies include limited using effective teaching practices curricula explicitly teaching behavior acceptable within school environment focusing ecological arrangement systems within school consistent use precorrection procedures using active supervision common areas creating reinforcement systems used schoolwide secondary prevention strategies involve around school population respond primary prevention strategies risk academic failure behavior problems need individual interventions secondary level often delivered small groups maximize time effort developed unique needs students within group examples interventions include social support social skills training eg explicit instruction skilldeficit areas friendship clubs check incheck role playing academic support additionally secondary programs could include behavioral support approaches eg simple functional behavioral assessments fba precorrection selfmanagement training even heightened support within secondary level interventions students need additional assistance tertiary prevention programs focus students display persistent patterns disciplinary tertiarylevel programs also called intensive individualized interventions comprehensive interventions within level strengthbased complexity intensity intervention plans directly reflect complexity intensity students within tertiary level continue involvement primary secondary intervention programs receive additional support well supports could include use full fba deescalation training student heightened use natural supports eg family members friends student development behavior intervention plan bip although comprehensive services important students critical aspect threetiered model identification students one three levels one method identifying students need interventions analyze office disciplinary referrals odr taken odrs may means identifying students risk level antisocial behavior school researchers advocated analyzing naturally occurring data source relatively cheap effective ongoing measurement device pbs odrs also shown effective determining students fall within threeleveled developing professional development well helping coordinate school efforts community predicting school failure older grades well indicating types behavior resulting determination effectiveness precorrection analyzing discipline referral data also help school personnel identify improve ecological arrangements within school recognize increase active supervision common limitation using odrs measure behavior problems found ineffective measuring internalizing behavior problems anxiety depression functional behavior assessment fba emerged applied behavior analysis cornerstone positive behavior support assessment seeks describe behavior environmental factors setting events predict behavior order guide development effective support plans assessment lays foundation pbs assessment includes results assessment help developing individualized behavior support plan outlines procedures teaching alternatives behavior problems redesign environment make problem behavior irrelevant inefficient ineffective behavior chain analysis another avenue functional behavior assessment growing popularity behavior chain analysis one looks progressive changes behavior lead problem behavior attempts disrupt sequence whereas fba concerned mostly settingantecedentbehaviorconsequence relations behavior chain analysis looks progression behavior example child may fidget first begin tease others start throw things finally hit another student many different behavioral strategies pbs use encourage individuals change behavior strategies delivered consultation process strong part functional behavior assessment allows interventions directly address function purpose problem behavior example child acts attention could receive attention alternative behavior contingency management teacher could make effort increase amount attention throughout day satiation changes setting events antecedents often preferred pbs contingency management often takes effort another tactic especially dealing disruptive behavior use information behavior chain analysis disrupt behavioral problem early sequence prevent commonly used approaches main keys developing behavior management program include use effective behavior management schoolwide level pbs programs offer effective method reduce school crime prevent severe forms problem behaviors normal social behavior programs actively consequential management positive response challenging behavior serves give person informed choice opportunity learn consequences must clearly related challenging behavior example glass water thrown glass smashed consequence restitution would person clean mess replace glass sorts consequences consistent normal social reinforcement contingencies providing choices important staff set limits giving alternatives related behavior seeking important alternative stated positive way words used convey person choice example schoolwide positive behavior support swpbs consists broad range systematic individualized strategies achieving important social learning outcomes preventing problem behavior measurable goal school may reduce level violence main goal might create healthy respectful safe learning teaching pbs schoolwide level system used create perfect school least better school particularly implementation necessary develop vision school environment look like according horner et al school decides implement pbs following characteristics require addressing proponents state program able create positive atmosphere culture almost school support resources consistency using program time must alternatives special education approaches special populations training consultancy services httpsenwikipediaorgwikipositivebehaviorsupport
