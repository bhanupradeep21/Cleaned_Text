radiofrequency ablation rfa also called medical procedure part electrical conduction system heart tumor dysfunctional tissue ablated using heat generated medium frequency alternating current range rfa generally conducted outpatient setting using either local anesthetics twilight anesthesia delivered via catheter called radiofrequency catheter ablation two important advantages radio frequency current previously used low frequency ac pulses dc directly stimulate nerves heart muscle therefore often used without need general anesthesia specific treating desired tissue without significant collateral damage due gaining popularity alternative eligible patients want undergo needed documented benefits led rfa becoming widely used rfa procedures performed image guidance xray screening ct
