foetal brain cell graft surgical procedure used regenerative treatment various neurological conditions mainly explored used specifically treating parkinsons disease standardised procedure followed cells usually obtained weeks old foetus collected cells undergo testing examine whether free infectious agents safe found procedure results overall improvement motor functions reduction reliance medication pd patients foetal brain cells unique multipotent proliferate faster however several factors influence success procedure foetal neurons completely functionally integrated host may cause various side effects risks limitations associated ethical issues raised regarding procedure include influence mothers decision abortion leading rise abortion deriving stem cells foetuses may also violate human grafting surgical procedure involving replacement damaged missing body tissues healthy body blood supply surgical area integrates neighbouring cells brief procedure first obtain cells healthy donor anaesthetise patient make incision target area easier access lastly close incision stitchescitation needed stem cells found foetal tissues differentiate cell type foetal tissue transplantation foetal allograft procedure using tissues aborted foetus implanting diseased patient body improve defective tissue one first foetal tissue transplantation attempt made italy using aborted foetal tissues lots trial error bone marrow transplantation became successful infectious complications transplant rejection foetal tissues also used liver thymus transplantations widespread success foetal tissue transplantation led use foetal brain cells treat neurological diseases foetal cells differentiated stem cells pluripotent embryonic stem cells found one three germ layers shows multipotency human foetal tissues widely used transplantations treat various mainly due unique properties containing rich source primordial stem cells comparison adult mature stem cells foetal stem cells proliferation rate much faster greater plasticity differential potential suggests lost functions host cells recovered relatively quickly donor cells within short period time also foetal cells differentiate response surrounding environment location plays key role instance functional connections establish growth elongation migration facilitated location environmental cues due presence low levels histocompatibility antigens foetal cells chances recipient rejecting transplanted foetal cell low also found foetal cells produce high levels angiogenic neurotrophic factors increases growth rate transplantation foetal cells short extensions weak intercellular connections survive better grafting lastly cells survive lower oxygen conditions tend resistant ischemic environments transplantation vitro generally cells harvested foetuses around weeks also possible collect cells foetus time cells obtained dead foetuses cause death usually due stillbirth abortion atopic pregnancy surgery collected cells first undergo vitro culture check gene abnormalities cell dysfunctions cells injected patient implantation surgeries immunosuppressants used avoid immune rejection access ventral midbrain tissue dissection cover tissues removed aborted foetus dissection targeted isolate homogenous cell types group tissues brain cells dissected glial cells regulate neurons growth synaptic connections harvesting cells foetuses done according standardised stem cell protocol includes week culturing around cells survive vitro cells stored weeks low temperatures cryopreservation keep cool cells examined whether clear infectious agents ensure safe use stage level dopamine released cells measured dopamine needed treatment pd patients physical health also monitored meantime aids physician determine optimal time physical state performing mri used examine anatomy shape location insertion cells human brain prior surgery examination essential ensures insertion foetal cells done target location duration procedure roughly takes hours operated general anaesthesia grafts implanted directly striatum monitoring patients physical state usually discharged hospital within survival cells influenced age donor tissue stage cells extracted addition tests cytogenetic abnormalities viability foetal cells differentiation cells patients well longterm follow ups needed determine success successful grafting neurons putamen functional integration host basal ganglia synthesises dopamine leads desirable new york times article reported patients pd underwent foetal brain cell graft showed uncontrollable muscle movements adverse another study reported postfoetal brain cell graft patients developed tremors procedure showed effectiveness instead grafted cells homogenised environment developed morphological functional features affected pd cells patient huntington disease treated foetal brain cells led brain tumour due graft due difficulty obtaining healthy foetal tissues cost surgery patients pd treated per year hence procedure used firstline treatment treating large parkinsons disease pd type progressive agerelated neurodegenerative resulted loss dopaminergic neurons projecting substantia nigra pars compacta initiates functional change dorsal motor striatum basal dopamine neurons found substantia nigra sends signals striatum specifically caudate putamen symptoms pd includes motor impairments behavioural underlying mechanism pd proposed due changes neurotransmitters including levels dopamine serotonin exploration mechanisms gives clearer direction new therapeutic target early surviving cell counts reported procedure cellular characteristics functions cells infectious ability examined screening stage foetal brain cells absent therefore testing animal models needed ensure safety period trial testing pd patients revealed several issues transplantation example patient received foetal brain cells foetuses died postsurgery dopaminergic neurons transplanted foetal brains pd patients full report clinical trial reported adverse events jerking uncontrolled movements another attempt documented report showed signs improvement foetal brain cell graft potential therapeutic treatment neurological diseases currently pharmaceutical interventions reduce loss striatal dopamine modulates dopamine da neurotransmission ie increasing da levels brain however use treatments symptomatic address underlying cause disease prevent progressive degeneration midbrain dopaminergic neurons mda neurons pd progresses pharmaceutical interventions lose efficacy result greater foetal brain cell graft regenerative treatment replace mda neurons pd patients time diagnosis method allows delivery da physiological manner helps maintain functions mda neurons previous clinical trial documented successful cell transplantation human foetal ventral midbrain tissue showed efficacy concept cell replacement therapy till results foetal brain cell graft treating pd shown moderate technological advancements foetal brain cell graft shown significant improvements patients pd recent years reduces medication dosage patients remained asymptomatic previous case study reported success foetal brain cell grafting patients pd yale university funded neural transplant programme followed aforementioned standardised procedure graft tissues collected elective abortions request donation made women decision terminate pregnancy status patients nonoperated group monitored followup period observed months postsurgery motor functions improved effect lasted years overall results foetal brain cell graft showed benefits patients pd improved performances reduced medication several ethical concerns associated procedure debated mothers decision abortion may influenced aspect serving humanity donating foetal tissues proponents also believe heightens possibility women becoming pregnant aborting sole purpose foetal tissues transplantation therefore affects pregnant womans decision abort additionally abortions might done financial purposes contributes rise abortion furthermore success procedure absolutely guaranteed transplantation rejections may occur due infections allergic reactions another ethical consideration foetus considered human thus act harvesting brain cells violates human dignity moreover success rate acceptance procedure increases addition transplantation foetal brain cells may potentially encourage act transplanting entire foetal brain medical httpsenwikipediaorgwikifoetalbraincellgraft
