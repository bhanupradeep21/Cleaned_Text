lasswells model communication one first influential models communication initially published harold lasswell analyzes communication terms five basic questions says channel effect questions pick five fundamental components communicative process sender message channel receiver effect theorists raised doubts widely used characterization model communication correct refer instead lasswells formula lasswells definition lasswells construct beginning conceived specifically analysis mass communication like radio television newspapers however applied various fields many theorists understand general model communication lasswells model still used today influenced many subsequent communication theorists expanded model additional questions like circumstances purpose others used starting point development models lasswells model often criticized simplicity common objection explicitly discuss feedback loop influence context communicative process another criticism take effects noise account however everyone agrees objections suggested apply mainly lasswells model presented interpreted theorists lasswells original formulation lasswells model one earliest influential models first published harold lasswell book structure function communication aim organize scientific study process communication described linear unidirectional oneway action media theory widely used segmentation communication simple linear potentially hypodermic conceptualization lasswells model analyzes communication terms five basic questions says channel questions refer salient components process communication asks person formulating message content message channel way message conveyed sender receiver refers recipient message either individual bigger audience case mass communication effect outcome communication example audience persuaded accept point view expressed message include effects intended case news paper headline sender reporter message content headline newspaper channel audience reader effect reader responds lasswell assigns question field inquiry within discipline communication studies corresponding control analysis content analysis media analysis audience analysis effect centrality five questions sometimes referred model despite widely seen model communication everyone agrees accurate model communication simplified presentation aims give basic explanation process highlighting fundamental characteristics example james watson anne hill see lasswells model mere questioning device full model early reception term lasswells formula commonly used instead scholars interested describing classifying acts communication however many subsequent theorists rejected terminology since term formula seems miss part significance applications many comparisons model invited term model well regard may understood framework conceptualizing theorists use term lasswells formula question says channel effect framework treats various basic concepts communication scholars also refer lasswells definition dictionaries even make reference lasswell definitions zachary sapienza et al hold many different conceptions lasswells model given theorists reason propose term lasswells construct emphasize one particular model umbrella term allows multiple lasswells model initially formulated specifically analysis mass communication like radio television newspapers also applied various fields forms include analysis new media internet computer animations video lasswells model also utilized pedagogical settings teach students major elements communication process starting point developing hypotheses lasswell others used model beyond scope mass communication tool analysis forms verbal also reflected fact theorists employ model definition communication one earliest models communication lasswells model influential field communication studies communication scholars denis mcquail sven windahl referred lasswells model perhaps famous single phrase communication mcquail windahl also considered model formula would transformed model boxes drawn around element arrows connected models influence also reflected various expansions developments many theorists used starting point development theories george gerbner founder cultivation theory expanded lasswells model focus attention perception reaction perceiver consequences laswells model communication expanded richard braddock model paper extension lasswells formula includes two additional questions circumstances purpose first question focuses importance context communication second question emphasizes may difference senders intention actual effect similar extensions proposed lennox gray adding question situation herbert hyman included question immediate response duncan moriarty added category noise focused feedback instead according media scholar michael real attempts successful capturing lasswells original lasswell also proposed additional questions usually application model specific fields field political communication example includes questions value outcomes sought whether effect tune speakers criticism lasswells model focuses simplicity lack indepth example greenberg salwen state although lasswells model draws attention several key elements mass communication process describe general areas study link elements together specificity notion active common objection emphasizes lack feedback feedback means receiver responds sending message back original sender makes process complicated since participant acts sender receiver many forms communication feedback vital importance example assess effect communication however carry weight case mass communication theorists argue criticism based misinterpretation lasswells model one reason view models communication take form graphical representation exist visualizations lasswells model lasswell never devised one due theorists interpreting visual representations usually show lasswells model linear transmission model lacking feedback loop sapienza et al argue view lasswells model linear transmission model since lasswell also discusses twoway communication another another argument favor objection effect discussed lasswell may understood form another shortcoming lasswells model take effects noise noise refers influences distort message make difficult receiver reconstruct sources original intention example crackling sounds telephone call one form criticism focuses fact lasswells model address various influences context context wide term refers circumstances transmission various forms context like physical surroundings emotional aspects mood participants well social cultural factors factors crucial many cases understanding conversation evolves one way rather abovementioned criticisms often lead another objection lasswells model outdated therefore lacks usefulness comparison modern models however despite one oldest models communication lasswells model still used today uses often restricted specific applications cited criticisms carry much weight examples include analysis mass media new everyone agrees criticisms listed based simplicity lasswells model according sapienza et al many objections result overly simplified presentation lasswells model subsequent theorists apply lasswells original formulation simplifications may motivated desire interpreter emphasize advances models theorists hold lasswells model simple called model communication better characterized questioning view argued models simple presentation terms five questions convenient starting point justice theoretical
