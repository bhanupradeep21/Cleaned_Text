horses exhibit diverse array coat colors distinctive markings specialized vocabulary evolved describe horses remain color throughout life course several years develop different coat color born white markings present birth underlying skin color healthy horse change equine coat colors also related breed horse like friesian breed instance basic outline equine coat color genetics largely resolved dna tests determine likelihood horse offspring given color developed colors discussion research even controversy continues details particularly surrounding spotting patterns color subshades sooty flaxen markings two basic pigment colors horse hairs pheomelanin red produces reddish brown color eumelanin produces black two hair pigment genes create two base colors chestnut fully red black fully black coat colors created additional genes modify two base colors common modifier creates point coloration red black hairs known bay classified base color well vast range coat colors created additional genes action upon one three base colors absence dna testing chestnut bay distinguished looking mane tail legs presence black points proposed allele darkens bay coat seal brown sooty gene linked forms

gets older hairs turn white eventually develop complete white fleabitten coat retains speckles horses original color grays sometimes confused certain roan dun white coat colors particular white horses actually grays fully white hair coat gray horse usually distinguishable dominant white cremello horse dark skin particularly noticeable around eyes muzzle flanks areas thin hair roan intermixed light dark hairs similar young gray horse unlike gray lighten white dun horses solidcolored hair coat also lighten age gray horses prone equine variations gray horse may exhibit lifetime include several different genetic allelic families produce colors lighter versions base colors caused dilution genes cream dilution incomplete dominant gene produces lightened partial dilute coat color one copy allele present fully dilute double dilute two copies double cream dilute phenotypes overlap regardless base coat color often distinguished visually sometimes creme allele combined unrelated dilution gene another family creates cremellolike coat coloration called pseudodouble dilute distinctions usually require dna testing verify alleles present mixtures dliution genes produce colors dunalino red dun also carries single cream gene thus pale gold coat white mane tail faint primitive markings patterns white hairs often pink skin varying fully white horse pinto patterns smaller white markings roan adds white hairs spread throughout coat patterns occur top color base color determines color colored hairs white patterns determine many white hairs present biologically white comes lack pigment cells many different genetic alleles create patterns group coat patterns caused leopard gene complex every horse leopard genetics exhibit hair coat spotting however even solid individuals exhibit

paint horse specific breed mostly pinto horses known quarter horse andor thoroughbred bloodlines regional terms certain pinto spotting patterns include blagdon uk pinto spotting produced large number genetic mechanisms dozens mapped identifiable dna testing variations pinto based observable color include terminology variations based observable shape white patterns include roaning adds white hairs colors unlike gray color steadily lighten horses lifetime though may minor color variation year year especially summer winter coats rabicano roanstyle effect caused yettobemapped genetic modifier

spotting pattern usually determined breed standards set registries white markings generally hypothesized minimal expression certain genes dominant white w allelic series horses brown eyes minor shade variations blue eyes linked splashed white spotting allele cream dilution may produce bluishgreen eye color champagne pearl genes also produce lightened eye colors blue green shades leopard complex

horses affect eye color coat exterior hoof wall color usually linked coat color horses dark grayish hoof wall unless white leg markings case palecolored hooves leopard complex gene create light dark striped hoof many chestnut horses brownish hooves somewhat lighter usual dark gray registries opened accept horses sometimes ponies mules almost breed type color either requirement registration
