fibrosing cardiomyopathy disease commonly caused heart failure great apes specially fibrosing cardiomyopathy attacks healthy heart comes bacterium virus makes muscles heart turn fibrous bands makes unable pump blood blood gorilla stressed food eats catecholamine harmful substance released heart muscle make creactive protein found blood plasma produced liver swell causing rheumatoid studies show causes heart disease differ greatly humans chimpanzees study scientists provided new data summarized existing reports subject also allow primitives limited data suggesting like chimpanzees respect general result heart disease represent similarity humans hominids rather inexplicably special difference finally preliminary evidence differences extracellular matrix glycosylation patterns human humanlike hearts proved provided may related understanding differences heart disease cause deaths yakex primate research center cardiac biopsies carefully examined includes animals males dying females looking animals serious animals males females almost pathological abnormalities death associated type fmi chimpanzees similar example shows chimpanzee goes heart muscle without hemiplegia heaven goes directly around blood vessels seen peoples hearts reasons death yerkes center also indicates myocardial fibrosis severe period men women autopsies fragmented imfcitation needed scientists begun study billions bacteria fungi microbes living stomach intestines humans affect health last decades eat determines microorganisms thrive composition intestinal flora great influence parts body example intestinal bacteria cause inflammation immune system bacteria secrete substances penetrate blood block arteries helps explain heart disease patients different microbes health conditions grains paradise plants grow swampy areas west africavine chocked swamps member ginger plant gorillas like eating contains powerful anti swollen compound grows meters trumpet shape reddishbrown seeds gorillas use plant make nests ground beds use night sleeping also use seeds treat coughs toothaches measles plant also provides comfort warmth weak cold bodies invention processed highcalorie cookies containing vitamins nutrients addition several fruits vegetables ultimately helped standardize diet gorillas animal biscuit diet begins prolong life looks healthier sometimes survive years researches found biscuit diet many shortcomings although gorillas genetically similar humans digestive systems different like horses like horse gorilla digestive organ processes food primarily long large intestine stomach means good breaking fiber good sugar grain zookeeper feed sweet potatoes commercially grown fruit eat didnt bring much energy themcitation needed different types cardiomyopathy include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy makes heart muscles enlarge thicken dilated cardiomyopathy happens ventricles enlarge weaken restrictive cardiomyopathy makes ventricles stiffen hypertrophic cardiomyopathy inherited one one generation another dilated cardiomyopathy results due heavy alcohol consumption use cocaine viral infections signs symptoms cardiomyopathy include shortness breath fatigue swelling legs dizziness lightheadedness fainting physical activities irregular heartbeats chest pain heavy meals unusual sounds associated gorillas inhabited forests central subsaharan africa whereby divided two species eastern gorillas western gorillas much closer humans dna reveals higher percentage fall kingdom mammalia human origin common ancestors gorillas considered single species three subspecies ie western lowland gorilla eastern lowland gorilla mountain gorilla species became one forest habitat shrank ended separating gorillas captive human started developing fibrosing cardiomyopathy due foods humans used give like biscuits diet much sugar made difficult digestion hindgut digesters processed food extralong large intestines instead stomachs lesser energy distribution bodies new diet lowered body fat cholesterol ended affecting bacteria living gorillas heart attack humans occurs due chest pain sweating even shortness breath results due coronary artery problem supplying blood heart muscle gorillas happens due diet ones captives used take humans suffer acute coronary heart attack end heart failure due gradual decrease blood supply arteries gorillas humans unusual form interstitial myocardial fibrosis whereby normal myocardium humans gorillas quite similar gorillas heart fibrosis distributed unorderly manner cardiac muscle seen humancitation needed many attempts prevent fibrosing attacking gorillas zookeepers came ideas could reduce mortality rate gorillas ie introduction national gorilla cardiac database used tracking cases disease gorillas captivity western lowland introduction tab determines populations gorillas also comparing ultrasound waves produce visual display heart healthy gorilla sick gorilla detect presence implantation advanced pacemaker gorilla disease pacemaker detect disease early stage also correcting breakdown hearts electrical circuit comes disease later restores heart pump properly heart failure considered common human gorillas could determined heart failure cardiac arrest point analysis taken accord human heart attack would considered occurred due coronary artery atherosclerosis happens arteries hardened due buildup plaque inside walls arteries gorillas considered occurred due bacteria muscles heart prevents heart pumping blood properly arteries fibrosing cardiomyopathy type heart disease affects family gorillas west africa captive humans due area live also type food eat grains paradise type plants grow swampy areas discovered favorite plant gorillas like eat plant contains powerful antiswollen compound attacks heart gorillas makes coronary arteries hearts poor functioning supply blood heart muscles disease attacks male gorillas years far exact treatment yet found measures put place order take control disease reduce mortality rate gorillas family httpsenwikipediaorgwikifibrosingcardiomyopathy
