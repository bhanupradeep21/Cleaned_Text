medullosales extinct order pteridospermous seed plants characterised large ovules circular crosssection vascularised nucellus complex pollenorgans stems rachides dissected stele frondlike nearest stillliving relatives medullosales small mediumsized trees largest specimens probably genus alethopteris whose fronds could metres trees perhaps metres tall especially moscovian times many medullosales rather smaller fronds metres long apparently growing dense mutually supporting kasimovian gzhelian times also nonarboreal forms smaller fronds eg odontopteris probably scrambling possibly climbing ovules different medullosalean species could vary maybe cm cm long latter largest known ovules produced nonangiosperm traditionally believed ovules borne directly fronds replacing one pinnules ultimate pinnae however strong possibility reconstruction based chance finds ovules preserved lying piece pinna rather organic attachment number cases coming light suggest seeds borne clusters relatively slender branching trusses ovules would produced top trunk among crown fronds seed megaspore surrounded two layers tissue vascularised nucellus usually threelayered integument

dolerotheca whittleseya aulacotheca unlike ovules good anatomical evidence borne fronds attached pollen produce strictly known prepollen germinated proximally thus intermediate structure pteridophytic spores gymnospermous pollen organs parispermacean species fossil genus potoniea produced spherical prepollen trilete mark medullosaleans produced large ovoid prepollen monolete mark assigned genus schopfipollenites medullosaleans unbranched upright stems produced crown fronds top widespread referred fossil genus medullosa found petrifactions anatomy preserved viewed transverse section appear several vascular segments passing along length stem superficially resembling polysteles seen tree ferns however detailed study vascular strands shown merge split along length stem fact represents single dissected stems increased size vascular segments also expanded adding secondary vascular segments stele embedded ground tissue contain canals ducts thought contained resinlike substance cortex surrounding stele also resinducts towards outside stem radially aligned bands sclerotic tissue numerous species used recognised appeared anatomically different medullosa stems many differences shown represent changes took place growth moreover shown similar types stem could bear variety different types distinctive type stem found late pennsylvanian preserved floras however referred medullosa

linopteris lacked major dichotomy although still thought constructed series overtopped characters used differentiate fossil genera used descending order significance group families based mainly
