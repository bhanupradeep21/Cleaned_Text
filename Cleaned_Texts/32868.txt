ronald lewis graham october july american mathematician credited american mathematical society one principal architects rapid development worldwide discrete mathematics recent president american mathematical society mathematical association america honors included leroy p steele prize lifetime achievement election national academy sciences graduate study university california berkeley graham worked many years bell labs later university california san diego important work scheduling theory computational geometry ramsey theory many topics mathematics named published six books papers nearly coauthors including many collaborative works wife fan chung paul erdős graham featured ripleys believe one worlds foremost mathematicians also accomplished trampolinist juggler served president international jugglers graham born taft california october father oil field worker later merchant marine despite grahams later interest gymnastics small grew moving frequently california georgia skipping several grades school moves never staying one school longer teenager moved florida thendivorced mother went finish high school instead age ford foundation scholarship university chicago learned gymnastics took mathematics three years scholarship expired moved university california berkeley officially student electrical engineering also studying number theory derrick henry winning title california state trampoline enlisted united states air force reached age left berkeley without degree stationed fairbanks alaska finally completed bachelors degree physics university alaska returning university california berkeley graduate study received phd mathematics dissertation supervised lehmer finite sums rational graduate student supported performing trampoline married nancy young undergraduate mathematics student berkeley two completing doctorate graham went work bell labs later director information sciences att labs new jersey conference colorado met prolific hungarian mathematician paul erdős became close friend frequent research collaborator graham chagrined beaten pingpong erdős already middleaged returned new jersey determined improve game eventually became bell labs champion state title graham later popularized concept erdős number measure distance erdős collaboration network many works erdős include two books open erdőss final posthumous graham divorced married bell labs colleague frequent coauthor fan bell labs graham also took position rutgers university university professor mathematical sciences served term president american mathematical society became chief scientist labs retired att years service moved university california san diego ucsd irwin joan jacobs endowed professor computer information ucsd also became chief scientist california institute telecommunications information president mathematical association graham died july aged la jolla graham made important contributions multiple areas mathematics theoretical computer science published papers quarter six books including concrete mathematics donald knuth oren erdős number project lists nearly doctoral advisor nine students one city university new york rutgers university bell labs seven uc san notable topics mathematics named graham include problem egyptian fractions theorem ramsey theory parameter words grahams number derived theorem grahams pebbling conjecture graph theory algorithm approximate scheduling graph drawing graham scan algorithm convex hulls also began study primefree sequences boolean pythagorean triples problem biggest little polygon square packing square graham one contributors publications g w peck pseudonymous mathematical collaboration named initials members graham grahams doctoral dissertation number theory egyptian problem whether every partition integers finitely many classes one classes finite subclass whose reciprocals sum one proof published ernie croot another grahams papers egyptian fractions published steve butler nearly years posthumously erdős last erdőss papers published making butler paper graham began study primefree sequences observing exist sequences numbers defined recurrence relation fibonacci numbers none sequence elements challenge constructing sequences later taken donald knuth grahams book erdős old new results combinatorial number theory provides collection open problems broad range subareas within number theorem ramsey theory published graham bruce rothschild applies ramsey theory combinatorial cubes combinatorics graham gave large number upper bound instance theorem known grahams number listed guinness book records largest number ever used mathematical although since surpassed even larger numbers graham offered monetary prize solving boolean pythagorean triples problem another problem ramsey theory prize claimed graham also published two books ramsey theorem graham published henry pollak two papers states edges n displaystyle n vertex complete graph partitioned complete bipartite subgraphs least n displaystyle subgraphs needed graham pollak provided simple proof using linear algebra despite combinatorial nature statement multiple publications alternative proofs since work known proofs require linear soon research quasirandom graphs began work andrew thomason graham published result chung r wilson called fundamental theorem quasirandom graphs stating many different definitions graphs grahams pebbling conjecture appearing paper concerns pebbling number cartesian products graphs remains grahams early work job shop introduced worstcase approximation ratio study approximation algorithms laid foundations later development competitive analysis online work later recognized important also theory bin area graham later worked algorithm graham published edward g coffman jr provides optimal algorithm twomachine scheduling guaranteed approximation algorithm larger numbers machines also applied layered graph survey article scheduling algorithms published graham coauthors introduced threesymbol notation classifying theoretical scheduling problems according system machines run characteristics tasks resources requirements synchronization noninterruption performance measure classification sometimes called graham notation grahams graham scan widely used practical algorithm convex hulls twodimensional point sets based sorting points inserting hull sorted graham published algorithm biggest little polygon problem asks polygon largest area given diameter surprisingly graham observed answer always regular grahams conjecture shape polygons finally proven another publication graham erdős observed packing unit squares larger square noninteger side lengths one use tilted squares leave uncovered area sublinear side length larger square unlike obvious packing axisaligned klaus roth bob vaughan proved uncovered area least proportional square root side length may sometimes needed proving tight bound uncovered area remains open nonparametric
