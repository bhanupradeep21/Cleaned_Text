tympanic membrane retraction describes condition part eardrum lies deeper within ear normal position eardrum comprises two parts pars tensa main part eardrum pars flaccida smaller part eardrum located pars tensa either parts may become retracted retracted segment eardrum often known retraction pocket terms atelectasis sometimes adhesive otitis media used describe retraction large area pars tensa tympanic membrane retraction fairly common observed one quarter population british school retraction eardrums less common retraction one ear common children cleft tympanic membrane retraction also occurs attempts made categorise extent tympanic membrane though validity classifications majority tympanic membrane retractions cause symptoms cause hearing loss restricting soundinduced vibrations eardrum permanent conductive hearing loss caused erosion ossicles hearing bones discharge ear often indicates retraction pocket developed cholesteatoma three factors must occur tympanic membrane become retracted gas pressure within middle ear less atmospheric pressure eardrum become sucked middle ear space may caused disrupted gas exchange middle ear mucosa inadequate opening eustachian tube combination factors people patulous eustachian tube may also cause negative middle ear pressure repeatedly sniffing try keep eustachian tube middle layer pars tensa strengthened fibers collagen protein layer may weaker posterosuperior quadrant top rear quarter eardrum heals perforation tympanostomy tubes grommets predispose retraction areas pars flaccida prone retraction contain stiffening layer collagen body new skin cells continually produced replace old skin cells dry slough growth new cells surface eardrum unusual new cells migrate surface move along ear canal even migration along ear canal blocked new cells continue grow surface eardrum becomes larger process proliferation migration result enlargement retraction pocket eardrum expands grows deeper ear majority tympanic membrane retractions remain stable long periods time may even resolve spontaneously eardrum becomes normal retractions able resolve even middle ear pressure normalizes retracted segment may become adherent structures within middle ear retractions continue progress grow deeply ear result erosion bone cholesteatoma formation asymptomatic deep pars tensa retractions tend remain stable adults however behaviour symptomatic pars tensa retractions significantly differ children adults likelihood ears children recover spontaneously simple clinical means identifying ears deteriorate accumulate keratin debris pars tensa retraction phenomenon influenced age children pars tensa retraction may remain unchanged pars flaccida deteriorates form middle ear narrow space eardrum retract short distance touches boney structures within middle ear ossicles may become adherent bones cases contact leads erosion bone well ossicular erosion bone ear canal eg scutum even bone cochlea promontory become eroded skin cells die form barrier dry protein called keratin layer keratin normally pushed ear migration skin cells along ear canal turned wax clearance keratin disrupted tympanic membrane retraction keratin accumulates within retraction pocket keratin becomes trapped deep inside ear cleaned known cholesteatoma growth bacteria trapped keratin causes smelly discharge ear spread cause serious infection various strategies may used manage tympanic membrane retraction aims preventing relieving hearing loss cholesteatoma formation retraction pockets may remain stable resolve spontaneously may appropriate observe period time considering active valsalva maneuver increases middle ear pressure push retracted eardrum middle ear adherent middle ear structures hearing may improve result however painful maneuver benefits typically temporary middle ear pressure also increased politzerization commercially available devices eg otovent ear popper ventilation tube also known tympanostomy tube grommet may placed eardrum equalize middle ear pressure although intervention may effective research yet shown whether provides better results simple weakness perforation eardrum may occur intended improve eustachian tube function adenoidectomy improve middle ear nasal steroid sprays reduce adenoid known whether treatments alter tympanic membrane retraction enlargement eustachian
