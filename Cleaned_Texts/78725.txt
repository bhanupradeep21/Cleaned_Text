dioicous males females insectpollinated species generally look similar one another plants provide rewards eg nectar encourage pollinators visit another similar flower completing pollination catasetum orchids one interesting exception rule male catasetum orchids violently attach pollinia euglossine bee pollinators bees avoid male flowers may visit female looks different various dioecious exceptions

female coloration displayed mimetic many arachnid groups exhibit sexual widely studied spiders orbweaving spider zygiella xnotata example adult females larger body size adult size dimorphism shows correlation sexual prominent spiders also found insects praying mantises size dimorphic wolf spider tigrosa helluo foodlimited females cannibalize therefore high risk low fitness males due precopulatory cannibalism led male selection larger females two reasons higher fecundity lower rates addition female fecundity positively correlated female body size large female body size selected

female feeding providing nuptial gift response sexual male body size selection due cannibalism spider species nephila pilipes prominently selected less dimorphic species spiders often selects larger male species maratus volans males known characteristic colorful fan attracts females rayfinned fish ancient diverse class widest degree sexual dimorphism animal class fairbairn notes females generally larger males males often larger species combat male paternal care sizes range dwarf males males times heavier needed cases males substantially larger females example lamprologus callipterus type cichlid fish fish males characterized times larger females males increased size believed advantageous males collect defend empty snail shells female males must larger powerful order collect largest shells females body size must remain small order breed must lay eggs inside empty shells grows large fit shells unable breed females small body size also likely beneficial chances finding unoccupied shell larger shells although preferred females often limited hence female limited growth size shell may actually change growth rate according shell size words males ability collect large shells depends size larger male larger shells able collect allows females larger brooding nest makes difference sizes sexes less substantial competition fish species also selects large size males aggressive competition males territory access larger shells large males win fights steal shells competitors another example dragonet males considerably larger females possess longer fins sexual dimorphism also occurs hermaphroditic fish species known sequential hermaphrodites fish reproductive histories often include sexchange female male strong connection growth sex individual mating system operates protogynous mating systems males dominate mating many females size plays significant role male reproductive males propensity larger females comparable age unclear whether size increase due growth

sex fish often seen fish change sex lack dominant male within social hierarchy females change sex often attain preserve initial size advantage early life either case females change sex males larger

including increase body depth hump height snout length females experience minor changes snout length noticeable difference huge increase gonad size accounts body sexual selection observed female ornamentation gobiusculus flavescens known twospotted traditional hypotheses suggest competition drives selection however selection ornamentation within species suggests showy female traits selected either competition male mate since carotenoidbased ornamentation suggests mate quality female twospotted guppies develop colorful orange bellies breeding season considered favorable males invest

sceloporus gadoviae undulates sexual dimorphism size also seen frog species like p bibronii male painted dragon lizards ctenophorus pictus brightly conspicuous breeding coloration male colour declines aging male coloration appears reflect innate antioxidation capacity protects oxidative dna male breeding coloration likely indicator females underlying level oxidative dna damage significant component aging potential sexual dimorphism birds manifested size plumage differences sexes sexual size dimorphism varies among taxa males typically larger though always case eg birds prey hummingbirds species flightless plumage dimorphism form ornamentation coloration also varies though males typically ornamented brightly colored differences attributed unequal reproductive contributions difference produces

causing reproductive success vary years environmental conditions migratory patterns behaviors also influence sexual dimorphisms aspect also stems back size dimorphism species shown larger males better coping difficulties migration thus successful reproducing reaching breeding viewing evolutionary standpoint many theories explanations come consideration result every migration breeding season expected results shift towards larger male population sexual selection sexual selection strong factor environmental selection also introduced environmental selection may support smaller chick size chicks born area allowed grow larger size even though normal conditions would able reach optimal size migration environment gives advantages disadvantages sort strength selection weakened environmental forces given greater morphological weight sexual dimorphism could also produce change timing migration leading differences mating success within bird dimorphism produces large variation sexes members sexes multiple evolutionary effects take place timing could even lead speciation phenomenon variation becomes strongly drastic favorable towards two different outcomes sexual dimorphism maintained counteracting pressures natural selection sexual selection example sexual dimorphism coloration increases vulnerability bird species predation european sparrowhawks presumably increased sexual dimorphism means males brighter conspicuous leading increased moreover production exaggerated ornaments males may come cost suppressed immune long reproductive benefits trait due sexual selection greater costs imposed natural selection trait propagate throughout population reproductive benefits arise form larger number offspring natural selection imposes costs form reduced survival means even trait causes males die earlier trait still beneficial long males trait produce offspring males lacking trait balance keeps dimorphism alive species ensures next generation successful males also display traits attractive females differences form reproductive roles often cause differences behavior previously stated males females often different roles reproduction courtship mating behavior males females regulated largely hormones throughout birds activational hormones occur puberty adulthood serve activate certain behaviors appropriate territoriality breeding organizational hormones occur critical period early development either hatching birds determine patterns behavior rest birds behavioral differences cause disproportionate sensitivities anthropogenic females whinchat

also male dimorphic traits due hormones like testosterone instead naturally occurring part development example addition strong hormonal influence phenotypic differences suggests genetic mechanism genetic basis sexually dimorphic traits may involve transcription factors cofactors rather regulatory sexual dimorphism may also influence differences parental investment times food scarcity example
