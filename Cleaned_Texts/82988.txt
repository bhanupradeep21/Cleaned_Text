effort heuristic mental rule thumb quality worth object determined perceived amount effort went producing object brief effort heuristic follows tendency judge objects took longer time produce higher effort invested object better deemed especially true situations value difficult assess evaluator lacks expertise appraisement item people use whatever information available effort thought generally reliable indicator example would comparison earned found someone finds inclined go spend whim part hardearned paycheck less likely squander away another way effort heuristic considered amount effort person put action depending goal little importance amount effort person willing put going experimental evidence supports notion people sometimes use effort put something estimate quality seminal study investigated phenomenon done kruger wirtz van boven altermatt conducted three experiments participants made judgments poem experiment paintings experiment medieval arms armor experiment experiment manipulated effort seemingly invested objects creation despite fact actual quality work remained anticipated manipulations supposed effort would influence perceived first experiment participants evaluated poem respect much enjoyed overall quality poem amount money poetry magazine would pay poem told experiment concerned way people evaluate poetry subjects randomly assigned one two condition groups study low effort high effort participants low effort condition told writer spent hours poem participants high effort condition told poet spent hours piece researchers combined liking quality measures one composite result found participants provided favorable evaluations poem thought took poet hours compose rather thought took hours also judged effortful poem worth money second experiment nonexperts selfidentified experts individually evaluated quality two paintings deborah kleven lines big abstract half participants told former took hours paint latter hours half told opposite rating painting separately participants compared two paintings directly results revealed participants preferred lines big abstract thought lines took longer paint opposite tended true thought big abstract took longer paint effort manipulation similar effect participants estimates much paintings worth participants thought lines took longer produce thought worth money big abstract whereas opposite tended true participants thought big abstract took longer paint data also indicated effect perceived effort perceived quality independent whether participants selfprofessed expertise domain selfidentified art experts appear rely effort less novices despite fact selfidentified experts presumably practiced evaluating art points generality intuitive appeal effort heuristic quality third final experiment researchers asked participants rate quality several images medieval arms armor presented computer screen rating final target piece armor half participants told took blacksmith hours complete half told took hours addition manipulating perceived effort invested artist researchers also varied ambiguity stimulus examine potential moderator use effort heuristic done altering resolution image half participants viewed highresolution image piece half viewed lowresolution image experiment produced similar results first two participants provided higher ratings piece thought took blacksmith longer produce effort invested object better assumed influence effort judgment also bigger highambiguity condition lowambiguity condition expected quality armor ambiguous lowresolution condition participants condition less objective information upon make judgment quality thus likely rely perceived effort invested blacksmith evaluating human behavior like animals often driven rewards directed energetic cost action takes effort attain rewards people accordingly weigh value rewards amount effort required attain early age children learn good performance due high effort valued adults teachers likely reward work experience internalize effort valuable commodity research directly examining testing effort heuristic scarce however research areas incorporated construct way manipulated effects however key distinction study done kruger et al research role effort judgment former focused othergenerated effort rather selfgenerated effort half century ago social psychologist leon festinger developed theory cognitive dissonance asserts inconsistencies among persons beliefs attitudes opinions produce psychological discomfort leading people rationalize behavior change one concept stemmed dissonance theory effort justification subjective value outcome directly related effort went obtaining people suffer work hard make sacrifices attempt convince worthwhile people tend put value goals items required considerable effort probably cognitive dissonance would arise great effort made achieve something subsequently evaluated negatively aronson mills conducted college students underwent severe mild initiation join discussion group subjects severe initiation group required read sexually explicit passage loud front experimenter whereas mild initiation group read less embarrassing passage subjects asked evaluate discussion group severe initiation condition rated higher mild initiation group aronson mills interpreted result terms cognitive dissonance according aronson mills resolve dissonance produced reading embarrassing passage subjects severe initiation group gave value discussion group subjects mild initiation difficult task greater value given sources reinforcement followed task completion daryl bem proposed alternative cognitive dissonance theory explaining attitudes shaped selfperception theory suggests people infer attitudes opinions internal states partly observing behavior circumstances behavior pattern thought unfolds people engaged normal efforts better understand behaviors bem suggested individuals analyze behavior much outside observer might result observations people make judgments motivated originally believed findings explained cognitive dissonance really due selfperception however studies shown selfperception primarily work subjects welldefined attitudes regarding issue research shown amount energy put towards achievement goal may play role development change individuals attitude towards evaluating goal one motivated place value goal required greater effort axsom cooper suggested objective way goal obtained initially attractive individual may later look past behavior determine attitude towards goal much effort spent attainment goal come seen worthwhile therefore resembles need justify ones efforts accordance cognitive dissonance theory evidence supporting factors may play one study proposed experienced goal value consumers subsequent motivation vary function whether pursuit goal perceived ones autonomous found consumers perceive goal pursue adopted autonomous choice initial effort investment experienced reflecting value goal therefore greater effort increased value goal well consumers subsequent conversely consumers perceive goal imposed experience psychological reactance proportional amount effort expend pursuing goal thus devalue goal invest effort pursuit show lower subsequent study kruger et al demonstrated evaluating item people tendency judge objects took longer time produce higher value knowledge companies manipulate manner product viewed make products appear desirable consumers effort usually required get best outcomes people looking best outcomes presume effort must imply best possible outcome bri√±ol petty tormala suggested impact effort evaluation depends meaning people overtly directed assign example people told unintelligent people like ease outcomes associated ease
