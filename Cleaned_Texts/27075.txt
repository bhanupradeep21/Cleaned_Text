diabetic nephropathy also known diabetic kidney chronic loss kidney function occurring diabetes mellitus diabetic nephropathy leading causes chronic kidney disease ckd endstage renal disease esrd globally triad protein leaking urine proteinuria albuminuria rising blood pressure hypertension falling renal function common many forms ckd protein loss urine due damage glomeruli may become massive cause low serum albumin resulting generalized body swelling edema called nephrotic syndrome likewise estimated glomerular filtration rate egfr may progressively fall normal less point patient said endstage renal usually slowly progressive pathophysiologic abnormalities diabetic nephropathy usually begin longstanding poorly controlled blood glucose levels followed multiple changes filtration units kidneys nephrons normally million nephrons adult initially constriction efferent arterioles dilation afferent arterioles resulting glomerular capillary hypertension hyperfiltration particularly nephrons become obsolescent adaption hyperfiltration paradoxically causes shear stress related damage delicate glomerular capillaries proteinuria rising blood pressure vicious circle additional nephron damage decline overall renal concurrently changes within glomerulus include thickening basement membrane widening slit membranes podocytes increase number mesangial cells increase mesangial matrix matrix invades glomerular capillaries produces deposits called kimmelstielwilson nodules mesangial cells matrix progressively expand consume entire glomerulus shutting status diabetic
