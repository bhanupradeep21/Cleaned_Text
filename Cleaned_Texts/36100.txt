liver disease hepatic disease many diseases longlasting termed chronic liver although diseases differ detail liver diseases often features common ground glass hepatocytes primary biliary cirrhosis syndrome micrograph nonalcoholic fatty liver disease hundred different liver diseases common signs symptoms liver disease following liver diseases develop several mechanisms one general mechanism increased dna damage shared major liver diseases including infection hepatitis b virus hepatitis c virus heavy alcohol consumption viral infection hepatitis b virus hepatitis c virus causes increase reactive oxygen species increase intracellular reactive oxygen species chronic hepatitis b virus infection following hepatitis c virus increase reactive oxygen species causes types dna oxidative dna damage also causes epigenetic alterations sites dna epigenetic alterations mutations affect cellular machinery may cause cell replicate higher rate result cell avoiding apoptosis thus contribute liver time accumulating epigenetic mutational changes eventually cause hepatocellular carcinoma epigenetic alterations appear even larger role carcinogenesis mutations one gene mutated liver cancers genes hypermethylated promoters repressing gene expression liver alcohol consumption excess causes buildup acetaldehyde acetaldehyde free radicals generated metabolizing alcohol induce dna damage oxidative addition activation neutrophils alcoholic liver disease contributes pathogenesis hepatocellular damage releasing reactive oxygen species damage level oxidative stress acetaldehydeinduced dna adducts due alcohol consumption appear sufficient cause increased however reviewed nishida et alcohol exposure causing oxidative dna damage repairable result epigenetic alterations sites dna repair alcoholinduced epigenetic alterations gene expression appear lead liver injury ultimately obesity associated higher risk primary liver shown mice obese mice prone liver cancer likely due two factors obese mice increased proinflammatory cytokines obese mice also higher levels deoxycholic acid product bile acid alteration certain gut microbes microbes increased obesity excess deoxycholic acid causes dna damage inflammation liver turn lead liver several liver diseases due viral infection viral hepatitides hepatitis b virus hepatitis c virus vertically transmitted birth via contact infected according nice publication hepatitis b infections newborns become occult cases hepatitis b virus present hepatitis b virus dna testing hbsag high consumption alcohol lead several forms liver disease including alcoholic hepatitis alcoholic fatty liver disease cirrhosis liver earlier stages alcoholic liver disease fat builds livers cells due increased creation triglycerides fatty acids decreased ability break fatty progression disease lead liver inflammation excess fat liver scarring liver often occurs body attempts heal extensive scarring lead development cirrhosis advanced stages approximately individuals cirrhosis develop form liver cancer known hepatocellular according tilg et al gut microbiome could well effect involved pathophysiology various types liver disease individual may insight exact causes mechanisms mediating pathophysiology liver quickly progressing due introduction new technological approaches like single cell sequencing kinome profiling particulate matter

bloodstream combines immune cells stimulates innate immune responses proinflammatory cytokines released cause disease number liver function tests available test proper function liver test presence enzymes blood normally abundant liver tissue metabolites products serum proteins serum albumin serum globulin alanine transaminase aspartate transaminase prothrombin time partial thromboplastin imaging tests transient elastography ultrasound magnetic resonance imaging used show liver tissue bile ducts liver biopsy performed examine liver tissue distinguish various conditions tests elastography may reduce need biopsy liver disease prothrombin time longer addition amounts coagulation factors anticoagulation factors reduced diseased liver productively synthesize nonetheless two exceptions falling tendency coagulation factor viii von willebrand factor platelet adhesive inversely rise setting hepatic insufficiency thanks drop hepatic clearance compensatory productions sites fibrinolysis generally proceeds faster acute liver failure advanced stage liver disease unlike chronic liver disease concentration fibrinogen remains previously undiagnosed liver disease may become evident first autopsycitation needed following gross pathology images diffuse cirrhosis macronodular cirrhosis nutmeg texture congestive hepatopathy antiviral medications available treat infections
