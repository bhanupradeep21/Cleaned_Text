cognitive specialization suggests certain behaviors often domain social communication passed offspring refined maximally beneficial process natural selection specializations serve adaptive purpose organism allowing organism better suited habitat time specializations often become essential species continued survival cognitive specialization humans thought underlie acquisition development evolution language theory mind specific social skills trust reciprocity specializations considered critical survival species even though successful individuals lack certain specializations including diagnosed autism spectrum disorder lack language cognitive specialization also believed underlie adaptive behaviors selfawareness navigation problem solving skills several animal species chimpanzees bottlenose dolphins first studied adaptive mechanism specific cognitive specialization since evolved encompass many behaviors social realm organisms evolved millions years become welladapted habitats

great apes addition humans broad abilities supporting positive social interaction stone et al put forth evidence specific specializations including cheater detection precautionary reasoning appear

standard darwinian evolutionary principles must explained using different according nowak sigmund language essential human life know without ability verbally communicate members social group would reciprocity returning favors way cooperate one another greater argued unique aspects human language evolved unexpectedly beneficial reasons besides simply asking help sharing information world gossip
