wellpreserved articulated skeleton considered one best herrerasaurid skeletons ever discovered fossilized close association rhynchosaur cynodont remains discovery superb specimen shed light onto

cabreira palaeontologist found three teeth premaxilla contrast herrerasaurus possessed four contact premaxilla maxilla encompassed two fenestrae holes subnarial fenestra situated low snout additional smaller fenestra positioned subnarial fenestra common herrerasaurids theropods additional fenestra unique gnathovorax like archosaurs small basin known antorbital fossa present front antorbital fenestra many early saurischians hole called promaxillary fenestra situated antorbital fossa hole absent gnathovorax hand gnathovorax possess characteristic thin ridge edging additional emargination within antorbital fossa small depression present ridge ridge forming border antorbital fossa lower branch lacrimal slender extends middle lower edge orbit eye socket similar daemonosaurus different herrerasaurus aspects skull thick squamosal expanded front branch jugal shape infratemporal fenestra lack palatal teeth similar herrerasaurids among early supraoccipital bone top braincase trapezoidal seen behind unlike herrerasauruss triangular supraoccipital bladelike crest top occipital condyle also thicker basioccipital vshaped rather ushaped contact parabasisphenoid paroccipital processes larger gnathovorax compared herrerasaurus otherwise braincase similar two taxa dentary lacks sauropodomorph qualities instead likely possessed sliding joint chin similar herrerasaurids although preservation good enough fully confirm premaxillary maxillary dentary teeth thin curved bladelike serrations distal rear edge teeth maxillary teeth also serrations mesial front neck short keels along lower edge vertebrae like herrerasaurids long transverse processes like sanjuansaurus specifically dorsal vertebrae similar herrerasaurids though tips neural spines slightly expanded herrerasaurids nondinosaur reptiles two vertebrae form sacrum however gnathovorax also last dorsal vertebra encompassed ilium upper hip plate although transverse processes long enough contact ilium therefore qualify sacral vertebra tail vertebrae similar herrerasaurus low elongated zygapophyses upwardspointing neural spines transverse processes semicircular cross gnathovorax herrerasaurid combining features scapula posterior curvature expanded tip fusion coracoid rest forearm similar herrerasaurus strongly developed elbow area long hand ilium short although pointed front tip contrast rounded front edge herrerasaurids gnathovorax herrerasaurid pubis sinuous front view projects straight side view pubis also possesses large pubic boot smooth lower edge similar herrerasaurids although lacks beveled pubic boot staurikosaurus unlike herrerasaurids like lagerpetids ischium hole known obturator foramen base femoral head simple herrerasaurids small craniomedial tuber front inner bump caudomedial tuber rear inner bump otherwise femur possesses muscle attachment sites typical basal dinosaurs tibia length femur unlike staurikosaurus longer tibia rest lower leg similar herrerasaurus foot three phalanges toe bone fifth toe herrerasaurus aureliano colleagues performed mircocomputed tomography scan postcranial skeletons earliest saurischian dinosaurs lived late carnian including gnathovorax

large floccular fossa lobe ffl cerebellum portion brain generally universally considered useful motor control eye head neck features mean paleontologists consider large ffl indicative active predatory lifestyle explaining reduced later sauropodomorphs theropods soft tissue data provided gnathovorax congruent evidence carnivory herrerasaurids structure teeth claws tooth proportions herrerasaurids basal carnivorous sauropodomorphs overlap slightly theropods according morphological variation analysis herrerasaurids sauropodomorphs overlap inferred carnian stage triassic herrerasaurids occupied large predatory niches small basal sauropodomorphs occupied small carnivorous omnivorous niches extinction herrerasaurids carnivorous sauropodomorphs norian theropods became dominant predatory
