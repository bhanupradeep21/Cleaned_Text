trabecular edema also known bone marrow edema bme traditional term describing interstitial fluid accumulation trabecular bone marrow term first used referring changes bone marrow due bone marrow edema later renamed bone marrow lesion bml later studies show increased fluid content trabecular bone likely caused inflammatory responses eg increased vascularization lymphocyte infiltration instead fluid influx ie hence narrows condition damage articular surface trabecular despite terms bme bml still used interchangeably condition normally affects musculoskeletal system commonly manifests lower extremities including limited feet ankle joints knee joints hip common signs symptoms include pain joint swelling limited joint bme separated two types based causes primary bme secondary bme primary bme also called spontaneous bme bone marrow edema syndrome bmes means bone marrow edema without obvious causes secondary bme meanwhile refers bone marrow edema caused another usually diagnosed magnetic resonance imaging mri supplemented ultrasound however bme detected xray computerized tomography ct scans helpful differential minor cases usually treated proper resting taking nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids steroid therapy even surgery may needed serious preexisting conditions like arthritis bone cancer induce stress onto bones leading greater risk bme within patients suffering studies also list high bone density risk factor local bone marrow age earlier immunosuppressive preexisting physical trauma risk factors bone marrow prevention bone marrow edema difficult due vast variety causes detecting bone marrow edema predict subsequent progression bone need replace common symptoms bme include joint effusion joint pain warmth related joint patients usually severe pain bones joints often leads limitations functionality harm quality primary bone marrow edema patients initial painful symptoms usually appear first month followed peak pain level two months transient increase interstitial fluid leads increased intraosseous pressure aggravated neurovascular symptoms typically fade months phase maximum pain may due bone remodelling abilities new bone formation vascular reconstruction steps secondary bone marrow edema patients repeated traumatic stress may disrupt trabecular marrow structure hence interstitial fluid leakage haemorrhage inside marrow spaces also heightened blood flow congested vascular drainage bone marrow may cause increased fluid content leads increase intraosseous pressure well decreased disturbs neurovascular bundles result pain swelling local cytokine production mediates inflammatory response thus worsens bone marrow edema similar histological characteristics types edema pulmonary edema commonly caused inflammation vascularization resulting displacement bone marrow originally rich adipocytes hydrophilic material said material may immune cells particularly b lymphocytes however exact mechanism causes bone marrow edema still unknown known presence bone marrow edema usually associated progression various diseases different pathophysiology mechanisms established based cause bone marrow edema example cause bone marrow edema rheumatoid arthritis edema attributed penetration sites caused resorption mineralized cortical bone beneath articular penetration sites allow entry inflammatory infiltrates could possibly lymphocytic aggregates invaded synovial tissue heavily vascularized contributing high water content bone marrow causes renal transplantation impairment microcirculation could result increase intraosseous increased hydrostatic pressure causes fluid leakage capillaries bone marrow edema direct result common characteristic among bone marrow edema patients pain experienced due aggravation neurovascular bundle increased intraosseous crucial element physician diagnose bme ability differentiate whether patient suffers primary secondary bone marrow edema primary bone marrow edema could indicate stage progression unfortunately interdisciplinary guidelines management algorithms regarding bme currently underdeveloped resulting repetitive checking delayed diagnosis treatment primary bone marrow edema also referred spontaneous bone marrow edema bone marrow edema syndrome bmes category bme particular cause selflimiting nature meaning symptoms usually resolve within three nine months onset without pathological theories proposing possible etiologies like vascular anomalies thromboembolism yet secondary bone marrow edema caused preexisting conditions may interdisciplinary hence category bme commonly found mris original intention diagnose particular condition different causes secondary bone marrow edema listed trauma events cause frequent microfractures instance transient regional osteoporosis bone bruises bone marrow lesions start one skeletal region spontaneously appear another skeletal region cause associated active osteoporotic changes low bone mineral density allows microfractures occur affected tendinitis strong association bone marrow edema study reported around onethird tendinitis patients bone marrow edema even cases revealed uptake isotope osteoarthritis another disease strong association bone marrow edema due mechanical loading well stress subchondral exist three types inflammatory lesions seropositive inflammatory arthropathy seronegative arthritis enthesitis bone marrow lesions tend present inflammatory arthropathy due increased often present sites arthritis enthesitis avascular necrosis bone directly related bone marrow lesions severity bone marrow lesions correlated intensity avascular bacterial infections bone marrow lesion development closely related infection directly leads example infections foot diabetic patients spread bone associated bone marrow hormonal imbalances severe hyperthyroidism hyperparathyroidism lead impairment bone metabolism could cause bone marrow changes connective tissue deposition uric acid composition gout could cause bone marrow damage could done bone marrow surgery radiotherapy leading inflammation hence bone marrow edema lesions patients undergone hormone therapy also susceptible bone marrow edema due insufficient bone metabolism high bone osteonecrosis risk may also increased common immunosuppressants like cyclosporine tacrolimus due induced vasoconstriction drugs sirolimus may potentiate effect similar action influencing lipid bone marrow edema usually caused associated preexisting conditions numerous epidemiological studies patients bone marrow edema found certain patterns characteristics among participants example certain medical conditions osteoporosis substantial risk factors developing bone marrow several common risk factors listed follows diagnosis trabecular edema primarily done via magnetic resonance imaging mri presence edema within bone marrow yields visible signal mri due displacement normally fatty tissue within marrow interstitial fluid higher water content change composition reflected mri due differences healthy bone rich fat lower water content therefore appears bright signals images dark conversely regions trabecular edema lower fat higher water content hence comparatively lower intensity normal bone tissues image higher intensity less sensitive compared mri scans ultrasound scans able detect abnormalities like joint effusion capsular thickening common bme computed tomography ct scans directly diagnose bone marrow edema sometimes used supplement mri scans differential diagnosis due ability show lesions fractures trabecular subchondral chondral structures aids physicians understand underlying bone pathologies leading observed edema definition accumulation excess fluid within body tissue one method treating edema draining said excess fluid core decompression otherwise often used treat avascular necrosis surgical procedure involves drilling hole dead bone tissue leading reduction pressure within bone increase blood flow thus excess fluid drained edema combination core decompression injection hydroxyapatite cement tissue affected bone marrow edema reported significantly reduce pain another goal treating trabecular edema manage symptoms pain nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs iloprost medication dilates arterial vascular beds proven aid treating bone marrow lesions administered intravenous manner resulting reduction pain restoration functionality affected yet another method treating bone marrow edema extracorporeal shock wave therapy eswt process involving reinjury cells via acoustic shock waves promote regeneration blood vessels bone treatment proven halve size areas affected edema six months recent evidence found associations vitamin status bone marrow edema syndrome pathophysiological association found vitamin status denotes osteopenia bone marrow edema syndrome association yet found causative vitamin c vitamin deficiency scurvy patients causative factor current literature reports acute subacute vitamin c deficiency future research advanced study designs randomized clinical trials needed evaluate therapy means vitamin hand another recent literature review performed studies published investigating efficacy various conservative treatments bmes although comparison studies highly reliable manner difficult due lack standardisation
