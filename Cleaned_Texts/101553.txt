occupational lung diseases comprise broad group diseases including occupational asthma industrial bronchitis chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd bronchiolitis obliterans inhalation injury interstitial lung diseases pneumoconiosis hypersensitivity pneumonitis lung fibrosis infections lung cancer caused directly due immunological response exposure variety dusts chemicals proteins organisms occupational cases interstitial lung disease may misdiagnosed copd idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis myriad diseases leading delay identification causative asthma respiratory disease begin worsen due exposure work characterized episodic narrowing respiratory tract occupational asthma variety causes including sensitization specific substance causing allergic response reaction irritant inhaled workplace exposure various substances also worsen preexisting asthma people work isocyanate manufacturing use latex gloves work indoor office environment higher risk occupational asthma average us worker approximately million people us occupational bronchiolitis obliterans also known constrictive bronchiolitis obliterative bronchiolitis respiratory disease caused injury smallest airways called bronchioles reported occur exposure inhaled toxins gases including sulfur mustard gas nitrogen oxides diacetyl used many food beverage flavorings fly ash chronic obstructive pulmonary disease respiratory disease encompass chronic bronchitis andor emphysema cases copd united states attributed occupational exposure including exposure silica coal dust people work mining construction manufacturing specifically textiles rubber plastic leather building utilities higher risk copd average us hypersensitivity pneumonitis hp also called allergic alveolitis bagpipe lung extrinsic allergic alveolitis eaa inflammation alveoli within lung caused hypersensitivity inhaled organic numerous categories ionizing radiation chemicals mixtures occupational exposures metals dust fibers linked occurrence lung mesothelioma cancer mesothelium part pleura lining lungs mesothelioma caused exposure pneumoconiosis occupational lung diseases caused due accumulation dust lungs bodys reaction presence common pneumoconiosis silicosis coal workers pneumoconiosis cwp asbestosis examples include minerals kaolin talc mica beryllium lung disease hard metal disease silicon carbide inhaling smoke byproducts combustion cause pulmonary injury third burn victims admitted hospital affected pulmonary injury inhaling smoke fatality inhalation injuries higher burn injuries mortality exceeds burn victims severe burn inhalation injury tissue oxygenation significantly affected thermal injury upper airways lower airways lung parenchyma occurs poor tissue oxygenation lifethreatening conditions results inhaling carbon monoxide cyanide gas mixtures devoid oxygen imbalance alveolar ventilation blood supply carbon monoxide colorless odorless gas interfere impede respiration oxygens tendency bind hemoglobin times less carbon monoxide severely reducing quantity circulating oxygen limiting tissue oxygenation carbon monoxide poisoning exposure deliberate suicidal accidental come automobile exhaust pipes inhaling smoke fire accident poorly vented gas heaters generators appliancescitation needed cyanide inhaled lungs gaseous form hydrogen cyanide cyanide also diffused skin ingested rapid infusion highdose cyanide cause cyanide poisoning produced nitroprusside broken constituents inhibits cells properly utilizing oxygen disrupting cytochrome oxidase damaging brain cyanide highly toxic chemical often used industries laboratories finger nail glue remover products contain acetonitrile metabolic break produces cyanide plants pits apricots cyanide found glycosides synthesize cyanide
