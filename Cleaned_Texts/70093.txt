number studies done infants knowledge numbers research confirms infants fact profound innate sense number abstract finite ways infants young hours accurately match images certain number objects sounds contain number ra ra ra ra number objects sounds abstract visibly see infants young hours abstract numerical sense well concrete numerical sense shown recognition image corresponding number similarly infants around age months also match images random although children young hours match number sounds number objects certain ratios used sounds objects objects around infants paid attention corresponding image thus showing recognition however ratios used infants showed recognition correct corresponding tells us although infants recognize corresponding numbers sounds objects two images objects must visibly different one must much larger number objects much smaller number although stark difference choices infants recognize correct matching set numbers vs seems prove infants innate numerical sense may numerical sense older children around age three half years children lose numerical sense whereas children younger three recognize four pebbles spread line less six pebbles scrunched together line children around age three half mysteriously lose researchers believe children around age begin rely heavily physical properties world objects within longer equals although
