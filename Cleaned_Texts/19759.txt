ocular albinism type common type ocular albinism prevalence rate inheritable classical mendelian type xlinked recessive disorder wherein retinal pigment epithelium lacks pigment hair skin appear since usually xlinked disorder occurs mostly males females carriers unless missense nonsense mutations insertions deletions identified mutations linked defective glycosylation thus improper intracellular eponyms name syndrome ophthalmologists edward nettleship harold francis falls recognized many different symptoms reduced visual acuity accompanied involuntary movements eye termed nystagmus astigmatism condition wherein occurs significant refractive error moreover ocular albino eyes become crossed condition called lazy eyes strabismus since little pigment present iris becomes translucent reflects light back appears green violet however important part eye fovea responsible acute vision develop properly probably indicating role melanin development stages eye affected individuals may also develop photophobiaphotodysphoria symptoms due lack pigmentation retina moreover ocular albino eye nerves back eye brain may follow usual pattern routing ocular albino eye nerves cross back eye opposite side brain instead going sides brain normal ocular albino eye appears blueish pink color pigmentation unlike normal eye carrier women regions hypo hyperpigmentation due xinactivation partial iris transillumination show symptoms exhibited affected human gene identified positional cloning gene mapped later mouse homolog human gene also identified cloned codes amino acid long protein three potential glycosylation sites transcript found expressing well retinal pigment epithelium skin much lesser extent brain adrenal mutations well characterized studied using various techniques like southern blot analyses singlestrand conformation polymorphism sequence mutations reported occurring nterminus transmembrane regions rarely much conserved cytoplasmic cterminus populations belonging different ethnic groups extensively analyzed database created recording details mutations related total missense nonsense frameshift splicing mutations reported till addition mutations also occur several deletions one many exons gene especially exon deletions presumed unequal crossingover due presence flanking alu regions cases entire gene deleted along contiguous genes many different polymorphisms also detected mainly intron tissuespecific control transcription long ebox region bound mitf shown regulate expression many melanosomal genes like tyr ebox motif catgtg vetrini et al used adenoviral vectors study tissuespecificity transcription mitf observed regulation conserved human term albinism l albus means white refers heterogeneous group congenital disorders melanin pigment biogenesis pigmentation process maybe affected one many ways due mutations abnormal pigmentation maybe level embryogenesis regions melanocytes fail populate melanin biosynthetic pathway may also affected due mutations sometimes one many genes responsible biogenesis organelles may albinism may manifest oculocutaneous oca ocular oa occur least ten different types oca four types oca refers group autosomal recessive disorders melanin reduced even absent leading pale skin increased risk skin cancer caused due mutations tyrosinase gene affecting catalytic synthetic condition tyr gene mutated p polypeptide mutational defects protein leads ocular albinism results defects melanin system may arise either defects receptor mutations either tyr gene p human gene product initially identified protein formed disease due defect receptor receptor shown similar class c g protein coupled receptors gpcr receptor characteristic gpcr transmembrane helices cytoplasmic loops extracellular loops extracellular n terminus cytoplasmic cterminus recently ligand activating receptor recent computational work provided insight threedimensional structure protein dynamic interactions known shen et al created fusion proteins melanosomal localization confirmed immunoelectron microscopy techniques alike localization patterns wild type mutated compared wild type localized late endosomal lysosomal compartments supported data samaraweera et al colocalizes marker late endosomal compartment hence might traffick compartment addition retina melanoma protein product also detected human pigment cells like melanosomal membrane suggests might involved melanosome biogenesis coimmunoprecipitation studies gβ gαi melanocyte extracts revealed specific interaction study also shown interact specifically moreover since organellar gpcr may represent unidentified pathway melanosome recently believed probable ligand might within melanosomal lumen maybe one components melanogenic pathway since closely related melanosome proved studies samaraweera et al revealed endolysosomal schiaffino et al already proved integral membrane newton et al shown three probable glycosylation furthermore found stimulated αmelanocortin stimulating hormone inhibited agouti signal fact responds melanin modifiers indicates probable role melanogenesis like melanosomal proteins tyr processing also occurs endogenous protein expressed normal human melanocytes detected protein recently orphan receptor deorphaned studies showed ldopa specific ligand ldopa byproduct melanin biosynthetic pathway melanin synthesis ldopa released retina retinal pigment epithelium necessary specific stages retinal development activation receptor ldopa leads secretion neurotropic factor retinal pigment epithelium helps normal retinal mutants classified two major groups based glycosylation localization patterns group consisted normally glycosylated group ii represented aberrantly glycosylated indistinguishable wild however studies revealed mutations protein retained er assumed major cause also revealed protein levels decreased drastically probably due misfolding protein er mutations reported second third cytoplasmic loops regions known critical gpcr downstream signaling believed affect transduction signals via g though exact role yet confirmed many studies give clues probable roles gene product might involved vesicular trafficking sorting also believed involved redistribution receptors thus suggesting important literature shows plays major role final stages growth maturation melanosomes conclusion based fact intermediates melanosomemelanosome fusion number melanosomes decreases maturation cell initial stages development number genes drosophila like hook gene alter ocular pigment granules shown affect lysosomal moreover found normal conditions melanosomal proteins traffic normally late endosomes absence continue accumulate mature melanosomes may mean acts stop signal melanosomal microscopic examination retinal pigment epithelium skin pigment cells melanocytes people affected ocular albinism type reveal presence characteristic macromelanosomes even though skin appears studies knockout mice reveal giant melanosomes appear due abnormal growth single melanosome due aggregation fusion many melanosomes melanin macroglobules probably formed due failure melanosomes separate ergolgi system accumulation enzymes secretory proteins leading increase organelle size however incerti et al contradict date treatment ocular albinism probably little known receptor function role pathophysiology condition though surgery strabismus sometimes helpful seem sure remedy cause ocular albinism well however recent discovery upstream ligand ldopa discovery possible downstream g alpha partner pathway becoming clearer future research looks touloukian et al characterized immunologically melanomamelanocyte differentiation flow cytometry data suggests cells indicates peptide processed presented surface melanoma cells recognized antigenspecific cells moreover recognition cells induces cytokine production cells means potential target melanoma vaccinescitation needed
