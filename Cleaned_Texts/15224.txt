mating call auditory signal used animals attract mates occur males females literature abundantly favored toward researching mating calls females addition mating calls often subject mate choice preferences one gender certain type mating call drive sexual selection species result sympatric speciation animals two species diverge living environment many different mechanisms produce mating calls broadly categorized vocalizations mechanical calls vocalizations considered sounds produced larynx often seen species birds mammals amphibians insects mechanical calls refer type sound animal produces using unique body parts andor tools communication potential mates examples include crickets vibrate wings birds flap feathers frogs use air sac instead lungs use vocalizations widespread avian species often used attract mates different aspects features bird song structure amplitude frequency evolved result sexual large song repertoires preferred females many avian one hypothesis song repertoire positively correlated size brains song control nucleus hvc large hvc would indicate developmental success song sparrows males large repertoires larger hvcs better body condition lower heterophiltolymphocyte ratios indicating better immune health supports idea song sparrows large song repertoires better lifetime fitness song repertoires honest indicators males quality possible explanations adaptation include direct benefits female superior parental care territory defense indirect benefits good genes japanese bush warbler songs island populations acoustically simple structure compared mainland song complexity correlated higher levels sexual selection mainland populations showing complex song structure advantageous environment high levels sexual selection another example purplecrowned fairywrens larger males species sing advertising songs lower frequency smaller rival males since body size characteristic good health lower frequency calls form honest signaling negative correlation body size call frequency supported across multiple species within rock sparrow song frequency positively associated reproductive success slower song rate associated age preferred females reproductive status individual communicated higher maximum frequency also positive correlation age extrapair copulation bird calls also known continue pair formation several socially monogamous bird species one experimental population zebra finches increased singing activity male increase positively correlated partners reproductive investment female finches bred cages two subsequent males differed varying amounts song output females produced larger eggs orange yolks paired male high song output suggests relative amount song production paired zebra finch males might function stimulate partner rather attract extrapair breeding season mammals call opposite sex male koalas bigger let different sound smaller koalas bigger males routinely sought called sires females choose sires indirect benefits offspring could inherit like larger nonsires females vary body mass reject male screaming hitting malemale competition rarely exhibited acoustic signaling type call used significant distance encoding organisms location condition sacwinged bats display acoustic signaling often interpreted songs females hear songs named whistle call onto males breed screech action termed calling red deer spotted hyenas along mammals also perform acoustic frogs use air sac located mouth produce mating calls air lungs channels air sac inflate air sac resonates produce mating call larynx larger developed males causes call louder túngara frog males use whining call followed seven clucks males whinecluck call successful attracting females males whose call whine alone ability produce clucks due specialized fibrous mass attached frogs vocal folds creating unusual vocalization similar twovoiced songs found common toad sexual competition driven large part males often physically displaced males backs female order gain access mating female larger males successful takeovers higher reproductive success however vocalizations toads provide reliable signal body size thus fighting ability allowing contests possession females settled without risk mexican burrowing toad males produce two types advertisement calls attracting females mating preadvertisement advertisement calls different tonality purpose advertisement call single tone upward tone duration seconds preadvertisement call single short sound without modulation higher frequency advertisement signals provide reliable signals females strength ability males frog species bibrons toadlet males increase frequency calls presence members species mating calls insects usually associated mechanical mating calls crickets several species insects use vocalizations attract mates asian corn borer males emit clicking sounds mimic echolocation bats prey moths take advantage females freezing response mate female japanese lichen moth however female able distinguish sounds made males made bats predators result males use ultrasonic clicking conventional mating signal compared deceptive courtship song used asian corn mating calls also take form mechanical processes animals unable vocalize call may use body attract mates field cricket gryllus integer males rub wings together create rapid trill produces males individually vary durations trilling sophisticatedly called bout length bout length male heritable passed future offspring also females prefer mate males longer bout end result males longer bout lengths produce offspring males shorter bout lengths factors influence formation bout lengths include temperature predation field crickets males prefer warmer sites mating shown increase frequency mating calls living warmer predation also affects mating calls field crickets potentially dangerous environment males cease calling longer periods time interrupted predator suggests interplay intensity mating call risk predation described sonation term sonate described deliberate production sounds throat rather structures bill wings tail feet body feathers use tools several amphibian fish species special structures used produce different sounds attract mates birds common users sonation although several amphibian fish species shown use sonation form mating call well general sonation one factor plays female may choose mate features mating territory defense mate defense contribute cause finding suitable mates outlined species uses distinct method produce nonvocal mating call order successful attracting mates examples represent common examples found literature although many examples may exist nature still currently unknown feathers beak feet different tools used different bird

throbbing palm cockatoos use sticks drum hollow trees creating loud noise attract attention bustards large highly terrestrial birds stamp feet mating displays attract mirafra apiata commonly known clapper lark engages complex display flight characterized rattling many species birds manakins hummingbirds use sonation mating calls however peacocks exhibit feature sonation reveals intrasexual intersexual properties type mating males move feathers produce lowfrequency sonation infrasound sonate frequently response sonation males attributable males desire advertise presence males looking mates suggesting sonation carries intrasexual function addition females show increased alertness hearing infrasound signals produced males wingshaking highlights two sexes use sonation interact bird species use feathers tools feet produce sounds attract mates many fish species use specialized internal organs sonate gadoid fish special muscles attached swimbladder assist production knocking grunting sounds attract many lepidoptera species including adzuki bean borer ostrinia scapulalis ultrasonic mating calls used attract females keep motionless copulation pulses average frequency differences mating calls lead separation different populations within species differences due several factors including body size temperature ecological factors arise form tonal temporal behavioral variations mating calls subsequently lead separation populations separation populations due differences mating call mating call preferences lead evolution creation new unique species type speciation often sympatric speciation two species created existing parent species live geographic location although absence research mammals birds phenomenon heavily researched several frog species around world examples illuminate speciation due mating call differences several frog species around world distinct species included focus majority current research two species narrowmouthed frog live southern
