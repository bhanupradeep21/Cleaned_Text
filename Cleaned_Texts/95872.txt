holland writes approach reductive claim rather thorough investigation biological facts useful mainly though allowing change focus away confusion place genealogy social ties onto reformulated baseline built around varied processual aspects social book reviews background key elements hamiltons inclusive fitness theory onwards setting significant conceptual heuristic value holland notes hamilton acknowledged earliest widely known account contained technical inaccuracies also notes hamiltons early speculations possible proximate mechanisms expression social behavior possible alternative contained errors nevertheless remained influential popular accounts specifically supergenes notion sometimes called greenbeard effect organisms may evolve genes able identify identical copies others preferentially direct social behaviours towards theoretically clarified withdrawn hamilton however intervening years notion supergenes often simply individual organisms evolved identify genetic relatives preferentially cooperate took hold became way many biologists came understand theory persisted despite hamiltons correction hollands view pervasiveness longstanding erroneous perspective

first wave attempts known human sociobiology darwinian anthropology apply inclusive fitness theory human social behavior relied reinforced misinterpretation section theorys predictions proximate

researchers holland also shows following perceived failures early wave particularly methodological agnosticism regarding proximate mechanisms social behavior evolutionary psychology school grew place although latter school typically avoided engaging ethnographic data human kinship holland argues cases repeated misinterpretation inclusive fitness theory characterized first wave holland also notes kitcher critique sociobiological position suggested perhaps expression social behaviors humans might quite simply based cues context familiarity rather genetic relatedness per se chapters four five investigate theory evidence surrounding proximate mechanisms social behavior specifically question whether social behaviors expressed organisms via behaviourevokingsituations via direct detection actual genetic relatedness related questions domain kin recognition theory holland notes name kin recognition suggests expectation positive identification genetic relatedness prediction inclusive
