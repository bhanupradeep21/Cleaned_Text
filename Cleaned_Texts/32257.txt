described three main variants related level anatomical common presentation condition characterized normal adult larynx increased pitch due vocal folds adopting falsetto position second variant occur laryngeal development prolonged puberty lastly puberphonia occur due incomplete transformation larynx adult determine whether patient presents puberphonia complete voice assessment including medical diagnostic evaluations recommended assessments performed otorhinolaryngologists speechlanguage puberphonia often diagnosed adolescent adult male patients often seek referral voice professional social
