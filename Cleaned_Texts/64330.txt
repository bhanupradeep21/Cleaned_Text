kohlschüttertönz syndrome kts also called amelocerebrohypohidrotic rare inherited syndrome characterized epilepsy psychomotor delay regression intellectual disability yellow teeth caused amelogenesis imperfecta abnormal formation tooth type ectodermal autosomal recessive symptoms appear early childhood syndrome first described alfried kohlschütter affected individuals known disease connected known epileptic cases associated mutations gene called another gene associated condition gene see citrate transporter diagnoses syndrome occurred switzerland sicily northern israel druze community well parts western symptoms seen consistently diagnosed cases epilepsy amelogenesis imperfecta primary secondary teeth developmental delay symptoms experienced experienced varying degrees across physical symptoms associated kts prominent symptom amelogenesis imperfecta gives teeth stained brownyellow color enamel thin rough prone crumbling two types amelogenesis imperfecta ai seen kts patients first hypoplastic caused enamel underdeveloped second hypocalcified causes enamel soft chalky ai originated heterogeneous syndrome observed homogeneous case physical symptoms cases presented include broad thumbs toes microcephaly coarse hair mildly asymmetric skull slanting palpebral fissures outside corners eyes higher normal smooth philtrum upper lip dip kts also presents symptoms affect patients ability function varying degrees patients either develop developed language skills well developed ambulance ability move around patients also present global developmental delay severity symptoms correlated intensity frequency age onset patients epilepsy well responsiveness treatment epileptic attacks severe cases patients develop spastic tetraplegia loss function four extreme variability symptoms well represented one family affected children first child vegetative state died age second child showed psychomotor developmental delay month old epilepsy unresponsive treatment months old child also nonverbal non ambulant third childs epilepsy responsive treatment ambulant intellectual disability slight verbal abilities fourth child demonstrated developmental delay age months epileptic attacks partially responsive treatment child non verbal awkwardly ambulant fifth child ambulant nonverbal epilepsy partially responsive treatment variation seen across cases kts symptoms kts including epilepsy amelogenesis imperfecta developemental delay overlap phenotype described den hoedde boervoisin syndrome autosomal dominant condition caused heterozygous missense variants pedigrees kts patients suggest autosomal recessive inheritance although several mutations rogdi gene linked cause kts connection enamel defect altered brain function patients yet rogdi gene located chromosome contains exons rogdi protein contains amino acids leucine zipper form function protein currently known expression studies shown gene high expression hippocampus also highly expressed parts adult brain spinal cord peripheral blood heart bone marrow studies showed low level expression fetal brain consistent onset symptoms occurring earlier one month birth protein staining provided evidence supporting rogdi protein may part nuclear envelope studies also suggest rogdi may interact involved neuronal proliferation migration differentiation cortical rogdi mutations include frameshift nonsense splice site mutations cause premature mrna degradation protein structure alteration results lack function one family frameshift mutation called duplication caused frameshift resulted premature stop codon rogdi gene amino mutation called deletion cytosine position resulted nonsense nonsense mutation point mutation results premature stop codon five affected families contained nonsense mutation called thymine place cytosine position exon three different splicesite mutations identified kts patients one known prevents recognition splice site intron results frameshift gene causing premature stop codon exon another known mutation destroys splice acceptor donor sites resulting inframe deletion protein resulting gene highly altered structure functional last known occurs intron also destroys splice donor acceptor sites due inclusion extra nucleotides exon mrna mutation causes nonsense mediated decay due fact affected families found mutation rogdi noted variability affected individuals possible syndrome contiguous gene syndrome contiguous gene syndrome occurs multiple genes affected alteration short chromosomal amelogenesis imperfecta known caused genetic mutations two examples chromosome open reading frame segregate autosomal recessive diagnosis occurs based two common features syndrome epilepsy symmetrical enamel hypoplasia also known amelogenesis imperfecta tooth discoloration caused amelogenesis imperfecta often thought caused environmental factors diseases diagnosis syndrome sometimes overlooked onset symptoms occur patient one month four years old contributing misconception tooth discoloration due consistent abnormalities brain imaging across cases yet discovered individual cases show altered brain activitycitation needed magnetic resonance imaging mri one family showed mild atrophy cranial vermis well small different types atrophy including cerebellar four individuals basal ganglia evident electroencephalography eeg one patient showed epileptiformic activities frontal frontotemporal areas well increased spike waves patient another patients eeg showed occipital rhythms background activity abnormal focal discharges temporal lobe multifocial epileptiform several patients showed loss normal background patients kts epilepsy resistant antiepileptic agents patients showed partial response treatment able stop epilepsy one case responsive treatment using phenobartbital vigabatrin antiepileptic spasticity treated baclofen patients responsive dr tönz brought infant fatal brain disease attention alfried kohlschütter infants symptoms
