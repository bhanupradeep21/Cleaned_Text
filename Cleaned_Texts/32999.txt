autonomic nervous system ans formerly referred vegetative nervous system division nervous system operates internal organs smooth muscle autonomic nervous system control system acts largely unconsciously regulates bodily functions heart rate force contraction digestion respiratory rate pupillary response urination sexual system primary mechanism control fightorflight response autonomic nervous system regulated integrated reflexes brainstem spinal cord organs autonomic functions include control respiration cardiac regulation cardiac control center vasomotor activity vasomotor center certain reflex actions coughing sneezing swallowing vomiting subdivided areas also linked autonomic subsystems peripheral nervous system hypothalamus brain stem acts integrator autonomic functions receiving autonomic regulatory input limbic although conflicting reports subdivisions exist literature autonomic nervous system historically considered purely motor system divided three branches sympathetic nervous system parasympathetic nervous system enteric nervous textbooks include enteric nervous system part sympathetic nervous system often considered fight flight system parasympathetic

neurotransmitter integral autonomic function particular gut although ans also known visceral nervous system although fibers carry nonsomatic information cns many authors still consider connected motor

analogy one may think sympathetic division accelerator parasympathetic division brake sympathetic division typically functions actions requiring quick responses parasympathetic division functions
