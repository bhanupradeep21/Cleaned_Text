duplicated researchers clinical trial therapy show efficacy treatment cancer american cancer society support livingstons treatment protocol cancer categorically denied theory cancer origins virginia livingston born virginia wuerthele meadville pennsylvania father grandfather physicians also pursued degree medicine prior attending medical school livingston earned three ba degrees english history economics vassar college attended new york university bellevue medical college received degree medicine one four women graduating shortly graduation livingston became first female resident physician new york hospital assigned treat prostitutes infected venereal diseases livingston became interested study tuberculosis leprosy later scleroderma disease affecting tissues skin studying scleroderma tissues darkfield microscope claimed find acidfast organism consistently appeared slides thinking scleroderma characteristics like cancer livingston began studying malignant tissues subsequently claimed find evidence acidfast organisms every sample early research prompted young physician devote career study specific microorganism involved cancer livingston published paper stated established bacterium causative agent cultured mycobacterialike organism human cancer according peerreviewed paper fulfilled kochs postulates establishing apparent cause livingston named chief rutgerspresbyterian hospital laboratory proliferative diseases new jersey continued cancer time livingston formed lifetime association dr eleanor alexanderjackson cornell university jacksons specialty study mycobacteria particularly species responsible tuberculosis jackson developed specific culture media growing microbe technique observing known triple stain felt microbe wasnt amenable conventional modes culturing microscopy livingston jackson also collaborated work rous sarcoma virus rsv lederle laboratories livingston claimed rsv cultures passed special filters designed hold back smallest virus particles able grow bacteria considered controversial claim since bacteria considerably larger viruses exist filtered rsv serum healthy animals exposed rous bacterial filtrates livingston jackson claimed cancerous lesions finding led speculation bacteria could transmitted poultry humans became primary reason livingston ordered cancer patients eat poultry underwent treatment scientists since rejected livingstons findings arguing evidence supporting livingston published paper suggesting causative bacterium wilsons reported isolation variably acidfast mycobacterium patients myocardial vascular disease time also began small test trial antibacterial vaccines made body fluids cancer patients reported moderate years livingston received fleet foundation kerr grants continued investigation bacterial cause human cancer also published paper describing presence substance identified actinomycind said could damage chromosomes promote livingston husband afton munk livingston established livingstonwheeler clinic san diego california began formally treating cancer patients therapeutic program included autogenous vaccine made killed bacteria derived body fluids low sodium diet consisting organic foods fruits vegetables high substance livingston called abscisic acid immune enhancing vaccines gamma globulin bcg antibiotics livingston prescribed antibiotics cross testing patients cultures see antibacterial activity livingston also recommended patients consume poultry products based earlier research husbands death married owen webster wheeler one first patients claims successfully treated head neck cancer shortly clinic renamed livingstonwheeler clinic livingston officially named cancer organism progenitor cryptocides presented findings new york academy according biography progenitor pseudonym meaning ancestral name chosen livingston believed microbe existed early precambrian era endogenous component life name cryptocides greek latin word meant hidden killer microbe classified order actinomycetales livingston described progenitor intermittently acidfast mycobacterium displayed highly variable growth cycles according livingston microbe pleomorphic cell walldeficient filterpassing forms resembling viruses ability adopt variety shapes including spindles rods livingston published paper described isolation human chorionic gonadotropin hcg cancer advanced one central hypotheses livingston theorized hcg component human cancer also innately involved embryonic growth fetal wrote hcg saturated placenta blocks mothers antibodies attacking fetus partly made foreign dna recognized host immunity token hcg performs similar function cancer conferring protection malignant tissues livingston believed progenitor hybridizes cancer cells imparts ability produce hcg manner similar developing fetus based duality function livingston called hcg hormone life hormone death also stipulated vaccines target hcgproducing bacteria could also halt progression cancer claimed abscisic acid could also neutralize hcg though bacteria associated instance h pylori associated stomach livingstons postulated relationship cancer p cryptocides never proven several follow studies conducted independent investigators researchers confirmed bacteria provided livingston produced hcg several studies demonstrated numerous bacteria cancer patients healthy individuals also produced substance occurring existence techniques analyze dna livingston investigators ability differentiate bacteria based morphology chemical characteristics limited however even given technological limitations time livingstons classification methods described full remarkable errors attributing characteristics actinomycetales order livingston believed p cryptocides belonged shared members order evidence supports p cryptocides result mistaken identification staphylococcus strain bacteria later studies samples provided livingston proved staphylococcus epidermidis streptococcus american cancer society acs support livingstons treatment protocol cancer categorically denied theory cancer bacterium p cryptocides primary cause human cancer acs also challenged efficacy livingstons autogenous vaccine concluded report corroboration either p cryptocides efficacy autologous since livingston hadnt stocked earlier cultures alleged microbe possible decipher precisely cultures containedcitation needed casecontrol study using selfselected matched randomized groups late stage cancer compared survival quality life cancer patients receiving conventional treatment undergoing livingstonwheeler therapy results reported new england journal medicine found differences survival among patients whether treated conventionally via livingstons treatment nejm report also stated comparing two groups quality life consistently better among conventionally treated patients enrollment based trial acs deemed livingstons cancer therapy without efficacy considered unproven groups patients trial deteriorated equal rates patients livingstontreated group reported poorer quality life start studys lead investigator barrie cassileth acknowledged university pennsylvania patients significantly better quality life times including enrollment quality life different base line livingstons patients rated patients treatment arms also received conventional therapies addition livingstons therapy livingstons patients also received bcg trialan fdaapproved cancer adjuvant found effective several cancers including bladder colon studys conclusion barrie cassileth commented studyinvolved patients diagnoses stages disease effective conventional treatment therefore results generalized patients less advanced stages disease treatment regimens cassileth also said study group hypothesized survival time would differ two groups basis assumption unproved remedy would effective endstage disease conventional care largely ineffective shortly speaking office technology assessment ota hearing alternative cancer
