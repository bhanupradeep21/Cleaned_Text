beginning ancient greeks long history overlapping ideas nineteenth century professionalization philosophy medicine came late twentieth century debates among philosophers physicians ensued whether philosophy medicine considered field either philosophy consensus since reached fact distinct discipline set separate problems questions recent years variety university conferences dedicated philosophy medicine epistemology branch philosophy medicine concerned common questions asked knowing knowledge know know know claim philosophers differentiate theories knowledge three groups knowledge

branch causes health causes disease growing interest metaphysics medicine particularly idea philosophers medicine might interested medical knowledge generated also nature phenomena causation interest purpose much medical research establish causal relationships eg causes disease causes people get scientific processes used generate causal knowledge give clues metaphysics causation example defining feature randomized controlled trials rcts thought establish causal relationships whereas observational studies instance causation considered something counterfactually dependent ie way rcts differ
