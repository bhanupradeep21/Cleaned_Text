epistasis phenomenon genetics effect gene mutation dependent presence absence mutations one genes respectively termed modifier genes words effect mutation dependent genetic background epistatic mutations therefore different effects occur together originally term epistasis specifically meant effect gene variant masked different concept epistasis originated genetics used biochemistry

used denote departure independence effects different genetic loci confusion often arises due varied interpretation independence among different branches classifications attempt cover various terms relate one another two mutations considered purely additive effect double mutation sum effects single mutations occurs genes interact example acting different metabolic pathways simply additive traits studied early history genetics however relatively rare genes exhibiting least level epistatic double mutation fitter phenotype expected effects two single mutations referred positive epistasis positive epistasis beneficial mutations generates greater improvements function positive epistasis deleterious mutations protects negative effects cause less severe fitness conversely two mutations together lead less fit phenotype expected effects alone called negative negative epistasis beneficial mutations causes smaller expected fitness improvements whereas negative epistasis deleterious mutations causes greaterthanadditive fitness independently effect fitness two mutations radical expected effects alone referred synergistic epistasis opposite situation fitness difference double mutant wild type smaller expected effects two single mutations called antagonistic therefore deleterious mutations negative epistasis also synergistic positive epistasis antagonistic conversely advantageous mutations positive epistasis synergistic negative epistasis antagonistic term genetic enhancement sometimes used double deleterious mutant severe phenotype additive effects single mutants strong positive epistasis sometimes referred creationists irreducible complexity although examples misidentified sign occurs one mutation opposite effect presence another mutation occurs mutation deleterious enhance effect particular beneficial example large complex brain waste energy without range sense organs sense organs made useful large complex brain better process information fitness

metabolism smaller effect negative epistasis sets mutations within genes also specifically found considered strict additivity exception rather rule since genes interact hundreds thousands epistasis within genomes organisms occurs due interactions genes within genome interaction may direct genes encode proteins example separate components multicomponent protein ribosome inhibit others activity protein encoded one gene modifies phosphorylation alternatively interaction may indirect genes encode components metabolic pathway network developmental pathway signalling pathway transcription factor network example gene encoding enzyme synthesizes penicillin use fungus without enzymes synthesize necessary precursors metabolic pathway mutations two separate genes nonadditive genes interact mutations two codons within gene nonadditive genetics sometimes called intragenic suppression one deleterious mutation compensated second mutation within gene analysis bacteriophage mutants altered riib cistron gene revealed certain pairwise combinations mutations could mutually suppress double mutants nearly wildtype phenotype either mutant linear map order mutants established using genetic recombination data sources information triplet nature genetic code logically deduced first time key features code also also intragenic suppression occur amino acids within protein interact due complexity protein folding activity additive mutations rare proteins held tertiary structure distributed internal network cooperative interactions hydrophobic polar epistatic interactions occur whenever one mutation alters local environment another residue either directly contacting inducing changes protein example disulphide bridge single cysteine effect protein stability second present correct location point two cysteines form chemical bond enhances stability would observed positive epistasis doublecysteine variant much higher stability either singlecysteine variants conversely deleterious mutations introduced proteins often exhibit mutational robustness whereby stabilising interactions destroyed protein still functions reaches stability threshold point destabilising mutations large detrimental effects protein longer fold leads negative epistasis whereby mutations little effect alone large deleterious effect enzymes protein structure orients key amino acids precise geometries form active site perform since active site networks frequently require cooperation multiple components mutating one components massively compromises activity mutating second component relatively minor effect already inactivated enzyme example removing member catalytic triad many enzymes reduce activity levels low enough organism longer diploid organisms contain two copies gene different heterozygous heteroallelic two different copies allele may interact cause epistasis sometimes called allelic complementation interallelic complementation may caused several mechanisms example transvection enhancer one allele acts trans activate transcription promoter second allele alternately transsplicing two nonfunctional rna molecules may produce single functional rna similarly protein level proteins function dimers may form heterodimer composed one protein alternate gene may display different properties homodimer one variants two bacteriophage mutants defective different locations gene undergo allelic complementation mixed mutant alone upon infection produce viable progeny upon mixed infection two complementing mutants viable phage formed intragenic complementation
