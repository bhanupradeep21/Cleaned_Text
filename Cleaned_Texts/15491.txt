paradox psychology counterintuitive approach primarily geared toward addressing treatment resistance method paradoxical interventions pdxi focused rapid effective motivational interviewing addressing resistance method seeks influence clients underlying attitude perception providing laser beam attention strengthening attachmentalliance counterintuitive traditional methods since change usually directed toward various aspects behavior emotions thinking turns better therapy able strengthen alliance aspects behavior change however within pdxi process idea changing behavior secondary main focus alliance surprising fashion seemingly minor shift actually results day night difference treatment conducted advantage focusing attachmentalliance done correctly client block defend intervention basically resistance becomes nonexistent resistant client often well defended guarded around attempts alter behavior unable block therapist strengthening alliance allows clinician avoid power struggles around behavior developing stronger clienttherapist bold natural unconscious shift toward relaxation result allows client let go rigid patterns manner best described spontaneous unlikely may initially sound pdxi approach specifically addresses treatment difficult resistant client scientific understanding supports process spontaneous change unifies behavioral cognitive psychodynamic orientations single umbrella theory sciencebased model showing treating secondary less problematic behaviors ie anger low selfesteem poor social skills etc impact primary targeted volatile criminal type behaviors ie violence problematic sexual behaviours firesetting etc addition paradox psychology helps explain process paradoxical interventions approach represents logical extension attachment theory described john bowlby ainsworth many treatment theories address separate aspects behavior emotions thinking approach focuses obvious fact human existence paradox paradox evidenced fact live animal body walk upright mind clouds dna programmed function via instinct yet prefer assert freewill smart enough know better quite often repeat past mistakes could argued study man paradox closely aligned human essence paradoxical method documented adler early counterintuitive style always difficult explain adler described method spitting patients soup meaning method ability impact behavior without convincing rewarding patient change many master therapists incorporated method great success include milton erickson viktor frankl jay haley salvador minuchin fritz perls others method proved consistent ability described many amazing results clients presented wide range disruptive behavioral issues unbiased research indicates behavioral cognitive psychodynamic methods show success rates statistically equal working motivated paradoxical interventions shown highest success rate oppositional treatmentresistant psychological research research psychologists perform investigate analyze experiences behaviors individuals groups systematic way findings could used educational occupational clinical settings research helps us understand causes people think feel act certain ways allows us categorize psychological disorders better understand symptoms impact individuals society allows us better understand intimate relationships development schools family peers religion play role even though method documented successful working treatmentresistance paradoxical interventions lost favor late due fact psychology field desired present science oriented pushed evidence based approaches since underlying theory mechanism paradoxical approach remained unsolved mystery way promote method concise logical manner however recently eliot p kaplan phd able provide simple scientific framework provides grounded understanding seemingly complicated approach work treating adolescents problem sexual behaviors psb able show basic orbitsgravity model allows us unravel puzzling nature approach model identifies process repetitive energy behavior orbits strength attachment force gravity gauged therapeutic alliance model incorporates scientific construct identify active ingredient allows method consistently effective disarming bypassing treatment resistance exciting aspect approach humor absurd quality counterintuitive interventions often unexpected humor breaksthrough clients usual attempts keep clinician distance defend treatment better known interventions include prescribing symptom predicting behavior outcomes exaggerating symptomatic behavior symptom planning scheduling etc lack knowledge depth paradoxical interventions tended dismiss approach simply reverse psychology paradoxical intervention reverse psychology may seem similar surface underlying intent direction different reverse psychology clinician hopes manipulate client follow planned preset agenda tells client go left plan client resist directive go right however pure paradoxical intervention seeks strengthen alliance without ulterior motive done understanding shifting gravityattachment client spontaneously make changes desire freewill clinician expresses unconditional positive regard acknowledges clients habitual pattern go left truly accepts client likely pattern near future however paradoxically clients behavior predicted future outcome accepted client position make freewill choice undo forecasted behavior difference paradoxical interventions support clients ability take responsibility actions reverse psychology focuses ability clinician trick client subtle important difference advantage method ability approach client nonconfrontational nonthreatening manner way forces treatmentresistant client take responsibility habitual reactions patterns reverse psychology also known strategic selfanticonformity strategy entails promoting behavior differs desired objective used control another persons conduct also used manipulate paradoxical interventions used directly target dangerous criminogenic behaviors situations clinicians need use strategic interventions target secondary noncriminogenic behaviors result impact primary targeted volatile behavior reverse psychology persuasion strategy involves asserting view conduct diametrically opposed one intended hope approach motivate persuasion subject perform genuinely desired
