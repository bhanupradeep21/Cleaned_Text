many skin conditions affect human integumentary organ system covering entire surface body composed skin hair nails related muscle major function system barrier external skin weighs average four kilograms covers area two square metres made three distinct layers epidermis dermis subcutaneous two main types human skin glabrous skin hairless skin palms soles also referred palmoplantar surfaces hairbearing within latter type hairs occur structures called pilosebaceous units hair follicle sebaceous gland associated arrector pili embryo epidermis hair glands form ectoderm chemically influenced underlying mesoderm forms dermis subcutaneous epidermis superficial layer skin squamous epithelium several strata stratum corneum stratum lucidum stratum granulosum stratum spinosum stratum nourishment provided layers diffusion dermis since epidermis without direct blood supply epidermis contains four cell types keratinocytes melanocytes langerhans cells merkel cells keratinocytes major component constituting roughly percent stratified squamous epithelium maintained cell division within stratum basale differentiating cells slowly displace outwards stratum spinosum stratum corneum cells continually shed normal skin rate production equals rate loss two weeks needed cell migrate basal cell layer top granular cell layer additional two weeks cross stratum dermis layer skin epidermis subcutaneous tissue comprises two sections papillary dermis reticular superficial papillary dermis interdigitates overlying rete ridges epidermis two layers interact basement membrane structural components dermis collagen elastic fibers ground within components pilosebaceous units arrector pili muscles eccrine apocrine dermis contains two vascular networks run parallel skin superficial one deep connected vertical communicating function blood vessels within dermis fourfold supply nutrition regulate temperature modulate inflammation participate wound subcutaneous tissue layer fat dermis underlying tissue may divided two components actual fatty layer panniculus adiposus deeper vestigial layer muscle panniculus main cellular component tissue adipocyte fat structure tissue composed septal ie linear strands lobular compartments differ microscopic functionally subcutaneous fat insulates body absorbs trauma serves reserve energy conditions human integumentary system
