londonborn kenyan paleoanthropologist meave leakey archaeologist alan walker excavated allia bay site uncovered several additional fragments hominid including one complete lower jaw bone closely resembles common chimpanzee pan troglodytes whose teeth bear greater resemblance human based limited postcranial evidence available anamensis appears habitually bipedal although retained primitive features upper meave leakey associates taking note differences australopithecus afarensis new finds assigned new species anamensis deriving name turkana word anam meaning although excavation team find hips feet legs meave leakey believes australopithecus anamensis often climbed trees tree climbing one behavior retained early hominins appearance first homo species million years ago anamensis shares many traits australopithecus afarensis may well direct predecessor fossil records anamensis dated million years findings stratigraphic sequences dating million years specimens found two layers

dietary isotope evidence turkana basin hominin species comes australopithecus anamensis evidence suggests diet consisted primarily resources possibly however small amount derived resources within next
