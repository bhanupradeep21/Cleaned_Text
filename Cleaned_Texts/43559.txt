selfregulated according alosferrer strack dualprocess theory relevance economic decisionmaking multipleselves model one persons selfconcept composed multiple selves depending context example someone student hard working intelligent sibling caring supportive decisionmaking involves use automatic controlled processes also depends person situation given persons experiences current situation decision process may differ given two decision processes differing goals one likely useful particular situations example person presented decision involving selfish rational motive social motive depending individual one motives appealing depending situation preference one motive may change using dualprocess theory important consider whether one motive automatic particular case automaticity would depend individual experiences selfish person may choose selfish motive automaticity nonselfish person yet controlled process may still outweigh based external factors situation monetary gains societal pressure although likely stable preference motive one select based individual important remember external factors influence decision dual process theory also provides different source behavioral heterogeneity economics mostly assumed within economics heterogeneity comes differences taste rationality dual process theory indicates necessary considerations processes automated different processes may interact within decision moral judgments said explained part dual process theory moral dilemmas presented us two morally unpalatable options example sacrifice one life order save many lives let many lives lost consider historical example authorize use force nations order prevent future acts international take pacifist approach foreign lives risk possibility terrorist attack dual process theorists argued sacrificing something moral value order prevent worse outcome often called utilitarian option involves reflective reasoning pacifist also known deontological however evidence suggests
