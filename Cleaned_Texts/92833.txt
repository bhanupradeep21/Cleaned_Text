hemolytic jaundice also known prehepatic jaundice type jaundice arising hemolysis excessive destruction red blood cells byproduct bilirubin excreted hepatic cells quickly unless patient concurrently affected hepatic dysfunctions experiencing hepatocellular damage liver contribute type one three categories jaundice obvious sign hemolytic jaundice discolouration yellowing sclera skin patient additional symptoms may observed depending underlying causes hemolysis hemolytic causes associated bilirubin overproduction diverse include disorders sickle cell hereditary thrombotic thrombocytopenic autoimmune hemolytic hemolysis secondary drug thalassemia congenital dyserythropoietic pathophysiology hemolytic jaundice directly involves metabolism bilirubin overproduction bilirubin due hemolysis exceeds livers ability conjugate bilirubin glucuronic diagnosis hemolytic jaundice based mainly visual assessment yellowing patients skin sclera cause hemolysis must determined using laboratory treatment condition specific cause hemolysis intense phototherapy exchange transfusion used help patient excrete accumulated complications related hemolytic jaundice include hyperbilirubinemia chronic bilirubin encephalopathy may deadly without proper signs symptoms additional development yellowish colour sclera skin specific causes hemolysis example patient hemolytic jaundice resulting sickle cell disease vasoocclusive phenomena like acute vasoocclusive pain acute chest syndrome may observed acute phases anemia neurologic deficits various pulmonary conditions may manifest chronic regardless causes laboratoryconfirmed elevation predominantly seen unconjugated serum bilirubin concentration rarely exceeds mgdl unless patient concurrent liver underlying causes hemolytic jaundice name suggests disorders associated hemolysis disorders manifold common causes include less commonly observed causes hemolysis include list exhaustive rare causes hemolysis bartonella hemolysis due transfusion microangiopathic hemolytic suspected symptoms specific causes manifest mechanisms bilirubin overproduced hemolytic jaundice understood relation two major sites hemolysis intravascular extravascular intravascular hemolysis red blood cells broken within vasculature allowing hemoglobin ruptured red blood cells form haptoglobinhemoglobin complexes haptoglobin internalized degraded hepatocytes degree hemolysis abnormally high unbound hemoglobin converted methemoglobin heme moiety bound hemopexin albumin hemehemopexin hemebound albumin internalized hepatocytes subsequently degraded extravascular hemolysis red blood cells destroyed phagocytosis macrophages reticuloendothelial system digested hemoglobin within red blood cells degraded release heme converted microsomal heme oxygenase iron carbon monoxide biliverdin immediately reduced unconjugated bilirubin biliverdin reductase released settings hemolysis mentioned low levels conjugated bilirubin may accumulate serum amount falling within normal limits percent total bilirubin conjugated bilirubin efficiently excreted bile secreted across canalicular increased levels conjugated bilirubin observed coexisting hepatobiliary abnormalities canalicular excretion capacity exceeded conjugated bilirubin accumulate unconjugated bilirubin high affinity albumin high level efficiently cleared glomerular filtration binds elastic tissue skin sclera high albumin content explains yellow discolouration observed tissues hemolytic jaundice symptoms jaundice observed superficially thus visual methods used identify

neurodevelopmental complications may follow condition eventually leading hearing loss visual impairment severe cases hyperbilirubinemia may observed hemolysis produces much bilirubin excessive

kernicterus braindamaging complication associated preterm full term infants jaundice large amounts unconjugated bilirubin infants become kernicterus affects mainly basal ganglia effects spread
