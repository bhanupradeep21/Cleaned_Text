competing sedative receptors displacing mainly used veterinary medicine licensed dogs intramuscular use used intravenously well cats animalsintravenous use cats dogs recommended due potential cardiovascular collapse occurs due profound hypotension caused reversal alpha effects reflex bradycardia still effect low rate side effects largely due atipamezoles high specificity receptor atipamezole quick onset usually waking animal within minutes originally released sold us atipamezole veterinary drug whose prime purpose reverse effects sedative dexmedetomidine well racemic mixture medetomidinenote also used reverse related sedative reverses sedative analgesic painrelieving effects dexmedetomidine atipamezole may entirely reverse cardiovascular depression dexmedetomidine atipamezole licensed united states intramuscular injection im dogs however used offlabel cats farm animals horses well zoo medicine reptiles including tortoises turtles alligators armadillos hippopotamuses giraffes okapi given intravenously iv subcutaneously intraperitoneally redeared sliders iv administration recommended atipamezole also used antidote various toxicities dogs example antitick medication amitraz commonly ingested dogs eat antitick amitraz works mechanism dexmedetomidine thus easily reversed atipamezole also reverses hypotension caused tizanidine muscle relaxant

absolute contraindications atipamezole recommended given anticholinergics cause dramatic increases heart atipamezole also given soon animal given dexmedetomidine mixed ketamine telazoltiletamine reverses dexmedetomidine ketamine telazol still active animal wake excited delirious muscle recommend using dogs sedated ketamine since convulse due excitement atipamezoles low rate side effects due high specificity receptors little affinity receptors affinity serotonin muscarinic dopamine occasional vomiting hypersalivation diarrhea potentially cause cns excitement lead tremors tachycardia increased heart rate vasodilation vasodilation leads transient decrease blood pressure dogs increases normal within reports transient chance side effect minimized administering atipamezole possibility sedation reversing abruptly leading nervous aggressive delirious cases associated iv faster onset im administration rapid administration atipamezole leads sudden displacement dexmedetomidine peripheral receptors cause sudden drop blood pressure followed reflex tachycardia cases iv administration atipamezole lead death via cardiovascular collapse thought combination sudden hypotension added onto low heart rate caused possibility animal relapsing sedation given atipamezole made likely original sedative given rats monkeys experienced increased sexual activity given atipamezole rats mgkg given subcutaneously minimum lethal dose dogs dogs tolerated getting ten times standard signs overdose include panting trembling vomiting diarrhea well increased blood levels creatinine kinase aspartate transaminase alanine transaminase dogs received atipamezole without first receiving dexmedetomidine shown clinical signs mild muscle atipamezole competitive antagonist receptors competes dexmedetomidine receptors agonist directly interact rather structural similarity allows atipamezole easily compete receptor binding atipamezole reverses analgesia blocking norepinephrine feedback inhibition ki higher affinity receptor three commonly used veterinary medicine atipamezole yohimbine tolazine atipamezole shows highest preference binding ratio shows preference particular atipamezole rapid onset reverses decreased heart rate caused sedation within three minutes animal usually begins waking within minutes study dogs half could stand within minutes could stand within atipamezole reaches maximum serum concentration within minutes im atipamezole distributed extensively tissues particular time concentrations brain reach two three times concentration atipamezole undergoes heavy firstpass metabolism includes glucuronidation nitrogen metabolites mostly excreted elimination halflife hours dogs hours atipamezoles effects cognitive function studied rats humans low doses rats improved alertness selective attention learning recall higher doses generally impaired cognitive function likely due norepinephrine rats also shown improve cognitive function decreased strokes brain studies humans found increase focus decrease multitasking atipamezole also researched humans potential atipamezole increases sexual activity monkeys claims potential treat erectile
